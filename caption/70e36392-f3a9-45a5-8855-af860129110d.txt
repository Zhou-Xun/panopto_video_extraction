00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,650
Full Transcript break. Oh, really?

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:19,210
Thank you so much. It's good to see you.

3
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:30,280
I was nice.

4
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:38,320
Well, that's okay. I mean, now we have a murder that is not the most embarrassing from one of your guys.

5
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,840
Okay. So I just made a couple announcements on campus.

6
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:50,650
I'm not sure if you guys have received that. You know, announcements probably this morning.

7
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:55,330
So about office hours. So we have finalized our the room for office hours.

8
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:06,370
It's 11. You have a 48 states, too, so all of the rest will be out over there.

9
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:15,820
So, yes, this post is great and out of everybody knows we're going to save room for all the office hours.

10
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:27,610
And also so we are we're starting our this week and the Friday office hours for Dr. John's office.

11
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:31,570
Our city has an hour on Friday. That's on Zoom.

12
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,880
So in the announcement, I provided them Zoom link. So feel free to.

13
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:44,080
I mean we share the hallways are just like sensitivities so the two of us and also the GSA as we all share our salaries.

14
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,180
So feel free to go to any office hours that works for you.

15
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,230
And then another announcement is for today's office hours.

16
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:57,010
So I am supposed to hold office our today for 4 to 5.

17
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:03,460
Right. But because there is department seminars. So I will point out to our 430 to 530.

18
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:09,640
And so in my office that's M 4531.

19
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,220
Okay. So before we get started, any questions from last lecture?

20
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:39,180
Okay. So if not, then we will continue. But before that, let me just give a very another very quick summary of the concept of so-called statistics.

21
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:45,760
So statistically and there are two I guess there are two level two levels of understanding of statistics.

22
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:54,760
So the simplest one is that while statistic any statistic is just a function of the data.

23
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:03,220
So if you go back to this slide over here.

24
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,490
So if you give me any function of data, you clamp data.

25
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:16,530
So you see here the.

26
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:26,570
So we've got data and we use the capital letter to denote to the, you know, the run, the variables.

27
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:34,399
So we have these run the variables from in individuals, which in a statistic is an arbitrary function.

28
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,110
Any function of this X. Of course. I mean, what is it?

29
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,489
Any function? We do not need to worry too much about that for this course.

30
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:54,740
But while they have to be memorable. But but anyway, so and for our purposes and any function you specify and if you construct based on this exercise,

31
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:02,090
they are they can be called a statistic. So that's one level of understanding what a statistic is.

32
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,450
So another level is take one step further.

33
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:15,140
That is, well, once you have a statistic, then you can partition.

34
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:20,330
Like we actually have a lot about this example, right?

35
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,729
So once you have a statistic, then you can based on the different value,

36
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:30,740
defined value of that statistic, you can partition assemble space into different regions.

37
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:40,280
This is a very good illustration, very good example. So we have three little variables, random variables, and each one takes zero one value.

38
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,140
Now in combination we have well, in total we have eight combinations.

39
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,680
So we are the words, the symbol space has eight different values.

40
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:57,200
So we can consider how there may be one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight values.

41
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,070
So this is the the sample of the sample space.

42
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:07,400
Now, if you construct a statistic again scenario, it's just an arbitrary function of the X.

43
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:17,800
So for example, then X one alone is a statistic, x one plus and two is also a statistic x three alone block or divided by two.

44
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:24,950
This is another statistic are all of these are different statistics because they are functions of the X one, x two and three.

45
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:31,730
So these are statistics. Now, even if you give me a statistic and based on the different values,

46
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:37,040
distinctive values of the statistic, then I'm able to partition the sample space into different regions.

47
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:45,050
Just like here. For this statistic, it only takes 44 amounts zero one, two, one,

48
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:52,910
two and a three are based on this 44 values that I'm able to partition and assemble space into.

49
00:05:53,780 --> 00:06:04,469
21380818283.

50
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:12,530
Right. So I'm able to partition the sample space into different regions so that the samples from the same region,

51
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:19,490
they used to the same value on the statistic. So that's another level of understanding of studies.

52
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,110
So in this course, we actually try to, at least at the beginning,

53
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:31,400
we try to emphasize a bit on the partition, the simple space, this interpretation of statistics.

54
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:39,500
This is because well, first of all, this is very helpful for more advanced level purposes.

55
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:50,450
And also in some proofs later, we will see that in some proofs we have to rely on this idea in order to improve some results.

56
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,470
Okay. And then we actually looked at some examples.

57
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:02,580
We talked about how we talk about law, we talk about definition, observational studies, do you know?

58
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:08,980
So we talk about a theorem as well as how to check, how to how to prove that us that is,

59
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:16,360
is just we just need to check that with the ratio of this to is a constant, constant function theta.

60
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:22,130
So that's what we have done in our last lecture. So now and also some examples.

61
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,040
Now let's take a look at let's continue from here.

62
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:37,770
So so far, we have two tools to tell whether there is surveillance that is or not.

63
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:47,790
One is the definition of definition itself. And one is the theorem looking at the ratio of the two quantities to see if it is a constant affair.

64
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:54,870
But neither is is like super friendly to use any practice.

65
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,550
So now we are going to take a look at a more general result.

66
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:06,750
And this is very easy to apply and it can actually, while later on will cover quite a few examples showing how to apply this.

67
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:12,720
Here to show that some statistics there are sufficient statistics or how to find a statistic.

68
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,160
If you give me a description. Okay.

69
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:20,400
So this theory is called the Factorization Theorem.

70
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:34,250
Let's take a look at what it is. So suppose you have a assembled x here while we use bowtie to act to it's x1x to eccentricity matter.

71
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:44,530
Now if x this is the joint PDF or PMF, whether you had discrete or continuous remarkably.

72
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:56,700
So those are we have the draw in the PDF and then a statistic is sufficient for theta for this and the theta here even only.

73
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,540
So this theorem is if and only if zero.

74
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:11,579
Even only if you can find a function that depends on theta know another function that is completely

75
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:19,530
independent of theta such that you are able to fact rise the drawing pdf in the following way.

76
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:27,900
So you are able to write it as a function of the statistic that you are sorry where you constructed.

77
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,070
And this is actually a function of theta as well.

78
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:39,750
This this is a function of theta as well, multiplied by another part that is totally independent of theta has nothing to do with that.

79
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:54,720
So if we are able to fact rise just drawing a pdf in this particular wave then from t of x given here, this is a sufficient statistic.

80
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:00,719
So this is very easy to use because once you climb data and a usually we assume

81
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,050
all the data for normalization of data follow explanation of this decision.

82
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,780
So once we make a certain assumption now the PDF,

83
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:13,830
we know what the PDF is and it was we know the PDF so we can take a look whether we are able to fact rise the app,

84
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,800
you know, such a particular way and that we are able to identify the corresponding T of x.

85
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:30,710
So that's our sufficient statistics. So again, this is just some notes.

86
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:40,110
So f x now in our to be in order to find this statistic now f should be factorization into G

87
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:49,530
and H and g is a function of the statistic construction and it can also be a function theta.

88
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:54,639
However, h can only be a function of x has nothing to do with.

89
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,660
There must be a constant to zero.

90
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,800
So now let's take a look at the proof of this result.

91
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:12,450
Again, we focus on the discrete disputed case, the cardinal's case.

92
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:18,990
The proof of the idea of the proof is almost exactly the same, but it's just a slightly more complex.

93
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,290
So now, because this is an event only if zero result we have to prove both attraction.

94
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:35,550
I got I got for some reason implies you know if we have if he's a vision then we can fact rise that his vision not that you go away and

95
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:44,520
suddenly we are able to figure out the draw the PDF in that particular wave and that he is a vision we have to prove both attraction.

96
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:56,310
Now let's take a look at these one by one. So first, let's focus on the ball, assuming that no key of X it is a sufficient statistic.

97
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:03,510
Now let's try to show that we can fact rise the pdf, the PDF in this particular way.

98
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:14,220
Let's go over the proof. So now this is going to be the app because we are considering different run of variables.

99
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:22,920
So the PDF is actually a giant problem that if it's it's just the probability that chemical x equal to the small x,

100
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,910
that's essentially what it is what this small ab is.

101
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:37,350
When we have discrete for the variables and of them for this probability, we are going to write it in the following way.

102
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:47,330
If you look at this probability here, well, I mean, you can call this event a right.

103
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,660
You can call this event B, and this is event A.

104
00:12:53,040 --> 00:13:01,020
So here we use the fact that if a event A implies event a, B.

105
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:10,550
Then the probability that A drawn B is just equal to the probability of.

106
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:22,570
Right. So Arianna, was this is actually I mean, apart from six or one or another way to look at this is okay.

107
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:35,110
So one was even a occurs was even a occurs that event be must occur because if capital X is equal to small acts.

108
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:41,050
Now, of course, this function of capital X must be equal to this function of small x.

109
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,640
And so that means event in was event occurs that B must occur.

110
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:53,530
So that's why the probability that A and a B simultaneous would occur, that's the same as the probability that the event occurs.

111
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,490
That's why we have this equality here. Right.

112
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:03,190
And. Okay. But this probably to here.

113
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,450
This is sort of the probability of a droit de.

114
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,330
Right. And then we can write it as a conditional.

115
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:21,300
Probably the product of this is probably G of event B, and this is the probability that an event, a given event, a, B, conditional event be.

116
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:29,410
This is from the fact that this this equality that's from here and this equality that's from

117
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:44,010
the event b is equal to it can be rewritten as event sorry to be written as B claims a view.

118
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:49,120
And B, again, this is from 66 or one, right?

119
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,350
So you just made as in the form of conditional probability.

120
00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:01,150
And then because we we are given we know that a T of X is sufficient, a statistic.

121
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:10,150
So by the definition of sufficient statistic, we would call the definition that the definition says that while if t sufficient,

122
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:18,130
then given t conditional t the dispute of x, the original data should not depend on theta anymore.

123
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,760
And that's just how we define sufficient certainty.

124
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:30,820
And that's that's based on the intuition that if you have a self interest, then the original data should contain any information about theta anymore.

125
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,020
So, so then it's a matter of is,

126
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:40,380
is that a given this division of statistics the original data should the discussion should be totally independent of the.

127
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:46,400
So now from here to here, that's just based on our definition.

128
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:56,890
Oh, so this is so that's like in the longer it depends, I'll say that we drop this theta in the latter dependent theta and this part we just give it.

129
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:09,220
And now if we look at this two parts, the first part is a function of g of x that may depend on theta.

130
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:15,580
And so if we choose to be that just the first part, this is not D function.

131
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:27,490
This is the probability that the statistic t is equal to small t and a certain part has nothing to do with theta.

132
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:34,780
Not our depends on theta is completely divided up. So it's only a function that a function of x alone.

133
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:47,350
So in other words, now we have characterized the draw a pdf into two parts where the first part well, is this vanishing the second part.

134
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:54,000
So this completes while this shows distraction, right?

135
00:16:54,010 --> 00:17:02,960
So if we have some visions, the reality that we have this factorization and the other direction.

136
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:06,610
Now, if we have this factorization, let's see why.

137
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:14,680
I mean, the key is some vision, a statistic. So now suppose or assume that we have this factorization.

138
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,330
Now the drawing a PDF can be factoring in this way.

139
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,820
Now we want to show that he's a sufficient statistic.

140
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,420
Now we rely on the previous theorem we covered.

141
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:33,250
That is, we try to show that this ratio is a constant function.

142
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:42,490
And that's not the only result that we have so far shows us that is a sufficient that is to show that this ratio is a constant.

143
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:50,740
Now, let's try to see how to show this is constant. Of course, the denominator numerator, we know what it is.

144
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:56,020
We are given this this pdf and we know that it can be found for us in this way.

145
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:01,090
So in order to calculate this ratio, we need to find what the denominator is.

146
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,190
That is two. So now let's try to find what a Q is.

147
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,920
So Q recall that. Q is that the PMF of.

148
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:18,629
T of X go back to that theorem of numbers.

149
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,770
So that's just a very clever memory.

150
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:28,250
US. Music is out.

151
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:37,480
So this result over here. So this is drawing a PDF.

152
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,940
There's a drawing a, b, the other x and this is the pdf of T.

153
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,150
Now if this is a constant, then he is. So he has.

154
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:50,950
So we need to find the the PDF or the pmt for for that.

155
00:18:51,260 --> 00:19:04,720
So those d that we are looking at. So now suppose this is what we use this to denote to the pdf of this statistic.

156
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:15,040
Now you find out what it is. Q Okay, so because we are considering discrete variables, so this.

157
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:23,200
Q is actually the probability of because it is the PM of this team, a capital team.

158
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,100
So is the probability that a capital T is equal to a small team?

159
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:31,090
This is the definition of PM for a run an team.

160
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:45,470
Because t is a function of x and we know that x the PM for for x is given by this development for a function of x from six or two.

161
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:49,030
You must have learned this result. There is a transformation of the random variables.

162
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:58,000
X. X. So if you are a transformation, then there is a formula to find the amount for the transformation for the function of X.

163
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:03,130
In this case, it is very simple because we have a discrete variable, so it's just a sum.

164
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:10,600
So the probability that he is able to slotted into the sum of the PMF for x

165
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:20,620
sum over the values of y such that such that the t of y is equal to small t,

166
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:28,120
so that in a small space you'll find all the y values that gives you the small p value.

167
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:41,080
Right? Looked at the key the t of equal to KLT and that's if you sum all these piano f4x together, that's the F for this function of x.

168
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,140
Again, this is just a from six or to.

169
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:58,320
This is based on the you know, this is a transformation where this is a function of the rather variable x whose pdf it's given that is given.

170
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:12,720
So it's discrete. So it's just a song, you know, was we found this, now we are able to calculate this Rachel this Rachel and this region.

171
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:19,920
Now let's plug this everything in so that the top here, this this guy, that is what we are able to figure out.

172
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,670
We are we assume that we have this factorization.

173
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:32,250
And then the denominator here, please. Well, we just keep this guy and then.

174
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,879
Well, from the previous from a previous line,

175
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:48,720
we know that we can write it as the sum of the PMF for X over all the small Y values such that the

176
00:21:48,720 --> 00:22:03,540
function T and those values are equal to or equal to this statistic are equal to this statistic equals x.

177
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,230
And then. Okay. And then.

178
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:33,480
And then because again, because we have assumed that this f can be fact raised in this particular way and so that we just rewrite this as this.

179
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:43,810
And that's the product of this. This is this is nothing but because of the assumption that we are able to do this in a way.

180
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,889
And after we got here after we got here,

181
00:22:49,890 --> 00:23:05,879
then we realized that now this is the sun over all the small white values in a small space where the t but t of y is equal to yield.

182
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,080
X that's that's what y about over what y values.

183
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,170
We are taking the sun. Now all the t of y is equal to job x.

184
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:25,400
So that means well, for all these different y values, this t of y is equal duty of x because that's actually equal which region.

185
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,910
So in other words, for all these different y values, this t a y is just till next.

186
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:38,290
And so this is actually does not depend on Y anymore.

187
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:41,490
So that's why here we can move it out of the summation,

188
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:47,520
so we can move this out of the foundations because it's just constant for different flat balance.

189
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:59,790
And also the T of Y is actually equal to the key of X because that's that's over which region they are taking some.

190
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:13,110
So after we got it here, then realized now that we can cancel this guy, this guy.

191
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,630
So what is left is just this.

192
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:30,930
And this is completely independent of them, has nothing to do with this function.

193
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,190
So in the end, we showed that this ratio now is equal to this.

194
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:53,900
What is it about Oliveira that's not even Oliveira? So by theorem 6.2 12p must be a sufficient statistic for theta.

195
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,530
Okay. So any questions about the proof?

196
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:13,980
So depending on what I know about here, especially for this direction, I mean that the argument is not new.

197
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:19,340
Probably it does involve a little bit of sex or true knowledge.

198
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,120
Oh, sorry. It takes a lot knowledge, especially because we are dealing with a discrete rounding error in Mosul.

199
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:31,150
So the probability is just equal to some an event. Basically, you should be familiar with this information.

200
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:37,720
What this means in our digital assemble space in order to understand this proof.

201
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:46,239
Yeah. So it does involve a little bit about the idea of partitioning a small space.

202
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,660
So that's why from the beginning, which one?

203
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:58,360
We try to emphasize this interpretation of the statistic a little bit because because it can help us understanding how to understand in the proof.

204
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:08,090
But any questions about this proof? Okay.

205
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:19,390
So then if we look at now again, if if you have questions, feel free to ask me after an actor or if you're spending, you know,

206
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:28,010
maybe another ten or 15 minutes trying to go over the proof, hopefully you can have a better understanding of logic behind the.

207
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:33,320
Now if we look at the result itself.

208
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:42,680
So. Well, the reason, he says, is that he's not he is a civilian statistic for theta.

209
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,480
Even only if we are able to fact rise F in this particular way.

210
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:55,460
And this is a very nice result in the sense that, again, in the sense that it is easy to apply or relatively easy to find.

211
00:26:56,030 --> 00:27:01,650
So as long as you you give me the PDF, you give me that this fusion pdf.

212
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:10,070
Then I am able to fact rise. Then I will be able to see whether I can fact rise the pdf in this particular way.

213
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:15,470
And if I can, then this t is actually a sufficient statistic for theta.

214
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:18,920
If I cannot, then not.

215
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:25,550
So if you give me a t of ads, if I cannot factor as the pdf in this way, then he is not so bad.

216
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:34,220
Steve INSKEEP. Okay, so now let's take a look at some examples.

217
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:50,090
So first we're going to give is is absolutely example to recall that here you know X one and these are ideas I balloons.

218
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:07,730
We prominent people in previously we have shown that the key of x equal to some of all these exercise.

219
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:15,470
This is a sufficient statistic. Previously we have shown this and also this is very intuitive to understand.

220
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:25,430
We have tried to emphasize the education or the understanding of this by the reason is that now choose success probability.

221
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:34,340
If you are trying to summarize all the information about your data, if you if you throw the coin 100 times,

222
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,820
then we don't have to know exactly which trial has a hat which has a tail.

223
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:53,120
As long as we know that out of is 100 miles or 60 has 40 tails, then that while these these number this number like 66 assets has out of 100 trials.

224
00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:00,710
This has to summarize all the information about P based on your based on this 132 trials.

225
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:09,740
So if you that this should be a sufficient study and also for years we have shown this basic using definition and using 6.1.

226
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:14,960
True. But now let's try to see how to show this using the factorization theorem.

227
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:22,940
So now let's just first right down the drawing p pmf, right?

228
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:31,850
So we have different x eyes. So here this is the PMF for x one and this is the PMF for him.

229
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:40,220
So we multiply all these together and then if we combine all different terms, this is what we get.

230
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:49,020
And then noticing that this power is just a team of small acts, just tracks.

231
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:53,050
And then this is why man has to power immodest tracks.

232
00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:11,040
So after realizing this that we can simply define g of t this function to be this to be this vanishes into other words, this actually this part.

233
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:20,310
This is g g. Yes, it's.

234
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,540
So I put a tutor behind me. We had a similar dinner.

235
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:35,440
It's a badger. This handwriting is really hard to follow.

236
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,890
40 letters. So I would just use your tuna.

237
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,960
This is natural. So we can see that he's right.

238
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:47,440
Simply define the G function to be this function here.

239
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:52,180
Then this ly is g, simply this g function.

240
00:30:52,720 --> 00:31:01,600
And then I'll simply define the h function to be what is the constant as then in of course that has nothing to do with theta,

241
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:14,670
so it's completely independent of the. So after I define G in this way and H in this way, then I can see that fact Fry's F as the product of this.

242
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:21,740
And then based on the zero g must be a sufficient listing for me.

243
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:32,980
So that's how we show that the sum on that side is sufficient to repeat using the Factorization Theorem.

244
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:49,020
And then we can actually look at this a lot.

245
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:53,220
We can use this to apply this to normal distribution as well.

246
00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:05,000
So. Just to go back to our previous 612.4.

247
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:21,230
And this, this is the normal example. So suppose we have some idle variables for a normal distribution.

248
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:29,900
Now see, my square is not. So last time, actually, while after the letter, some of you asked the question, okay, for for normal distribution.

249
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:37,430
Now, if we look at this t here, he's the symbol average of TS, the symbol average.

250
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:44,569
And last time we showed that TS are sufficient studies D for mew and some of you asked O, so what if I want to see my square?

251
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:52,910
Because the average itself, of course, does not contain any information about the spread of the data or the variation in the data.

252
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,980
So how then how come this T of X is a surveillance?

253
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:06,770
That is because when you cancel visions correctly, we say that is sufficient studies and all of the data, it keeps all the information.

254
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:15,130
Well, the reason that key of X here the sample average is sufficient for you is because we are assumed to see much more is not so.

255
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:23,020
This is just a number. This is no number. So the only unknown parameter is this MI.

256
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:28,280
We are trying to use data. We are probably climate data to estimate as well as only we.

257
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:34,760
So only the sender of the decision is unknown. So the variation, the bearers of that is usually is not.

258
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:41,360
So that's why here not sufficient studies that you just assemble average similarity.

259
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:49,280
So average content, all the information in the original data about the center of the decision about the means of the distribution.

260
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,280
Later when we see some example where both small and a similar square are unknown.

261
00:33:55,670 --> 00:34:00,860
So in that case, this X bar itself is not a sufficient statistic anymore.

262
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:11,240
Well, it's also very intuitive because this the study itself, it does not contain any information about how fresh is the data.

263
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:17,900
But now let's just look at the the case where Sigma Square is not.

264
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:30,889
So in the previous. And we have shown that the sample average is a sufficient statistic for me and recall that of the PDF is given and

265
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:40,160
this this is what we have is so now let's now let's try to show this again by using the Factorization Theorem.

266
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:58,570
So of course to apply factorization to zero, we would always have to start with drawing a pdf.

267
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:07,770
So we Fabris would draw the PDF into two components, and that's how we decide whether us or other device would decide whether to do this.

268
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:17,660
So we always start with that drawing a PDF. And in the previous example, we have shown that the drawing a PDF can be written in this way.

269
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,580
This is through some evidence we went over. So let's not do that again here.

270
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:30,040
So we have we have rewritten the drawing, a PDF in this particular way.

271
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:41,950
Now we want to identify of age, function and function so that now we are able to apply the theorem to our driving theorem.

272
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:50,680
So in this case, well, it's relatively easy to identify what it actually is.

273
00:35:50,680 --> 00:36:05,520
So if I simply. Consider this part two be my age function because you're this part of my age.

274
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:09,430
Now you can see that this age function does not depend on new adult.

275
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,320
New does not appear in this age. So that's the age function here.

276
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,389
And then the rest. I call it the G function. Well, of course.

277
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:25,900
I mean, this is this plus this the sum up here in the inside of the exponential.

278
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:30,290
So what is left is the useful measure of that seven part here.

279
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:37,010
So that I define my g function to be this exponential, this function.

280
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,150
And it actually that involves me and this.

281
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:52,160
Then you'll see that this drawing a pdf then can be written as h,

282
00:36:54,530 --> 00:37:05,689
which is this part or which is the the first part here h times g of sheet g of capital.

283
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,740
T Recall that a capital capital ts just like the symbol average.

284
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,670
So my g function is defined in this way.

285
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:25,850
T letter t is over here. So if I replace this t by some or every spark that gives me this sound part of this function inside that one here.

286
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:41,540
So in other words, now if we write to the drawing a PDF in this, in this particular way, then it's very easy to identify the factorization.

287
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:47,089
So we just start to be that is to meet with this.

288
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:57,800
Then what is that rise as the part and then based on the fact rather than zero, this t of x is a sufficient statistic.

289
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:09,690
Yes. The difference between the parties is in terms of between five and the ones we did.

290
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:18,310
So you've got to show that that's important, not just because it's not just the image of the two of us.

291
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:21,700
Are you going to say what you want to use?

292
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:27,840
You mean a previous era? Right. Okay. Those are like, say, one, 2.2, right.

293
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:36,719
Well, that's a good question. So here, well, we have three results,

294
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:45,900
word or one definition and two results regarding to a sovereign state as a so far as we define what its appearance is and based on that definition,

295
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:51,050
we establish so 6.212, which is essentially the definition.

296
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,180
I mean, you look out which of which is essentially the definition.

297
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:58,290
And now we have this result found in Factorization Zero.

298
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:08,130
Okay. So the the most widely used way to find submitted a statistic or to prove as sufficient is the fact that zero.

299
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:20,510
Okay. So although you might be able to show or prove using without nation we're using 0.12 as well because all these results that are connected.

300
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,430
Right, are not completely, you know, separated.

301
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:33,290
So but when it comes to application, like if you are looking at a particular distribution and you want to show where we want to identify.

302
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:39,060
So the statistics in theory is probably the easiest one to use.

303
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:48,840
Okay. So like this term is, is used, find your simplicity and find a sufficient statistic that the first one would be.

304
00:39:49,290 --> 00:40:01,169
And this is sure that this statistic is a sufficient position if you have a

305
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:05,470
question and the question says that we should show that and it's my suspicion,

306
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:14,460
then I'm just saying that maybe you haven't used it face to face differentiated by then if your question did not give us X.

307
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:23,490
But the question says that's when you find a sufficient statistic that we can use the fact that it is in German, then yeah, that's a good credit.

308
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:27,480
So I think you can you can use Factorization Theorem to go to for both questions.

309
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:34,770
So even if you're giving us that stick and you are asked to show it is sufficient,

310
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:41,680
then actually I think that's a relatively easier problem in the sense that then you're kind of giving us give a hint.

311
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,600
So you know what you're looking at and then you well then for the distribution for the PDF,

312
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:56,130
you just try to run the PDF in that particular factorization where you know G involved the given statistic,

313
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,840
you just write a G as a function for a given statistic and also a function of theta.

314
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,710
And then you have an H that does not depend on theta.

315
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:09,299
And that's that's that's how you applied for residency in the case.

316
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,560
Very reduced identity.

317
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:18,690
Now let's say you are not a give us that as D I just give you a description I best I give you a normal decision as to what are the submissions.

318
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:24,500
This is for normal, this fusion. But then you can again apply factorization theorem and you.

319
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,060
But in this case then you will need to identify what does it like?

320
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:39,360
What does it suggest that Jose is? But as long as you you you can fact rise the distribution in the correct way, in a appropriate way.

321
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:44,820
Then you should be able to identify several studies later on to see some examples.

322
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:54,149
Yeah. So this federation theorem is probably the the easiest and the one most widely used leaves

323
00:41:54,150 --> 00:42:02,700
out when it comes to identifying something is the and for proving that is sufficient.

324
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:22,430
Okay. Any other questions. But do you effects be different from Q effects of the PMF tested something g of X different from Q.

325
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:30,590
Q if I kill Max, you mean the I'm here to test?

326
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:34,280
Yes. Okay. Yeah. These two are not necessarily connected.

327
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:45,410
They should cancel out doing I mean for the for the ratio to have independence on P does wouldn't it?

328
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:48,740
Q And do you have to be related in some way?

329
00:42:50,380 --> 00:43:01,040
Um, yeah, I think implicitly they are related because because Q is actually a pdf of capital T, but is PDF account covered?

330
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:09,470
Yeah. So they have a G and a q. They are based on the same drawing a pdf.

331
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:15,680
Yeah. Yeah. So in this sense they must be. A yeah. They must be connected, but they are not necessarily the same.

332
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:22,760
They not as what's happening. I mean, here this G has has no interpretation of PDF like PDF integration.

333
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:26,240
All right. So it doesn't have to be anybody. It's just a function.

334
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:53,690
Okay. Kind of. Then let's take a look at another way of fact rising that the normal is good.

335
00:43:53,810 --> 00:44:03,470
I saw this here. I mean, this example, what we just saw, we are then for age to be this and g two with this and based on this particular gene age,

336
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:06,950
we say that the sample average is surveillance statistic,

337
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:14,690
but it turns out that there are there are many different ways of identifying age and gene function.

338
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:22,639
So in the end, the only to the same conclusion but but the gene age makes may maybe slightly different.

339
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,100
So let's take a look at this. Exactly.

340
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:32,550
You see?

341
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:30,870
So the previously, you know, through some algebra, we actually showed that this guy, the sun from this square is actually equal to this guy over here.

342
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:37,380
So somehow that's what we did. But now let's let's not go over that algebra.

343
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:53,670
Let's just directly separate this square and cover this square so that it's some X squared, minus plus new squared, minus two times new.

344
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:32,650
Then for that explanation, I'm going to separate it as well in the following way as the product of two exponentials.

345
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:49,970
The. She?

346
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:11,160
Okay. So if you look at what we did here, we just run this piece for this exponential improvement.

347
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:24,170
This is Financial Times, this exponential. So basically, we put this exercise square together and we put this new square minus two high.

348
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:32,360
So we have this tool and then realizing that this opportunity, it does not depend on new at all.

349
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:50,000
So if we call this the age of X, the age function X, and then if we call this function our this is the g,

350
00:47:50,870 --> 00:48:00,980
g x II function where see, this function is equal to.

351
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:44,600
Is defined as. Russell Young was I defy age function to be this and achieve function to be this.

352
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,810
If you look at the g function that it is a function of well, it is a function that involved me.

353
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,670
Now, the statistic I'm looking at is the sum of exercise.

354
00:48:55,850 --> 00:49:00,950
Now, if I replace the small T in the g factor by some of x, I take on the second.

355
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:14,930
The second part, Renzo Piano Words. Now, indeed, in this case I have fact revised the F as a product of H times g a few of x,

356
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:22,400
and in that based on fact horizon zero a field x is the sufficient statistic.

357
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:30,470
So here to who knows, I want to make one of these that this factorization, if you look at the fact right here,

358
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:41,360
the choice of H and G is different from the previous H and function and g factors are different.

359
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:47,059
So this doesn't matter because of the fact resident theorem that says that as

360
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:52,820
long as you can find H and such that you can write about F as a product of H,

361
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:58,880
and that's fine. So the page and G, they do not need to be unique.

362
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:08,989
And all the times they are not. And second of all, the second note is that okay,

363
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:19,630
so here if we write it this way I'm not seriously we are looking at is the sum of Axion previously we kind of look at it that the average X right.

364
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:34,700
So here I mean if you want to make this small to to make this up of these two results exactly the same, then you could start from the very beginning.

365
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,790
You could actually shock this guy over here.

366
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:48,840
You could write it as well. This is equal to two meal times in times one over again some exi, right?

367
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:55,610
And then this if you call this the T of X, this is the sample average size.

368
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:03,470
So that essentially this to this two approaches were two ways to give you the same statistic.

369
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:09,190
One is sample average. One is a sample of some of the whole sample.

370
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:18,320
And later, we're going to see that actually there is a one if you have a sufficient statistic, one function is actually also a sufficient statistic.

371
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:23,270
And this is very intuitive to understand, especially in this case.

372
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:32,480
So now because the sample average corresponds to the center or contain all the information about me in the data,

373
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:36,829
simply every component collision, of course, does the sum.

374
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:42,380
If I multiply by in a sample size again, that has nothing to do with the center of the data.

375
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:48,500
It just assembles ice. So it should contain exactly the same information, same amount of information about me.

376
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:53,090
So that's like both the sample average and the sample.

377
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,190
So yes, they're both sufficient statistic.

378
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:01,380
Okay.

379
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:13,469
So this that's this example of, again, the main message here is that the factorization theorem is not a how to find a unique H and unique to you.

380
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:20,190
As long as you are able to find an H and g satisfies the conditions, you know that you have severe instances of.

381
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,440
Okay. So let's take a seven minute break.

382
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:45,000
Yeah. Okay.

383
00:52:45,001 --> 00:52:54,091
So for the rest of the lecture tonight, we're going to see a few examples like the students that who identify either

384
00:52:54,091 --> 00:52:59,041
identify some business statistics or show that working on some statistics,

385
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:05,971
they are actually good statistics. So first, let's well, the next example is about uniforms.

386
00:53:07,451 --> 00:53:11,051
And we want to identify the civilian studies for uniform.

387
00:53:13,831 --> 00:53:19,751
Well, suppose we have the observation from from universe.

388
00:53:19,901 --> 00:53:25,321
Follow your uniform decision with support of y for up to theta.

389
00:53:25,471 --> 00:53:28,471
This is for because theta is unknown.

390
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:39,510
Parameter three is not and we have uniform the from the support was up to theta and if

391
00:53:39,511 --> 00:53:42,990
a uniform disputed while this is a first of all this is a discrete easily from this

392
00:53:42,991 --> 00:53:48,061
version and for a uniform distribution we know that the density or the probability mass

393
00:53:48,061 --> 00:53:54,581
function is given by one divided by the total number of support we have received.

394
00:53:54,881 --> 00:54:01,501
In this case, there is not one two after theta, so that's why that can happen to be a one over theta.

395
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:08,691
One X is equal to any of these numbers, so otherwise the PMF is just equal to zero.

396
00:54:09,931 --> 00:54:13,411
So this is the PMF now move this PMF.

397
00:54:13,441 --> 00:54:18,601
Now we want to find a sufficient historicity for Theta using the Factorization Theorem.

398
00:54:19,171 --> 00:54:27,361
We are not given any statistics. We're just asked to find an unbiased opinion statistic using theorem.

399
00:54:28,561 --> 00:54:36,151
So again, to apply for the residents here, we have to first based on the PDF or GMF, we have to find the draw on the PMF.

400
00:54:38,371 --> 00:54:45,271
Then we find how to fact write the drawing of PMF into page into the product of H energy.

401
00:54:47,431 --> 00:55:08,191
So let's do that together. So the drawing, the first we look out of the door and try the drawing, the p m f of x1x2x end is given by.

402
00:55:19,071 --> 00:55:26,511
And by the way, I know that for handwritten notes, it's really hard to distinguish.

403
00:55:26,521 --> 00:55:28,941
And you got to because I had really poor handwriting.

404
00:55:28,941 --> 00:55:37,761
So the subscript, you know, this is capital letter A, capital X, this denotes that this is the pediatric map for capital X.

405
00:55:38,421 --> 00:55:41,781
And in this argument here, this is smart. I lowercase x.

406
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:46,671
This is just one of the arguments on the function.

407
00:55:48,121 --> 00:55:52,921
Okay. So this is equal to the point of the drawing the PMF is equal to.

408
00:55:55,171 --> 00:56:01,381
Of course, again, because we have IP data. So it's the product of all of our individual math.

409
00:56:01,381 --> 00:56:05,581
So it's the one over three to do part in.

410
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:19,271
Now, if, if every exi, if every ascot exide belongs to 0 to 1 two,

411
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:30,751
obviously if I if all this excise fall off, well, take values one, two, the theta, then we have one or both.

412
00:56:31,111 --> 00:56:41,181
Otherwise the draw the PMF is equal to zero. I guess, but this is the draw at the piano.

413
00:56:43,101 --> 00:56:53,660
And then while the falling may seem a little bit, you know, out of nowhere, you know,

414
00:56:53,661 --> 00:56:57,501
in the next room, we are able to define what a function is, what a G function is.

415
00:56:58,101 --> 00:57:04,821
But from the very beginning and it may seem a little surprising, like how how would you define patient G in this particular way?

416
00:57:05,011 --> 00:57:07,281
But this is based on the piece,

417
00:57:07,281 --> 00:57:17,510
on somebody's experience and based on based on some algebra and based on some exploration which actually we we omit all that middle step.

418
00:57:17,511 --> 00:57:22,401
But let's define H in this way.

419
00:57:58,481 --> 00:58:03,221
So let's see what this age is. This age.

420
00:58:03,371 --> 00:58:07,691
And to take only two values 140130.

421
00:58:08,891 --> 00:58:14,741
It takes value one if this well first of all this.

422
00:58:15,011 --> 00:58:18,141
I mean this x I'm sorry, this ex-student here. This.

423
00:58:18,151 --> 00:58:21,881
This is the vector that content. All the x, right? Yes.

424
00:58:24,191 --> 00:58:27,341
So this age is a function of all this exercise.

425
00:58:27,911 --> 00:58:38,411
So this age take value one. If every exi if every exi is a positive any, it is a positive in it.

426
00:58:39,371 --> 00:58:46,411
So this notation here is simply means that every exi is a positive because we have in x eyes.

427
00:58:46,761 --> 00:58:51,371
So the bacteria come from this is to power in.

428
00:58:59,721 --> 00:59:03,261
Does everybody follow me here? She means.

429
00:59:03,991 --> 00:59:09,141
That means that. Well, it takes value. One one every exi is a part of it either.

430
00:59:09,831 --> 00:59:15,891
Otherwise it takes about zero. So this is how we define H.

431
00:59:17,541 --> 00:59:21,501
And then, of course, this does not depend on theta. It has nothing to do with the.

432
00:59:23,031 --> 00:59:31,971
And then we define. Let's say.

433
00:59:40,801 --> 01:00:01,440
We look at this statistic. So in six a while.

434
01:00:01,441 --> 01:00:04,531
You guys have learned other statistics, have you?

435
01:00:05,161 --> 01:00:10,921
Yeah, you obviously. So if we define cheat just to be the largest utter statistic in.

436
01:00:15,941 --> 01:00:20,561
And if we define C function.

437
01:00:39,581 --> 01:00:44,491
Otherwise. So key function.

438
01:00:44,551 --> 01:00:49,981
Well, it depends on theta. So once you give me a theta value, this is what my function is.

439
01:00:50,281 --> 01:00:58,411
So Jyoti, what ts less than or equal to theta is one over a theta to power in otherwise this g function is equal to zero.

440
01:00:59,461 --> 01:01:08,391
This is how do you find my g function? Okay, so with this definition.

441
01:01:08,401 --> 01:01:16,341
So after we define this H and there's this statistic which is the longest ultra statistic and this g functions,

442
01:01:16,891 --> 01:01:31,021
then we claim that then f the joint pdf with PMF can be written as the product of.

443
01:01:38,831 --> 01:01:41,891
Teenage age.

444
01:01:45,821 --> 01:01:49,361
So, again, this scene may seem a little bit out of nowhere.

445
01:01:49,481 --> 01:01:54,341
How did you know to define age this way and in this way and see this way?

446
01:01:54,401 --> 01:02:00,280
I sort of maybe in the next example things, what's our next solution?

447
01:02:00,281 --> 01:02:04,271
We have an alternative solution. Things become slightly easier to see.

448
01:02:04,601 --> 01:02:07,691
But again, this is actually largely based on, you know,

449
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:17,441
seeing many examples and based on algebra and based on time based exploration, finding that we've come up with that sort of GMT.

450
01:02:17,831 --> 01:02:25,901
But for now, let's just check that indeed, with such a defined age and g, t t of X,

451
01:02:26,321 --> 01:02:30,671
we are able to this is actually indeed equal to this must attack this very quickly.

452
01:02:34,051 --> 01:02:39,361
Okay. So now let's take a look at the product. Let's try to evaluate this product.

453
01:02:40,171 --> 01:02:45,421
Now, this product is a part of H and G. Now H and G.

454
01:02:45,421 --> 01:02:48,871
They can both take values now zero values and zero values.

455
01:02:49,741 --> 01:02:55,201
So of course, then the product is non-zero only when both G and H are non-zero.

456
01:02:55,831 --> 01:03:03,571
Either one is zero, then the product is zero. So when we look at of their product, the product GMH.

457
01:03:04,201 --> 01:03:08,791
So we just need to look at the value where both G and H are non-zero.

458
01:03:09,301 --> 01:03:12,601
Let's take a look at what happens when both G and H, r non-zero.

459
01:03:14,281 --> 01:03:17,971
So this guy we're checking this is equal to H.

460
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:25,111
So this guy is actually equal to two and this guy is equal to zero.

461
01:03:25,741 --> 01:03:31,651
It is. It is zero. If either H is it or d zero and is not zero.

462
01:03:31,651 --> 01:03:37,681
If both HMG are not zero, the both page and g are not zero.

463
01:03:37,711 --> 01:03:44,611
H takes about two. One always takes out of one. G always take value one over again.

464
01:03:45,061 --> 01:03:51,781
And so if you modify this two together, then the product take a value one over three to the current.

465
01:03:53,311 --> 01:03:56,971
Now let's take a look at a when you take such value, it it takes value.

466
01:03:57,681 --> 01:04:06,631
Well, both this happens and well, under both this condition and this condition.

467
01:04:08,071 --> 01:04:11,811
Right. So if you look at this condition,

468
01:04:12,351 --> 01:04:23,271
what this condition says is that every X eye is a positive emitter and that that's essentially what the water what this condition says.

469
01:04:24,231 --> 01:04:26,381
It says every exercise, positive, any drinks.

470
01:04:27,171 --> 01:04:35,901
Now, if you look at what this condition says now, tea is actually, you know, because we are replaced replacing t by by t of x, maybe.

471
01:04:35,961 --> 01:04:39,231
Let me just finish this and then I'll answer the question.

472
01:04:39,561 --> 01:04:51,260
So now T of X is actually the largest statistic so that the artist, although a statistic less than or equal to theta,

473
01:04:51,261 --> 01:04:59,811
that means every x has to be less than or equal to theta because exercise the largest one, those are x and is largest one.

474
01:05:00,111 --> 01:05:10,731
So. So if you put these two conditions together first, every x is about integer and a staggering the of x.

475
01:05:10,731 --> 01:05:18,981
He has to be less than or equal to theta. That means every z has to be less than or equal to theta.

476
01:05:19,161 --> 01:05:28,031
And also they must be positive any. If we put this two together that it means well, every x.

477
01:05:29,541 --> 01:05:44,541
So all these x i's they take such that this is so much otherwise.

478
01:05:45,231 --> 01:05:49,491
If this is not true, then otherwise that the product is equal to zero.

479
01:05:51,391 --> 01:05:57,020
And then you can indeed see that this is precisely h function.

480
01:05:57,021 --> 01:06:01,791
That's something like yeah, yeah.

481
01:06:01,971 --> 01:06:06,801
The draw of the drawing, a PDF that's, that's this kind of thing.

482
01:06:12,471 --> 01:06:21,291
So these, these two are the same. So the other words, what we have done is that look from the drawing a pdf once we have the drawing of f,

483
01:06:21,831 --> 01:06:32,451
we we just suddenly we just directly define this age and this T and this G and we check that indeed the product of H and a g gives us.

484
01:06:33,591 --> 01:06:39,561
So the other one, in other words, the PMF can be fact raised in this particular way.

485
01:06:41,181 --> 01:06:47,061
So then based off the the by the by factorization theorem.

486
01:06:55,441 --> 01:06:59,581
X in the largest dataset, hosting is a sufficient statistic.

487
01:07:09,641 --> 01:07:17,950
Okay. So I saw a question. Yeah. When you defined age of X and you say X is a positive and what is the superscript

488
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:31,241
small and superscript small and you may hear about a box in the set of 1 to 3.

489
01:07:33,491 --> 01:07:37,071
You've been here? Yeah, I'm here, yes. Oh, I see.

490
01:07:39,261 --> 01:07:45,221
Okay. So this is sort of this means that.

491
01:07:45,231 --> 01:07:55,401
Well, I mean, if every well if each X I belong to, maybe I'll use a purely mathematical notation.

492
01:07:55,401 --> 01:08:08,361
So if every x y belongs to a positive image, if I use this to denote a positive integer, I'm not sure if you're like, you're okay with this.

493
01:08:08,901 --> 01:08:12,681
You'll get so that this means that each x is a positive.

494
01:08:12,691 --> 01:08:17,311
And then if I have x equals 2x1,

495
01:08:17,571 --> 01:08:26,421
think that's and then I get this is just a notation that raises the bar and it means that every x line is a positive and

496
01:08:26,451 --> 01:08:37,251
imagine that this is similar to the notation aren't so if it's not in real numbers as of accurate dimensional fact.

497
01:08:40,601 --> 01:08:47,740
Yeah. When you define the statistic, so t of x, it says equals marks.

498
01:08:47,741 --> 01:08:51,401
And then there's like a little I mean, what does that mean?

499
01:08:52,431 --> 01:08:58,101
Oh, this. This means that this is or is between one and.

500
01:08:59,591 --> 01:09:02,651
Okay. And this is the maximization over pi.

501
01:09:04,191 --> 01:09:08,471
Oh, okay. Yeah.

502
01:09:11,711 --> 01:09:20,471
Okay. And other question. Yeah. What's the difference between the notation for the conditions for hit your fix and x?

503
01:09:20,981 --> 01:09:29,161
So how is capital x belongs to one? Common to common three to the different from essay belongs to one comma to committee.

504
01:09:31,311 --> 01:09:39,041
It makes it so much easier that you so in the first line the condition for f

505
01:09:39,611 --> 01:09:46,271
effects of x given you don't really care about otherwise that condition be here.

506
01:09:46,301 --> 01:09:51,881
Yes. How is that condition different from the condition in the lines here?

507
01:09:51,911 --> 01:09:56,211
No, no. Don't forget your fix here.

508
01:09:56,281 --> 01:09:59,331
Yeah. How are those two different? Oh.

509
01:10:00,891 --> 01:10:05,051
Oh, they're. They're only the same.

510
01:10:05,651 --> 01:10:14,381
They are not the same because here this condition says that every excise takes valid one to up to say one here.

511
01:10:14,751 --> 01:10:18,611
Well, this is X. I can take any part of it. Okay.

512
01:10:18,791 --> 01:10:28,291
Thank you. Any other questions?

513
01:10:34,681 --> 01:10:42,061
Okay. So, again, this this solution here, this seems to be I mean, there is some algebra involved,

514
01:10:42,061 --> 01:10:52,651
which is typically the case when we tried to refer many examples in 6602, there is some some algebra involved.

515
01:10:54,781 --> 01:11:04,231
Sometimes the algebra I use is the one that we commonly seen, but sometimes some other times it's some algebra that is a little bit tricky to follow.

516
01:11:07,021 --> 01:11:13,651
So I guess in this, as is probably similar in six of us in this one example is probably also far into the same category.

517
01:11:14,161 --> 01:11:18,401
But anyway, I mean, this solution shows that by using Factorization Theorem,

518
01:11:18,451 --> 01:11:27,301
we are able to identify what that solving a statistic is and actually this X and now after we realize after we

519
01:11:27,301 --> 01:11:33,001
show this actually and this division of statistics sort of makes sense because if you look at the distribution,

520
01:11:34,531 --> 01:11:40,591
if you look at the distribution, this is a two square distribution. This is a universal decision where theta is our amount.

521
01:11:41,281 --> 01:11:48,751
That is the unknown parameter is the upper bound. Then of course, it's very natural match.

522
01:11:48,841 --> 01:11:56,701
You know, the largest order statistic, the largest value among all these in all the data points you collect that adds to the content.

523
01:11:56,851 --> 01:12:01,021
The information about this are about of the support.

524
01:12:01,641 --> 01:12:08,491
And so after I mean, after, of course, without even this, it's probably a little bit hard to say, but.

525
01:12:08,761 --> 01:12:16,741
But after we show that of this X in this surveillance statistic, then things should be a little bit a little bit more intuitive.

526
01:12:18,691 --> 01:12:28,051
So that's this solution. Now, let's take a look at another solution, which might be more, well, easier you to understand.

527
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:35,101
That is, to use the so-called indicator function to to find the factorization.

528
01:12:50,371 --> 01:12:54,611
You know, just.

529
01:13:01,141 --> 01:13:06,481
What we want you to.

530
01:13:15,061 --> 01:13:24,840
So guys seeing any good or other from 601 or from other courses not seen in other function so well if you haven't.

531
01:13:24,841 --> 01:13:29,011
But that's that's okay. So let's just hope very quickly to go over the entire function.

532
01:13:29,761 --> 01:13:34,831
So we will use AI to denote any getter function. In a getter function, just take two values.

533
01:13:34,921 --> 01:13:37,981
You can think of this as a Bernoulli rather variable only take two values.

534
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:40,381
So any of you are a function of event,

535
01:13:40,381 --> 01:13:51,091
a take about a one event occurs or event hey is true price increase otherwise to take about value so it indicates whether it occurs or not.

536
01:13:54,691 --> 01:14:09,931
Then for indicator function to events like a drawing would be the any kind of unusual indicator that a and it be simultaneous

537
01:14:09,991 --> 01:14:20,611
occur essentially equal to the indicator that event occurs times the initiator that exactly occurs and this is one property.

538
01:14:20,911 --> 01:14:35,161
Well and that slight of generalization is that. That's the initiator of that.

539
01:14:35,701 --> 01:14:46,231
You know, a multiple event occurs simultaneously is the product of the inventors in that every event occurs.

540
01:14:46,921 --> 01:14:50,601
So this is just a slight generalization of this.

541
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:54,600
So and it's larger than two. Okay.

542
01:14:54,601 --> 01:15:00,180
So with this any dinner function now let's take a look at how to fact rise the drawing of that,

543
01:15:00,181 --> 01:15:09,751
because our goal is to effect prize goodwill of the amount and the H and and using the radiograph is probably easier to identify what age in G are.

544
01:15:11,891 --> 01:15:21,821
So in this case, you're drawn to PMF, which is equal.

545
01:15:21,821 --> 01:15:29,080
True. Because we have discrete well, you have uniform rather variable discrete uniform run variables.

546
01:15:29,081 --> 01:15:32,981
So this is equal to X1, small X1 and X.

547
01:15:32,981 --> 01:15:42,581
And it was not actually. And then because all these excise, they are independent.

548
01:15:43,181 --> 01:15:45,160
Independent. I don't think it is really to run America.

549
01:15:45,161 --> 01:16:06,341
So the product of all these two events is equal to the product of x ie equal to small x, which is the product, the PMF that is one over theta times.

550
01:16:06,341 --> 01:16:10,211
Any data indicator that x I will ask to.

551
01:16:16,581 --> 01:16:20,571
And also one. And this.

552
01:16:20,591 --> 01:16:24,151
This is simply the PMF. We're excited.

553
01:16:33,721 --> 01:16:51,621
So this is then equal to. Well, maybe just one more word.

554
01:16:51,651 --> 01:17:02,691
So here we recall that to the PMF for each X is given by this or this is the PMF or uniform rather variable.

555
01:17:03,501 --> 01:17:05,990
And we can of course read this as an indicator.

556
01:17:05,991 --> 01:17:13,851
So this can be written as one number theta times the indicator that Exide belongs to rule one and two theta.

557
01:17:15,941 --> 01:17:19,351
Well, now you've regretted us using the heater, then.

558
01:17:19,471 --> 01:17:26,031
This is how we. This is not about. Does everybody agree?

559
01:17:27,771 --> 01:17:33,021
Okay. So that this now here on we are simply using that fact that we just wrapped.

560
01:17:33,021 --> 01:17:35,091
You are now using this image. Okay.

561
01:17:35,451 --> 01:17:45,231
So then this integrator, this is the indicator that X passing through this that we are going to write it as in the following way.

562
01:17:45,231 --> 01:17:56,871
So this is X, Y falls into X is a positive integer and x is less than or equal to theta.

563
01:18:06,111 --> 01:18:10,031
We simply arrived at this this this indicator as the indicator of this.

564
01:18:10,071 --> 01:18:13,761
And this, of course, these are the same events.

565
01:18:13,941 --> 01:18:22,261
So if X is positive, any X less than or equal to theta, then of course x, I must be a spot into a particular.

566
01:18:22,621 --> 01:18:31,731
Okay. And then for the variety of the asked, the product of one number, a theta.

567
01:18:31,731 --> 01:18:34,821
That's one over theta. The power in.

568
01:18:37,601 --> 01:18:43,871
And then the well, then we still have the product of all these indicators.

569
01:18:45,041 --> 01:18:51,101
The product of all these inhalers is by using this, this result here.

570
01:18:51,281 --> 01:19:01,691
So we have the product of all these indicators. It's actually equal to the indicator of the for the drawn events of the event simultaneous of.

571
01:19:01,841 --> 01:19:18,341
So then we're going to write of this as X. I is a party leader and it's I guess and we're able to say that this is for all I for all.

572
01:19:27,601 --> 01:19:34,471
And this equality I'm going to point out this equality is simply an application of this.

573
01:19:35,881 --> 01:19:42,721
This fact over here. That's that's where this equality comes from.

574
01:19:47,861 --> 01:19:50,611
We're going to then if we keep writing.

575
01:19:52,021 --> 01:20:01,921
So the indicator that this occurred is where I and this occurred is for all I that is the same as the indicator that expired.

576
01:20:05,461 --> 01:20:09,961
This is true for I. And.

577
01:20:18,961 --> 01:20:24,381
The maximum expense is less and work is less than or equal to I.

578
01:20:31,221 --> 01:20:37,101
Because if every X is less than or equal to theta, then of course the maximum must be less than or equal to theta,

579
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:41,921
and for the maximum is less than or equal to theta. Every exi must be less than or equal.

580
01:20:42,261 --> 01:20:50,330
So these are equivalent. And then oh okay.

581
01:20:50,331 --> 01:21:00,891
So then we are going to write in this one over theta and then I times x i glossary the initiator and.

582
01:21:10,111 --> 01:21:14,631
But no, he's not here. This is the year for this event.

583
01:21:14,751 --> 01:21:20,711
And in this event, and I am going to write this as the initiator for the first event.

584
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:27,801
What about the initiator from attacking that? So this is the initiator for the first event modified by the initiator for the second event.

585
01:21:41,641 --> 01:21:52,911
Okay. And then. Well, just to. Clearly define what gender age is and go to the one or two of our end, to the very end.

586
01:21:56,251 --> 01:22:02,391
After we got here, now it becomes clear I will simply call this the age function.

587
01:22:06,731 --> 01:22:10,601
And I'll simply call this the G function.

588
01:22:54,651 --> 01:23:13,061
You. Okay.

589
01:23:15,461 --> 01:23:21,311
This is probably an easier to understand proof or solution compared to the previous one,

590
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:25,901
because the previous one sort of started from the very end of this ocean.

591
01:23:25,901 --> 01:23:36,901
So the previous solution directly defined age to be this directly defined g to be this how dragon defined t the strategy to be to the end, right?

592
01:23:36,911 --> 01:23:40,631
But part of this solution here is sort of start from the beginning.

593
01:23:40,631 --> 01:23:51,581
So use an indicator function. It adds to the fact rise f in the edge into the product of H and g, which is a function of the order.

594
01:23:51,601 --> 01:24:04,341
So now with this afternoon we realize that this h part now has nothing to do with theta and g and partly depends on skin.

595
01:24:04,481 --> 01:24:07,841
And given the data now n is less than.

596
01:24:08,291 --> 01:24:11,351
But in fact rising zero is the sufficient statistic.

597
01:24:12,781 --> 01:24:21,821
So if you look out of this h empty here, there are precisely the precise set of that h kind of g and t defined in the previous solution.

598
01:24:28,121 --> 01:24:36,461
So this is a solution by using the indicator function. So after use in any interaction we are able to or exclusive to read the drawing.

599
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:39,731
Yeah. We're put out as a part of.

600
01:24:44,431 --> 01:24:47,461
Any questions about this soldier or the previous one?

601
01:24:49,931 --> 01:25:01,441
Yes. Why fight abuse and the maximum war that's persisting because of a wide.

602
01:25:01,451 --> 01:25:06,611
We use the maximum. You mean we hear defense?

603
01:25:07,471 --> 01:25:12,231
The first solution? This one.

604
01:25:13,501 --> 01:25:24,241
Here. The offensive side looks like the first line sliding slider.

605
01:25:24,721 --> 01:25:32,511
Oh, the first line. Okay. Sorry. Why did you use the maximum on that statistic?

606
01:25:32,771 --> 01:25:42,071
If we guess that's based on the, um, the domain they give us because for the exercise time less than the T does.

607
01:25:43,821 --> 01:25:48,621
Oh, you mean here? Like why we made it this gas, right? Why we suddenly consider this.

608
01:25:49,161 --> 01:25:53,661
Right. So on. Now again. Well, for this solution here, that's.

609
01:25:53,751 --> 01:26:04,271
There's less, I mean, I guess less explanation that can be given because I mean, this is stuff like, you know, how, how H and T there are defined.

610
01:26:05,451 --> 01:26:10,401
Um, I think maybe, maybe it's better if we start with this solution.

611
01:26:10,461 --> 01:26:14,511
Now, let's, let's, let's switch the order of this to a solution. Let's look at this one first.

612
01:26:15,111 --> 01:26:17,671
Right. If we look at this one, first of all,

613
01:26:17,731 --> 01:26:27,771
we use the any intervention and we write we think rise this F as the product of h empty emptiness defined in this way.

614
01:26:28,731 --> 01:26:37,071
So. So do you have questions about this and this I think this one has its main question which cause and yeah,

615
01:26:37,161 --> 01:26:42,111
let's use the maximum with that statistic because the exercises are less than two weeks.

616
01:26:42,611 --> 01:26:49,281
Yes, right. Right. So this solution is more natural the better the logical way.

617
01:26:49,731 --> 01:26:56,841
Now, the previous like this solution here, it really doesn't tell where this age come from.

618
01:26:57,411 --> 01:27:01,751
We are this t come from. Where this g come from is justified this way.

619
01:27:01,761 --> 01:27:06,261
And then finally we are able to check, okay, this little product is indeed equal to F.

620
01:27:07,311 --> 01:27:13,761
So in this sense, this is there's not like too much explanation that can be given behind this illusion.

621
01:27:14,181 --> 01:27:18,621
But once we realize if we if I mean, if we provided the cycle resolution first,

622
01:27:19,851 --> 01:27:27,861
then we then if we just directly define H in this way and G in this way and T in this way, then very good.

623
01:27:28,161 --> 01:27:39,911
Then that's sort of give the first. So let's say I'm using my idea from the first, like the previous, as opposed to after I get to my giant PDF.

624
01:27:39,951 --> 01:27:46,940
And I just it's that each of makes this one and then there g g the function is one

625
01:27:46,941 --> 01:27:50,981
or whatever and it just ended without doing the maximum or that statistic is.

626
01:27:52,681 --> 01:27:55,621
Right after I get to my Giants distribution.

627
01:27:55,861 --> 01:28:07,440
That's one of my teeth apart and I'll just it's that's my of x is one and then my duty of giving it to is that I want to see

628
01:28:07,441 --> 01:28:22,171
even more than this without doing the maximum what that's that's is going to do that it's probably not crap the reason is that

629
01:28:22,981 --> 01:28:31,671
in the end well as I mentioned that age is not a unique age is are you going and g is not necessarily unique by that so we

630
01:28:31,681 --> 01:28:40,561
just diversity it has to something to do with X in the largest order statistic if if you are considering other statistics,

631
01:28:40,561 --> 01:28:45,631
they are not sufficient unless they are one function of this excellent.

632
01:28:48,701 --> 01:28:53,571
So in other words, I mean, again, so this I mean, this is how the slice are ordered.

633
01:28:53,691 --> 01:28:57,481
So but I don't think this is the best order of these two solutions.

634
01:28:57,501 --> 01:29:02,031
So probably the second solution should be, you know, should be first presented.

635
01:29:03,261 --> 01:29:08,551
That's a more natural solution. The second solution and it was we got to the second solution.

636
01:29:09,321 --> 01:29:12,200
Like once we got to here, once we got here,

637
01:29:12,201 --> 01:29:19,641
then it's probably easier to see why the first solution define age and the corresponding age and g and that's it.

638
01:29:20,421 --> 01:29:28,851
Right. And essentially, I think these are the these two are the same solution, although the slides called it the two solution.

639
01:29:28,851 --> 01:29:30,531
But essentially, they are they are the same.

640
01:29:31,161 --> 01:29:39,821
It's just that you well, from the second solution, you probably you realize what HMG are and then resolution you define them.

641
01:29:43,101 --> 01:29:51,471
So I mean, if you have such a central question in the homework or in the exam, you don't have to really come up with two solutions.

642
01:29:52,131 --> 01:29:56,531
You could drag or give solution two if you're more comfortable with solution tools.

643
01:29:56,841 --> 01:30:00,441
Right. I mean, there's there's no yeah. It's not necessary for you to drag.

644
01:30:00,441 --> 01:30:07,791
We come up with a solution. What does that to sort of address your your question.

645
01:30:08,931 --> 01:30:12,651
Okay. Yeah. If you if you want to talk more, we can talk more after.

646
01:30:16,431 --> 01:30:22,551
But that's that's just a cartoon of how this has organized and might cause some confusion.

647
01:30:22,561 --> 01:30:29,771
But I think if you're really uncomfortable with solution one, let's just focus on social.

648
01:30:30,561 --> 01:30:36,050
We don't have to I mean, we don't have to really keep driving, come up with social one.

649
01:30:36,051 --> 01:30:46,711
If you are, do that. Let's make this. Okay.

650
01:30:46,721 --> 01:30:53,211
Any other questions? So on.

651
01:30:53,371 --> 01:30:56,781
So the whole search process, so these statistics,

652
01:30:57,551 --> 01:31:06,231
it mainly based on intuition of the problem is not merely boiled some sometimes intuition helps result.

653
01:31:06,261 --> 01:31:15,011
So for example, if you are the normal like me being premier of a normal kind of, you have kind of the intuition.

654
01:31:15,021 --> 01:31:22,871
I mean, the sample average should be it should be sufficient when it is something related to the sample mean.

655
01:31:24,381 --> 01:31:29,571
But again, if you want to formally argue with that absolutely sufficient, then you will have to go through that.

656
01:31:30,201 --> 01:31:36,501
You will find the average in zero. So the translation can help you to construct some statistics.

657
01:31:37,581 --> 01:31:42,201
How do you identify what appears to be car noise?

658
01:31:42,201 --> 01:31:45,831
One would argue it is sufficient this to neutral on the itself.

659
01:31:50,521 --> 01:31:54,331
Okay. So now let's take a look at, again, the normal distribution.

660
01:31:54,631 --> 01:31:59,561
But now we assume that both you and a similar amount.

661
01:32:00,631 --> 01:32:04,081
And then now let's take a look at what are the submission statistics are.

662
01:32:06,871 --> 01:32:10,621
So suppose we have run resemble from normal.

663
01:32:11,801 --> 01:32:15,571
We handle the prompter of actors you can see much clearer.

664
01:32:18,451 --> 01:32:22,471
And now we are trying to use the fact rather zero to find a civilian statistic.

665
01:32:22,501 --> 01:32:32,281
So we are not given any statistic. What we need to do now, we need to write down the book, draw the PDF, and then try to place on that.

666
01:32:32,281 --> 01:32:36,391
Try to identify what for the civilian statistics might be.

667
01:32:39,031 --> 01:32:50,191
So now let's take a look at the solution. So yeah, we start with the drawing that is the product of the individual PDFs.

668
01:32:50,421 --> 01:32:56,691
Right. And then this is just a well, we have seen this well, actually, this whole algebra, we have seen this.

669
01:32:56,701 --> 01:33:02,821
So this is stuff we just subtribe X bar and then X bar number just separate.

670
01:33:03,451 --> 01:33:06,961
Right. So here we just combine this two and this two with separate in the square.

671
01:33:07,171 --> 01:33:11,160
And in the end, we have we got this this is algebra.

672
01:33:11,161 --> 01:33:18,811
We saw this in our last lectures. And that's not getting to details on showing other words.

673
01:33:18,811 --> 01:33:22,741
We can rewrite this draw in a PDF in this particular way.

674
01:33:24,331 --> 01:33:32,941
In this particular way. And then if we consider this statistic, while these two statistics,

675
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:41,041
one is the sample average and one is sort of the symbol bearers, but not what if we.

676
01:33:41,041 --> 01:33:45,601
Well, this is the symbol various.

677
01:33:45,631 --> 01:33:49,561
Right. This is the symbol bearers.

678
01:33:49,561 --> 01:34:02,401
But now we're just looking at, you know, this part of which doesn't matter too much because you could actually you know, you could actually be white.

679
01:34:03,241 --> 01:34:06,271
So let's just not worry about that too much. So.

680
01:34:07,111 --> 01:34:12,211
So if we define these two stars, this one is symbol average and one is this guy.

681
01:34:13,081 --> 01:34:21,711
And then for the reason that we suddenly got it, we decided to look at this tool that's not, you know, out of nowhere.

682
01:34:21,721 --> 01:34:28,981
That's because of that. That's actually guided by the drawing a PDF because we see that, you know, there is this part.

683
01:34:30,031 --> 01:34:34,141
Yeah, there's, there's this part. Right, sorry.

684
01:34:34,381 --> 01:34:42,541
There's, there's this part. So this, this is x bar and it's all the function depends on x bar and depends on the parameter.

685
01:34:42,781 --> 01:34:48,151
And also the function depends on this statistic and depends on the adult counter.

686
01:34:48,331 --> 01:34:53,211
See my square. So this, this, all of these are indications our size.

687
01:34:53,241 --> 01:34:57,721
I want a statistics that we should construct or we should consider.

688
01:34:59,221 --> 01:35:09,811
So then if we consider this t1t to this to statistics now let's then this is again the the pdf.

689
01:35:10,651 --> 01:35:24,600
So if we simply take h to be over one and a then the t function, now we have to one MP two So the g function to be this function already here.

690
01:35:24,601 --> 01:35:32,161
So this is, this is t y and this is T2. And so this function depends on both parameters.

691
01:35:32,611 --> 01:35:38,221
The new C must work. If you look at we have to see my square and we have see my square Sigma Square and we have we.

692
01:35:38,611 --> 01:35:43,861
So indeed it is a function of view and see my square and also it's a function T one and T2.

693
01:35:45,751 --> 01:35:52,171
And then if you pluck capital T one and capital T two, as we defined on the previous slide,

694
01:35:53,161 --> 01:36:03,361
if you plug that into this G function, you realize that, okay, so this F is actually equal to g times.

695
01:36:03,571 --> 01:36:07,911
H where H is just a 200 is just a constant Y.

696
01:36:10,711 --> 01:36:20,311
So then this is the factorization of this drawing the PDF and then based on the factorization theorem, this T one and T2,

697
01:36:21,031 --> 01:36:30,421
these two together, this is some visual statistic for the theta parameter of theta has to come in and we'll have to see my square.

698
01:36:32,151 --> 01:36:35,420
And again, this is well after we see this,

699
01:36:35,421 --> 01:36:44,211
it's very intuitive to understand because new is the center of the distribution can assume a square is that varies on the distribution.

700
01:36:44,731 --> 01:36:55,161
Now if you look at this two statistic, the simple average matter the center and this matters, the variation, the spread, how spread of the data is.

701
01:36:55,641 --> 01:37:05,631
And so these two together the as we content all the information in the original data about the center of memory of the original distribution.

702
01:37:08,181 --> 01:37:12,561
So this is the normal example again.

703
01:37:12,831 --> 01:37:23,031
I mean, here, the identification or the construction of 22, all the previous lies like you two, this is not out of nowhere.

704
01:37:23,041 --> 01:37:31,421
This is actually guided by I mean, if you write the the draw the PDF in this particular way that this is guided by this particular expression,

705
01:37:31,431 --> 01:37:34,991
that's gives us a sign of how to construct this phenomenon.

706
01:37:36,981 --> 01:37:52,491
If we can just make the age function equal to one, then I can see really like, could you just rewrite the Factorization Theorem?

707
01:37:53,601 --> 01:38:07,131
But without or just in terms of gee, we do need a good reason is that I see your question, but I think we do need a reason to do that.

708
01:38:09,651 --> 01:38:15,771
The genie should be a function of that, a function of X through key points.

709
01:38:16,371 --> 01:38:22,821
So like in this book, like in this example, for example, like, like in this one,

710
01:38:23,851 --> 01:38:31,941
if you really define this as wordy and if you divide age to be one that's not done,

711
01:38:32,121 --> 01:38:41,301
then the dependance of TS through x I that's not only through that the x bar here, but also through this x i's.

712
01:38:49,371 --> 01:38:53,031
I'm not sure if you follow. Follow me here.

713
01:38:56,031 --> 01:38:59,951
So as we measure the age and they are not necessarily independent.

714
01:39:00,351 --> 01:39:04,011
Poverty cannot be just trivially taken as one.

715
01:39:04,821 --> 01:39:14,000
So that's what I'm trying to make. And then I'm trying to see if there is a good example for that to illustrate my point.

716
01:39:14,001 --> 01:39:26,381
But. Maybe I will just explain it in a more general way.

717
01:39:26,381 --> 01:39:32,681
And later, you can you can see if you are able to find an example that I sort of agree with my general explanation.

718
01:39:33,041 --> 01:39:39,731
So the reason that we cannot seem to take all we want is, okay,

719
01:39:39,791 --> 01:39:53,921
so let's let's go to the fact that zero that's Google 5005000 says that the true on a pdf is fact priced in this way and this g.

720
01:39:55,671 --> 01:40:04,841
Yeah is actually a function of T, so it is well, it is a function of it is a function of x, but it is a function of hence through this T.

721
01:40:06,341 --> 01:40:09,671
So in other words, it's like t cannot be arbitrary.

722
01:40:10,001 --> 01:40:15,401
That's why h cannot be arbitrary. So yeah.

723
01:40:15,401 --> 01:40:26,141
So the other words, the dependance of this function on x that is not a through t, then you would have to put it in x h.

724
01:40:27,191 --> 01:40:31,661
That makes sense. Okay. Yeah. So that explains why that house from us, right?

725
01:40:32,001 --> 01:40:45,591
Yeah. Okay.

726
01:40:45,591 --> 01:40:54,271
So that's this example. And so I think we are almost at time.

727
01:40:54,271 --> 01:41:00,541
So I'm debating whether we should get started with maybe, maybe not, maybe not.

728
01:41:01,411 --> 01:41:08,521
Any other questions before we start? Oh, yeah.

729
01:41:08,521 --> 01:41:26,581
That means we'll stop here. Sorry, I have to.

730
01:41:30,781 --> 01:41:38,581
I think it is. What are you supposed to do?

731
01:41:38,791 --> 01:41:55,231
Which is to file whatever it would look like.

732
01:42:04,531 --> 01:42:05,211
Like my last.
