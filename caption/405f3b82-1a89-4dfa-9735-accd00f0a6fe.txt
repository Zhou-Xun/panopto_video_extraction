00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this video, I'll show you how to record your first video with Panopto.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
First, I'll walk through the process on Windows and then I'll show the differences when using a Mac.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If your account has the necessary access to create videos within Panopto, you will see a create button at the top of the page as shown here.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The first thing you want to do is install the software on your computer.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Click the create button and select record a new session. Next click download Panopto at the bottom.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The installer for Panopto will download onto your computer, run the installer the same way you would install any other application.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Once Panopto is installed, you can launch Panopto right from the Create button, click create recording New Session Open Panopto.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The Panopto software will open on your computer. Choose the folder you'd like to create a video in and give your video a title.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Next, we'll need to determine what content you'd like to capture.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Do you want yourself to be included in the video? If so, choose your webcam or video camera from the primary video dropdown list.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Do you want to record a video of your screen capture or your PowerPoint slides?

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Simply check the boxes under secondary sources as shown here.

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If you choose to record any secondary sources, feel free to adjust the resolution,

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
frame rate and bitrate of these sources with the controls at the bottom of the recorder.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Always remember to click apply after adjusting the secondary source quality settings.

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Finally, you must select a primary audio source to create a successful recording.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Choose any microphone connected to your computer.

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
After selecting talk in a normal voice to test volume, you should see a few green bars appear as you talk.

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:31,000
If you don't see any or see the yellow or red area highlighted. Adjust the volume by using the slider.

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
When you're ready, click the record button at the top. Panopto will start recording all of the sources you've selected.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If you've chosen to record your screen capture, feel free to minimize Panopto and begin displaying the content you wish to present.

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
When finished.

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Maximize Panopto and click the stop button, click the blue upload button, and your video will automatically be uploaded to your video library.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Great job recording your first video. Now let's take a look at the differences on Panopto for Mac.

25
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:32,000
As you can see, there aren't three tabs at the top. There is the mÃ©nage recording's area and the create new recording area.

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You will select your primary sources the same way you would in Windows below the

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
primary sources select the checkbox if you want to record PowerPoint or keynote.

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Then on Mac, you can select two secondary video sources.

29
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Select the secondary one or secondary two tabs at the top.

30
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Then select the desired secondary video source from the source dropdown list.

31
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This is where you would select your desktop display for screen capture if desired.

32
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:27,371
Click record when you're ready and stop when you're finished.
