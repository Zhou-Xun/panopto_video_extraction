1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:07,160
And good morning to all of you today.

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:16,870
So we have Dr. John Smith again. She's going to be speaking as well.

3
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:24,230
Who Applied Genomics and work in omics as well.

4
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,290
Was there any question? I don't have anything on my mind.

5
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:37,440
Were there any questions or anything that frightened? Okay.

6
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:49,200
Right. So first I just want to give a shout out to the people who made it here today.

7
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,950
I know, I know it can get really tiring at the end of the semester,

8
00:00:52,950 --> 00:01:00,870
but I think that your dedication and commitment to the to the class will be full really began out for you.

9
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,330
And like you, I just am really, really proud of people who are here.

10
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,110
I especially because I don't I don't think this one's covered on the exam this year.

11
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,890
I mean, I don't know if you know that or not. I don't know. I to emphasize that point.

12
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:29,640
I think you'll like this lecture, though, because this is kind of like I really I really like to give people,

13
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,100
you know, you guys have done so much in the class with, like, the nuts and bolts and, you know, whatever.

14
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:44,669
And, like, this is more like a story. This is a story about, like, how we do what we do with all this guy stuff,

15
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,000
what we do after to us, and how we integrate other types of omics into the work.

16
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,690
And I really could have made I mean, I could do a whole class on this.

17
00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:05,810
Absolutely, for sure. Because there's so much stuff. Once you get past these basics and maybe I'll just make a little shameless plug for episode 516,

18
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,590
which I do, which I normally teach, but I'm not teaching next semester.

19
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:19,290
But it's a it's a genomic epidemiology class and it does some of this stuff that we're going to talk about today.

20
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,130
So that's in the winter semester. So.

21
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:32,579
Yeah. So I, I, I'm just going to give like a little bit of epidemiology on dementia and how we

22
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,719
can kind of use and make epidemiology approach to chronic diseases in general.

23
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,590
Although I think you've got most of this already and then kind of talk about three different pieces.

24
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:50,310
One is the gwas and then, you know, some immediate follow up analyzes that could come from us.

25
00:02:50,730 --> 00:03:00,180
And then an example of Multi-omics investigation in a single gene for for Alzheimer's disease.

26
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:10,260
Okay. So I don't know how familiar you all are with dementia, Alzheimer's disease and things like that.

27
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,899
But when I talk about dementia,

28
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:21,690
I'm really talking about an array of conditions that result in impaired mental ability and that they interfere with the functions of daily life,

29
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,739
including most prominently think in.

30
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:31,350
But it can also be physical and social domains affected as well, especially as dementia progresses.

31
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:39,640
And it's a major problem. About a third of people over age 70 have some form of cognitive impairment or dementia,

32
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,760
and we think about the cognitive impairment sometimes as starting to precede dementia.

33
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,580
So before dementia starts, there's this whole phase where people's cognition begins to decline.

34
00:03:52,290 --> 00:04:01,589
And here you can see this is the prevalence of cognitive impairment per 1000 people and it's divided by age group.

35
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:08,670
And you can see that as people get older they have a much greater risk of dementia, these age related dementia.

36
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:14,879
And that African-American here is in blue, Hispanic and red and whites are in green.

37
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,610
And you can see that there's quite a big health disparity in dementia.

38
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,040
And so it is a major cause of death in the US.

39
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:36,480
It's very, very, very expensive. Even without dementia, even with cognitive impairment preceding dementia or cognitive decline,

40
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,240
there's a lot of costs associated with home care and things like that.

41
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,030
So it's expensive. It's also really hard on families.

42
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:53,100
So there's a lot of work on caretakers for people with dementia and that's actually a public health issue also.

43
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,700
Right, is like the stress on the caretakers.

44
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,999
And so, you know, the U.S. demographics are aging, right?

45
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,440
We have less kids and we have a lot of old people and we just keep getting more.

46
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:15,240
So, as you know, that sort of keeps happening and the public health burden is is shifting quite a lot.

47
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,900
So there's three subtypes of dementia.

48
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:23,520
Well, that's true. There's two major subtypes and then some other ones.

49
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,890
So Alzheimer's disease makes up about 70% of dementia.

50
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,799
In the US, vascular dementia is around 17%.

51
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:40,200
And then there's a whole bunch of other older age mentors like Lewy Body Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia and things like that.

52
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:53,870
Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia are both kind of common enough to look at in bigger populations when you have population based studies.

53
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:04,280
Alzheimer's disease you've probably heard more about. So that one, it is kind of like, well, they're both sort of gradual.

54
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:11,810
Most of the time with a slower progressive decline. Well, actually, let me just start with something else.

55
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,720
Vascular dementia is very strongly related to cardiovascular risk factors.

56
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,420
So vascular dementia is the thing that happens in the brain, in the white matter of the brain.

57
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:33,520
And so this is the the place where the electric signals between your hemispheres, they travel through the white matter, through those axons.

58
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,760
And it actually is something that happens in those areas of the brain.

59
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:52,130
And it is really related to hypertension and it can be related to it to vessel disease in the small vessels in the brain.

60
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:58,280
And so hypertension is one of the major risk factors for vascular dementia and hypertension.

61
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:03,620
It's also a major risk factor for stroke. And stroke can make vascular dementia worse.

62
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,030
So vascular dementia is you don't have to have stroke with it, but stroke is part of it.

63
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:22,910
And so sometimes that can onset really suddenly, whereas Alzheimer's disease is really this buildup of beta amyloid protein and tau protein.

64
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:29,080
And so you get these neurofibrillary tangles from the tau protein and you get beta amyloid plaques.

65
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:35,030
And so that is much more gradual process because that just happens over time.

66
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,970
And so that's why vascular dementia can be a really quick onset because if it's associated with having a stroke,

67
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:51,040
it will be quick, otherwise it can be slower. The vascular dementia also has more physical disturbances.

68
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:57,560
So when you think about that white matter in your brain and what it's doing, it's actually connecting all the parts of your brain.

69
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,579
So there's more domains usually affected immediately with the vascular dementia.

70
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:13,010
So physical domains, executive function, like thinking, it's really more it's really more just like dispersed and distributed.

71
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:24,920
Whereas the Alzheimer's disease, it almost always has people have cognitive features first and especially memory.

72
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,540
Memory is the thing that starts to get affected most with Alzheimer's disease.

73
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,680
And it's that's because it's mostly affects the cortex.

74
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,920
So it's it's like the upper regions of the brain, not that not the signaling parts, but the the thinking parts.

75
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,919
Okay. And both of these can be visible on neuro imaging.

76
00:08:48,920 --> 00:09:00,559
So like MRI. But MRI is definitely much better at detecting subclinical vascular dementia than it is at Alzheimer's disease,

77
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:07,100
because the the MRI related changes are really prominent for vascular dementia.

78
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:15,710
So you hear for vascular dementia, what you see on the MRI is this is like a cross-section of the brain and you're looking down on it.

79
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:23,840
And this part here is like around like the middle here to see like where your

80
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,100
spinal cord and stuff is starting to like come in and your your lower brain.

81
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:35,479
So this part right here where you see all this white stuff, this is what we call white matter,

82
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:45,500
hyper intensity or Lucho of says and it is changes to the blood vessels that actually it's

83
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,030
basically small vessel disease that's a result of that hypertension or even strokes.

84
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,580
So these white pieces that you see here are the subclinical markers of vascular dementia.

85
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:04,410
When we look at Alzheimer's disease, this is like an example of a progressed Alzheimer's disease brain.

86
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,129
So what you see is you like you see shrinking of the cortex.

87
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:12,520
So you could actually just measure brain volume and how it changes over time.

88
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,990
And in people with Alzheimer's disease, it actually gets smaller.

89
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,040
And then you also see it shrinking almost from the inside out.

90
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:28,019
Right. So you also see these enlarged ventricles like these spots that normally like they're these little tiny, tiny,

91
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:35,880
little places in the brain that the brain tissue isn't, that the cortex is shrinking in every direction, so these ventricles get larger.

92
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:43,850
And then I just spent all this time really telling you that, oh, vascular this and Alzheimer's things.

93
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:50,999
But what we know now is that there is a lot of evidence also for for mixing of those effects.

94
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:00,510
So you can have Alzheimer's disease or some subclinical features of that, but you can also have vascular dementia or some vascular disease.

95
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,020
So we still categorize them separately.

96
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:14,830
Alzheimer's disease, like. When you dissect the brains of people that have Alzheimer's disease, like pathology, is pretty prominent.

97
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,350
But you can also see some traces a lot of times of this vascular dementia.

98
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,690
And so a lot of people are really now thinking that that there's a lot there.

99
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,850
There are mixed forms of dementia. Yeah.

100
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:38,370
Do you see the same thing with like CTE, like dementia, like in cognitive, like something more like the structural CTE,

101
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:47,580
like the brain disease that like athletes get from like repeated and oh, so like from concussion.

102
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,850
That I don't know. I don't know what?

103
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,940
What? I've never studied that. So I don't know exactly what that does.

104
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,150
The dementias that I'm talking about are mostly like the older age, like process dimensions,

105
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,979
but there are definitely a lot of forms of like younger age dementias,

106
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:14,290
like there's an HIV associated dementia, there's, you know, like injury associated to mentors and things like that.

107
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,350
So I don't know. I'll have to look into it. That's a great question.

108
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:23,110
Yeah, I don't know much about younger age dementias. Does anybody else have a question?

109
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:30,340
Very good question. Happy to answer questions. Lots of risk factors.

110
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,310
So I talked about most of this already.

111
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:42,700
You know, age, ethnicity, education is also a major risk factor for dementia.

112
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:54,970
So does anybody know sort of like the hypothesized relationship between education and like basically cognition in later life and how how that works,

113
00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:02,990
you know, any theories around that or anything about that? Who do you think is more likely to get dementia?

114
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,580
Somebody who's more educated or less educated? Yeah.

115
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:17,540
Probably more educated cause they're like. Using their brain more like keeping it, not using their brain more, but like more metabolism,

116
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:22,189
like faster, more memory function if you're having to memorize stuff for class.

117
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:27,880
Or maybe that helps keep your brain. Like in shape.

118
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:34,600
So if it's keeping your brain in shape, then do you think it would be more or less likely for you to.

119
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:41,110
Oh, that's right. Exactly. So, like, that's the key here is like the keeping your brain in shape hypotheses.

120
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,170
Right. It's actually called the cognitive reserve theory.

121
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:54,480
So if you have a higher education, you are like I mean, it's not that you're you're using different processes, right?

122
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,910
Like you said, like the memory. Like literacy. Like writing.

123
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,209
You know, you're keeping that keeping those pathways active in your brain.

124
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:09,460
You're also building more connections and pathways in your brain or different kinds.

125
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:19,390
And and it's thought that that will be a buffer against Alzheimer's disease pathology that's happening and or even vascular dementia.

126
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,390
But this is a lot more toward that Alzheimer's, I think,

127
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:30,010
because vascular dementia can be it's a little bit more like if your pathway gets messed up, you're in trouble.

128
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:43,569
But people can have people with higher education can have a lot of the pathology of Alzheimer's disease and not show the effects.

129
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:46,660
And they do think that that's because you formed more connections.

130
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:54,550
You strengthen those connections. And that's why, like, if you ever see I don't know, like sometimes I don't know.

131
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,989
I don't know if you guys get this, but I get this when I'm on Facebook.

132
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:04,540
I know you probably don't use that. Whatever Facebook and I'm like scrolling through and you get those ads or whatever.

133
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:14,109
And I get all the time ads for brain games like, oh, like, you know, staying stay healthy cognitively, like play these brain games.

134
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:22,810
I don't know if it's my demographic, but like that's targeted toward people who are kind of getting older in age and want to

135
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:29,140
like there's so little we can do to fight dementia and Alzheimer's disease specifically.

136
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:34,959
Like there's not good drugs, there's not like you can do exercise and lifestyle modifications,

137
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:44,860
but there's definitely a lot of companies and and scientific support, I think, for keeping your brain active.

138
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,460
And those brain games are a great way to do that, right?

139
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,240
Like just puzzles and logic. So, um, yeah.

140
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:59,500
So that's the piece around education you'll see later when we start going through some of the results

141
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:07,000
that one other thing that people think about education is that people who have high education,

142
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,540
they stay healthy cognitively longer, right?

143
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:17,470
They've got that buffer. But then when they start to drop, sometimes they drop faster because they have further to fall.

144
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:24,489
Right. So if you if you buffered against that pathology, but then it finally starts to overtake you,

145
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:28,090
sometimes people will go faster because they start at a higher point.

146
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:33,580
Is is the thought on that? Okay.

147
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,210
So then you've also got genetics.

148
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,070
So have we talked? Have you talked or do you guys know about Ebola?

149
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:47,020
You talked about Ebola at all. Do you guys know anything about Ebola? You've ever heard of this gene before?

150
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,290
All right. So, April. Oh, somebody was just.

151
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:57,709
Was it Chris Hollingsworth? Is anybody heard this thing about his family?

152
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:02,090
His. Is that his name? I think so. Does anybody heard this in the news?

153
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,060
Chris Hollingsworth, an Alzheimer's disease. You've heard it.

154
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:13,860
So basically what I think happened there is that I think he found out that he has two copies of the Oppo Epsilon four early.

155
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:17,570
Also Oppo E. It's called Apolipoprotein E.

156
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:23,300
So this is the most strong genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease.

157
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,860
So there's there's other genes that will do early onset Alzheimer's disease.

158
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:35,240
So like before age 65, those are very familial and very strong and have high penetrance.

159
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:40,280
APOE is the strongest risk factor for the old age dementia.

160
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:56,480
And so this apolipoprotein is actually the apolipoprotein are a set of proteins that actually sit on lipids, lipid vesicles.

161
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:01,750
So cholesterols, triglycerides, lipids that are moving through your bloodstream.

162
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,830
And they have a receptors, they have receptors on cells.

163
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,890
And so APOE it'll be carrying some cholesterols.

164
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:19,850
It'll find its cellular receptor and it will it'll be involved in what we call cholesterol efflux,

165
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,390
which is the movement of the cholesterol from the vesicles into the cells.

166
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:36,950
And so depending on there's three major appeals for APOE e it's based on two different snips having two different snips.

167
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:43,240
And oh, I think I talked about this before in the last lecture. So there's E2 two, three and four Epsilon two, three and four.

168
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:48,770
Remember we talked about that with heart disease. Well, it also is related to dementia and.

169
00:18:50,190 --> 00:19:01,080
If you have the E-4 alone, you have about 2 to 3 depending on the population, times the risk of dementia, Alzheimer's disease specifically.

170
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:06,660
Then if you don't have a need for a meal and if you have two copies of the eat for a Leo,

171
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,020
the risk is like 10 to 12 times higher than the general population.

172
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:19,110
That doesn't. Then people who don't have a copy of you for now, you if you have any to that's actually protective.

173
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,440
So that can help modify if you have any to eat for.

174
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:31,440
But if you have two copies of E4, it is in no way a doom or a death sentence or anything like that, but you are at much higher risk.

175
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:37,050
So I think that's what just happened with Chris Helmsley and his family.

176
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:43,110
So aside from it, though, there's also a lot of other genetics that come into play.

177
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,790
So just like any other disease, we've got chronic disease.

178
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:52,170
We've got this array of genetic risk factors, right? Bad boys like heavy hitter.

179
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:57,360
Okay. Everything else you probably already know.

180
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:07,200
Stress and social and cognitive engagement have started to come into play as supplementary risk factors to things like genetics and.

181
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:13,600
And cardiovascular disease. So. A lot of the work that, you know,

182
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:19,200
I've kind of done around this in the last ten years has been more like thinking about developing

183
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,480
new biomarkers and understanding molecular mechanisms of kind of what's going on here.

184
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,950
So I just spent all this okay in there, right? So I'll just go through this one first.

185
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:36,810
Only the epidemiology of chronic disease. I think you guys have seen something like this before, right, for when you talked about epigenetics.

186
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:45,390
So basically, we've got genomics, we've got millions, 100 million mutations.

187
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:51,959
Or like the whole DNA sequence, you could be you can have snippets, you can have rare variants which are like snips.

188
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:59,880
But the minor little is really, really rare, maybe less than 1% or even less than point 1%.

189
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:07,589
You got the DNA methylation markers in the epigenome, which you all know about now and then transcripts.

190
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,920
And so the transcripts are the expression of the genes. Right.

191
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:16,640
These are this is actually like if you measure in a cell this morning.

192
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,850
Right. So how do all these pieces fit together?

193
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:30,340
You know, you can have effects at each of these levels on chronic diseases and the social factors also come into play.

194
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:40,430
So the two ways that they really, I think are most important are going through the epigenome, which is what you guys learned about before.

195
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:50,550
I think the social influences on the epigenome that then affect the chronic diseases, but they also can modify genetic effects.

196
00:21:50,880 --> 00:22:01,660
So so for example. We just finished a presentation yesterday on some work that we're doing in.

197
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,310
Wait. No, never mind. Oh, yeah. Sorry. My mind got switched.

198
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:13,240
Epigenome from an at some work that we're doing in India where we're looking at genetics of

199
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:22,540
of cognition and Alzheimer's disease and especially where we had been looking at 8.8 and 8.4,

200
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,489
really all because it's such a major risk factor in every population.

201
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:30,110
So when we got our whole genome sequence data, the first thing we did was we were like,

202
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:36,739
Oh, what's the relationship between E4 and cognitive function in India?

203
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:44,780
And we found the relationship that we expected, but kind of and I won't say like unexpectedly, but kind of interestingly,

204
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:55,909
I guess we found that in people with lower education that E4 will had a stronger effect only in women.

205
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:00,350
We don't know why that is, but thinking about the social, for example,

206
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:10,760
so having like a lot of people aren't even literate or they've had no education and for them the E4 l'oeil is having a stronger effect.

207
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,260
So that's a modification between a social factor and a genomic factor.

208
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:25,970
That's an interaction, right? And people who had higher education, they still had E4 was still associated with lower cognition, but not as strong.

209
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:30,990
So it can kind of influence us into different ways, the social factors.

210
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:36,840
All right. Any questions before I dive into some of the results that we've had?

211
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:45,850
Okay. So first I'm just going to tell you, I can just breeze through a little bit.

212
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:52,400
What we found through G was because I want to give you the background to be able to understand what we do after g loss.

213
00:23:52,850 --> 00:24:03,680
Okay. So we've done a lot of G was one of the first things we did was in 2015 and oh, I must have uploaded the wrong slides I think had changed us.

214
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,909
No worries. Now it's like I don't. Well, this was a job talk.

215
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:12,770
So I'm like, you guys don't need to know that I was doing stuff for us. So I took that off.

216
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,720
I don't know what happened. I'll figure it out later.

217
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:23,959
So one of the first things we did was looking at white matter, hyper intensity, and this has a really high heritability.

218
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:33,620
So this this blood pressure related trait and small vessel disease, really a trait that has a higher heritability.

219
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,860
So we know it's has a genetic component. Right.

220
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:42,500
And we did G was in 29 cohorts, 21,000 people.

221
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,410
It was a multi-ethnic sample, which was actually pretty novel for the time.

222
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:55,370
Most people were still doing European ancestry only. So we did that but looked at white matter, hyper intensity.

223
00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:00,379
How much did you have in your brain? And this is the results that we had.

224
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:05,270
We had four different gene regions that met genome wide significance.

225
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:10,669
And you can see like there was a lot of support for I looks like a lot of snips and lda under some

226
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:18,500
of these peaks and so we looked into that further and what were the pathways that were affected?

227
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:26,360
Right. How do we start to put these pieces together? Well, one pathway or whatnot, this isn't a pathway analysis.

228
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:33,440
So let me rephrase one. We looked at these four genes and what they had been associated with previously.

229
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:43,550
And so one thing that we found was that the there was at least a few of them that were associated with cell death and cell growth.

230
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,660
So glioma is a cancer of the glial cells.

231
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,580
And cancer, as you know, is a is a cell growth gone wrong?

232
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,540
Right. Also, apoptosis is cell is programed, cell death.

233
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:07,970
So you've got at least a couple three different of these genes that actually were related to cellular growth and death.

234
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,100
So that was really interesting.

235
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:19,100
And with the small vessel disease kind of hypothesis, it sort of makes sense that, you know, the cells are not growing and dying as they should be.

236
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,530
Another thing was that at least two of these genes that were associated with Alzheimer's disease,

237
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:34,010
and that was probably a little surprising because this is a white matter, hyper intensity MRI, you know, very vascular study.

238
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,479
But it turns out that, you know, there is that mixed dementia.

239
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,540
And so we were kind of seeing some crosstalk between what we found hearing and what people had found for Alzheimer's disease.

240
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,770
And here's the beta amyloid pathways. That's ad also.

241
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:53,810
Right. And then the other thing was it was inflammation, neuroinflammation,

242
00:26:54,170 --> 00:27:04,280
which was something that we kind of expected because like inflammatory processes are a very big part of the cardiovascular disease pathways too.

243
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:14,150
So that was not surprising. And then I wanted to this is like just a little bit of like when you do it,

244
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:17,990
you ask there's all these follow up studies and I know you guys did that as part of your assignment.

245
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:29,090
So like the follow up pieces here where we started to pull and other sources of information were things like the snips that we found.

246
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:35,690
What did we think they do to the proteins that they're in? So there's a couple of different ways that you can look at this.

247
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:43,099
Actually, a couple there's like 300 different annotations now for when you find a genetic variant,

248
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,810
what do we think it does to the protein and what do we think it does? It's like the regulatory stuff around it.

249
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,280
This is just giving you two examples. Polly Fen is a popular thing.

250
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:58,670
This one looks at the the sequence of the protein and the sequence of the DNA,

251
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:07,100
and it tries to actually figure out how your mutation or your step will change the 3D structure of the protein.

252
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:16,519
So even if it's well, if it's a MISSENSE mutation, it's going to change that protein structure.

253
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:16,819
Right?

254
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:23,510
And so it kind of can give you some information about whether they think it'll be damaging to the protein a little bit damaging or not damaging.

255
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:30,710
And then another way to kind of look at this is through looking at evolutionary conservation.

256
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:37,640
So if you have a mutation in a very important gene that's present in.

257
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:46,710
A lot of different species. You can you can see in that gene across species.

258
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,410
Is the snap that you're looking at. Is it almost always the same across species?

259
00:28:53,430 --> 00:29:02,850
So for example, in humans, if you have a major oil T and a rare variant that is like a minor overhaul A and you

260
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:08,730
look at all the other species and they all have t as like their major oil there,

261
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:16,620
then it's highly conserved across species and and change in that might have a bigger problem than if it's not conserved across species.

262
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,909
Does that make sense? So so that's another way we kind of looked at it.

263
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:25,830
We did find that some of these were predicted, damaging or highly conserved.

264
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:33,359
And then another thing is to look at its effect on omics. Right? We saw that picture of omics where it's genetics to epigenetics, to transcriptomics.

265
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,960
So do these steps even affect gene expression? Right.

266
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:45,239
So this was a hard thing to do back in 2015 because the databases that we had of snip effects on

267
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,870
gene expression in different tissues were really small and now they've started to get bigger.

268
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:55,169
So you guys, at the very beginning of the class talked about the ENCODE project and you learned that

269
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:59,670
part of that project was trying to map the relationship between snips and gene expression,

270
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:12,840
right? And a bunch of different cell types. So we looked there and found that that there are kind of they are in regulatory regions and.

271
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:18,690
I guess I didn't talk here about the gene expression part, but the encode,

272
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:26,629
do you remember they match those regulatory regions and all these different cell types and that some of these steps were in those regulatory regions.

273
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:34,600
So they might be important for gene expression. We didn't look directly at the gene expression, which we did later for other studies.

274
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,480
So we did find some regulatory strips there.

275
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:50,140
Then if we have a guess on pathology, we should also have a next step as it was on cognition and cognitive function, right?

276
00:30:50,710 --> 00:31:01,050
So we did that. And so cognitive function is also pretty heritable and it changes in heritability as you grow across the lifespan.

277
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:06,610
So they find stronger genetic effects in childhood and then and in older adulthood.

278
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:13,389
And in the middle it's sort of more an environment like there's still genetics, but it's more environment.

279
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:21,250
So as you're building your cognitive function, that relies a lot on genes and as you're losing it, that's has more reliance on genes.

280
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:27,890
So we looked at fluid cognitive function in multiple domains like memory, reasoning,

281
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:35,349
processing, speed, how fast you think spatial ability is and just general executive function.

282
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:39,969
Like how well can you how well do you know your surroundings?

283
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:45,820
How well can you kind of process information and all of these are positively correlated with each other.

284
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,240
And we looked at this was kind of an older age, you ask.

285
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,379
We actually have a new one that came out, I think in 2018 or 2019,

286
00:31:53,380 --> 00:32:02,140
but it's similar in that we looked at European ancestry and we took this general cognitive function,

287
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,320
which was a principal component analysis of these different domains.

288
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:16,600
So across all of these different studies, we took various tests of neural cognition because all the studies have different tests.

289
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:24,969
So we required at least three three domains to be three different domains.

290
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:29,440
And then we took basically the summary of those three domains.

291
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:34,690
Right. And we're actually doing this again in top metaphor.

292
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:42,639
Our whole genome sequence data for us led a lot of that and we've worked together on that because this is just gwas.

293
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:49,750
But now we're doing it in sequence data. So for this one, we found three different genes.

294
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,329
It did seem to be very poorly genic, so it seemed like a lot of genes were involved.

295
00:32:55,330 --> 00:33:00,250
And that's one of the reason why we actually expanded it and did a bigger study in 28 and 19.

296
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:07,810
But just even from this relatively small study, we saw a bogey popping to the top, just like we expected.

297
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:12,360
And then we had these other things going on.

298
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:18,580
So one thing was that we found a gene that had already been associated with educational attainment.

299
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,400
Right. Because all these pieces are working together.

300
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:31,809
So if it's if you have snips in that gene that sort of increase your educational attainment through whatever means,

301
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:37,810
right, maybe you're better at school, maybe you're more likely to stick around and do things like however that happens.

302
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:49,809
It also is probably holding that relationship will also result in a higher general cognitive function because education is related to that.

303
00:33:49,810 --> 00:34:01,780
So there's that pathway come in. And we also found stuff, other things for aid and brain development and also bipolar disorder.

304
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:06,970
So different psychiatric pieces that might be related to cognitive function as well.

305
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:16,060
And then here I want to point out this is a micro RNA, which is another kind of epigenetics, really.

306
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:23,020
And I think you might have talked about it, but it basically interferes with messenger RNA a lot of times.

307
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:30,280
So there's micro RNA and then this one is also regulating DNA methylation.

308
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:36,669
So we start to see hints that some of these genes have very regulatory function.

309
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:46,030
So it's not the protein and it's necessarily what it's doing in the brain biological pathways.

310
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,400
But but it's also regulating other things.

311
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:56,890
So the other thing I want to point out is that the genes that we found for cognition show a lot of overlap between

312
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:06,760
pathological brain aging like Alzheimer's disease and normal brain aging because this sample did not have dementia.

313
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:14,080
So this is like aging, older age, age, general cognitive function in older age without dementia.

314
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:20,740
So this is where we looked at the impact of steps on gene expression and all these different databases.

315
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:29,020
So there's this database called G text and it's a big database of the relationship between snips and gene expression and a bunch of.

316
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:34,489
Different cell types. And we didn't find anything there.

317
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:45,709
But but in our other choices, we definitely found because we had, I think it was like 140,000 people and we had like over 100 heads.

318
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:52,160
So we had a lot of different genes we identified and some of them were definitely associated with expression in brain tissue.

319
00:35:54,620 --> 00:36:00,529
And then the biological pathways were cell cycle, cell death and survival.

320
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:12,469
And so we're still seeing a lot of that cellular death and survival in the genes that were near the top but didn't reach genome wide significant.

321
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,920
So that's kind of a tie back to what we saw in the vascular dementia.

322
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,589
And this was a really cool analysis that I don't really see much, honestly.

323
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:30,390
And you ask where they took all of the cohorts that had contributed to this duals and they actually

324
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:38,620
each of these lives on here is a cohort and they put the they ranged them by average age.

325
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:43,290
So along this X axis, this is the average age of the cohort.

326
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:52,260
So keep in mind, there could be a lot of variability in cohorts like if it's a birth cohort, they're all going to be age 65 or whatever.

327
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:56,069
But like General, our study could be from 45 to 90.

328
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:58,320
So there could be a lot of variability within each cohort,

329
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:10,020
but they just put the average age of the cohort and then they plotted the effect size estimate for for one of these genes in our snips.

330
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,879
And in April e this is not the E for all.

331
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:22,110
We'll it's probably a it's like a what we call like a proxy snap where it's in high linkage disequilibrium with E4.

332
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:29,160
But E4 was very, very, very hard to measure on chips and G was chips, so we couldn't get good data on it a lot of times.

333
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:39,750
So this is like a proxy for E4. And what you can see here is that the E4 effect is actually increasing in strength in these older cohorts.

334
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:44,040
So it's having a more negative effect on cognition as you get older.

335
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:56,580
Okay. Any questions? All right. So then we we did the job as a cognitive function.

336
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,660
Maybe we should do that. You ask for all these individual components, right?

337
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:06,900
Because cognitive, general cognitive function is such a messy phenotype and all the cohorts measured it differently.

338
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:12,630
So then we went in and tried to do ones for memory, for processing speech or executive function and all these other things.

339
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:22,990
And just I'll tell you just a minute about that one with memory, because this is one of the key things for Alzheimer's disease.

340
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,350
And we did find we we had 30,000 people.

341
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:32,520
So now we're actually getting into the range where it's hard to find stuff.

342
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:38,790
And us a lot of times it sounds like a lot of people it's not really that many people for us.

343
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,210
And we basically found the 8040 again,

344
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:52,320
increasing effects with age and we had some suggestive genes that were linked to expression in the hippocampus and cortex,

345
00:38:52,320 --> 00:39:03,899
which are the major age related brain structural places and also involved in immune system dysfunction.

346
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:15,209
And they really do think that, well, there is a kind of a theory where Epley in the brain functions as the lipid transporter.

347
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:23,430
So it's involved in that lipid stuff but also has like this link to inflammation and immunity in the brain.

348
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,800
Okay so that's some give us for you.

349
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:38,640
So now we've done all this work in gas and we've got gene regions that have been identified for cognitive function or right or related traits.

350
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:44,879
So there's a bunch of different ways that you can kind of use these results.

351
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,450
So one thing is, do we want to know something about it in the big picture so we can estimate molecular heritability,

352
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:57,000
we can go deep and do some gene based analysis using these regions that we've found.

353
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,530
We can go broad and do genetic risk scores.

354
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:06,330
And so like summary measures of what we found in these G was results.

355
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:13,260
And then we can do something functional and study it like the genetic effects on the epigenome and transcriptome and how that all works together.

356
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:20,100
And then the social factors are going to come into play in any of these possible places.

357
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:27,840
So we had a grant with Jessica Fall at ICR, which I think is she come and give a guest lecture for you.

358
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:37,170
Did they watch it? Not just. So I think in EP at 516 she comes to give a guest lecture.

359
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:43,440
So she's really fantastic. She works with with me on the health and retirement.

360
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,099
Sorry, I don't know if you guys have ever heard of that, but I'll talk about it in a second.

361
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:54,389
But we had this grant where we were like taking in regions that were identified for normal function

362
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:59,670
and pathological brain aging so that things like our general cognitive function and memory,

363
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:03,690
but also Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, white matter, hyper intensity.

364
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:11,400
So basically all that you are I just told you about plus Alzheimer's disease and kind of looking at this arm over here where we were looking at,

365
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:18,120
you know, the molecular heritability and some other things and how did X modify those effects?

366
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,930
So I don't need to go into this.

367
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:29,129
I think you kind of get the innovation and the in the pieces.

368
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:35,940
But we used we used you us chip DNA and we had common variations and we had rare variants.

369
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:40,860
And so the rare variants were from the axon chip. So this is a chip.

370
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:47,189
A G was a chip that was developed to take mostly things like missense and loss of

371
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:55,020
function variants and other potentially regulatory variants within the exons.

372
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,090
And so this is just the part of the genome that codes for proteins.

373
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:03,030
So we ignored the other 98% of the genome.

374
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:10,650
So this chip just has known rare variants that are in the axon, but they're more likely to be functional, right, because they're in the axon.

375
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,580
And we use the Health and Retirement study,

376
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:23,250
which is the largest nationally representative longitudinal study of Americans over 50, and it has about 20,000 people.

377
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:26,459
They run it every two years.

378
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:37,740
People get interviewed. It's been going on since 1992, so for the last 30 years and they re put new cohorts in as people die and age out.

379
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:41,250
Well, they age out when they die, they die. They don't get it.

380
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:49,860
So then when we followed them for a long time, so this is a super rich resource if you're ever interested in doing anything related to cognition.

381
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:59,850
And then they also have really rich socioeconomic data because they also are there's a lot of economists that are

382
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:05,970
very interested in studying like things like retirement wealth and like so they got all kinds of stuff there.

383
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:17,220
They also have genomics. They just recently got epigenomic and transcriptomic data on 4000 people, which is a lot, you know, relatively.

384
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:22,410
And they have Medicare records and it's just crazy. So very good study.

385
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:29,310
What we did first was we looked at trajectories of cognitive decline.

386
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:37,920
So every two years these people get memory tests and we use a couple of different modeling

387
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:44,879
techniques to see what the best model was with these cognitive trajectories over time.

388
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:54,750
So this is just an example. This is in European ancestry and the average number of time points that people in this study had was eight time points.

389
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:59,400
And these are four different ways that we tried to estimate the trajectory.

390
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:06,180
So one was just linear, like if you just draw a line across that, what does it look like over time?

391
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:14,430
Quadratic is sort of with the curve, just one curve cubic can have multiple curves and then a spine model,

392
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:21,180
which is where you have these knots where you have a linear and then at the spine, it could be a different slope after that.

393
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:25,800
So the spine model fit the data the best.

394
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:33,840
So that had a slope that was basically before age 80 and after age 80.

395
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:40,560
And it had this kink right here where you can see like there was some kind of decline in cognitive function.

396
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:46,870
And then after 80 it really went down fast for our modeling.

397
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:55,920
We ended up using the linear function which is here in blue, because it pretty well approximates what's going on even with this spine model.

398
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:01,080
And we well, I'll show you another thing with the spine model in a second,

399
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:07,709
but we ended up using the linear one we estimated like cognitive performance,

400
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:11,940
like a general estimate of overall cognitive performance we took at age 65.

401
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:16,230
And then the decline over time, we took it as a linear slope.

402
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:21,330
So we're estimating cognitive performance and cognitive decline.

403
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,909
And the first thing we did was look at molecular heritability.

404
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:31,110
So that's the heritability. It's basically the variance of the.

405
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:36,230
It explained by genetic factors and cognitive function.

406
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:45,640
In general, cognitive function has a heritability of about 50 to 80% in this age group, but molecular heritability is only about 2025 to 28%.

407
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:51,700
And that's because when you estimate molecular heritability, so you're not looking at families,

408
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:55,690
you're just looking at individual people and how closely related they are to each other.

409
00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:03,040
You might not capture all the effects of, first of all, unmeasured genetic variation like rare variants.

410
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:06,459
This is a loss. So we can also look at common variants.

411
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,530
So you won't see as many rare variants.

412
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:17,580
And you can't you can't look at things like at the states when you have, you know, two steps that are interacting or gene environment interaction.

413
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:25,179
So, so the heritability is lower and you can also partition heritability.

414
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:33,370
So you can look at, for example, you can take all the genes that we found related to Alzheimer's disease and cognitive function.

415
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:38,050
And you can look at how much of the heritability is due to those genes versus other genes.

416
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,990
So we did that, but I don't think I have the results in here.

417
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:57,790
We did look at heritability and found that with our linear model in European ancestry and in African ancestry, we found that the slope or I'm sorry,

418
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,010
the intercept at age 65 or that cognitive performance was heritable with about

419
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:06,159
the effect that we would expect maybe a little lower than we would expect.

420
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:16,120
But this again was g stayed up and then in the spine model we also saw heritability of that cognitive performance,

421
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:22,719
but we didn't see as much with the cognitive decline. That's the slope here in African ancestry.

422
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:27,129
We did see a little bit of heritability in the slope, not as much as in European ancestry.

423
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:30,670
So it didn't really stop us.

424
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:40,930
We still started looking for, you know, genetics that were related to the slope, but maybe it's not as heritable as the average cognitive performance.

425
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:44,800
And there was a whole bunch of different stuff that we did later.

426
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:55,030
Then we tried to do gene based analysis. So this is to see if they have.

427
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:07,160
Okay. So we have all these steps that we've found through these various guises.

428
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:13,940
And sometimes the genes overlap, and sometimes the snips may or may not overlap between,

429
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,810
you know, even if the same gene like in vivo is a bad example.

430
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:23,720
Tom Ford is in the oppo e region. It has independent effects on Alzheimer's disease,

431
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:29,560
but there are different snips that might be related to Alzheimer's disease versus cognition versus something else.

432
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:35,270
Right. So we wanted to and especially because we had rare variants,

433
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:45,110
an excellent look at the combined effects of genetic variation across the entire gene region, not just the snips that had been identified in Gwas.

434
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:50,750
And another reason for that is because we had we had an interest in looking at African

435
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:57,020
ancestry individuals and most of the G was had been done in whites and European ancestry.

436
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:07,430
So these kind of techniques examine both common and rare variation together and look at all of the genetics of the gene as a whole.

437
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:12,379
So there's two kinds of tests that are used one. One are called non burden tests.

438
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:17,480
And so this is going to be scat is one of the main things, even though it's a weird name.

439
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:23,059
And it tests for like variability in the genetics across the whole gene region.

440
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:28,580
Is it related to your trait of interest? And that other thing is called a burden test.

441
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:36,260
And so this is like making a baby genetic risk score and looking for cumulative effects across that gene region.

442
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:47,180
So the scat analysis, this is like a very short like explanation,

443
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:51,440
but basically you've got your outcome like cognitive function as the Y variable here.

444
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:58,900
This is just a linear model. You've got all your covariates and your adjustment variables and then you have

445
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:05,920
a vector of beta coefficients that correspond to each snip in the gene region.

446
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:12,110
So it's just like a g loss where you estimate an effect size for the snip and its association with cognition.

447
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:19,430
But instead you're doing it in a model with all your snips in there and you've got your your vector of beta coefficients here.

448
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:27,110
And then you look at that vector and you test whether it's more or less variable than you would expect, basically.

449
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:33,080
And if you find that there's more variability in those beta estimates than you would expect based on chance alone,

450
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:37,930
then that's a significant test for that gene region. That's the long and short of it.

451
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:42,680
You don't need to know all the details, but I'm happy to happily tell them to you after class if you want.

452
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:52,220
And so we did that and we found that this gene cluster was associated with memory.

453
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:57,440
And this is a Zoom plot of of the single step effects.

454
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:07,370
And this are as 10119 is up here in purple and that's one that's a good proxy for E4 that we saw previously.

455
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:13,579
So when we look at this gene cluster,

456
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:23,870
we do see that both common and rare variants in European ancestry are pretty strongly associated with with our cognitive,

457
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:31,040
our measure of memory, both the performance, the intercept and the slope.

458
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:36,170
After you correct for the age at 65, the cognitive performance.

459
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:44,510
We didn't really see that and we didn't see it strongly. But in fact, there for this particular gene, I think it was a little bit surprising.

460
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:54,440
But I don't remember when we looked at just the E4 variant or just that one snap, I think we still saw an effect in African ancestry,

461
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:59,720
but when you tested it in the gene region as a whole, it wasn't strong enough to to make that significant.

462
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:05,260
Okay. And then the other way that we did it was through broadened testing.

463
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:12,129
So this is basically creating a mini genetic risk score in the Igbo gene or in other genes.

464
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:18,310
But for example, in ACO e by just summing up the number of rare minor levels that the person had.

465
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:27,430
So let's say there's like ten rare variants in the region, and you could have either one or two of the minor levels at each of those.

466
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:30,900
And so it's the score theoretically from 0 to 20 for each person.

467
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:34,150
How many minor oils do you carry? Great. Just a baby genetic risk score.

468
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:38,970
And then that's like the cumulative burden of mutations in the gene, right?

469
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:43,450
It's a way of making a summary variable from that genetic information because we

470
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:48,249
can't really test each of those rare variants individually because it's too rare.

471
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:52,820
We don't have the power. So I don't know why I did that this way.

472
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:58,299
I hate when I do that. Okay. So this is the graph where we actually are.

473
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:06,490
All right. Let me try. Okay. This is the graph where we actually we're looking at this social by genetic interaction.

474
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:16,629
Okay. Just like I told you about we did in the Indian study here, we are looking at the less than high school or high school education.

475
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:21,970
So this is basically having a high school degree and whether or not they had.

476
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:32,479
Pretty low burden so that the genetic risk score of rare variants in April was pretty low.

477
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:37,250
It was probably like zero or 0 to 1 rarer variant and or a high.

478
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:41,250
I don't remember where we did the cutoff, but. Okay.

479
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:43,010
Low burden and high burden.

480
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:55,079
So if you just look at people with less than high school in a low ed vote, this is their cognitive trajectory, less than high school and high.

481
00:53:55,080 --> 00:54:03,200
Avery, they are just a little bit lower in their age at 65 cognitive performance.

482
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:09,200
But you can see that after age 80, that's my model is saying that they do decrease quicker.

483
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:15,570
Right. If you look at people who have a high school degree right off the top there,

484
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:25,669
they can recall like two more out of two more words on a word recall test out of 15 then people without high school.

485
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:27,770
So across this whole entire region,

486
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:35,480
you can see that the high school performers are doing better than both groups that don't have a high school degree.

487
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:49,160
That's the education effect. Right. But then when you have AP, Ebert and you actually the people who have a high burden tend to have this bigger drop.

488
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:56,149
And, you know, with the modeling, it also kind of looks like they're a little bit higher at age 65.

489
00:54:56,150 --> 00:55:04,040
But I don't think like I don't know that those differences here between these groups are significant, but they definitely have a bigger fall.

490
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:14,119
And so in that study, it was like, okay, well, when you have these higher burden of variance and growing, you do tend to decline faster.

491
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:24,920
Like you, if you had a high school education like the elbow burden pushes you down faster when you start to fall.

492
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:30,110
So, so that was kind of looking at that gene by social factor interaction piece.

493
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:37,910
Does that make sense? Another thing that we looked at were genetic risk scores.

494
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:42,680
So I think you guys understand this concept maybe.

495
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:49,969
But so the genetic risk score is really just if you do a G loss and you get your

496
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:54,670
beta estimate or your effect sizes for each of the snips across the whole genome.

497
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,710
Right? Then you have a new sample.

498
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:08,269
You can take what you can take people's genetics at those snips and weighted by the effect sizes found in the genes.

499
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:17,180
And you can basically create a score of genetic risk for a certain disease within your sample, even if you never measured that disease.

500
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:27,530
Right. So we took, for example, all this stuff that had been identified for Alzheimer's disease and their effect estimates.

501
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:35,210
And in our sample, for each of us, in people who never had dementia, we could create their genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease.

502
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:46,050
And so we did some work around that. And then we also did a study, which I'm going to tell you now about,

503
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:54,810
about dementia and each of us using that same kind of cumulative genetic risk score for Alzheimer's disease.

504
00:56:56,250 --> 00:57:06,870
So what we did here was we were really interested in whether we know APOE e Epsilon four is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.

505
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,629
But we're also wondering,

506
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:17,220
like from these 80 G was if we take out APOE4 and the whole region around APOE e because there's a lot of stuff going on in there.

507
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,090
Does the rest of the genome its cumulative risk for Alzheimer's disease?

508
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:27,930
Does that actually help us predict who is going to get dementia and cognitive impairment?

509
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:33,600
And so what they did is they looked at people in the US.

510
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:43,740
And in each wave they assigned, whether they thought people had dementia based on an algorithm that was developed previously.

511
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:56,790
So they, they found about 724 European ancestry participants who had dementia, 271 African ancestry.

512
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:01,990
They also had these different categories.

513
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:06,460
So like cognitive impairment or dementia and borderline cognitive impairment, no dementia.

514
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,800
So they said like people who you can't really say for sure what they're doing.

515
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:16,620
And then they had cognitively normal people. So people who never looked at any wave like they had dementia.

516
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,080
And in looking at the sample sizes, I mean, you can see that it's not huge.

517
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:29,670
It's like 5700 to like 700 cases, controls versus cases, basically.

518
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:36,689
And so they created apologetic score from an 80 gwas that was conducted in European

519
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:41,580
ancestry participants and they excluded those APOE e snips and that whole region.

520
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:51,950
And then we were looking at the Bogey Epsilon four carriers first.

521
00:58:51,990 --> 00:59:04,830
So we found similar effect estimates that we would expect in the relationship between Epsilon four oleo and odds of dementia.

522
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:08,429
So the odds ratio was between two and three.

523
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:15,270
So about. So people who have an E4 will have 2 to 3 times the risk of developing dementia compared to people who don't.

524
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,340
So that was consistent with the literature.

525
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:32,060
And then we looked at if you take the Alzheimer's disease, polygenic score and you go up one standard deviation in that score based on our sample.

526
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:37,620
So we all we've got this some distribution of polygenic scores in our sample.

527
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:48,959
And if you go from like the midpoint up, one standard deviation that was associated with about 10% increase in risk for dementia.

528
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,410
So a 1.1 odds ratio, it wasn't, it was like.

529
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:58,700
Just significant at the 95% confidence level, not significant in African ancestry.

530
00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:08,160
So what you see is like you do still see the genetic effects after accounting for E4, but it's definitely not as pronounced.

531
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,870
It's not even like all of the other genes in the genome are even as big of a risk factor as E4.

532
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:26,160
This thing about this that's kind of hard sometimes with genetics, it's like just because you find something, can it help you clinically?

533
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:35,240
Like, is it predictive? After accounting for regular like clinical covariates and here are the answer is like it's not that great.

534
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:42,270
So if you you have like some I don't know if you guys have seen this before in the area under the curve,

535
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:45,330
it looks at the sensitivity and specificity of prediction models.

536
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:58,220
But basically what they're saying is that there's a whole bunch of covariates that can predict dementia pretty well, like age, sex, ISIS, right.

537
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:00,060
Like that, you know, cardiovascular.

538
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:14,190
You can you can do some pretty good prediction adding apoe e and this sample increased prediction in increase area under the curve

539
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:25,320
somewhat but you know I don't think I don't think any of this was like there was significant differences between the two models.

540
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:34,229
I do think, though, that this might be a little bit biased because the lingo we are algorithm is it's predicting dementia.

541
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:38,580
It's not like we're measuring it like it's not a clinical diagnosis.

542
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:43,650
And the way that they do that is by using a lot of these covariates.

543
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:54,180
So we might be like. With the covariant model here might do better in the US than it would in a clinical prediction of dementia sample.

544
01:01:54,480 --> 01:02:01,650
So what we really should have done is look at our dementia cases and look look at their Medicaid

545
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:06,000
records and compare and see whether they had a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or not.

546
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:11,280
So it might do a little bit better than this, but we weren't seeing any clinical improvement.

547
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:17,670
Okay. Any questions on that? Before I switch gears for the last thing I want to talk about?

548
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:24,540
All right, you guys still with me? Okay. It's a lot.

549
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:30,180
Okay. Last story. This is a little bit different.

550
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:35,219
It's a different sample. It's a different way of looking at things.

551
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:44,130
But this study is one that we literally just had published maybe just a month ago and.

552
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:56,880
I like it because it shows how to integrate genetics, epigenetics and transcriptomics in just a single gene.

553
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:02,070
To try to look at different pieces around what might be going on, like in a regulatory sense.

554
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:07,710
It's not the cleanest story ever, but it's ours.

555
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:14,320
And I like it. Okay, so there's Gene ABC7.

556
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:22,440
An African ancestry is the largest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, aside from apoe e,

557
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:32,970
and it actually has a comparable slightly less but relatively comparable effect size to Apr e Epsilon four.

558
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:43,770
So. So this gene specifically has been really looked at in African ancestry because although it's not it's not a typo,

559
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:48,450
it still has a pretty big effect in some African ancestry cohort.

560
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:56,850
So this is just a a G was the AGC is the Alzheimer's Disease Genomics Consortium.

561
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:01,350
That's where we do all our work, like with the sequencing and everything.

562
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:08,790
So they have like these huge studies and they're looking right now in the ABC7 gene region right here

563
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:16,379
and in gray is the effect sizes for whites for some of these snips in pink is for African-Americans.

564
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:23,970
And you can see the effect size and even the p value is a lot lower for African-Americans than it is for whites in this region.

565
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:36,030
So it just has a stronger effect. And and there's also some snips that are specific to the African ancestry that tend to have big effects.

566
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:46,319
And so this is also a lipid homeostasis protein and people think it's responsible for AP processing.

567
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:55,889
So that's that's related to some of the this is also related to some of the early onset

568
01:04:55,890 --> 01:05:05,430
dementia is HBP and then clearance of the amyloid beta protein and so in and apoptotic cells.

569
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:09,420
So this is clearance of the amyloid beta once this cell dies.

570
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:14,549
So this is sort of where the cell death piece comes in and it's related to the amyloid beta.

571
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:19,440
It's like when a cell dies, you got to get that stuff out or it just sticks in the brain.

572
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,030
And that's how those plaques can formed.

573
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:35,659
And so the this was one of my students on her dissertation aim was to examine whether genetic and epigenetic variation in the ABC7

574
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:44,990
gene region or their interactions were associated with cognitive function in older African-Americans who do not have dementia.

575
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:48,590
So we kind of know this relationship to dementia,

576
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:58,430
but we don't know if it's related to normal cognitive function or cognitive function prior to the dementia diagnosis.

577
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:07,340
Right. And we don't really know how the genetics and epigenetics work together or could possibly be interacting.

578
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:12,410
So this we used our our Genoa cohort.

579
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:18,040
This is siblings that had hypertension prior to age 60.

580
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:23,420
These are all siblings, in fact, in families that had a high proportion of hypertensive.

581
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:32,900
And we examined them at multiple timepoints about five years apart. We used about 1800 African-Americans from Jackson, Mississippi, for this analysis.

582
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:41,450
And there's lots of other data in Genoa, but I won't go into it right now, just to give you a little bit of timeline.

583
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:46,680
We had three different phases of Genoa during this O.C.

584
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:51,710
They enrolled in 1995 to 2000.

585
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:54,650
So this was our enrollment time period for the first wave.

586
01:06:55,070 --> 01:07:03,490
And during that time, we collected blood samples and we got DNA methylation measured on their blood samples.

587
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:06,680
So this is the epigenetic data collection was here at phase one.

588
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:20,530
And then after phase one, starting in 2001, we collected we did this study called Gambie, where we collected cognitive and structural brain measures.

589
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:25,370
So this was like measures of cognitive function and the white matter, hyper intensity and things like that.

590
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:30,260
And then we also had gene expression.

591
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:35,930
So our gene expression is not ideal. It comes from transformed beta lymphocytes.

592
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:41,270
So we took a blood sample at some point in time, usually around phase two,

593
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:52,040
and we used a Epstein-Barr virus transformation on those cells and beta lymphocytes specifically,

594
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:55,960
which are one of the white blood cell types and immortalize them.

595
01:07:55,970 --> 01:08:03,110
So we had cell cultures from each person that were in the test tubes that we kept forever.

596
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:14,389
Those are great for measuring gene expression in general because you have a really tight link between the genetics and the expression,

597
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:17,420
because the environment of the cells is all the same.

598
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:22,340
So you get a tighter connection between genetics and the gene expression.

599
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:31,160
However, it's not the best for trying to figure out what was happening in the gene expression in the human before you took the cells.

600
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:37,099
Because like all the environmental stuff gets kind of washed out when you do the transformation.

601
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:45,430
And the transformation can also affect does also affect gene expression in very characteristic ways that we know and can account for too.

602
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:57,200
But it's not the best. But we had it, so we excluded everybody, less than 45 years old who had history of stroke or who had any evidence of dementia.

603
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:04,730
You know, we looked at five measures of cognition and made a general cognitive function score, like I told you before.

604
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:10,729
And we also measured the EPO Epsilon two and four,

605
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:17,240
also using a different a different method that does a pretty good job of going in and

606
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:21,310
genotyping them because you really can't do it on energy loss chip or even on sequencing.

607
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:29,180
It's very hard to get accurate. E. And then we had methylation in the gene expression data.

608
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:33,380
So the things we wanted to do,

609
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:40,220
we're kind of to look at these eight like snips in the ABC seven region and see if they were related to general cognitive function.

610
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:46,660
First of all, in our African-Americans that don't have dementia or look at methylation, is that related?

611
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:55,430
So we took 72 methylation sites in the ABCs seven gene and its surrounding regulatory region and we looked

612
01:09:55,430 --> 01:10:00,650
at those are the error associated with cognitive function and then did the two have an interaction?

613
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:15,799
And I'm not going to go through all of this. I feel like with I'll just say we had 634 African-Americans, we had variability in random things.

614
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:21,530
But here I'm going to get each to the results. So we did not see a lot of association between.

615
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:25,390
In the sense that we're from the literature.

616
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:29,950
So we had we chose steps from Gwas and our general cognitive function.

617
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:35,110
We did see associations between CPG sites and general cognitive function.

618
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:49,780
We. Are not super entirely sure why this snips dissociation associated with general cognitive function in our sample.

619
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:58,930
But like I said, we just don't know too much about how that gene and how those snips function before the onset of dementia.

620
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:04,509
So it's possible that they're starting to have an effect like at later ages.

621
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:08,890
And so we don't really see it in our sample or it's more associated with pathology.

622
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:16,510
But we did see some relationships with the CPG sites, so we wanted to pursue that just a little bit further.

623
01:11:17,470 --> 01:11:29,620
And what was kind of interesting is that we did see an interaction between some of these snips from the use and CPG sites on cognitive function.

624
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:37,220
So. So let me just show you this. This is saying this is showing you the interactions.

625
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:44,720
So these are four different interactions that we observed. So it's showing you the SNAP and the CPG site here.

626
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:48,740
So these are this the name of the snip in the CPG site that we saw an interaction for.

627
01:11:49,460 --> 01:12:00,230
This is what's what cognitive function is predicted from our model that that that looks at the SNAP, the CPG site and their interaction.

628
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:05,630
And this is the methylation down at the bottom here.

629
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:12,200
So this CPG site went from 96 to 98.5% methylated in our sample.

630
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:18,710
And as it got more methylated, people who had the alias for this particular snap,

631
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:22,970
they their predicted cognitive function really didn't change that much.

632
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:26,600
It's kind of like a flat slope. It's not significantly different from zero.

633
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:32,330
But people who had at least one copy of the G oleo here,

634
01:12:33,170 --> 01:12:39,740
we actually saw their cognitive function decline and that decline was significantly different from zero.

635
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:49,639
So for people who have at least one copy of G, they really want their CPG site at this particular CPG site and ABC seven,

636
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:53,810
they want it to be a little bit more methylated rather than last month.

637
01:12:54,140 --> 01:13:03,200
That's what our data is telling us, that we don't see a relationship necessarily between the snap genome phenotype and cognition.

638
01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:08,990
But if we look across different levels of methylation, we do.

639
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:15,610
Does that make sense? Right.

640
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:23,840
So it's really this risk factor of having both the glial and the higher methylation here.

641
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:30,150
And you can see it a little bit more prominently here as well.

642
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:36,860
So then this is the risk little here. Oh, actually, sorry, I did that.

643
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:49,240
No, that's right. So the risk level here or the risk pairing would be the aleo and having low methylation at this particular CPG site.

644
01:13:49,250 --> 01:14:01,790
2271. What? So we're starting to see this preliminary evidence that the methylation matters for people with a specific genotype or alternatively,

645
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:07,580
genotype matters for people with specific levels of methylation at different CPG sites.

646
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:13,910
And we only have a couple more minutes, so I will I will hurrying along.

647
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:26,630
This is the ABC seven gene. This is the different X sorry, this is the different exons and ABC seven, this is the regulatory element.

648
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:32,060
This is the correlation between all of the CPG sites in that region.

649
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:42,650
So it's almost like an LP plot, but for methylation and then these are showing the results of the significant CPG is associated with gene expression.

650
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:46,730
So this was the figure that we showed to try to put all those pieces together.

651
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:59,690
And then these CPG sites are marked as to whether they had like direct relationships with with the cognition or whether they had an interaction.

652
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:03,130
I think the diamonds are the four that had interaction.

653
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:09,170
So you can if you stare at it long enough, you can kind of figure out like, you know, is it in the promoter region?

654
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:13,880
What how much other methylation is it, you know, associated with and things like that.

655
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:22,819
And we talked about it in the paper, but the other piece I just wanted to say is that we looked at those four interactions that

656
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:27,770
we found that were significant and and we looked at all the transcripts from the ABC7 gene.

657
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:31,010
So we had transcript data not just for the link.

658
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:36,920
So the all these different enzymes can be put together in a lot of different ways.

659
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:39,950
There's like 17 different transcripts for ABC7.

660
01:15:39,950 --> 01:15:49,879
So we looked whether those interactions were related to any of those transcripts and this is, I think the last slide that I.

661
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:56,060
Oh, no. Well, it's basically the last slide. So here's ABC 17 with all its different exons.

662
01:15:56,420 --> 01:16:01,010
Here's all the different transcripts that they that we had.

663
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:08,550
And we actually found that the interactions were associated with this little tiny transcript and this little tiny transcription.

664
01:16:09,230 --> 01:16:16,370
And we looked in G text and we saw that like this tiny transcript the red one had,

665
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:21,980
I know this is really hard to see, did have expression and it did have expression in the brain.

666
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:25,310
So you can look at these later, but that's basically what we found.

667
01:16:25,310 --> 01:16:33,230
So we tried to link up the genetics, its interaction with the epigenome and what's going on downstream with the transcription.

668
01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:43,940
Okay. So that's, that's basically the whole point and that we also have been doing a ton of work in mediation.

669
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:46,430
So if you have a snip relationship with cognitive function,

670
01:16:46,730 --> 01:16:53,959
is it mediated through any of these pathways like is the effect going through them and we're doing that even at a high scale now.

671
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:59,750
And so that gives us insight into etiology and helps with precision medicine.

672
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:09,410
So it's 950, but I'm happy to answer any questions if you have a burning desire or I'll be down here if you want to come to order.

673
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:12,690
Or you can go.
