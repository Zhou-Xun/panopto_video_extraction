1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,490
Okay. All right, let's let's get going with, like, micronutrients and stuff.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,860
So today we're going to start off with choline for the viewer in 630.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,179
That's like also where we ended up.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:17,370
So that's like super convenient because that was like to me seems like 5 minutes ago, although it even seemed like more than a month ago.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:24,749
So just to be transparent, there's a few reasons we picked Colleen. Colleen stands out in a bunch of really unique ways, like we can make it.

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,800
And the dry is based on some like total insanity that I'll get to at the end.

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,660
But it's also a good example of like it's got a bunch of different structures, you know, a bunch of different foods.

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:40,410
The deficiencies involve a bunch of different bioactive content. So that's why we're sort of starting with that before we go through folate and B12.

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:49,320
Okay. Couple of small announcements. So for the study guide activity, what can we do here?

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:58,559
I just posted. So thanks to all the people who give me ideas, I posted a suggestion that we're going to start with about how to use the study guides.

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,340
If you would like to. You don't have to. Of course, there's two options.

12
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,650
There's going to be a public option where you post it on perusal.

13
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,300
Sorry, we posted on Yellow Dog and everybody can kind of collaboratively work on the questions.

14
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,290
And then if that's not your thing and you want to submit it privately as an you to submit it through grade craft,

15
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,819
then there's another option for that, right?

16
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,630
So both of them are available to you and there's a very long like multi paragraph explanation that you can read if you want more details.

17
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,120
And we're going to try that for a little while, see how it goes, make sure it makes sense,

18
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,109
make sure the points match up with the the efforts and the and the submissions.

19
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,250
And then if we have to readjust, well, we'll readjust. Okay.

20
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,120
So that was that. Like I said, there should be great catch up with that generic.

21
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:48,460
Yeah, I'm about to set up my office door so I will send the 170 at Princeville for to like that.

22
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:53,909
And then I was at my step office and there's never an hour that'll work for everybody,

23
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,920
but we're going to try to set one hour that works for the most people.

24
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,830
So if you could set that up so that you can sort of set that time aside, we would we would definitely appreciate it.

25
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:09,270
Okay, great. All right. So with that, let's get through quickly. So daily, which is I was playing room with a lot of artificial intelligence things.

26
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:16,140
This is a thing where you can enter words and it generates a picture for you. So anyways, these are the randomly generated pictures that I had.

27
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,350
So you can try to figure out why I'm talking about each of these things later.

28
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:25,440
Okay. These are the learning objectives for today. All right. So let's start off with we're calling.

29
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,940
So most of the time, I'm going to start off with structure because you all know I'm a biochemist.

30
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:37,050
And so I think of things as structures. So cooling, as with most not all of the neurons we're going to talk about is a bunch of different things.

31
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,890
It's not just one thing, while coding specifically is one thing, but we talked about coding.

32
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,900
We made a bunch of different things so it can exist in a bunch of different bioactive forms here.

33
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,870
So for example, this is the main choline.

34
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,970
It's generally made as phosphatidylcholine positive calling can be made into another phospholipid called single myelin,

35
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,760
which is here, and then free choline, which is what we would call calling, fossil calling, glycerol, calling acetylcholine.

36
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:13,679
None of these have a fatty acid linkage. So this are here or this like multiple carbons here and here would represent fatty acid chains for these two,

37
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,040
whereas there's no fatty acid chains for or for these guys here.

38
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,940
Okay. There should be spiral slides over there.

39
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,010
Cool behind uniform. Okay. So food sources.

40
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:34,230
So the major challenge with choline is there's actually quite a few, quite a few good food sources for cooling.

41
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,970
So the dry, which we'll get to at the end for choline is 550 milligrams for an adult.

42
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:44,280
And you can see that that would still require being like three eggs every single day.

43
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:51,420
If you start to move down the list of beyond eggs, there's a bunch of vegetable based sources of this.

44
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:57,690
But you can see, for example, you'd have to eat ten red potatoes to get your dry of cooler temperatures.

45
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:04,530
Is is kind of a lot of potatoes. You'd have to drink like 12 and a half cups of milk to get the amount of pulling for the dry.

46
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:10,770
But there is quite a few virtual sources. But the major, major, major source is hard boiled eggs or just eggs in general here.

47
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,780
And then you'll notice on the top or near the top of many of these lists are going to be beef liver.

48
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,309
You could also say pork liver or chicken liver, goat liver or camel liver even, I'm sure.

49
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,209
I don't know. But I'm not going to and say probably all of those are generally can be really high sources.

50
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,530
Now, I don't love the taste of liver.

51
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:32,850
Very few people even eat liver, but liver has a ton of vitamins and minerals because that is the storage organ for quite a few of these complex.

52
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,099
So beyond eggs, there's fish beef and then for vegetarian options they exist.

53
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,090
But there's quite a few. The best vegetarian option is soybeans.

54
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:49,590
Okay, so in terms of what form they are or how we consume them, for most of the nutrients we talk about,

55
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:56,730
there's going to be both dietary forms as in food and then supplementary forms, either fortification or or other types.

56
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,989
So there's quite a few types of calling that could be some. And so there's chloride, Colleen, killing by heartrate.

57
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:09,350
These are different counter ions, CD4 coli, which is like possible choline, glycerol phosphate, collagen, which is possible along with the glycerol.

58
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:16,249
And then of course, it's terrifically. So the most bioavailable form by far is, is terrified, right?

59
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:22,250
So that's the thing that we absorb the most effectively. All of these have somewhat some less effectiveness of the pre forms.

60
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:27,200
And these are the forms that tend to be in vitamins or in supplements or if they're added to foods.

61
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,550
This is the most common one and this is the more bioavailable of the free.

62
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,270
COLLEEN So none of these have excuse me, fatty acid tail.

63
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,830
This is about 2.2 times more effectively absorption than these three.

64
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:46,219
And we'll talk in a minute about why. So I'll come back to cognition in the end.

65
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,860
But there was a quite a few people had questions on perusal about cognition or Alzheimer's and things like that.

66
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,499
So there's really only one pretty good study that's an asked of Colleen and Alzheimer's disease.

67
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:03,559
So really briefly, I'll walk you through this. It's a reasonably sized study, so 113 people who are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease,

68
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,680
they were randomized in either to Don Hazel or whatever, which is, I guess, in Alzheimer's treatment.

69
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,810
I didn't even Google what that is. But more importantly, Don is a pill, which is standard care and coaling.

70
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,270
So you could consider this Colleen versus not Colleen.

71
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:23,479
And what you can see is in this group here, over the course of the next year, their symptoms got worse.

72
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,090
This is a provider assessment of symptom severity.

73
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,819
Alzheimer's is a progressive decrease in cognitive function that got worse than it appeared for this group here,

74
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,640
that there were quite a bit of an improvement for colon supplementation.

75
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:41,690
There's some observational data, although it's not great about Colleen levels in protecting Alzheimer's in observational studies.

76
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,230
But this is the best I can find. But this is pretty good. 113 people.

77
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,040
A pretty good, pretty good reduction. Now, the one thing that is a little weird about the state oops I forgot to put the link above it.

78
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,120
I'll put it in after. Is that this was a previous study as opposed to go for five years.

79
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,590
That five years has been up for like three years now and I've not seen the final results published, which is a little concerning to me.

80
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:06,830
But so like maybe the differences went away or something. But anyway, I couldn't find any, any results from it.

81
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:14,210
Okay. So that's one way that you could support it. And just to be clear, Colleen, also scary is the same as us possible calling.

82
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:22,100
So they did use the most bioavailable non fatty acid form actually in terms of the fatty acid colleagues.

83
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:28,400
And so in this case, some talk about possible Colleen and single myelin the absorption is three also phospholipid.

84
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,430
So just as a reminder back to 630 phospholipids can be broken down into like all phospholipids.

85
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:40,910
So that removes the s into fatty acid chain using phospholipids e to you end of the life of phospholipid.

86
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,870
Those end up being absorbed through passive diffusion. You all know my thoughts there.

87
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,909
Probably a transporter. We just don't know what it is.

88
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:52,610
But somehow it gets into the interior site and then it in turn gets packaged back into positive Colleen

89
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,570
or single myelin and then packaged into a kind of micron where it goes off to everywhere else,

90
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,850
most notably the liver, because remember, the kind of the micron is going to release all its lipids to the peripheral tissues.

91
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,060
It's going to end up in the liver, which is where the phospholipids are going to end up.

92
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,730
So that's why so much of the dietary phosphatidylcholine ends up in the liver through kind of micro remnants.

93
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,400
Okay. In terms of where Colleen is and how you get it from the liver to other places.

94
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,990
One of the challenges with Colleen is that because it exists in both in a sterilized in a free form,

95
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,940
they actually have kind of completely different pathways.

96
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,530
So the stereotype form is usually through lipoproteins that exists on the surface of the lipoproteins,

97
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,959
whereas the free Colleen has a bunch of these different transporters and there's at least three classes of transporters.

98
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:43,190
There's high affinity transporters like SLC, a 75 seven, and then other choline transporters that are somewhat lower affinity.

99
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,620
And then there's these cation transporters which are active.

100
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:52,910
All of these are generally active transport and they exist on cells that are trying to get free, Colleen, into their cells.

101
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,549
So for example, a neuron which is going to require a lot of acetylcholine is going to be a high activity of SLC.

102
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:04,310
587 And you can see that the SLC five seven is highly expressed in the brain because it's got a reabsorb.

103
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,270
Colleen quite often. Other tissues have have different respect.

104
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:15,110
There is again, kind of like with lipids, some thought that free Colleen may also be absorbed through some passive diffusion.

105
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,570
I don't it I just think that we don't know. All the transporters are nobody's knocked out all of them.

106
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,010
You can see there's a lot of redundancy here. There's one gene here, five genes here and another three genes here.

107
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,530
So if you wanted to knock out all of the free choline transporters, you'd have to knock out like.

108
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,770
Nine different genes, right? So that would be quite difficult. But that's how that's how they that's how they traffic around.

109
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,790
Okay. Cloning synthesis. That's where that this is here.

110
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,419
This is one of the very few nutrients we're going to talk about that we can actually make ourselves.

111
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:49,370
And so we can make cooling ourselves. We always make it all mammals make it from fossil turtle and ethanol, I mean, which is right here.

112
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,970
So we always make it as the phospholipid. So using EMT,

113
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:59,209
we convert possible ethanol amine into possible coaling and then not possible coaling can be sterilized into

114
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:03,710
free coaling which can go off and do all of the other things we'll talk about in the next half a dozen slides.

115
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:07,490
Right. So we cannot make free coli from any precursor, right?

116
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:13,969
We can only make it from past little ethanol. I mean, and not shown in I guess it is shown in here is acid, you know what I mean?

117
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:19,820
Which is going to provide the methyl groups and we're going to talk a lot of a lot about same as we talked about and 630,

118
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:26,600
quite a few people cannot do this. So somewhere around 55% of people have various levels of impairments of PMT,

119
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:31,280
which means they cannot make any choline because they cannot make any particular point.

120
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,930
Right. So that makes possible calling semi essential, sort of conditionally essential.

121
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,899
And so some people can make it and some people need to supplement.

122
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:44,360
And then this is just the breakdown for the most common, a level of who can make home and who not.

123
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:50,480
Now, of course, this matters because if you take people and you randomize into calling deficient diets,

124
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:56,150
what you'll find is that if you monitor for some of the outcomes in this case of monitoring for liver fat and muscle breakdown,

125
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:02,940
whether or not you have the variance and EMT or several of these other genes dictates whether or not you're going to get this disease right.

126
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,310
If you can make sufficient codeine yourself, it doesn't matter if you're coding deficient, you'll be fine.

127
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:15,110
But if you have that variant, you have in this case a 25 times increased odds of having some sign of cooling deficiency.

128
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,130
So choline is essential for some people, not all. And it sort of depends on their genotype.

129
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:26,480
Is that something they could easily test for or do you just give us some sort of deficiency where they're like, wow, this must be healthy?

130
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:33,590
So yes, you can you can test for genetically for sure. There is not good biomarkers for choline deficiency.

131
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,290
So you'll notice neither of these are great biomarkers like liver fat.

132
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,500
Lots of things cause liver fat, muscle breakdown, a lot of things Cosmo will break down.

133
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:45,550
That's one of the biggest challenges. We don't have a good biomarker where we can measure sufficiency, but we can measure the genotypes.

134
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:50,690
And so if you were to assess that, you would want us as a keynote speaker. Okay.

135
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,590
Since we make PC and some people make PC, about half of us make PC.

136
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:59,630
All of us probably consume PC. Most of the cooling our body is actually stored in that PC form.

137
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,230
So this is a super complicated diagram. Don't worry about it. I'm going to show this on five slides.

138
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:08,630
We are going to focus on this little part right in the middle here so we can make PC.

139
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,340
That was this stuff we just talked about here.

140
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:16,370
And then that PC is the source of the free calling that can be used for all of the other things that we need calling for.

141
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,990
So for example, if we need codeine for making acetylcholine, we can liberated from PC.

142
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:26,510
And if we need calling for as a methyl donor, we can liberate that from PC as well.

143
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:31,100
So there's this huge, huge pool of PC if you imagine all your cellular membranes in your body,

144
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,670
which is a lot about a third of those phospholipids are PC Right.

145
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,690
So that's one of the reasons why it's hard to measure choline deficiency because we have this massive,

146
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:45,530
massive, massive pool of hospital cooling in our body. And so the ability to access that pool is dependent on on these activities here.

147
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,280
There's actually two ways. Sorry, apologies for those of you were right at the front.

148
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:55,670
You can liberate the colon from the hospital coin. You can use a fossil like a D, which is cuts right here.

149
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,550
So that just liberates choline, which is shown right here.

150
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,240
Or in some cases you could use fossil APC, which cuts back here and now that liberates false for it.

151
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:10,030
Okay. And so fossil clean is shown right here or you can liberate, right?

152
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,689
Most of the time you're using fossil like paste, which just liberates coin because if you fossil calling,

153
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:19,280
then you would have to also remove the bumper sticker. So that's one source.

154
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,650
So if your body needs clean, probably the easiest place to tap into is your phosphatidylcholine reservoir.

155
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,430
But much like proteins and somewhat like fats that we talked about.

156
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:32,179
Remember, these lipids are used for other things, right? So by tapping into that reservoir,

157
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,399
there's some functional consequence for if there is a reason to want to use phospholipids

158
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:44,600
d would we resort to fossil and CC and then the enzyme to break the phosphate group off?

159
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:50,479
Okay. So two, two really good questions. So I don't know if anybody goes PLD deficiency D does a lot of things.

160
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,139
That's a good question.

161
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:58,610
Now, I don't know, you could imagine a scenario where if you were D deficient, you could go C and then falsities and maybe that would be upregulated.

162
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,030
But I've never seen a D deficiency, so I don't actually know. But it's a good question.

163
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,880
I'm not sure that I have the answers yet.

164
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,240
Thank you. The coin fossil. This fossil coin phosphorus. Okay.

165
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:18,079
So the next sort of metabolic step that is relevant here is you can take that free colon.

166
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:25,790
And again, this could be free coding from your diet or coding that you had previously liberated from false recall.

167
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,649
So any of your free coding pool can be turned back into Phosphatidylcholine, right?

168
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:37,910
And so there's these multiple steps here through CDP, which is shown here, and then you and then you can make possible coding here.

169
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:43,940
All right. So there's another whole set of enzymes here. About 70% of the total PC in the liver is synthesized through this pathway.

170
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,969
So there's this constant release of colon from phospholipids and then recertification back into phospholipids that again,

171
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,750
you could kind of think of the phospholipid as the as the storage form here.

172
00:14:54,890 --> 00:15:03,590
And so most of that occurs in the liver and the rate limiting enzyme here is possible points phosphatidylcholine several transferase,

173
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,729
which is this CPT, which is this last step right here. That's the rate limiting step.

174
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,870
It is probably regulated by a bunch of stuff, but like with most of the vitamins minerals,

175
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:16,760
we don't actually have a good sense of exactly how it's recommended. Like is it regulated by peak or important things like that?

176
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,860
There have been a few studies on this, but not not a lot. Right. But we do know that that is the rate limiting step.

177
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:29,690
Another reason PCI is important. So PCI is sort of the first of the three bioactive forms of calling that I'm going to

178
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:35,450
talk about today is primarily for forming cellular membranes and for LDL production.

179
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,030
So this is a bit of a review for those of you in 630.

180
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:43,910
But for those of you who weren't all lipids that exit the liver have to be packaged into these things called chiral microns.

181
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,460
Can these color microns have phospholipid coats? Those phospholipid coats are generally mostly passed through the colon.

182
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:56,780
So every time you make a lipoproteins, such as of the LDL, you you generate you need a lot of phospholipids to make that lipoprotein.

183
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,360
If you don't have enough phospholipids to make that coat,

184
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:05,840
the fat can't get out of the liver and therefore the fat stays in liver and you end up with that left or eventually.

185
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,730
Stan Ptosis right. And so coaling deficiency is thought to be one of several causes of fatty liver.

186
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:15,290
Now somebody and I forget who exactly asked this question of like, well,

187
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:20,540
what proportion of fatty liver is due to calling deficiency versus is due to, let's say, obesity?

188
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,799
I don't know. They probably work together, right? So if you're obese, you're getting more fat, going to liver.

189
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,430
If you are choline deficient, you're getting less fat out. Right. So they might work together.

190
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,510
But it's really hard to tell.

191
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:38,510
Most of the genetics of overall fatty liver disease tend to point more to liver, liver, metabolic enzymes, not to clean enzymes.

192
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:42,889
But for example, EMT is associated with fatty liver disease through GI loss.

193
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,640
Right. So there's so there is some evidence that choline is important. Okay.

194
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:55,020
So here in this study here from my. 91, which I'm going to Ireland this day before some of you were born, at least, is looking at cooling levels.

195
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:59,450
And so this is a pretty important study. We're going to come back to it at least twice more today.

196
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:06,060
And so what they did is they took a bunch of people, they were inpatient, so they were hospitalized and they were given a controlled diet,

197
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:11,310
which was replete in Colleen, and then randomized to either wholly deficient or quality control diet.

198
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,730
Right. So they were inpatients. We knew exactly what they were eating and then they monitor their free plasma coding levels and then their alt levels.

199
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,050
So as you can see over time, this is reasonably slow. This took 30 days.

200
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,330
There was a modest decrease, about 25% in their blood choline levels.

201
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:32,879
And then as their blood quality levels decreased, alt, which is a marker of liver disease, increased.

202
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,390
Right. So you can see these things roughly mirror each other. So as Colleen goes down, liver disease, especially fatty liver goes up.

203
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,850
And then in a shaded bar here, they added, calling back to the deficient group.

204
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,180
And you can see that resolves the liver disease reasonably quickly in this case,

205
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,110
more or less to resolve that liver disease in a so that's that's promising.

206
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,139
That's really good news. Most fatty liver disease is not treatable.

207
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:01,620
There is no drugs for fatty liver disease. But if you could somehow identify that somebody has fatty liver disease due to colon deficiency,

208
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,260
then it's resolvable quite quickly within a week or so.

209
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:10,860
This is, I should say, since this is just alt and these are all somewhat subtype logical levels of alt, this probably isn't true.

210
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,679
If somebody had liver disease for years and years and years and certainly isn't

211
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,020
sure if they've progressed to stereotypes or certainly not to cirrhosis.

212
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,230
Right.

213
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:26,399
But it does give you a sense of the time scale that this also kind of somewhat indirectly alludes to the problem of how do we measure choline levels.

214
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:33,750
Right. So you can see after 30 days of absolutely zero, Colleen, their levels only decreased by about 25%.

215
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:38,400
Right. And that's because of this big possible choline reservoir that everybody has.

216
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:44,580
Right. So you can keep cutting that for a while and it works for a while. But 30 days of absolutely no choline had almost no effect.

217
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:50,820
This is also true if you do studies where people are completely starved and I mean completely starved of all foods for two weeks,

218
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,510
there's only about a 20% reduction in free coli levels. Right.

219
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,510
And so is this really a good indicator of quality status?

220
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,890
Maybe, but not really,

221
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:05,250
because we know that in this case they've had no calling for a really long time and there's only a pretty small in relative terms.

222
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,780
It's not like they're calling levels went down to zero. For example, this access is cut off pretty high.

223
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:18,050
Okay. So that's positive, Holly. And then the second bioactive molecule I want to talk about is a subtle call.

224
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,769
So again, you need free calling.

225
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:26,730
This is almost exclusively made in neurons and it is a really, really important neurotransmitter for a whole bunch of of different things.

226
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:34,800
So acetylcholine is made from choline generally from the hydrolysis, using fossil fuel choline here, usually through TLC.

227
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:42,330
And there's a bunch of deficiencies that are associated with coding that can probably be explained by the role of acetylcholine.

228
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,770
So for example, we know fatty liver disease is probably due to a deficiency of phosphatidylcholine,

229
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:53,460
but most of these diseases are probably due to deficiencies in free cooling or specifically acetylcholine.

230
00:19:53,730 --> 00:20:01,260
And that involves things like muscle fatigue, because acetylcholine dependent neurons are the neuromuscular junctions that cause muscle contraction.

231
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,190
The slow motor neuropathy is vocal cord paralysis attacks.

232
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,529
Yeah, those are all sort of the same, the same thing, potentially mega plastic anemia and neurodevelopmental disorders.

233
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:15,120
Although, as we'll talk about, these might have more to do with the methyl donor role of calling.

234
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:24,750
So we've talked about acetylcholine before, but the other sort of neuro active component of choline is a different compound called single myelin.

235
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:29,040
So single myelin is shown over here. And so it's a little hard to see what it is.

236
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:35,940
But if you start with postural calling, you see here's the coaling right here and then you add a ceramide, which is another kind of.

237
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,120
Amino fatty acid type molecule here you end up with something called single mile, right?

238
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:46,179
So you see the amino group is here. And then this year my group is is now down here.

239
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:53,340
So it's still a dinosaur, it's still a diglycerides. But because it's got this amino group here, it's not actually what we consider a phospholipid.

240
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:58,600
Now, single myelin is really important because it's the major lipid component of these things called myelin cheese.

241
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,690
So all neurons have myelin chiefs that are wrapped around them.

242
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:06,129
They play multiple roles, including structural integrity, but most importantly, insulation,

243
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,850
so that two neurons that are right next to each other are cross-reactive with each other, right?

244
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,319
The charge is passed between the neurons. And again, if you have deficiencies in single myelin,

245
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:20,979
either due to calling deficiency or due to deficiencies in single myelin sympathies, you'll have something called demyelination.

246
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:28,300
And then that causes all sorts of neurological challenges, right? Because you don't have well insulated, structurally integral neurons.

247
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,400
Okay. So there's two phospholipid forms of choline that are both bioactive.

248
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:39,850
So while most about myelin, she's postural choline mostly about apolipoprotein formation.

249
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,110
Okay. So the last one and I swear I'm going to stop talking in a minute here is the metal donor form of coltan.

250
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:52,480
So Colleen has these three metal groups here.

251
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:59,040
It can be converted in an irreversible fashion by an enzyme called choline dehydrogenase into Betty.

252
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,170
So Betty looks like this. This is actually three methyl glycine.

253
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:10,270
Got those three methyl groups that Betty right here is the proximal donor to make as adenoma fighting from within.

254
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:14,409
Right. So this is the one carbon metabolism cycle which will be showing a lot over the

255
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,380
next three lectures because the next few lectures are all about 1000 cycle.

256
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,040
But you can see Colleen can donate methyl groups by first being converted to

257
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,400
better mean and then better in can donate that methyl group to the binding,

258
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:28,300
which becomes acidic on the binding, which is generally the universal methyl donor,

259
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,570
which can be used for a lot of other things that we're going to talk about.

260
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:36,220
Foley over here next class. And you can see there's two ways that you can regenerate.

261
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:42,730
Well, three ways you can regenerate mine. One is through better Ian and Colleen through VMT, which is right here.

262
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,790
One is through folate going through here. And then the third is through direct consumption of refining from the diet.

263
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:53,170
Right. So all of these can help regenerate, maintaining and then as adenoma fighting.

264
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:56,920
Right. But one major role, Colleen, is to provide those those methyl groups.

265
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:05,290
Now, somewhat interestingly, when we're getting rid of Colleen, so if we are catabolism, Colleen, for excretion, it's the same pathway here.

266
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,420
So you start with Colleen and then you convert it into Betty, which is shown right here.

267
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:15,160
Chemical Glycine is just another name for Betty. And then the tribe, ethyl glycine can be excreted through urine.

268
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:20,440
Now, there's pretty minimal loss of cooling in the urine, so generally about less than 2%.

269
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,040
So what that means is we have very, very, very efficient resorption of Colleen.

270
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,910
So as Colleen gets to the kidney, the kidney recognizes it and pulls it back in.

271
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,570
That reduces our dietary requirement for it.

272
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:36,070
There's also some loss of Colleen in the form of pulsatile Colleen, which is secreted as part of bile.

273
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,720
That's actually a much more substantial loss of Colleen compared to the Free Ross in Europe.

274
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,020
But you could imagine a scenario where in the case of chronic kidney disease,

275
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:48,530
this reabsorption of Colleen is impaired, and therefore your Colleen sufficiency might increase.

276
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:52,100
Right. Because you're leaching out Colleen through your kidneys. So the better.

277
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:58,510
Ian is both important for the methyl donor role, which is here, but also for the eventual catabolism and decrease.

278
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:04,030
Now, importantly, this conversion. From calling in, the betting is totally irreversible.

279
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,720
Once you've become better, you can never take up anything and turn it back into colon.

280
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:11,760
You can also consume very indirectly. It's in bits. That's what's called getting right.

281
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,589
And there's lots of supplements that provide better you directly. Right.

282
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:21,010
And we can talk in about 20 minutes about whether or not there's any sense to any sense to doing that.

283
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:26,320
Okay. So that was that. Okay. So that was a.

284
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:37,420
25 minute ish. Yes. Do you think for people with chronic kidney disease that Colleen is unable to be?

285
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,390
I'm saying potentially it sort of depends on the disease.

286
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,880
That's a general rule about all these nutrients, is that usually the kidneys do a good job of keeping it in our bodies.

287
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:53,230
But if your kidneys start failing and your GFR decreases, we start leaching things out, whether it be salts or diamonds or amino acids.

288
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:57,030
In all of those cases, your requirement would increase. Yeah.

289
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:05,660
Okay. All right. So what I want you guys to do now is I briefly talked about all of these genes, sometimes in packets.

290
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,970
So this was a transporter. This is the calling kinase makes possible co-lead.

291
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,400
This is PM T,

292
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:18,600
which makes multiple point and this is the thing that makes up better in all of these have common variants that affect coding requirements.

293
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:22,709
But one thing that might be kind of surprising is if you look here, you can see Chek egg,

294
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:28,050
which is codeine kinase, actually has variants that cause you to have increased risk of choline deficiency.

295
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,890
And also there's a leads that have decreased risk of killing deficiency.

296
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,780
Now the reason for that is genetic variants can make you better or worse at doing the thing that the molecule does.

297
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:44,370
So what I want you guys to do for the next 10 minutes or so in your groups here is I want you to go through each of these four.

298
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,340
And based on what I told you and what you read about on these,

299
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:55,650
I want you to predict whether dietary coding requirements would be increased when you have either a gain or a loss of function.

300
00:25:55,750 --> 00:26:00,780
Right. So for each of these, you will say, I think, for example, if I don't have p m t,

301
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:05,130
then therefore I cannot make choline, therefore my requirements will increase.

302
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:11,400
Right. So that's why I did that one first. So you should be able kind of do that same logic for each of the other enzymes here.

303
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:15,930
Right. This is not an exhaustive list, but that should kind of get you going and think about it.

304
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,500
And Junior and I'll circle around if you have if you have questions.

305
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:31,979
You know, in case you forgot, please create and submit your groups first so that we can approve them.

306
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,980
So you can actually submit your your group activity here. Yeah.

307
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,190
What I.

308
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:27,420
We're not going over here because you have security and military that is going to I you.

309
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:37,760
I just want to say to people what they.

310
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:46,669
You have no idea what they're thinking.

311
00:27:46,670 --> 00:28:15,080
Okay. What we know is already in this country, White House Judiciary Committee members were here and there might be something like this.

312
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:26,130
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

313
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:38,270
Definitely. They got questions like everyone else.

314
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,589
Yeah. I'm sorry.

315
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:49,850
I mean, because I'm afraid that could mean one thing.

316
00:28:50,210 --> 00:29:01,160
I can also inclusionary zoning ordinance 24 is never.

317
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:10,280
And he said, yes, I'm going to make you can't figure this out.

318
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:15,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You have to love this.

319
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:33,110
Sounds like you surprised by the number of people in your restaurant.

320
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:36,110
I'm not sure. That's really.

321
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:49,610
I think her requirements are less and I am sorry.

322
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:55,260
I don't think people realize. Oh, yeah, yeah.

323
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:00,280
So what did you say?

324
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:08,230
Started as a website is not working on it.

325
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,410
So do you have any of those? Yeah.

326
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:30,640
Yes. I mean, so that's what I'm working on.

327
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:37,700
The decision is really it has one, one, one, two, three.

328
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:59,690
When you click on one of you will then it will say like something like when we come home and I hear you looking at the Apple users will think

329
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:23,060
it's a really great value to consume more than $34 per month for all the people that are using that to happen over here in your report.

330
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:42,740
That's what we do when you I learn how to do it from what I was trying to do with this really.

331
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:46,010
You get so high that you are not.

332
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:14,080
Yeah, that's what we do in polling.

333
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:21,850
Trump's qualified for the second year, so that's the reason we're going to tell you why.

334
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:45,260
So the idea behind it was crazy. N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A.,

335
00:32:45,710 --> 00:33:04,870
N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A. Bookcases is like you know what I mean?

336
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:10,270
It's just like, let's not forget.

337
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:21,520
But that's why do you think that that's what kind of right handed over there times I think yeah

338
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:38,800
and it didn't feel very fortunate in that but then because it also has an even larger than I was.

339
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:57,400
But also, I mean, I know I do not know what you say in general for that would gain or loss of function to create important.

340
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:03,760
Now there could be a real people who are not the only people who were.

341
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:10,629
And what happens you get more active you got the reason check Abraham point because there are certain

342
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:22,140
reveals an important part of this all the way up to one particular one is what was going on all the while.

343
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:43,870
And I said, Well, I'm not sure what that is that I know it didn't work there.

344
00:34:45,460 --> 00:35:08,410
But unfortunately, yes, I think we're going to see a lot of people that would never be supportive of I don't know,

345
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,590
like what about where you know, what's going to happen now?

346
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:27,640
[INAUDIBLE] never be able to call this number less than a month later when I decided to call him,

347
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:43,660
because he was very different because we got married, Department of Interior about how we have been looking for the medical report.

348
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:57,490
I never got one that was like, Yeah, okay.

349
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:25,450
How are you? All right. All right. No, this isn't the right one for most of the time is when you know if you can separate, it's not right.

350
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:34,540
Right. Well, remember, you can't always have this piece of information, but you would never get people down.

351
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,530
So you're right, even though you're getting a little disappointed,

352
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:46,670
because when you find avoiding the backpack, you're always going to be something that you would need.

353
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,510
Like this one.

354
00:36:54,670 --> 00:37:02,720
Yeah. And there's, like, a one way street out here that I really don't understand.

355
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:28,100
So if you just want to show that you're neighborhood, you could.

356
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:32,060
I mean, you could do either race or sometimes with a base. You might just want to know.

357
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:39,460
So that's what I was looking for.

358
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:47,840
Interesting. So when you search by that, the 1983.

359
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,600
Well, you know. I know.

360
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,850
Oh, yeah, probably. I think so, yeah.

361
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,390
I think I can agree categories. Well, yeah.

362
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,210
So it uses a number. Yeah. Yeah, I it's been very tough right now.

363
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:15,830
You have a couple of things. Like there's a lot I could figure out with a what it's like.

364
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,790
Yeah. So every artist never had that experience. Everything you could go to that point.

365
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:27,200
I mean, it is just about as easy as you need to think about it.

366
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:36,620
It probably even comes from thought.

367
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:43,060
Oh, so you guys seem to have this really great quieted down a little bit.

368
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:48,080
So I'm going to try this semester based on some of the feedback from your teaching

369
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:54,950
evaluations to spend a few more minutes on like what the answers were to the questions.

370
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,640
So why don't we kind of go through them one by one?

371
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:01,670
So does somebody are to do so?

372
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:07,610
If you have lost function of PMT, you're going to have a higher quality requirement because you cannot be too positive calling.

373
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:12,620
All right. So it would be loss of function would increase the requirement.

374
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:17,140
Okay. So does somebody want to kind of go through that logic for a check?

375
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:31,880
So that is the Queen Highness. The two of them checking and checking the check helps you convert free calling to Phosphatidylcholine.

376
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:38,810
And if we were to have inactivity in that you aren't able to convert frequently to phosphatidylcholine.

377
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:44,360
So for your phosphatidylcholine you're only relying on dietary sources.

378
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,240
Are people p empty? That's right.

379
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:53,900
So normally you would also be able to tap into your free calling sources and make that free calling in the positive column.

380
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:59,460
Sort of the third way you can get faster, but in people with a check, a variant, they would not be able to do that.

381
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:04,640
So since they have limited opportunities to create easy relative to somebody without that variant,

382
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:07,460
then now their calling requirements would also increase.

383
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:12,830
And particularly we're measuring it, their false reporting requirements would be probably more relevant.

384
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:21,630
Okay, how about SLC 40 for a while? You're going to have to know that you're doing it for yourself, that you know.

385
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:25,470
Oh, yeah. Well, I'm going to talk about what? Okay. You can do satiated. Feel strongly about that.

386
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:33,590
Okay. Well, we wouldn't be able to convert going the thing and so we were going to be supplementing or increasing our volume.

387
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:40,670
We would just increase our beta in our diet or supplementation, so.

388
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:44,059
Okay. That's right. Yeah. So you wouldn't be as McMillin. Right.

389
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:51,080
So if you were trying to make methodology point one to have either fully combining or being directly not relying on going to be so what would that do?

390
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:55,600
You're pulling parents off. Interesting thing.

391
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:02,910
Does anybody agree or disagree with the states are saying. The three options are resumes.

392
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:18,820
Everything seems like a clean bill doesn't the that there is negative side effects of too high calling although usually a massive settlement.

393
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:24,910
But you're right it would decrease your requirements because now you're not using the clean to make methadone series and calling for everything else,

394
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:30,550
which means you need less coal because you've got less jobs for the call was great.

395
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,840
Okay, how about SLC 44? A one is in good thoughts about them.

396
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:43,260
And so at Transport and myself, as soon as we were able to walk out of delivery.

397
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:48,960
You would basically be relying on fossil fuel for one thing even.

398
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:56,490
And that would be can't get out of liver, can't get out of the parasite, can't get it into the parasite, can't get it into the neuron.

399
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:02,700
All of these things would be the same problem, right? So you'd sort of that free pool, Colleen, is like less useful to you because you've got less.

400
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:07,560
And that would be the same with any of those eight transport of the shuttle SLC 27

401
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:15,510
or since you 44 you by getting all the things here based on the previous answer,

402
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:22,200
I was going to say it would stay the same originally, but I think we had actually need to increase that so that we might be able to transport.

403
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,620
So because it's free so that mostly right, because it's free.

404
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:29,820
Colleen It wouldn't really matter if you supplemented with more frequently because that's still not available to you,

405
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:34,750
but you can still use positive, but then you probably have a much higher requirement of Boston, right?

406
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,390
So you want to have dietary possible convert have to be higher. Now you'll notice maybe you didn't notice.

407
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:45,030
I don't know. When you look at the food levels, holy. It's kind of like generic like here's the Collins, right?

408
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:50,249
It's not saying this food has this much cholesterol coli in this much hospital pulling in this much quality and things like that.

409
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:56,300
Right. So even for foods that are high in holdings, for example, beef liver are actually high in both PC but are even higher infrequent.

410
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,520
Right. And I don't think any I'm not that I've seen a if somebody thinks you want to let me know, I don't think I've ever seen Free Colleen.

411
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:07,860
What's real polling or possible polling shown on an FDA, USDA ethics.

412
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,219
But that would be important. That's like an important piece that I think we should know. Right.

413
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:16,260
But as that shows, there are certain people who better benefit to possible call in their free calling.

414
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:20,460
And that might affect the dietary recommendations that you might might make.

415
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:22,300
Okay.

416
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:33,450
Cause if we have any questions about the appendix from the hospital preschools and protective menus with those three on the blog you can look at.

417
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,140
Yes. Yeah. Three D in a functional. Yeah, yeah.

418
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:49,020
So yeah. Okay. And as you will not be surprised here, this will be not the last time we talk about genetics and vitamins, probably not even today.

419
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:53,370
Okay. So we're going to move on to pregnancy.

420
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:58,620
So I want to spend about 10 minutes on pregnancy and colon requirements during pregnancy.

421
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:05,430
So as I said, some people, both people can make choline while they are pregnant.

422
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:10,919
In fact, because it's estrogen responsive and estrogen goes up during pregnancy, you can actually generally make more choline.

423
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,819
If you're a pregnant woman, you can generally make more point if you are a woman of birthing age,

424
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:18,210
and even more if you're a woman of birthing age who is currently pregnant. That's great.

425
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:22,470
That's helpful. But not everybody because of the genetics we talked about.

426
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:28,649
So if you look at some of these methyl donors here in pregnancy, I regret this.

427
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:35,610
And you called for school appropriate colors here. You can see that if you look at the levels of these nutrients in pregnancy,

428
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:40,379
both between and fully decreased pretty precipitously from early pregnancy.

429
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:45,750
In this case, this was like before 13 weeks and late pregnancy, which was like about 34 weeks overall.

430
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:53,010
Right. So you can see there's a big demand here. So presumably this is not because the pregnant women are pregnant people are not eating better.

431
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,850
And folate. Right. This is because of demand for bedding and falling here.

432
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:05,940
Now, where is this going? It turns out that the placenta uses quite a lot of cooling, but almost exclusively the placenta relies on free cold.

433
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:12,030
You can imagine a scenario where they would access lipoprotein particles and take up the LDL and LDL and the like.

434
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:18,570
But they just up here to not. Right. So it appears that they are exclusively dependent on free coli during lactation.

435
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:24,300
There's also a lot of secretion of choline. We secrete about 125 that we I'm not currently electing a woman,

436
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:27,569
but a woman who is currently breastfeeding would generally secrete somewhere around

437
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:32,910
225 milligrams of coaling per day and that's about 84% possible choline six.

438
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:38,219
Sorry, I have this backwards, right? That should be 84% free choline, 16% postural cooling.

439
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:43,410
Right. So they're secreting quite a lot of cooling into the breast milk. That's going to turn out to be to be pretty important.

440
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:50,910
That is pretty important. So important. So I guess my question is, so you'll notice cooling levels actually don't decrease, right?

441
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:57,270
So even though we know or we can intuit, there's a huge cooling demand because the placenta is pulling a bunch out and then after delivery,

442
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,750
you're secreting a bunch of through breast milk. Why is it increasing?

443
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:07,190
Like what's going on here? Like Why is it not decreasing in the way that folate and bedding are decreasing with demand?

444
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:17,420
Because of the effects of estrogen, we are able to supply the body with enough.

445
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,999
Yeah. So that's one part of I would say it will be three potentially correct answers.

446
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,690
So, yes, estrogen is going to increase the synthesis of possible point, right.

447
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,280
So that's one part. Okay.

448
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:36,780
The second part, which is more or less related to what Haneen just said, is that the presence of possible calling can continually be tapped.

449
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:43,620
Right? So we have this big reservoir. So this is another example of why looking at free calling is not really a good indicator of choline status.

450
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,519
Right. These women are definitely at higher need of choline, but they're calling.

451
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,790
Those are actually higher. Right. If you just looked at the blood choline levels, you'd be like everything's great.

452
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:55,950
They don't need any more coding, but we know that they're using all this, right? And that's because they're tapping into this other pool.

453
00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:04,140
That's harder for us to measure the free fall for people. It was two, I guess the third one that you could argue that might be important.

454
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:10,020
It could be it could be a dietary change. Right. And so some but not all prenatal vitamins might have cooling in them.

455
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,670
In the study, that wasn't a big issue. The study was done quite a while ago, 2016.

456
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,819
So the presence of cooling improvement alignments wasn't as common.

457
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:22,800
But you could also imagine a third possibility where people are just consuming more calling and that's why it's increasing.

458
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:31,020
But mostly it's because of the increase in EMT and the accessing of the PC pool is for most women sufficient to provide their cooling,

459
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:35,880
whereas bedding and bullet they run out a lot faster.

460
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:44,549
Okay, so why does this matter? One of the major reasons that one car metabolism matters is because there is a particular stage of

461
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:49,860
development where there's a lot of DNA replication that's required and there's a lot of cell division.

462
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:54,510
And this is at the closing of a part of the developmental embryo called the neural tube.

463
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:57,990
And that requires a lot of supply of nucleotides.

464
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:03,870
And those nucleotides are going to come from one kind of metabolism. We'll talk more about the nucleotides in in the next class.

465
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:07,409
And so neural tube defects are present in a lot of different ways.

466
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:13,680
The two most common are and simply and spinal bifida. And it's been known for quite a long time that there's important gene drive interactions.

467
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:20,640
So for example, genetic risk of SB or INS happily are associated with variants of choline and folate metabolism.

468
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:25,620
Also, people who have local in folate, B12, B6 also are at higher risk of that.

469
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:30,870
And that's one of the reasons why there has been prenatal vitamin fortification, especially with folate,

470
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:36,419
and that in at least America has reduced the incidence of spinal defects by about 78%.

471
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:40,080
So this is a real victory of public health. This is not universal worldwide.

472
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:44,639
But this had a really, really big impact on on a very, very debilitating disease.

473
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,500
Right. And so, again, there are several coli related genes that are directly associated with neural tube defects.

474
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:54,900
But really, the way they're working is they are increasing the levels of choline or folate that you need.

475
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,569
Right. So it's really a gene diet interaction, right.

476
00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:03,270
Because as we talked about, several of these like for example, SLC 40, 41 is associated with neural tube defects.

477
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:07,620
That's because they're not getting sufficient choline in that case through the free choline transporter.

478
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:14,310
So that's one important thing. We'll talk more about this, of course, in the following 12 lectures.

479
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:20,429
The I guess the other general point I'll make about this is that this this stage of build actually occurs very,

480
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:23,520
very, very early, quite often before the woman even knows they're pregnant.

481
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:29,969
So that's one of the reasons why folate and potentially coding supplementation is recommended for all women who are of a birthing age,

482
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:35,190
not just women who are planning on becoming pregnant, because that might happen before you you even know.

483
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:39,690
And again, that's one of the reasons why once and so many fortified foods. Okay.

484
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:46,740
So the other piece I want to talk about is the relationship between calling during pregnancy and cognitive function in infants.

485
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:52,770
So in this study here, this is an observational study where they looked at maternal free calling, right?

486
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:58,200
So that, as I said before, not the best biomarker for calling, but it is certainly a biomarker for pulling.

487
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:05,010
And both the levels of choline and the levels of beta even positively associated with cognitive score for the infant.

488
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:09,600
Right. So that would excuse me one good piece of evidence that could lead,

489
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:16,050
at least in the blood of the mother, was related to the developmental trajectory of the of the child.

490
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:21,990
This, of course, observations could be due to any number of things. And so in this study here, they didn't asked.

491
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:26,040
So what they're showing here is reaction time. You can think of a short reaction time is good.

492
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:31,520
Cognitive function reaction time for everybody decreases as you get older because you learn how to react, right?

493
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:32,940
So that's why everybody plans going.

494
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:38,910
And you can see the higher coding supplemented group here had a lower reaction times on average than the higher group.

495
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:45,040
Now this makes it seem like there's like a gazillion children in the study, but it's actually the same child at different times, right?

496
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:52,140
So the end of the study is still reasonably small. I want to say it's 22 or 23, but it's good evidence from the calling supplementation.

497
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:57,290
And this is beyond 480 milligrams per day, which is about what the dry is might be beneficial, right.

498
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:02,459
So this suggests that maybe the driver calling that pregnancy might benefit by going all the way up to,

499
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:06,360
say, 930 or maybe it continues continues below that range.

500
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:14,580
So that's pretty good direct evidence that calling during pregnancy has an impact on the on the development.

501
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:20,400
And again, this could be due to any number of methyl donors loss phosphatidylcholine slash acetylcholine related roles.

502
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:30,690
Oh, okay. Okay. So the last notable metabolic metabolic thing I want to mention is to, oh, so many people,

503
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:39,360
their gut bacteria can take both very eating choline and carnitine and catabolism into a short lived molecule called TMA,

504
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,800
which then gets oxidized into a much longer live molecule called Tamayo.

505
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:53,760
So this was extremely exciting ten, 15 years ago because what people found was that people who were carnivores compared to people who are vegetarians,

506
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:58,080
had much more breakdown of these products into TMA and into TMAO.

507
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:02,610
And we know for a long time people who had. To be more carnivorous tend to have higher cardiovascular disease.

508
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,740
So this seemed like an attractive target. Maybe it's these molecules interacting with their gut.

509
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:12,570
Flora makes this apple genic molecule, which is then the reason for cardiovascular disease.

510
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:18,930
So there's been a lot of research since that looking at TMA and TMAO in people and looking at cardiovascular risk.

511
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:27,210
The reason that that's been challenged a little bit is there are some foods and I would say specifically the counterexample here is salmon,

512
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,180
which has extremely high levels of track.

513
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:36,780
So the food that provides the most TMA of any food in our diet is salmon, and salmon is quite clearly cardioprotective.

514
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:45,750
Right? So either TMA is bad, but the other things in salmon are so good it overcomes the badness of the TMA or the team is not as bad as we thought.

515
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:51,180
Right. So right now my view is that there's quite a bit of controversy about whether or not TMA

516
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:56,720
is definitely part of cardio metabolic disease or not or whether this is a biomarker.

517
00:52:56,730 --> 00:53:02,460
But what is clear though, is that TMA in your gut can break down each of these molecules.

518
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:04,620
So if that is working effectively enough,

519
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:10,920
some people would propose that if you have a gut flora that is more predisposed to breaking down colon especially,

520
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:16,680
you are now going to have less bioavailable choline for you, right, because you're breaking it down before you absorb it again.

521
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:22,379
I'm a little dubious because where the gut microbiota lives is a little bit farther down the chain than where the absorption occurs.

522
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:23,610
But I'm not ruling it out. Right.

523
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:30,450
So it's possible that there might be a microbiological effect that is decreasing the availability of by breaking down of the TMA TMAO.

524
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:36,959
So much about what we see is variations in risk and not like other things, including as well.

525
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:42,990
People try to look at other things too. I think the reason for that is this came out of sort of like carnivore versus vegan and

526
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:47,100
there was much stronger data about meat based diets having more cardiovascular risk.

527
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:52,469
People have looked at this in terms of, say, colon cancer, which is another sort of like meat specific dietary association.

528
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:57,870
But again, the data is still a little bit mixed because, again, we know that salmon is largely protected from from colon cancer.

529
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:03,060
The advantage is, it turns out it's actually really easy to measure TMAO in the blood in bile samples.

530
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:07,080
So you can measure this from like a gazillion people from a retrospective study and look at associations.

531
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:11,370
Those associations generally are okay, but they're not replicated very often.

532
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:14,759
Right? So I've seen three big studies where there was a positive association with cardiovascular

533
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,260
disease and three other also really big studies where there was like negative associations.

534
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:21,510
Right. And this wasn't really explained too much by variations in the population.

535
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:30,000
So I'm not ruling it out, but I think there's less enthusiasm about this as a intervening step than it was, say, eight or nine years ago.

536
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,830
Okay. So we've already talked about about this a couple of times already.

537
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:39,420
So one of the major signaling factors that regulates colon production is through estrogen.

538
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:44,520
So estrogen has a binding site upstream of the EMT gene.

539
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:48,180
So that is how estrogen increases phosphatidylcholine synthesis.

540
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:54,060
Byrne talked a little bit about why that's beneficial, right? So as you are pregnant, you have higher cooling demands with more choline synthesis.

541
00:54:54,210 --> 00:55:01,670
This being the only route of coding. Synthesis is good, but there are people who not only have variance in the coding region of PMP,

542
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:07,259
but there are also people who have variance in the ability of the R to activate PD, right?

543
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:12,780
So the ability of R stimulated points if this is a specific subset of variance, right?

544
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:20,010
So these women would have generally regular calling levels and you would expect actually levels should rise during pregnancy, but they don't.

545
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:27,330
Right. So that'll be another example of where they would have increased demand because the r m pmt signaling is less less effective.

546
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:35,370
I tried to find a pitch for that, but that's a lot of words. Okay, so does anybody have any that was pregnancy stuff for now.

547
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,780
Does anybody have any sort of thoughts or questions about pregnancy or pregnancy?

548
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:49,850
What Coyne was doing during pregnancy more so some 50% of people to.

549
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:53,380
Is that something that's regularly tested? Absolutely not.

550
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:57,550
Absolutely. It should be, but it is absolutely not tested. Not that I've ever heard. So.

551
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:07,260
Yeah. Look, you look like you've a question. I do? Yeah. So then on the flipside of pregnancy, when women make.

552
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:12,379
Host anybody in that polling. Goes down.

553
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:16,820
And I realize like men already have a lower level of making it,

554
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:21,920
but it's steady throughout their lives where women are making a ton more of it and it's dropping.

555
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:30,220
Is that potentially the reason that. Most cases, like 60% of Alzheimer's cases, are in post-menopausal women.

556
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:35,630
I thought you're going to say that kind of agency and then through an Alzheimer's are so so for calling deficiency brain.

557
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,940
Right. So they're calling deficiency for sure. Right.

558
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:43,000
I think that post-menopausal women not having access to this mechanism are more likely to be at risk for.

559
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:47,560
Just like men who also don't have access to this are generally good, high risk whole.

560
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:52,960
You know, whether or not that is due to Alzheimer's depends on the connection, the strength of that connection between choline and Alzheimer's.

561
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:57,280
Right. Right. And like, as I showed you, there's that one piece of data for the RCD that does suggest there's a connection,

562
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,099
which is good, that suggests that that might be true.

563
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:04,720
But I don't like for example, I've never seen a good study that looked at conditional on p EMT variance.

564
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:08,020
Are you more likely to have Alzheimer's disease depending on your point of entry?

565
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:11,770
So you probably want all three of those pieces to answer, but I think it's totally plausible.

566
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:17,820
It's like coherently makes sense to me in a small number if you can figure it out.

567
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,910
Well, be great. If you could help figure it out, let us know. Yeah.

568
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:25,990
Just a we'll be covering calling for about another 45 minutes if you re if you can figure it out.

569
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:34,030
Okay. So we're going to go on to our next activity then, which I want to spend about 15 minutes on here.

570
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,930
So what I want you guys to do is I want you to imagine a scenario where you're

571
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:40,959
working at a prenatal clinic and you're meeting with women who are pregnant,

572
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,940
who's already pregnant or already in their second trimester.

573
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:48,730
And just imagine a fancy world where you actually knew exactly what they were eating and what their genetics were and what history was.

574
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:51,460
So what I want you to do is kind of answer these four questions.

575
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:56,680
I want you to identify, figure out how you would identify women who might be at risk of appalling deficiency,

576
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:02,050
what you might measure, what you might figure out, what you might see. I imagine that since you've got blood, you could measure anything in the blood.

577
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:08,410
And then I want you to go through the process of trying to explain what you mean to a patient in lay terms,

578
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,629
what would be an intervention you'd suggest.

579
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:16,000
And then if you have time, try to get to the fourth thing of how would you determine if your advice is like useful or not?

580
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:30,940
Like I said, we'll spend about 15 minutes on that and again, submit your groups to Guru if you could, and then we'll finish off with the dry woman.

581
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:39,540
Okay.

582
00:58:39,870 --> 00:59:02,560
This is not something that people have been working on and I have no idea where we have to put this one here, but they have to do their first one.

583
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:08,210
Yeah. So.

584
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:17,500
Crowley. I was like, Well, I never heard of her.

585
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:35,890
I can tell you that I don't think I was interpreting things like that.

586
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:46,280
I don't think they consider sexual harassment. They care about that.

587
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:55,390
Yeah. I promise I won't be honest about that.

588
00:59:55,720 --> 01:00:04,440
I don't know who said that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

589
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:09,540
I look at.

590
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:22,520
They can get anything invented around the world.

591
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:33,450
And as you point out, the United.

592
01:00:37,060 --> 01:01:00,070
Okay. Well, yeah, it's an issue as part of the presidential year and it would be nice to have the better indicator that we want to see in the Senate,

593
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:17,920
because after all, it's not like it's the money and the economy is awesome and the whole hearing.

594
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:24,640
Yes, that's what we're looking at right now.

595
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:31,730
Yes. Because she was worried that this was going.

596
01:01:35,850 --> 01:01:52,090
And there is a difference in using technology, but it's like having a PC is like every time I scanned it,

597
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:56,580
it's a storage reservoir, but it's like in theory, since I'm saying perfect data, you could like.

598
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:04,780
Grind the person up and figure it out. With like that's probably blood but isn't necessarily a good indicator.

599
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,799
Know sometimes you're not all that pregnant example.

600
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:30,780
It was a few years ago I got out of his system and I said, okay, he's very thin and they have like sex sessions and work in the restaurant.

601
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:51,590
And there is like this one being one of them.

602
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,530
But I mean, I get all.

603
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:06,330
All right. All right.

604
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:17,170
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

605
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:37,700
You know, John Kerry, whatever you want to say, that is something people would actually consider even.

606
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:49,579
N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A.

607
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:59,750
Yeah, exactly. Sometimes has got to know that.

608
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:10,100
I wouldn't know where to start taking him while I was like, okay.

609
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:17,420
Yeah. So. I wrote one of them once in my career because like the.

610
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:36,380
Yeah. They don't have to.

611
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:46,110
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't know.

612
01:04:47,940 --> 01:05:05,500
I think I was lucky that I, you know, I used to have a pretty good job when I was someone that you were not paying a premium on.

613
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:13,540
You know exactly what it was that was in my hand holding.

614
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:20,850
It was a brand new place to.

615
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:27,050
I like I feel like I. Yeah.

616
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:34,070
Cool. And then I didn't know what to do with her.

617
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:39,750
Yeah, I guess I am thinking about that.

618
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:43,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

619
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:54,520
I think you're supposed to be taken.

620
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:58,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

621
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:10,090
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

622
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:32,470
They I think most people have seen like here in Summit City like that, you know, like.

623
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:53,080
I don't have anything about it. So I go home and put it in terms of the issues under control.

624
01:06:56,510 --> 01:07:03,900
We spent about two more minutes on this and move on to the prize.

625
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:08,830
I was like, Oh, you're going to write?

626
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:20,930
Oh, yeah, I can. I always get it right now.

627
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:31,790
Yeah. Maybe we can help them.

628
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:45,260
We need the to help.

629
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:53,460
I want to see my mother.

630
01:07:55,220 --> 01:08:11,180
How did you know from the beginning that everything was about you?

631
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:16,030
Why don't you try your. You know what that's like?

632
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:25,670
We're doing it like that. Using her up to that effect.

633
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:33,280
Yeah. Or even like you.

634
01:08:34,270 --> 01:09:04,450
About. Like you and how we can always do something about the fact that you're born into people like that.

635
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:09,700
Yeah. Okay. All right, so let's spend a couple minutes. Oh, my God.

636
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:13,430
That's wonderful. Let's spend a couple of minutes on that.

637
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:20,720
So why don't we start with the first question? So then we want to sort of share some thoughts on like how you might identify at risk pregnant people.

638
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:36,970
I mean, there's probably a bunch of different things, so I'm sure you could consider them a set of variants of the code and stick them.

639
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:40,270
No, that's great. That's good.

640
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:43,030
But pretty much any of those variants that we talked about in the last activity,

641
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:46,159
you might want to test for any of those or more than that, but that's something for sure. Yeah.

642
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:50,200
The recent family history of neural tube defects or any past pregnancy for that.

643
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:55,660
Yeah. No, those are really good. Right. So those are very similar type questions like family history and coming to be related to genetics.

644
01:09:55,870 --> 01:09:59,079
People will generally know that that is generally how this is done in practice.

645
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:03,700
Right now you have you see that history of not to do that could be an indication for for sure.

646
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:10,400
It's a little harder to be like is your kid done by that? But do think this is pretty clear?

647
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,350
Okay. How about we'll skip the second one? That's just to explaining things.

648
01:10:14,350 --> 01:10:18,250
So does anybody want to suggest what they would have suggested as an intervention?

649
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:28,820
Supplementation supplementation upon pooling for three weeks.

650
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:32,049
It is pretty cold in falls. We didn't know that.

651
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:34,240
We didn't know. That's why. But that's why. That's why I was asking. Right.

652
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:39,600
So, like it could be you could be recommending a supplement with this troponin or possibly or point citrate.

653
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:40,990
There's a lot of different supplement out there.

654
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:46,660
The one that it works the best as far as we know right now is that glycerol, not positive, cholesterol positive.

655
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:50,920
That's the one from the Alzheimer's. So if you're going to recommend a supplement, that's the one.

656
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:56,650
And you trust me, I can get you to buy all there, all of the senior scientists like Wayne Coyne.

657
01:10:56,770 --> 01:10:59,829
Well, if you're trying to optimize and you want to give them a with they'll tell that yeah

658
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:06,430
some cholesterol bottle colleagues more valuable because you can customize it.

659
01:11:06,970 --> 01:11:10,629
Okay. So what if they say no, I'm like anti-cholesterol. Colleen Right.

660
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:22,630
So I have a fundamental disagreement and we talk about just trying to help them make a conscious effort to exert the study, right?

661
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:25,930
So I think so one, one general thing about that and this is related,

662
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:30,310
but additional to your point is that you don't want to jump to the presumption that they're on a local diet.

663
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:34,080
Right. You could just ask them. I've got I got like five kinds of probably five.

664
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:41,409
Right. Like you're probably okay. Right. And you, especially women who are pregnant, are very prone to being like easily disturbed by medical advice.

665
01:11:41,410 --> 01:11:45,700
Right. Well, you can probably start by trying to figure out what are you eating, what are some of your dietary?

666
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,790
And therefore, yeah, I love soybeans and I have more time or whatever, then it becomes less for.

667
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:53,950
But they mentioned, for example, that that they're vegan or something that they might be like, all right,

668
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:58,090
now let's talk about what the plant sources you have and and whether those are communicate or not.

669
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:02,010
The general issue here are this number. No.

670
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:08,739
So are you sure? It was like kind of about the I just don't know how outdated this research is,

671
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:13,110
but like kind of all the in terms of soybeans and like links to breast cancer.

672
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:16,450
Like I don't know if that is outdated.

673
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:21,850
Yeah. So the concerns there were the phytoestrogens in soybeans, which are overstated and extremely low.

674
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:28,630
And so these soybeans are associated with cancer? Probably not, unless you're eating a lot of that with my doctor.

675
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,620
That's a good question. And I'm glad you asked. Okay.

676
01:12:32,710 --> 01:12:41,500
So and then for the. Oh, yeah, go ahead with like preeclampsia, my blood pressure and like the intake was like more and.

677
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:48,560
That is a good question. I mean, a lot of that is going to depend on.

678
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:52,170
So, first of all, the dietary correlates of pre-eclampsia, to my knowledge, are not that well established.

679
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:56,700
So a lot of what people think about are like the sodium and potassium that are associated with that.

680
01:12:56,850 --> 01:13:00,480
Not all people who are preeclampsia ourselves into the preeclampsia. Some are not all.

681
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:04,330
So that sort of depends on that. Yeah, I don't know.

682
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:08,480
I'll I'll look into that and see if I can find. We'll have a whole unit on hypertension and preeclampsia come up.

683
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:12,370
And so maybe I'll know more by April. Okay.

684
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:19,020
So I'm going to move on to determining choline sufficiency, which, as I mentioned, probably half a dozen times already.

685
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:22,800
You're not going to have some of these sites, but they're on the they're on the drug.

686
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:28,770
And so a couple of things to think about. So there is free corn in the blood.

687
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:32,700
That seems like the most obvious biomarker. But like I said, it's defended pretty heavily.

688
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:38,610
Right? So even in that study where they completely fasted people or fasted people in a coaling free diet for like 30 days,

689
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:44,700
calling levels only decreased a little bit. And that's because of the large amounts of possible choline which are available.

690
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:48,420
So you could use that. That's one option. The other option is you can use homocysteine.

691
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:54,330
So as we've talked about before, low presence of methyl donors is going to cause an alleviation of the homocysteine.

692
01:13:56,830 --> 01:14:00,100
Noted in here somewhere. Homocysteine conversion from Sam.

693
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:04,599
Here is a diagram, but you could look at homocysteine levels.

694
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:10,450
It's more of a general methyl donor measure. But the problem with that is that could be because a lot of things that are not pulling,

695
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:15,130
for example, holy B12, B6 binding, all of those could cause homocysteine.

696
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:23,200
You could consider looking at that. The other challenges we know there's lots of genetic variation that has nothing to do with choline.

697
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:27,969
And also this is compounded by the demand for a certain O'Mahony which goes up during pregnancy.

698
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:34,810
There's a lot you could use that that is maybe a little bit worse than free calling, but still not optimum option.

699
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:41,920
All then the best. Then the other option. You can measure some outcome like Napoli or dementia or levels in breast milk or something like that.

700
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:45,460
So it turns out since we don't have a good biomarker for Colleen,

701
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:50,110
figuring out how much calling somebody needs turns out to be a pretty difficult question.

702
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:52,659
So there's a drive for Colleen, and as you might expect,

703
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:58,420
because we have bad biomarkers for it or actually no biomarker for it, it is based on an adequate intake.

704
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:04,300
Right. So we do not have a good EMR. When we get the folate class, we'll talk about years, but we don't have a note.

705
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:08,349
Please don't remember memorizing these numbers. They they vary.

706
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:10,630
They increase. As you get bigger, they increase as you get pregnant.

707
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:18,460
They are slightly lower for women than men because women have aspirin generally and can generally make more make more colon.

708
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:23,559
So how do we get these numbers? So these numbers look this and so you know me, they're taking a nutrition class and I was like,

709
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:28,300
this must have been done by rigorous science testing thousands of people in many diverse populations.

710
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:35,920
And they have really good reasons for this. And let me tell you about how the choline levels were established by seven dudes in Boston.

711
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:44,410
And that's it. That's all the data is on seven guys in Boston and then also 16 pregnant women living in Durham, North Carolina, in 1984.

712
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:47,800
So there is an upper limit for choline for here.

713
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:52,060
So we know that many people do not reach the DRI for choline.

714
01:15:52,270 --> 01:15:58,329
So if you remember, it was 550, 450. If you look at ages, most people are way under the air for cooling.

715
01:15:58,330 --> 01:16:00,459
So that might suggest all these people are like a super high risk.

716
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:04,210
We must all have, you know, snaffled and risk of dementia and all sorts of challenges.

717
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:12,160
But that's probably not true. And that's probably because these guys don't have a lot of of of sense to them.

718
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:17,460
So this is just a breakdown of the same sort of graph looking at what percent of people exceed the age.

719
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:21,730
So very few people are above the upper limit, very few people are above the eye.

720
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:26,139
And you can see this varies. There are some high risk groups that we've already talked about.

721
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:31,660
So pregnancy, lactation men and post-menopausal women because they don't have the ERP pathway.

722
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:38,139
Of course people who have variance in various metabolic and transport enzymes and then some dietary coding choices.

723
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:46,810
So vegans, premenopausal women and people on TPN would generally have that.

724
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:51,910
But in general only about 8% of people meet or pregnant people meet the eye.

725
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:57,460
So one of the things we're going to go through and I'll go through it if nobody volunteers, is just how do they figure that out?

726
01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:01,300
Where did that 125 milligrams per day per newborn baby come from?

727
01:17:02,110 --> 01:17:07,690
And so we'll go through that. And if you are not shocked like I was, you'll see that maybe we could do a lot more research in this area.

728
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:15,070
So it turns out that if you measure the average choline in breast milk, it is 160 micrograms per milliliter.

729
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:19,840
And the average volume of breast milk in a woman is 740 milliliters per day.

730
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:27,910
So that means the average woman is producing 125 milligrams of choline per day for that child.

731
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:32,260
So the presumption is. That's how much the baby needs.

732
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:38,560
Right. So the average woman makes that much. So that must be how much the baby needs is 125 milligrams of codeine per day.

733
01:17:38,710 --> 01:17:44,020
That's that's where that comes from. So that's the 125. Trust me, it's going to get worse.

734
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:47,860
So now that comes out to 80 children per day.

735
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:51,399
If you presume the average zero, six month three year old is seven kilograms,

736
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:57,000
which seems like wild and crazy to presume because, you know, babies grow.

737
01:17:57,460 --> 01:18:02,230
They're not like a static size. But it turns out the natural.

738
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:12,430
National Academy of Sciences has reference weights for the average weight of a baby is 27 kilograms.

739
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:19,840
So that means 80 milligrams per day or 225 milligrams divided by seven kilograms is 80 milligrams per kilogram per day.

740
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,600
So presumably that's how much you need as you get bigger.

741
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:28,839
So if you just kind of keep scaling that up, then at 7 to 12 months you are slightly bigger and therefore you need slightly more.

742
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:35,139
And then you keep scaling by size. They make it sort of like a parabola by it's not just directly proportional in size,

743
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:43,420
but there's this like 0.75 exponent so that as you get bigger presumably you're going requirements decrease by that curve of the exponential Y.

744
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:49,540
Yeah. So the reason that people over time the concentration of things.

745
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:56,940
So what is the average. Good point. Because they only measured this in 16 women once at a random point during their lactation cycle.

746
01:18:56,950 --> 01:19:02,500
So good point. Yeah. Kid probably isn't exactly 125 milligrams per day every day.

747
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:06,700
In fact, I would be astonished and shocked if it was because you're right, it does change.

748
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:10,210
Right. And so the requirements changed over the course of the day in a baby.

749
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:16,480
Even from two weeks to two months, we've measured this, but not, you know, who knows if that continues on as you get bigger.

750
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:24,340
Are there considerations for women who don't trust me? Well, the consideration is that they should be getting that amount according to their formula.

751
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:29,200
Yeah. Which is end point is mandated in formula, but interesting thing.

752
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:32,950
Breast milk changes. Formula doesn't. The formula is the same whole time where the breast milk changes.

753
01:19:34,330 --> 01:19:37,030
Furthermore, if you looked at the and I know this because we have this data,

754
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:42,879
if you look at the variance between women in the medical in their breast milk, it turns out not every woman makes exactly under 25 milligrams per day.

755
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,380
Some may gloss and some make less. Right.

756
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:51,550
So not 125 has a pretty big confidence in at least in our data, it's 95% comfortable is like 20 to 370 or something.

757
01:19:51,550 --> 01:20:00,700
So. So pretty white. Right. So one presumption is that the amount be the average mother among these 17 women in North Carolina is the correct amount.

758
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:04,690
So that's assumption number one, which who knows? And then who knows what they were eating?

759
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:09,160
Who knows what their lifestyle was? Who knows what other confounders are, what their genetics were?

760
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,970
And then the second presumption is that you can extrapolate this as the babies get better,

761
01:20:13,090 --> 01:20:15,840
which is like I would argue it like an even worse assumption. Right.

762
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:23,319
But it means that we get all the way up to 13 years old and you keep kind of extrapolating it up based on that 125 milligrams per day,

763
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:25,180
based on that one study on that.

764
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:29,290
Now, you might be you might think that's bad, but for sure, for adults, they figure this out that it's like much better.

765
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:31,360
For adults, it's actually much worse for adults.

766
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:37,540
So instead of having 16 sorry, I keep saying 16 to 17 women, the original study, one of them dropped out halfway.

767
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:42,100
So it's like 16 to 17 in the breast milk study. For men or for an adult, it's even worse.

768
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:47,470
So remember that study here that we just talked about? That was seven men in Boston.

769
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:53,260
They didn't mention the demographics, but I've been to Boston. I can go on and say it's not the most globally diverse population in the world.

770
01:20:54,040 --> 01:21:02,699
So that's what this was in this study. When they reduced Kohli level and then added coding levels back, they gave them back 500 milligrams per class.

771
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:06,850
So the controls got 500 milligrams per coli. They did not get fatty liver disease.

772
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:10,720
Right. So this control group was on five milligrams per coin.

773
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:15,070
There was no dose response here. It wasn't like some group got 500, another group got 300, another group got 200.

774
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:22,060
They all got 500. They didn't get fatty liver disease. Okay. So the drug is 500 because of that one study on those seven men.

775
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:30,459
Right. Because they scaled it up a little bit, because it turned out these men were a little bit underweight in 1991 compared to the population now.

776
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:36,880
So they've run it up a little bit to 550 for men. And of course, the average reference woman is exactly 61 kilograms, as we all know.

777
01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:42,070
Every woman is exactly the same size. So that's where the 550 and 425 come from.

778
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:45,459
So you take the 500, that means seven milligrams per kid per day.

779
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:48,790
So let's count from 18 multiply by the reference weight of the man.

780
01:21:49,060 --> 01:21:54,360
You get the you get the amount for the colon. Okay. And then for pregnancy, you combine the two, right?

781
01:21:54,370 --> 01:22:01,240
So you start off and you say, well, a woman needs 1425, but they secrete 225 per day, so they need 550.

782
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:06,380
Right. So it's just the 425 for the non-pregnant women, plus the 25 for milk gets 550.

783
01:22:06,410 --> 01:22:11,830
Right. So that's where lactation comes from. The pregnancy, it turns out it's a little more complicated.

784
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:17,319
So they had some some fetuses placenta that that were aborted.

785
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:23,110
They measured how much cooling was in the fetus and the placenta turns out there's about 3000 milligrams, which is about 11 milligrams per day.

786
01:22:23,410 --> 01:22:31,030
If you have the exact same amount of colon goes into the placenta through a pregnancy that comes to 11 plus for 25 is like ish for 50.

787
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:37,059
Right. So that's where that number comes. Yep. If you were going to be doing a study like, what would you do?

788
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:41,410
Because if it's hard to measure, like what we've all done,

789
01:22:41,410 --> 01:22:46,390
like with the only thing you really change is like really diversified your study population.

790
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:55,390
Yeah. So we're sorry. I think that's my last slide. So, yeah, so that's kind of what I wanted to get to is like it turns out this is back.

791
01:22:55,450 --> 01:23:03,069
This is quite bad, right? Seven back in 1991, based on the entire hearing for all adults in the entire global planet is like not.

792
01:23:03,070 --> 01:23:11,890
All right. So I guess what I would. But this time would be the the refitting because they had at least multiple doses of the remaining stuff.

793
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:16,720
No, of course you'd want it to be much larger and more diverse population. Maybe include women, maybe an idea.

794
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:20,440
Right. Because it was only men. So all of the 500 for 25 year olds are based on men.

795
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:27,160
So that seems kind of like a limitation on both sides. One women being at high risk of having a pregnancy that is causing division.

796
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:32,200
Also women that can make a lower quality than that. Right. So neither of those are accounted for in any of the trial.

797
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:35,890
Right. For the breastfeeding thing, I think that can be solved a lot easier.

798
01:23:36,110 --> 01:23:40,059
If you look at more women we like actually what is the average? It is different between different populations.

799
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:48,790
How does it change over time? So it's clearly like half the population isn't even going to growing enormously when you also want to split it up.

800
01:23:49,870 --> 01:23:53,770
Because we know that the gene of 77 men, is it hard to trust people? It is expensive.

801
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:57,070
No. I mean, it wasn't 1991. That was impossible. 1980.

802
01:23:57,310 --> 01:24:04,180
Right. But now it's it's quite. So you could you could buy a lot of a diverse population of just people who had the one back and look, it wasn't.

803
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:10,960
Or any of the other three or. I mean, it's one thing to be wholly deficient.

804
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:14,500
Do we have anything to say? Like what is accessible?

805
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:18,040
Not only. But. Yeah, so there is. There is.

806
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:22,029
When you have, that's what the tolerable upper limit is. And that's based on supplementation studies.

807
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:25,320
So that one's a little more clinical. It's a much more correct.

808
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:30,669
What I'm kind of getting at with the way that it is is if we're to say that 92% of people are wholly deficient,

809
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:33,190
we're basing it on the presumption that this is correct.

810
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:38,530
And what I'm hopefully portraying to you here is that there is not this is kind of the best we have right now,

811
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:41,980
but this is like as dry as go like pretty bad, right?

812
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,680
Like this is if this change, like if there was like a really good new experiment that came out next year and it turned out that year I was 280,

813
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:51,300
I would not be shocked or if it was 1500. Right.

814
01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:56,570
It's just this is kind of where we are now. Right. My guess is this is the worst draft that we will come across.

815
01:24:57,490 --> 01:25:00,970
My guess is all the rest will be slightly better. So we're going I'm coming from here.

816
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:09,010
But I think this is a good example of why some of them are not moderate or not based on the kind of in-depth, you know, diverse populations.

817
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:13,540
And then I think we'll see that on Wednesday for fully.

818
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:23,870
Well, you guys, I think.
