00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,232
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06,232 --> 00:00:10,040
In this segment,
we go through epidemiological trends and

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,820
the diagnosis of chronic diseases.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,701
In many cases,
chronic diseases go undiagnosed.

5
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:20,520
For instance, in the United States,

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,640
we estimate that they're about
18 million adults with diabetes.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,603
And that we have an additional third
of the adult that don't even know

8
00:00:30,603 --> 00:00:33,774
that the have diabetes.

9
00:00:33,774 --> 00:00:38,602
We have a second aspect of common chronic
disease diagnosis that often people don't

10
00:00:38,602 --> 00:00:39,500
understand.

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,350
And that is that even when we
have individuals diagnosed and

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,840
they are getting treatment,

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,480
that that treatment isn't good enough to
control their for instance, hyper tension.

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,330
So on average, when we look at
hypertensives in a community,

15
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,370
of the individuals that know that
they have high blood pressure and

16
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:05,820
they're taking medication,
only a third are actually under control.

17
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,650
And the remainder
are actually uncontrolled

18
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,720
even though they're being treated.

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,452
So when you think about the burden
of disease in populations,

20
00:01:14,452 --> 00:01:19,694
we now have: those individuals that are
unaware; those individuals that are aware,

21
00:01:19,694 --> 00:01:23,528
treated, and not actually have
their disease under control.

22
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:27,170
And then this third sector,
which is basically the individuals with

23
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,900
the disease, who are treated,
who do have their disease under control.

24
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:37,150
In some cases, we can see the power
of public health, health behavior and

25
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,180
health education intervention
on the awareness,

26
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:47,400
treatment control of chronic diseases
like high cholesterol and heart disease.

27
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,750
So for instance, in the late 80s and
90s, what we saw were two-thirds

28
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,640
of Americans were unaware that
they had high cholesterol.

29
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,260
And when they were aware and
they were treated,

30
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,940
the vast majority of them had
their high cholesterol controlled.

31
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,631
If you go forward a couple of decades,

32
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:08,587
now with the National
Cholesterol Education Program,

33
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:14,494
we only have about 30% of Americans that
are unaware of their high cholesterol.

34
00:02:14,494 --> 00:02:21,941
And many of them are doing well and
controlled on their lipid lowering drugs.

35
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:26,826
One of the other aspects of
tracking prevalent, common chronic

36
00:02:26,826 --> 00:02:32,164
diseases in the United States is that
we can see trends over time in what

37
00:02:32,164 --> 00:02:38,460
the diagnosis of disease is showing
us as a population burden of disease.

38
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:44,470
So we know right now for instance two
diseases are increasing in the prevalence,

39
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,952
diabetes and asthma.

40
00:02:46,952 --> 00:02:51,930
These are two examples where once we
know that a disease is increasing,

41
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,630
we can put new efforts on either
developing new interventions,

42
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,150
understanding key risk factors.

43
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,530
And then moving that information into
new prevention and control measures to

44
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:09,564
bring those common chronic disease
prevalences down in a population
