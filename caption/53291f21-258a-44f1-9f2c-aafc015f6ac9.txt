1
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,050
Now that we've had a chance to really think about the structure and function of

2
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,150
public health and craft a definition of public health and its role in our society,

3
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:25,860
I want to take a deeper dive into the history of public health through a brief documentary history narrated by Dr. Ken Warner,

4
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:32,790
former dean of the University of Michigan School of Public Health and professor emeritus in the Department of Health Management and Policy.

5
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,460
As you learn more about the history of public health, think about some of the important questions that we've discussed.

6
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,250
How is public health playing a role in improving societal health?

7
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,930
At different moments in history?

8
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:53,670
What are some of the challenges that you think public health professionals might have faced when they were designing interventions?

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,240
What core values of public health were being forged as public health developed over time?

10
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:09,210
And finally, what would you have done differently as a public health professional if you had been a stakeholder involved in making decisions?
