1
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,080
No. So.

2
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:21,070
Good morning. How's everybody doing? Seb and I can see the audience is cut down.

3
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:27,090
It's fall, it's almost fall break. So I am sick today.

4
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:38,850
My kids gave me germs. So I am wearing this mask and my voice is like, Ooh, so if you cannot hear me, let me know.

5
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,420
And, like, just wave your hands or something. Get my attention.

6
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:48,460
But it's good right now. Okay. Kids.

7
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:55,870
It's like when we wear the mask all the time. I went a whole season without a coat, but not anymore.

8
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,700
But there's some anecdotal evidence that may help.

9
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,320
So today we're going to talk about external validity.

10
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:22,010
Before we jump into that announcement that the quiz opens today and am I take this off a little too much?

11
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:36,409
Too many layers. The quiz opens today, and I have a student request to keep it open longer because I guess every professor had the same idea as I did,

12
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:41,840
which is give you time during fall break to do it, whatever it is and.

13
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:52,560
For that reason, I agreed to keep it open and at first I wasn't there tell you all, but I realized it would be a jerk move.

14
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:59,460
So the exam, the quiz will be open till the 23rd.

15
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,710
So that's Sunday. Same time it closes at 1159.

16
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,790
Well. In it's due 1159.

17
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:20,130
It's 20 questions and it will cover the units on evaluation and purpose to today's unit.

18
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:26,010
So we'll have questions from today, as you know, and then the campus.

19
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,930
So that's what's going on for the queers. So you have like an extra few days to complete it.

20
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,610
If that give you four. Right.

21
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,080
But again, multiple choice. Um.

22
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,810
Trim. Fast. False. Yeah.

23
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,260
So try to keep it simple. So that's analysis for today.

24
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,230
Today. We'll talk about external validity. We'll talk about threats.

25
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:11,340
Actually, I'm just talking about the threat. So ignore that and research design and then we'll talk a little bit about multicultural validity.

26
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,620
It's not something that I expect you to.

27
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:25,340
Like I'm not going to quiz you on it. But in terms of thinking about evaluation from a Cree lands.

28
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,080
It will be helpful to understand what it means because it's something that actually

29
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,350
encompasses all the types of validity that we will talk about in this class.

30
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,960
But in terms of what we talked about on Tuesday, we talked about internal validity,

31
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:57,250
which is the extent to which our study allows us to infer a cause and effect relationship between a predictor and the outcome.

32
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:04,590
So one way to kind of keep it straight in your mind, it is internal versus external.

33
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:18,450
Internal validity is referring to those vulnerabilities or it's referring to the quality of the internal composition of the study,

34
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:26,730
if you will, you know, part internally what it allows us to be able to say for that study only.

35
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:37,320
So some threats that we talked about, history, you know, external ways external changes can affect.

36
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,190
How we understand our study findings.

37
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,820
Maturation which refers to internal changes that might affect the study findings.

38
00:05:51,420 --> 00:06:05,819
Regression to the mean remember either extremely high or extremely low scores on a pre test contributing to sampling or selection and then having

39
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:19,080
an impact on the findings selection bias observed or the observed differences between intervention and either a control or comparison group.

40
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:27,920
Attrition. So loss or otherwise known as mortality, saw a loss in participants.

41
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:38,599
During the duration of the study or about or program testing, the ways that we can learn,

42
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:46,220
that participants may learn from the pretest and then implications that has for findings interpretation.

43
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:53,260
When we're talking about changes in study questions from pretest to post test.

44
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,860
And then finally ambiguous temporal precedence,

45
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:06,800
which is talking about the lack of clarity around if an external event that could influence the outcome happened.

46
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,490
Versus the timing of the outcome happening.

47
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:24,290
So in essence, our inability to know. When the outcome actually occurred and whether or not it occurred after the intervention activities.

48
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:37,030
So as we get into external validity today, I just want it to, you know, refresh your mind about what we're talking about when we talk about validity.

49
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:49,840
And. We're basically saying. When we're talking about validity is how sound do we know that our design and methods are?

50
00:07:51,990 --> 00:08:04,410
How sound and how rigorous those methods are in terms of their ability to be able to tell us something about either the program.

51
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:12,300
In itself or the program in the context of some other use.

52
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:27,680
Three. Reminder again, three types we talked about in turn on Tuesday and then we'll talk more about construct validity when we get into sampling.

53
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:43,120
So giving it to external validity. Um, so in contrast to internal validity, external validity is really turning our eye toward whether,

54
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:51,310
whether we want to do with this program slash its findings after we complete this study.

55
00:08:51,640 --> 00:09:03,970
Because what we're thinking about is generalizability. Can we apply the learnings from this study in the context of evaluation, this program?

56
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:11,080
Can we generalize that to other settings, other populations or other points in time?

57
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:20,800
So that kind of framing question that comes with that is will the intervention that we are implementing,

58
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:28,810
would it have the same results if we implement it in another setting with different people and or a different time?

59
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:40,220
Generally we're thinking about this in reference to an intervention evaluation that shows that the intervention is effective.

60
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:49,070
But I think it's helpful also and hopeful to remember that this also could apply to an intervention that was shown not to work.

61
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,600
Because it just may be that intervention is sound theoretically,

62
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:03,930
but it may not be applicable for that given population or that given setting or that given time.

63
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,460
So if you know as you go on and you find something doesn't work, which is more common than the literature would suggest,

64
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,360
there may be hope yet for the work that was done to develop that work.

65
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:29,800
Or develop that program. So I showed this on Tuesday just to give you kind of a.

66
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,340
Quick introduction to external validity.

67
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,640
But this model again is a proximal similar proximal similarity model.

68
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,620
And again, not expecting to memorize this model.

69
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:56,240
But the principle behind it is a really good illustration of what you should consider when you're thinking about external validity.

70
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:03,910
Right? So technically the model is a statistical model.

71
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,170
So there's all kinds of formulas associated with it.

72
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:16,880
But the idea is that you consider the difference between the various properties in the study that you're conducting.

73
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:23,640
And then the difference between that and the properties that you want to generalize.

74
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:31,250
And then the question is how likely is it that this difference will alter your research findings?

75
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:40,240
So in the context of an evaluation for a program, we're thinking very analytically about.

76
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:48,910
Four domains. One is setting. Where does the program take place?

77
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:56,410
You know, typically we might, you know, think of, you know, is it in the school?

78
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:04,030
Is it in a hospital? Is it. Well, those are like pretty good examples.

79
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:13,220
Is it in the community center, for example? We also think about people and so that's where we dig into characteristics of a population.

80
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:23,270
Are we talking about young adults versus midlife adults or seniors?

81
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:30,610
Are we talking about different characteristics related to race, gender, etc.?

82
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,360
Place is where we get into the idea of geographic location.

83
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,400
Are we on a roll place? Are we in the urban place?

84
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,090
What state are you in? Are we in a different country?

85
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:56,440
So that's what you would consider in terms of that. And then time is really also reflecting that moment in time.

86
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,510
There may be things going on that help contribute to the results that you see,

87
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:10,650
whether those are affirming the effectiveness or not affirming the effectiveness of the program.

88
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,880
And so that the light that the idea this principles that.

89
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:22,490
The more similar they are, the more likely it is.

90
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:30,800
Or that a program is going to work and that in another location it can be generalized.

91
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:40,780
But. The less likely or the less similar that they are, the less likely it is that it's going to work.

92
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:52,900
And so when you're thinking about doing a program evaluation, it's if you can you can think about ideas of external validity,

93
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:59,620
thinking about how this program might be used in other contexts or other settings or places, etc.

94
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,360
So there are four threats that we'll cover today.

95
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:17,340
Interaction of selection and treatment, interaction setting, interaction of testing and treatment.

96
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:25,560
And then multiple treatment effects. So interaction of selection and treatment.

97
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:33,180
This is really about when there and this is similar to you know, it'll feel very similar to selection bias.

98
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:41,769
This is when there are observable or observable differences between the population that's in the study.

99
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:49,060
So the program population and those in the general population of people that might be targeted for the intervention.

100
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,560
So for, you know, for example.

101
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:05,740
If you have an intervention or a program that's designed to increase childhood immunizations and limited the sample to first time parents,

102
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:13,150
one thing you might want to think about is whether the intervention should be promoted for those with.

103
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,470
Those having a second child or a third child, etcetera.

104
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,940
So essentially this interaction is saying is asking.

105
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:33,200
Or the question you want to ask, rather, is do the results of a study generalize to groups with different characteristics?

106
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:40,240
And how you can think about that or conceptualize it or start to kind of gather evidence on it.

107
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,590
And you can look at the literature you can look at.

108
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:56,130
The design. You know, maybe there are theoretical elements that let you know whether or not it's likely to work in different groups.

109
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,200
Now. How can you help mitigate or counter that?

110
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,020
One way to do that is probability sampling. And for now, you just kind of keep it.

111
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:19,130
I'm keeping it high level because we'll get more into what these sampling strategies are.

112
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:26,990
But probability sampling essentially is any method that utilizes some form of random selection.

113
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:34,850
And that the units in your population of interest have a known probability of being chosen.

114
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,480
So some examples that we'll talk about later on.

115
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:45,510
Simple random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified and cluster.

116
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:54,850
So the you know, the idea is that there's some kind of random selection that helps mitigate the issue of

117
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:03,910
differences between those who are participating and those who you would like to generalize to.

118
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:15,040
The second interaction is the interaction of selection in our setting and treatment.

119
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:21,550
And this is really when the results of an evaluation are impacted by the setting of the intervention.

120
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:25,600
So that framing question that you're asking when you're thinking about this threat,

121
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,950
could we apply this program within the different setting and see similar results?

122
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:38,230
So in this example, you have a hospital based intervention to reduce readmissions in the urban setting.

123
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:52,390
And we may you know, we may not think we may decide that it may not achieve the same outcomes as if we implemented this intervention in a rural area.

124
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:59,690
So for example, there might be issues with the population characteristics of the community.

125
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:07,820
It could be the number of people. It could be the racial, ethnic background or a breakdown of.

126
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:19,980
Of the people in that community, that makes a difference. Maybe availability of other hospital alternatives makes it impact.

127
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:27,490
You know, again, this is an example of it may not work in one place but may work in another.

128
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,740
So maybe because there are multiple options for hospitals.

129
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,790
That you know this. You know,

130
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:46,349
you may find that it works less in an urban area where people can actually go to another

131
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:51,630
hospital if they're not pleased with the service they received at one hospital.

132
00:18:51,900 --> 00:19:00,740
Whereas in the rural area, there may be only one hospital within 40 miles of all the towns kind of clustered together.

133
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,650
So that intervention you can more clearly.

134
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,800
See a positive impact of a program if it's in the rural setting.

135
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:20,680
It may be that there are hospital. The hospital has a weak or really strong tie to the community.

136
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:32,440
And so that you can think about significance that that community values that hospital more than they value other hospitals,

137
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,550
and that contributes to the effectiveness of intervention.

138
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,830
So those are different ways that setting can interact with treatment.

139
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:49,500
Treatment being the intervention, right. So how can we counter that?

140
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,070
So one way we can counter that is instrumentation.

141
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:04,480
As we are developing instruments to understand the effectiveness of the program, we can consider other populations.

142
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,080
Right. We can make sure that we are asking questions in a way that are.

143
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:18,490
Meaningful and applicable to the came to the setting or the community that we're working with in.

144
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,580
But the trick with that is that you also need to balance that with the need to measure

145
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,080
constructs in a way that are meaningful to the population participating in the program.

146
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:38,500
So one example may be slang. You know, you once designed to study.

147
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,040
I probably won't do this again. Or decide to survey. Where.

148
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:52,490
Instead of using categories of. We were trying it out, trying to understand very good, okay.

149
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:58,340
And very bad on a scale that that was the scale.

150
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:08,899
So we changed it to something like Awesome Man and not cool because we were trying to appeal to the youth that were completing the study.

151
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:17,240
But if we gave us, you know, we gave that survey or completing the survey and we gave that survey to adults,

152
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,840
they're not going to, you know, process it in the same way.

153
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:25,460
I had to have somebody actually, they suggested, man, I was like, I will know what that means.

154
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:35,610
So you may you know, you need to balance. Making sure that you can capture constructs.

155
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:44,459
That in ways that can be generalized, but again, balancing it with how you're speaking to the community,

156
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:56,840
that is the focus of the program in this study. The third interaction or the third threat is interaction of testing and treatment.

157
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,269
And this occurs when the results of evaluation are impacted by the use of a

158
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:07,460
pretest or observations that are conducted before they receive the intervention.

159
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:16,850
So the idea of this is that something that happened before the intervention starts in terms of measurement has an impact.

160
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:28,740
And the framing question to consider here is do the results of evaluation using a pretest generalize to studies where no test is used.

161
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:37,130
So for example, you might have a program where you pretest participants on their knowledge about diabetes.

162
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:47,330
And that pretest may be the reason why the prevention intervention appears to have positive, positive outcomes.

163
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:57,430
Right. So think about again that idea that, you know, you know, there is interaction between these different types of threats.

164
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:04,120
So this definitely harkens to the internal threat of testing as well.

165
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:13,690
So one way to counter that is modifying evaluation design.

166
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:24,970
So for example, you might add an intervention group or you might, you know, if you can statistically bear it, split your intervention group in half.

167
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:35,730
And then only have one group do the pulse test and then compare the results of that arm.

168
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:44,780
You can use an intervention group that had the pretest. I compare that to the intervention group that took only the pulse test.

169
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:53,090
You can also compare the two intervention groups to the control slash comparison group if you have one.

170
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:07,930
And finally, multiple treatment effects. This is when the intervention being evaluated exists in the ecosystem that includes other interventions.

171
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,240
I recall somebody asking about like, what do you do if there's like other interaction,

172
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:17,710
there's other programs going on, how do you tell the difference? So that indeed is a threat.

173
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:28,210
Um, in our frame framing question for this is will the results of an intervention that's implemented concurrently with other programs,

174
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:32,800
will those generalize the settings where the other interventions are not occurring?

175
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:40,810
So say we have a program that's implemented to, again, reduce readmissions and hospital.

176
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:49,300
But the hospital setting, that particular hospital also had interventions and or penalties targeting readmissions.

177
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,909
And for those who, you know, a lot of public health people,

178
00:24:53,910 --> 00:25:01,650
we go into working into the health care system and especially with larger health systems like Michigan Medicine,

179
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:12,630
even like Saint Joe's, which is now known as Trinity Health, they have multiple hospitals, multiple clinical trials, multiple studies going on.

180
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:19,050
So this is a this is actually can be a common threat depending on the setting that you're working at.

181
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,930
So one way that you can counter that is to.

182
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:36,400
You know, requires coordination. And admittedly, coordinating in a big health system, for example, can be very difficult.

183
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:41,100
But if you can, it can be counter with timing.

184
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:49,300
So, for example, you can allow for sufficient time between the programs to minimize the possibility of multiple treatment effects.

185
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,980
And so even if. Yes.

186
00:25:53,990 --> 00:26:03,220
Study population. May have been touched in some way by another program, if possible.

187
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:09,310
If there is more change to be had, you can still document the change that occurred because of.

188
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,050
Your intervention from pre test the pulses.

189
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:29,200
And you can also I mean, put this, but you can also try to control for that by asking for questions that they participate in another program.

190
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:33,670
So at least analytically, you can control for that in the analysis.

191
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:42,670
So when it comes to threats to external validity,

192
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:56,830
if your goal is to have a program and have findings that allow you to argue that it could be generalized to other contexts such as the setting people,

193
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:03,070
time, place, you need to consider these threats to external validity.

194
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:13,790
I also wanted to kind of bring these up again now that you, you know, had some exposure to the threats for both internal and external validity.

195
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:20,960
If there are indeed trade offs between internal and external.

196
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:30,430
You know, even though. It's typically been that internal validity.

197
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,720
It's seen as like the best, you know, the more pressing.

198
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:45,190
Validity to be concerned about. Now, even the article that you ran for today, if you read the article for today, shows you that there.

199
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,740
You are funny. Oh, well, that's why I gave it if.

200
00:27:54,890 --> 00:28:04,970
But you should read it especially. It's very short for the basically says that in public health we need to care more.

201
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,770
We need to care more than we do about external validity because what we're trying to do is improve the

202
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:20,210
public's health and we can't just keep doing programs and then evaluating them and not generalizing them or.

203
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,430
Or not, or trying to apply them in different contexts.

204
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:33,710
And one thing that I want you to kind of even be attentive to, because I'm gonna show you a video.

205
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,790
To come in round off the class.

206
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:49,110
Pay attention to what they're talking about in terms of generalizing and the discourse around what it means to generalize a study.

207
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,320
But but getting back to this slide, you have, you know,

208
00:28:54,330 --> 00:29:01,350
in order to in control or improve in terms of validity, you have to control for as many factors as possible.

209
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:07,320
But at some point, if you control for too much, you really can't generalize the study.

210
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:16,510
So you have to be able to balance this, and then you also have to think back to your purpose.

211
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:26,600
Does the client and again, because we're talking about evaluation, it's political where you have to concern yourself with the stakeholders.

212
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:31,540
So what are the stakeholders more concerned about?

213
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:40,720
Are they more concerned about cause and effect? Do they want to know just for this program that was funded by this entity?

214
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:50,540
Do they really care more about? Did it work? Without, you know, as much concern about can we do it again?

215
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,240
So you have to make decisions in that situation that improve internal validity.

216
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:05,780
And so that might help you kind of make choices between, you know, okay, are we going to sample this way or ask a question this way?

217
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,740
That can help you weigh out the difference.

218
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,049
I mean, in contrast,

219
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:22,750
if you want if the priority among your stakeholders is determining whether it will be successful among other populations or in other locations,

220
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,980
your focus should be on improving external validity.

221
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:34,910
So they might you know, they might also impact the program design, not only the evaluation design.

222
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:42,500
Who else was considered the program sample or the people that we're going to recruit into the program?

223
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:56,450
So any questions about external validity? All right.

224
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:06,370
So we're going to round off today by talking or thinking about multicultural validity.

225
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:13,930
I guess I shouldn't say again if you read for today. Get my feelings hurt.

226
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:17,620
No, really. You're not gonna hurt my feelings.

227
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:21,219
It's okay. I don't know how much I read either.

228
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:26,560
When I was in grad school. And if I was reading, I was reading it like two in the morning.

229
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:35,950
So I don't know how much of it I actually processed multicultural validity, but keep the reading cable you will reference for the rest of your life.

230
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:40,270
That's my base. Multicultural delivery.

231
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:49,190
So we're talking though. So everything I presented to you so far about internal and external validity is coming from a very technical,

232
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:56,440
public health, study driven approach to doing evaluation.

233
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:01,990
You know, thinking about rigor only in reference to.

234
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:15,040
Scientific rigor. But when we talk about multicultural validity and, you know, increase circles and cultural,

235
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,790
you know, thinking about cultural responsiveness, thinking about equity,

236
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:25,570
we also have to think about how well we can trust what we're seeing and what we're

237
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:32,500
designing and how sound it will be in reference to dimensions of cultural diversity.

238
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:37,910
I might measure something, you know, and a good example is.

239
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:42,410
I might measure a construct like hope.

240
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:50,350
In reference to kind of a white, heteronormative way of thinking about hope.

241
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:59,810
But maybe if I'm working and or, you know, maybe by age or maybe, you know, whatever.

242
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:10,109
Whatever demographic or cultural characteristic. But how, you know, black and brown youth in our urban area.

243
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:19,970
Think about how it might be completely different. So when we're thinking about multicultural reality validity, we have to think about.

244
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:30,090
Are these findings trustworthy? Given that we're talking about groups with different cultures.

245
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:38,400
Sorry about that. And you see, my voice is running out to all of you, I can tell you try.

246
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:46,460
So. Just in time. Not only just in time for.

247
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:54,020
Just in time for today, but just in time for this unit at.

248
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:59,520
Instead of me talking about multicultural validity more than I already have.

249
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:09,629
I wanted to show you a clip from a recent webinar that actually one that has multiple speakers,

250
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:14,400
including the writer of the article that you ran for today, Kirk Hart and Kirk Hart.

251
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:21,810
So I am going to start it. And.

252
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:29,930
Based on the time I'm going to play through two of the introductory speakers, I'm not playing the whole thing.

253
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:33,770
So if you see it's an hour and 26 minutes, do not panic.

254
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:43,670
I'm not making you watch the whole thing. But I do encourage you, if you are interested in it, to continue to watch it.

255
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:50,100
So once. So I'm watching her move.

256
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,630
I'm like, wait, I if she's playing, you all can't hear.

257
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:04,500
So I'm going to play this and then we'll just come back together to summarize, and then we'll be done for the day.

258
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,070
From witness on. Oh.

259
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:26,860
Okay. Now you get to see what we really look like in real time instead of going through that rigamarole.

260
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:35,970
I'm just going to do this. See if that helps. Time.

261
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,430
Mm. No, but.

262
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:51,150
I think that might help at least. Karen Kirkman. I'm a white cis gendered female heterosexual.

263
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,140
All right. Or the U.S. Government Accountability Office.

264
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:11,570
We welcome all the panelists. And at this moment, I'm going to turn it over first to Dr. Karen for part of the matter.

265
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,930
Thank you all for participating. I think that's all I can do.

266
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:19,800
Okay. Now you get to see what we really look like in real time.

267
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:28,380
Greetings. My name is Karen. Curt. Curt. I'm a white cisgendered female, heterosexual elder of German heritage,

268
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:35,610
and I grew up in a working class neighborhood of Southern California and attended a private college thanks to affirmative action.

269
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:41,940
I subsequently earned a Ph.D. in social work and psychology from the University of Michigan.

270
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:46,680
And that's relevant because my interest in social justice, I think,

271
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:53,480
stems from those two disciplines, my commitment to evaluation dates from the 1970s.

272
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:03,450
I've added a long time. I taught both program evaluation and clinical practice evaluation at Syracuse University for 34 years,

273
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:12,780
and I think that shifts between macro and micro contexts has really shaped my emphasis on relationship and communication.

274
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:19,900
As mentioned, I've been blessed with brilliant and supportive colleagues in Asia and Korea.

275
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,330
I began working on multicultural validity in the mid-nineties,

276
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:32,470
and I want to succinctly set the stage for today's conversation by focusing on some core ideas.

277
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:38,440
At the end of today's panel, there'll be a conversational description posted of my journey.

278
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:45,640
In case you're interested in how I got to this point, um, and that'll just be posted for your information.

279
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,260
Multicultural validity. Hmm. It's not a new type of validity.

280
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:58,860
Rather, it's a call to broaden the kinds of evidence that are considered in validity.

281
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:03,030
Conversations. Narrow constructions of validity.

282
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:09,300
Work against justice by limiting what is counted as legitimate evidence.

283
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:19,410
Multicultural validity calls for broader conversations, inclusive of voices, historically minimized or overlooked entirely.

284
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:28,430
This supports social justice by opening validity to diverse perspectives previously suppressed or silenced.

285
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:36,050
This is not about checking off discrete categories, but about how confidence in the accuracy,

286
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,389
adequacy and appropriateness of our understandings is strengthened by going beyond

287
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:48,050
measurement and just time to consider five intersecting sources of validity evidence.

288
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:58,820
It also creates a framework that reminds us to notice the all too frequent absence of diverse perspectives and to correct those omissions.

289
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:04,170
First methodological evidence is the most commonly considered.

290
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:08,400
Often subdivided into qualitative and quantitative methods.

291
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:16,410
From this perspective, validity is supported through the procedures that are followed or the operations that were performed.

292
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:27,000
Multicultural validity does not reject this as a source of evidence, but simply argues that it's insufficient as the sole source of evidence.

293
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:33,330
Second, theoretical evidence brings insights from a range of social sciences,

294
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:39,210
humanities and professions, including theories of evaluation and program theory.

295
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,690
Indigenous wisdom is honored here as well.

296
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:53,730
Theoretical models such as programs, theory of Change need to be examined thoughtfully for embedded assumptions of deficit or disadvantage.

297
00:39:54,360 --> 00:40:00,330
This, too, is not new. MESSICK included theory in his 1989 definition of validity.

298
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:11,220
Third, relational evidence rings considerations of how people relate to one another to our planet and to the universe.

299
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:18,720
It calls us to examine how power is exercised in relationships, collaborator,

300
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:27,660
collaborative and participatory research, models of evaluation, position, relationships as positive as good things.

301
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,290
However, that's not necessarily how they're experienced.

302
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:39,000
For example, inclusion can twist into a settler colonial invitation to assimilate.

303
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:50,960
Come, join. Be like me. Fourth experiential evidence grounds our understandings in the life experiences of the communities that are studied.

304
00:40:51,470 --> 00:41:02,120
The community members recognize their experiences in the story told by this evaluation and its conclusions that are reached by that inquiry.

305
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:07,579
This source of evidence policy evaluators to spend time with communities upon

306
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:13,460
being invited so that understandings can be created and grounded in context.

307
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:20,639
Fifth consequential evidence brings accountability to our work and provides feedback on

308
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:27,750
our initial understandings by examining what happens or fails to happen as a result,

309
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:33,180
if our evaluation does not move the needle in the direction of social justice,

310
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:39,210
what does this tell us about the accuracy and adequacy of our prior understandings?

311
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:46,230
This can expect to come back and mystics early concern for the social consequences of assessment.

312
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:52,750
Recognizing that validity requires attention to more than measurement and design.

313
00:41:53,140 --> 00:42:00,960
These five sources of evidence can expand our evaluative gaze and strengthen the relevance of our understandings.

314
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:11,260
They can serve as a lens through which to view an evaluation proposal or to determine the strengths and limitations of a report.

315
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:16,510
They can shape what is to be included in a request for proposals.

316
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:24,030
Taking a page from intersectionality, literature, the curious to ask and what else?

317
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:32,310
In other words, we're challenged to press beyond simple understandings, to more fine grained reflection,

318
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:44,580
not only on how evaluation has answered questions of interest, but also on an aspect of a program, context, or community on which it is silent.

319
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:51,459
Good afternoon. I'm Kathy Newcomer and I am just delighted to be here with a great panel.

320
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:56,350
I'm excited and I've already been learning from Karen for many years, but I'm anxious to learn from others.

321
00:42:56,650 --> 00:43:06,520
So I'm going to briefly tell my story of how and why I have embraced the notion of multi cultural validity in a three part story.

322
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:18,280
Part one I basically have been my career and my practice has straddled public administration, public management and program evaluation for many years.

323
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:24,580
Ironically, I took courses on neither when I was getting a Ph.D. in political science.

324
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:31,450
So when I came to GW many years ago and was asked to teach a class on program evaluation,

325
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:35,770
I started figuring out how to learn about it, and I've learned through three ways.

326
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:41,410
First, from a wonderful mentor, Joe Holley, who taught me pretty much all I know.

327
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:49,810
Secondly, from taking a sabbatical at the G.A. in the nineties in which I got really got to know how GAO works.

328
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,409
And then thirdly, by just doing dozens and dozens and dozens,

329
00:43:53,410 --> 00:44:04,000
dozens of evaluations every single semester since I for almost four decades, we I work with students to do pro-bono evaluation.

330
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:09,670
And then I actually actually have gotten paid for a little bit of that now with good reason.

331
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:16,240
I was extremely humble when I started stumbling literally into program evaluation.

332
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:23,920
I was acutely aware of how much I did not know and the term cultural humility, which became my mantra.

333
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:29,110
But we never know how much we don't know. And there's always more to learn.

334
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,400
I basically that's how I've been stumbling through my career.

335
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:39,220
I was able to, fortunately, learn a lot through the American Evaluation Association,

336
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:44,380
particularly thought leaders like hearing their guiding principles,

337
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:51,550
their cultural competency statement, and the and also through Korea,

338
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:58,600
which is the culturally responsive evaluation assessment association out of University of Illinois.

339
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:07,840
So in my day job, I actually teach students how to conduct evaluation, but also how to critique research.

340
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:12,220
And throughout these many years, to make it more easy for students.

341
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:17,290
I have developed a checklist about addressing issues of validity.

342
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,270
The only thing I would say is validity is very much a quantitative research methodology term.

343
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,520
So I talk more about, you know,

344
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:37,210
I also utilize terms that reflect qualitative data analysis and in the way that I have learned and tried to embrace what Karen has talked about,

345
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:40,900
I see my multicultural validity not as something else,

346
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:48,250
not as another pillar, but as something as I call it, a lens through which we should look at all of our claims,

347
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,460
whether they be claims about measurement, accuracy, or claims about relationships or causation.

348
00:45:55,150 --> 00:46:05,260
Part two of my story. So in the last two decades, I've been watching the our federal government in particular.

349
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:17,350
But the world, the OECD countries anyway have embraced evidence based policymaking and with particularly federal agencies and foundations

350
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:26,680
suggesting that random controlled trials or true experiments should be used to identify evidence based interventions,

351
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:31,059
or sometimes called demonstrated evidence based interventions, which I kind of like better,

352
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:36,370
because then you can call them debits, so to say you can have our money if you implement a Debbie.

353
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:43,120
And if all I knew from the beginning, I was concerned that it would be difficult to take something that worked in oh,

354
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:47,290
in Omaha, Nebraska, and pluck it in in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

355
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:54,850
And so I became extremely concerned about the need to tailor to context and develop contextual wisdom,

356
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,590
including wisdom of who are we trying to help, who are we impacting?

357
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:03,430
I like to the impact is because we don't know. They're always beneficiaries.

358
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:13,570
So I've been I recently published in like last month a book on inclusive engagement for equitable outcomes.

359
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:20,500
To get to the point of getting the people who are affected to the table from the beginning and throughout part three.

360
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:29,800
So I mentioned I teach graduate students how to evaluate and assess the rigor of research and evaluation work.

361
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:37,989
And I also have been concerned with the standards that are used in the many registries

362
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:45,250
and clearinghouses to vet interventions that allegedly produce desired outcomes that.

363
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:50,770
Ah than have efficacy. And recently I'm very excited.

364
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:57,550
I have been working with colleagues to develop an enhanced set of evidence standards.

365
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:08,200
And in our our set, basically, we are broadening the perspective on causation and a broader concern on context,

366
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:14,860
a broader and actually additional, because it's been missing pretty much focus on equity.

367
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,720
Thirdly, earlier.

368
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:29,780
Fourthly, a a look at how to utilize mixed methods, qualitative and quantitative and fit the methods to address the meet the questions requirements.

369
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:34,400
And lastly, how to deal with metrological, rigor and reflexivity.

370
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:43,880
Whether you have qualitative or quantitative data and I want to say that we were asked to provide resources.

371
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:51,230
There have been three books that have been extremely influential in my thinking about cultural humility,

372
00:48:51,800 --> 00:49:02,960
and that I think really help us understand the role that racism, sexism and classism affect public policy and administration.

373
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,420
And they and I know that we're going to put them in the chat, but it's stamped from the beginning by Kendi.

374
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:17,950
White Trash, which is 400 Years of Untold History of Class in America by Eisenberg and Invisible Women Data Bias in a World Designed for Men by Perez.

375
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:24,560
I highly recommend those and I will. And I'll end with a just a quick factoid.

376
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:33,769
So in the in the new in the article that we have just written about new standards for assessing the efficacy of

377
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:43,610
interventions we took the top three top rated articles are studies in what works for them over the last five years,

378
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,910
and we coated them against our new criteria.

379
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:56,390
And I just thought I would share one thing, which is 98.4% did not mention anything about multi multicultural validity at all.

380
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:04,610
And in fact the majority did not actually involve anybody of the impact is, well,

381
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:13,070
76.2% did not involve anyone when over two thirds did not give voice to anyone that was actually affected.

382
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:22,550
And basically the only to almost two thirds didn't even break down by by race in terms of outcomes.

383
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:27,620
So we need we need to do some rethinking. Thank you very much.

384
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:33,110
After you've never. All right.

385
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:40,400
And please don't think that the irony of the speaker's identity creating smile me.

386
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:51,020
But I am aware. But I also think that reflects issues related to the power and who who is represented in our field.

387
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:58,910
Although I think even I would they would not they would not call themselves the.

388
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:07,750
Creators of these concepts either. And actually, if you choose to do so,

389
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:20,440
one of the people who have been also involved in kind of really forming these forming these theories and concepts, Mickey Bowman is later.

390
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:29,800
But I wanted you to hear these two women because these two women because they give you a better intro to what it is we're talking about.

391
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:35,860
So let me reflections or thoughts. From.

392
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:57,120
From that? Yes. Yeah.

393
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,600
Who's, who's teaching the city PR class that your. Yes, sir.

394
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:11,220
I would recommend that. I worked with Barbara when I was here, so it's probably the closest.

395
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:17,750
To carry that you probably would get as far as I know.

396
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:27,560
You know, there have been people in believe, believe it or not, natural.

397
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:31,790
I think it has a different name now in the School of Environment, Natural Resources.

398
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,010
What is it called now. It's the state. Yeah.

399
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:41,670
They change the names some. Yeah. Okay.

400
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:53,600
Huh? Used to be now. Yeah. So there there've been some really interesting people over there who been talking about these concepts as well,

401
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:59,640
although they talk about it in the context of environmental justice. But yes, the idea of power.

402
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:07,590
You know, and how power affects who gets to shape what is considered valid.

403
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:12,820
Well, valid evidence. Any other reflections of thoughts?

404
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:45,720
Recent articles. It takes longer.

405
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:16,730
Uh huh. Yeah.

406
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,120
So it is. And it's a it's a delicate balance.

407
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:32,980
Right. Like you are. A delicate balance between doing work that is going to most immediately impact the communities that are being served

408
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:43,490
with the need to be able to disseminate in a way that can promote novel approaches to addressing health issues like.

409
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:49,900
But then there's also, you know, you know, in terms of balancing and, you know,

410
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:56,209
cranking out articles really points to how in some ways an academic setting can

411
00:54:56,210 --> 00:55:03,770
be to run counter to the goals of public health and the values of those values,

412
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:09,560
as well as values related to evaluation and utility.

413
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:18,259
It is a reason why a lot of people struggle with being doing this work in academic settings because

414
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:26,900
it's very hard to publish if you're not following a very traditional scientific framing of research.

415
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:33,030
It's hard to pump it out. So. Yeah.

416
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:36,879
So, you know, it it does, you know, also screen for them.

417
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,060
And then it's also very difficult.

418
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:48,059
You know, these speakers are speaking in the context of government evaluation where it again is also very difficult to do this work.

419
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:55,800
So the fact that Gail was even doing a seminar on multicultural validity in 2020.

420
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:02,620
What, 22 when a lot of this work has been happening for decades?

421
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:05,080
Is this a signal of that?

422
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:14,589
But it also shows that there's progress because federal agencies are very particular about how they want studies to be structured,

423
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:19,420
which can run counter to stakeholder driven evaluation.

424
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:25,830
I know I haven't I haven't quite figured out how to balance it in a way that.

425
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:41,520
We're on smoothly. Honestly. So I hope you see that like the idea of multicultural validity is not.

426
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:51,220
A different kind of validity, but a rather a way of a lens through which you are thinking about things like internal validity,

427
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:59,110
external validity, construct validity. Not just thinking about it in traditional framing, but, you know,

428
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:04,120
thinking about how is the work we're doing again, continuing to further social justice,

429
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:15,040
further equity, you know, further cultural responsiveness rather than undermining it and undermining representation and inclusivity.

430
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:26,860
Oh, I just learn something new. Okay. You can't press the arrow in the videos or so in summary.

431
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:34,510
You know, they close our discussion of validity and we're talking about soundness.

432
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:40,080
But there's many ways to think about soundness and research, including evaluation research.

433
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:52,330
You know, today we talked about external validity, thinking about how we can take the results from a study and generalize them to other settings.

434
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:55,540
Other people, other times, other places.

435
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:05,500
And how important it is to consider what is going on within the study, within the program,

436
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:12,430
how all of that is structured in a way that can be beneficial for learning and evaluation purposes.

437
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:18,310
We talked about threats to external validity, selection and treatment,

438
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:24,399
ways in which we may observe or not observe differences between those who are

439
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:31,810
participating in a program and those who we would want to generalize those findings to.

440
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:36,010
We talked about setting and treatment interactions,

441
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:42,250
ways that the setting itself can make a contribution to the results that we see

442
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:48,010
and how we need to consider those and reflect on those if we are going to.

443
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:53,660
Try to apply the results to another context or another setting.

444
00:58:55,600 --> 00:59:06,700
We talked about interaction of testing and treatment and the ways that the pretest can be can have an influence on the findings.

445
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:11,380
One thing I actually didn't say in relationship to this is that.

446
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:26,210
So I think you can also think about ways that you can be innovative with testing so that it is beneficial and part of the actual program.

447
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:31,259
So, you know, for example, you know,

448
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:39,750
some people have played around with journaling as a way of protesting so that the journaling has a therapeutic effect.

449
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:46,410
And so it's going to be part of the program regardless of if it's being evaluated or not.

450
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:54,540
That's another way to, you know, counter that. And then finally, we talked about multiple treatment effects.

451
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:05,640
The ways in which. And this is. I feel like a very, very true reflection of real life,

452
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:14,700
which is there's probably other programs going on which stresses that you need to know what's going on,

453
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:20,520
not only in the program but outside of the program to better understand the results that you're seeing.

454
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:30,490
Any questions before we close for today? All right.

455
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:36,430
So now so for the recording, the link to the video is on the bottom of the page.

456
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:39,970
Hello, everyone. Stop at the bottom of the slide.

457
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:50,590
So and I really do encourage you, if you have time to really listen to the at least the intros of the other two speakers.

458
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:59,230
It is enlightening to see how, you know, especially since a lot of you will probably go into some, you know,

459
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:04,840
little touch federal government and program funding at some point to really

460
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:10,380
think about how these issues are being grappled with in the federal context.

461
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:16,000
Because if you're going to do CBC, it's going to affect if you're going to do HHS, it's going to affect you.

462
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:23,080
So I'll just encourage that. And then I also encourage you take a break during the fall break.

463
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:29,680
Live vicariously through me. I think I only have one fall break as a student.

464
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:34,840
It was implemented way too late for me. So just have fun.

465
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:39,410
Get some rest. It's a rough life out there. Have a good one.

466
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:49,030
It's also great. It's not just rough. And I've been here for a few minutes, if you have any questions.

467
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:20,739
I was evacuated from the West African country for an hour with only one hour out of town.

468
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:26,950
And we decided that wasn't the case, because if you are ground up, I think we are going to be in there.

469
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:40,110
And I think I was there when there was a 12 hour or an hour or so to make sure we made our program rather than something else.

470
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:49,900
I would actually do both because the thing is, if you only measure your program, you're only measuring what's expected.

471
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:57,770
And so the problem you or you could so the problem you hit is that you're only documenting what you expected to happen.

472
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:10,240
You may not be aware of other factors that are related to other programs, like their mode of delivery, their relationships with Haitians.

473
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:14,640
Artistic, you know, it could be anything.

474
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:18,920
So, um, if you think that there is a case about the treatment,

475
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:29,860
the fact that not only what I ask about, um, I ask about, um, your program, I would ask.

476
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:36,000
Or at least, at least understand the other programs that are taking place.

477
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:46,110
You can even do like semi-structured interviews with like a sample of participants and, you know, find out like how the yeah.

478
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:55,390
How other programs, how they felt like the program that they're participating in led to the results that might come out also.

479
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:11,140
And we didn't talk about that. So we're taking a look at, you know, so we're for the first time, this is just how we get it.

480
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:16,930
Now, how do you what the multicultural.

481
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:24,730
Yeah. Yeah you wish yeah you thank you for that.

482
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:26,980
And thank you for the threat that would allow you to.

483
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:39,470
Mine would allow you to think about its potential problems like, say, you design or your instrumentation.

484
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:55,760
You tailored it so much that now you can apply the results to you can like say your tailor for a white heterosexual female identifying it.

485
01:04:57,530 --> 01:05:04,639
So you tailored it so that it makes sense for that group that now you're kind of like,

486
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:13,420
screw that, it's a sorry for that language, but say it's a black and brown petal sexual female.

487
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:16,100
Identify how we deal with that.

488
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:26,060
So one way is through the instrumentation and like pilot, you could pilot test to see in pilot test groups that you would want to generalize to.

489
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:37,980
So like if I do want to make sure that I like apply applying, you know, I want to be able to generalize to other people who identify as female.

490
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:45,059
Then I could try to diversify my group that test the instrument that's my library.

491
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:51,720
So I know I can make sure I have white females like female or Asian females.

492
01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:56,070
You know, the sense of self just white. Yeah. Yeah, that's one way.

493
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:10,460
Depending on today. People want to know what it takes to send information, accessible information within.

494
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:22,520
You can also think about ways that like as you like,

495
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:33,470
say you evaluate it with in the U.S. with how you already evaluated it and you want to try and generalize to between in these.

496
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:43,660
Participants. Then you can also look at the findings that you've gotten from the evaluation of the program to better understand,

497
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,280
well, why was it effective for them? And then maybe even the evaluation.

498
01:06:49,240 --> 01:07:02,200
Yeah. Yeah. Because if you break it down, you know, um, and I think about that, I closed it, but guess I always wonder about that, how I can add that.

499
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:05,870
That's, I think that's one of the big things about our profession, right?

500
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:20,010
To it's just like, you know, looking at this so you can look at different characteristics of how they are, you know, of like studying people kind of.

501
01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:23,160
And right.

502
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:36,320
You might like you might find that somebody might say something like, man, if you try to think of like some something that would be really common.

503
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:49,190
Like, I really like how Susan explained the concepts of breast self-care, like breast examination, self-examination.

504
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:55,430
You know, she made me feel really comfortable saying that, you know,

505
01:07:55,430 --> 01:08:04,490
there may be something about Susan's delivery that's very kind of Western or, you know, I don't know, like I'm just bit involved in something.

506
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:10,670
So then I have to think about do I have to change the delivery for this VM in these audience?

507
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:21,230
You know, you have to make sure that like one thing I think about is I, I don't know, I'm trying to think,

508
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:27,709
okay, this is I'm not I'm not going to pretend like I understand them in these population.

509
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:31,460
I'm trying to think of something, but maybe the delivery is very western.

510
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:39,930
So if you try to deliver it the same way in an eastern context there and be like, I know this is not right.

511
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:45,110
Like, what I said is not acceptable. Kojo Yeah.

512
01:08:45,690 --> 01:08:49,340
Yeah. Or you can think about like even size, like role,

513
01:08:50,120 --> 01:09:00,800
like maybe an intervention works in a particular place because even things like transportation, like people can.

514
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:05,720
So you have a program where people have to come twice a week.

515
01:09:06,530 --> 01:09:15,950
Well, that's easy. If there's a lot of busses and bus transportation, you know, to get there, I guess it's for low income populations.

516
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:21,350
But it's going to be harder if you're in the rural population where there are no busses.

517
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:26,060
You can't expect people to come twice a week. If there's no busses, there's no cars.

518
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:35,680
So that's just like another. So you're going to have to modify and maybe you only do it once a week, maybe you do it in a big chunk, you know.

519
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:40,930
So that's how we. Mm.

520
01:09:42,610 --> 01:09:46,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

521
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:51,010
Yeah. But you first have to understand your program that way.

522
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:59,590
Like, you have to understand, like, why this setting worked, if it was set and why that work, if it were people, why that worked,

523
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:09,370
if there were places, why that worked, if there were something about the time like this mask wearing would not have worked.

524
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:16,390
If there wasn't coding, we wouldn't have been walking around wear masks if it was just like, Oh yeah, because obviously they help the cold.

525
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:26,680
I mean, that's what Corona virus is, is a cold virus. We want to get away with this without COVID 19, but it's a good idea.

526
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:32,090
You see, I'm like, I'm gonna keep wearing a mask when I get sick. And I and I've seen people do that.

527
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:35,340
The internationals do this. Do that for the year. For decades. Yeah.

528
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:40,690
We never did it. Yeah. Oh yeah.

529
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:46,899
Yeah. So it was something I was, you know, not familiar to an American audience.

530
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:51,910
So there was resistance, but there wasn't as much resistance, is there?

531
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:55,690
Might have been ten years ago when there was an old when we didn't see a reason.

532
01:10:56,230 --> 01:11:00,280
Right. So when you say that we have to understand our program, like why it works.

533
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:07,089
Yeah, yeah, it's good.

534
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:12,430
Like, yeah. When before you pilot testing of like survey tools,

535
01:11:12,610 --> 01:11:24,820
interview protocols or even just co-creation of art like that or even like having like different stakeholders look at the tools before they,

536
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:28,180
they're, they're, they're administer.

537
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:33,520
So like I have an interview protocol for grantees for a project.

538
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:40,450
We have different grantees looking at it, we have different funders looking at it.

539
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:44,980
Then we decide what we're going to use, like how we're going to implement it.

540
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:53,520
Any art for it? Yeah. Yeah.

541
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:59,979
And then there's an article too. I mean, I wasn't there actually is like work on this.

542
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:03,640
I just like the principle of it. It makes sense. I want to understand.

543
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:07,990
Yeah, but so. Yeah, so you can look up.

544
01:12:08,230 --> 01:12:12,430
Campbell Oh, uh huh.

545
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:19,570
Okay. Yeah, you can look at yeah, look at that. And then you look at your.

546
01:12:30,290 --> 01:12:45,010
I know what you're doing now.

547
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:13,320
Yeah. Yeah. And so was it interesting or the.

548
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:24,240
I think you have to.

549
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:49,000
We did that. You know, I would say it's hard to start a business and not.

550
01:13:53,790 --> 01:14:02,960
It's much slower over here because you have to create the relationship, which is hard to do.

551
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:07,840
I mean, we don't like I don't like the way.

552
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:36,660
Can you tell us about this person that they are?

553
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:53,520
Yeah. All right. How to deal with the Delta found three things we know that your family has.

554
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:57,370
I know that. Was there anything else in your.

555
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:22,180
You just work? I know that our.

556
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:51,050
Part of the. I was working with one of them.

557
01:16:05,950 --> 01:16:11,390
Or let me tell you about.

558
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:19,870
Oh, my God. Yeah. When you are doing your work.

559
01:16:23,010 --> 01:16:29,810
When you are implementing a policy.

560
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:40,830
They didn't want you to go. And I'm like.

561
01:16:53,090 --> 01:17:02,850
Segment three and. Well.

562
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:14,630
Ensure that we are able to provide the same validity.

563
01:17:25,530 --> 01:17:28,540
Well, turns out the results.

564
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:37,459
Yeah. Yeah. So what do you say?

565
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:44,110
Like the Reformation that required some.

566
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:50,280
And then the other is that they really like.

567
01:17:51,360 --> 01:18:01,610
The idea that. I think my memory is very.

568
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:26,520
That's. Like with finance.

569
01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:35,550
Some would argue that. So that cooperation.

570
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:47,300
But from treatments. Yeah.

571
01:18:49,660 --> 01:19:04,830
So some might say I feel like. The creation process introduces bias.

572
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:17,030
Times the about. People ask me a question, given that there is a.

573
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:30,390
But with somebody. No actually that's how think the rating measure between the.

574
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:37,110
The consequence that we're trying. How much?

575
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:56,590
I think about that. I wasn't happy with the reservation.

576
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:57,460
You know my time.
