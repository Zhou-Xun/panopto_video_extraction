1
00:00:00,835 --> 00:00:05,769
Premise 2, individual patient data can be used to identify key outcome or

2
00:00:05,769 --> 00:00:07,112
process measures.

3
00:00:07,112 --> 00:00:08,915
So, how is that done?

4
00:00:08,915 --> 00:00:09,639
You have to ask the question.

5
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:13,733
All right, they're showing me all these nice measures, where do they come?

6
00:00:13,733 --> 00:00:16,320
Basically, they're gonna come from three places.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,858
Either claims data, registry data or some kind of surveillance or

8
00:00:20,858 --> 00:00:22,568
extra data collection.

9
00:00:22,568 --> 00:00:23,231
[INAUDIBLE].

10
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:26,668
So let's look a little bit at each of these.

11
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:32,702
There's one problem with the particular claims data,

12
00:00:32,702 --> 00:00:36,570
but in any kind of system which has been partially addressed by some

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,528
of the health care reforms but that it's the attribution problem.

14
00:00:40,528 --> 00:00:45,392
So back in 2007, before the four healthcare reform passed, if you look

15
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:50,256
at Medicare recipients, the typical beneficiary saw seven physicians and

16
00:00:50,256 --> 00:00:52,168
four practises in two years.

17
00:00:52,168 --> 00:00:56,794
So if you're trying to hold people accountable for longer term treatment,

18
00:00:56,794 --> 00:01:02,156
chronic conditions, screening, medical costs, prove you hold responsible there.

19
00:01:04,236 --> 00:01:09,893
They really are not in the same practises, they're not even the same people.

20
00:01:09,893 --> 00:01:12,347
They have no business relationship with each other.

21
00:01:12,347 --> 00:01:14,268
In many cases who is responsible,

22
00:01:14,268 --> 00:01:17,924
no more than half of their visits with their assigned physician.

23
00:01:17,924 --> 00:01:21,599
Minority of patients seen by a physician in a year were assigned to them and

24
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,159
other patients assigned to provide our practise.

25
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,302
Only half of those assignments were stable over three years.

26
00:01:27,302 --> 00:01:32,679
And this has become, you say, well how can this, why is this?

27
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:37,246
Well, it's kind of the shoes on both feet.

28
00:01:37,246 --> 00:01:41,694
But the doctor is hard, just to organise and see people, regularly and

29
00:01:41,694 --> 00:01:42,742
consistently.

30
00:01:42,742 --> 00:01:45,994
On the other hand, patients also wanna be seen when they want to be seen.

31
00:01:45,994 --> 00:01:49,769
They want to wait around for even the next day.

32
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:51,269
[INAUDIBLE] have you seen particularly?

33
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:56,543
I don't think there's a big advantage being seen by the regular doctor for this.

34
00:01:56,543 --> 00:02:01,139
And so, yeah, it's hard, there's part issues on both sides and

35
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:02,545
trying to get that.

36
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:06,261
It's a lot of, if you're gonna measure people and hold them accountable,

37
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:07,606
it makes it hard to do that.

38
00:02:07,606 --> 00:02:12,934
So that was one of the big motivations for healthcare organisations and

39
00:02:12,934 --> 00:02:17,463
why they're called accountable to try and find somebody for

40
00:02:17,463 --> 00:02:19,441
the care of the patients.

41
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:21,846
So can indicators be based on claims?

42
00:02:21,846 --> 00:02:27,062
This is a little bit of a young picture for

43
00:02:27,062 --> 00:02:32,438
lunch time, but pressure ulcers or bad.

44
00:02:32,438 --> 00:02:34,874
For those of you who don't work in work in critical areas,

45
00:02:34,874 --> 00:02:37,176
they happen when people don't move around very much.

46
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:40,599
So I mean they're really sick or debilitated and

47
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:44,361
they just put a lot of pressure on one part of the skin.

48
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:46,824
And this game starts to break down and

49
00:02:46,824 --> 00:02:51,199
it goes through these stages of what are called pressure ulcers.

50
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,471
They can develop in the hospital when people are really sick,

51
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:55,536
if you don't pay attention, moving them frequently.

52
00:02:55,536 --> 00:02:59,272
And that's one of the hallmarks of good nursing care is that people don't develop

53
00:02:59,272 --> 00:03:00,150
pressure ulcers.

54
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,520
So, Medicare decided that they wanted to make a measurement equality

55
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,643
performance measure around the development of pressure ulcers in the hospital.

56
00:03:09,643 --> 00:03:11,883
Seems like something that shouldn't happen,

57
00:03:11,883 --> 00:03:15,643
if you're taking care of the people and you certainly don't want to pay for it.

58
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:20,626
You don't want to pay extra because application of a pressure ulcer and

59
00:03:20,626 --> 00:03:24,615
furthermore, Medicare has decided to actually tighten

60
00:03:24,615 --> 00:03:28,117
down the screws on this one and it's part of this.

61
00:03:28,117 --> 00:03:29,957
This measure is part of it,

62
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:33,877
sort of a package of measures that if you are an outlier on,

63
00:03:33,877 --> 00:03:38,131
they will start deducting from your total Medicare universe.

64
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:40,136
I just want to relate to this.

65
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:46,292
But if you're not doing well on this and a couple other things,

66
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:53,495
you could end up having 1 to 3% of your total Medicare reimbursement for

67
00:03:53,495 --> 00:03:58,978
several million dollars on this in a couple of minutes.

68
00:03:58,978 --> 00:04:02,209
It seems like it should be easy to manage.

69
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:07,207
So if you look at claims data, this is the hospital rank for

70
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:09,962
hospital in the United States.

71
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:15,650
By looking at administrative data for hospital acquired, the codes for

72
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:22,562
hospital acquired pressure ulcers, there's about the average is about 0.15%.

73
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:26,652
There's a range from 0 to 0.74%.

74
00:04:26,652 --> 00:04:33,775
And so this was actually still being used, I think as care measure, and

75
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:39,132
if you're in the top the portal, you're let's go.

76
00:04:39,132 --> 00:04:46,510
[INAUDIBLE].

77
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:52,702
So it will always be there [INAUDIBLE] happened interesting?

78
00:04:54,953 --> 00:04:56,978
But how else could you look?

79
00:04:56,978 --> 00:04:58,053
How else could you do this?

80
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:05,349
What would be your concern

81
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:09,786
about these claims?

82
00:05:12,776 --> 00:05:17,914
>> It's based on claims, [INAUDIBLE].

83
00:05:17,914 --> 00:05:20,387
>> Right, so you worry a little bit about hiding and

84
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:23,354
of course that's a general concern to Medicare, right?

85
00:05:23,354 --> 00:05:25,343
Because you're paid based on their claim.

86
00:05:25,343 --> 00:05:29,282
So how does Medicare enforce, how do we know the taxpayers,

87
00:05:29,282 --> 00:05:32,616
the hospitals are bring everybody in the highest.

88
00:05:32,616 --> 00:05:38,116
[INAUDIBLE].

89
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:48,773
Whatever percent of the charges they find that are built wrong

90
00:05:48,773 --> 00:05:51,012
that often your total Medicare.

91
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:56,638
So it's a big stick and and then they find

92
00:05:56,638 --> 00:06:02,442
millions of dollars, it's a big stick.

93
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:06,502
But they do add for billing and for

94
00:06:06,502 --> 00:06:11,288
coding that goes against their rules.

95
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:14,728
So if you want to cheque that it would be a way of doing it.

96
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:18,601
I mean it's something we're developing measure.

97
00:06:18,601 --> 00:06:21,132
You might even think Medicare when they put this measure in.

98
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:25,605
They wouldn't want to cheque to see

99
00:06:25,605 --> 00:06:30,084
that measure another way to do it.

100
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:33,745
You can call it the sheep test, which is you go and you look under the sheet, and

101
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:35,909
you see whether the person has pressure also,

102
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:38,154
which is basically some kind of surveillance.

103
00:06:38,154 --> 00:06:42,877
It's a little more complicated because you wanna know you're only responsible for

104
00:06:42,877 --> 00:06:44,882
the ones that have happened since.

105
00:06:44,882 --> 00:06:50,381
Many people come in with pressure also you're responsible for

106
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:53,190
one new ones itself [INAUDIBLE].

107
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,702
California actually has a statewide surveillance system that does this,

108
00:06:57,702 --> 00:07:00,576
when nurses go out, they got four times a year.

109
00:07:00,576 --> 00:07:04,098
They just look at everybody in the hospital and

110
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:07,905
they built these points point prevalence rates.

111
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:11,108
That can give us a look under every sheet they staged them themselves.

112
00:07:11,108 --> 00:07:16,259
They're trained in staging, and it's not totally trivial because

113
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:22,409
the rules are about certain stages too or any pressure on their at certain stages.

114
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:28,945
And so, but surprisingly Medicare never even looked at that thing, but we did.

115
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:30,969
And that's on the lower and

116
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:35,722
is what the rates are by surveillance data in the same hospital.

117
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,690
So these are actually California State hospitals.

118
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,754
The upper is what each hospital has by the coding data and

119
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:45,572
the lower is what they had by the surveillance data.

120
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:48,877
So what do you notice about that?

121
00:07:48,877 --> 00:07:53,024
Yeah different, a lot differs how much higher rate and

122
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:55,377
these are hospital acquired.

123
00:07:55,377 --> 00:08:00,275
So it's still not it's 2%, but that's starting to sound more and more.

124
00:08:00,275 --> 00:08:00,838
Yeah. >> So

125
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:04,628
this kicks in your, that has already become [INAUDIBLE].

126
00:08:04,628 --> 00:08:09,213
Right, so they actually go back through the records, look what stock,

127
00:08:09,213 --> 00:08:12,306
you know, look, look document and look at the.

128
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:16,135
Whenever nursing home records came with them and yeah,

129
00:08:16,135 --> 00:08:19,157
look at the so it's basically a service.

130
00:08:19,157 --> 00:08:24,133
So the surveillance system, that gives you a very different look.

131
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:28,778
And if you look at if you were gonna make quartile which is what and

132
00:08:28,778 --> 00:08:31,890
these portals money behind them, right?

133
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,796
The court trials for is very bad Medicare,

134
00:08:34,796 --> 00:08:39,477
I mean if you build Medicare what you see is you see where the portal for

135
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:43,857
people who are at risk of getting financial penalties from CMS.

136
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:48,153
And you see where they fall on the surveillance state and they're pretty much

137
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:52,596
humanly distributed throughout the what would be the ranks developed on this.

138
00:08:52,596 --> 00:08:57,339
So you know this is not some sort of data

139
00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:02,393
that's what I want validate your data.

140
00:09:02,393 --> 00:09:07,606
This operating programme funded by the state

141
00:09:07,606 --> 00:09:13,260
of really decided you needed to measure this.

142
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,091
You have a programme like this to measure with,

143
00:09:16,091 --> 00:09:18,928
we have decided that it's worth paying for.

144
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:24,598
Yeah, but obviously one state at a time of it although since Medicare has continued

145
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:29,702
to focus on on these rates, they actually about to drop the surveillance.

146
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:34,390
And you know why?

147
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,219
Why the differences?

148
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:41,459
Well, the diagnosis in the coding world can only be based on a provider note.

149
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,987
They cannot look at anything in a nurse note to cope.

150
00:09:44,987 --> 00:09:48,968
That's the coding documenting the position, right?

151
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:54,076
So the nurse and the wound specialist notes where a lot of us get documented.

152
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:56,942
You can only be used for staging but they can be used for

153
00:09:56,942 --> 00:09:59,183
whether they have pressure ulcer or not.

154
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:02,780
If the doctor's note doesn't mention furthermore audits only

155
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:07,254
require the diagnosis to be listed, if it's required for the building level.

156
00:10:07,254 --> 00:10:10,858
So Medicare doesn't say you have to list every diagnosis.

157
00:10:10,858 --> 00:10:15,704
What the rules say is that you have to list the diagnoses that are required

158
00:10:15,704 --> 00:10:19,287
to justify the level of building that you are asking.

159
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:22,631
Your level building doesn't depend on the pressure ulcer.

160
00:10:22,631 --> 00:10:24,636
No need to, there's no reason.

161
00:10:24,636 --> 00:10:27,734
You have to include nothing that says you,

162
00:10:27,734 --> 00:10:32,479
there's no requirement to code hospital acquired conditions.

163
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:36,349
Even though we now have a whole don't you do not pay for

164
00:10:36,349 --> 00:10:39,365
hospital acquired conditions programme.

165
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:44,441
There's no requirement we're talking about, right?

166
00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:49,301
This data probably didn't have any gaming because it was before

167
00:10:49,301 --> 00:10:53,715
the Medicare pressure ulcer incentives went into place.

168
00:10:53,715 --> 00:10:57,844
All right, only plan or

169
00:10:57,844 --> 00:11:02,593
here fire conditions often

170
00:11:02,593 --> 00:11:07,763
reported, but none of that.

171
00:11:07,763 --> 00:11:15,266
There's no proof that coding islands don't even say they have to report.

172
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:23,035
So that's the problem when you're sort of going to use claims data.

173
00:11:23,035 --> 00:11:24,486
So, you have to know this and

174
00:11:24,486 --> 00:11:28,054
a lot of times these kinds of things you don't know unless you go out and

175
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:31,587
spend some what I do with my researchers who are working in this area.

176
00:11:31,587 --> 00:11:35,232
Jennifer weddings who did this work starting in September,

177
00:11:35,232 --> 00:11:39,882
you need to go down and spend a week or two with your coders watching them code.

178
00:11:39,882 --> 00:11:44,002
And ask them all sorts of questions about what they do and why and

179
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:48,899
when they do it and why they you need to understand what the rules are in order

180
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,033
to know how you can use the data.

181
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:56,195
Yeah, so that's one of the big you know one of the big issues with with

182
00:11:56,195 --> 00:12:01,276
it's sort of remarkable that they report as much as they do come on.

183
00:12:01,276 --> 00:12:05,886
So another area that's been focused on as a hospital

184
00:12:05,886 --> 00:12:10,614
acquired condition is is a catheter associated UTI.

185
00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:14,645
I there's now efforts to reproduce catheter associated UTI.

186
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:18,574
They're sort of a similar issue you know and

187
00:12:18,574 --> 00:12:23,363
Medicare had a programme based on claims data for UTIs.

188
00:12:23,363 --> 00:12:27,591
That is pretty much the same as it was for the pressure ulcers.

189
00:12:27,591 --> 00:12:33,695
And basically the impact of this slide is to show you that again the hospital coding

190
00:12:33,695 --> 00:12:39,725
of a acquired catheter associated UTI is very different than what you would see.

191
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,989
If you had a position abstract or go through the record and

192
00:12:42,989 --> 00:12:45,505
making judge whether there's Catherine.

193
00:12:45,505 --> 00:12:50,230
For some reason, in this case Medicare, we have decided that they needed to change

194
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,226
their data source and there's now actually a surveillance programme.

195
00:12:54,226 --> 00:12:58,619
The first half of associate UTI, it's run by the CDC, and

196
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:04,192
all hospitals are mandated to report 30 days and infections to the CDC.

197
00:13:04,192 --> 00:13:08,500
And that's now the data used by Medicare for

198
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:15,960
tracking the complication hospital, fire, hospital acquired capital.

199
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,813
The idea being Is it, yeah we should try

200
00:13:20,813 --> 00:13:25,078
to minimise the use of catheters,

201
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:28,620
increase the risk, right?

202
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,985
So summarising some of these pitfalls related to the way

203
00:13:33,985 --> 00:13:39,590
trying to measure individual patient data attribution.

204
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,859
Building is often job one and claims data and

205
00:13:41,859 --> 00:13:44,075
people follow the building regulations.

206
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:48,619
They don't follow necessarily the ones that were coding that would help

207
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,904
quality improvement the way you would like them to.

208
00:13:51,904 --> 00:13:57,349
There's and it's the pre existing condition indicator is a new one.

209
00:13:57,349 --> 00:14:00,309
It used to be that you couldn't tell from claims

210
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:03,569
data whether a condition was preexisting or or new.

211
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:05,461
That obviously made things really difficult for

212
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:07,545
seeing applications that happened in the hospital.

213
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:12,432
But that changed a few years ago, California has been using one for

214
00:14:12,432 --> 00:14:18,016
years which is why you'll see a lot of studies depends on condition later and

215
00:14:18,016 --> 00:14:19,336
they validated.

216
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:20,549
So it's a pretty good measure.

217
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:26,446
Other states basically phased it in relatively recently and

218
00:14:26,446 --> 00:14:33,390
you to get a sense of how valid there conditional flag is registry data.

219
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:38,238
You can have compromised data quality because it's expensive.

220
00:14:38,238 --> 00:14:41,590
Registering means you're collecting data above and

221
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:46,441
beyond what easily available extractable from electronic medical record.

222
00:14:46,441 --> 00:14:51,114
And sometimes people compromise on that and then surveillance down data.

223
00:14:51,114 --> 00:14:53,480
The issues there didn't really talk about but

224
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,099
that you have to have some kind of sampling design.

225
00:14:56,099 --> 00:15:01,075
Because you're not there's not watching all the time and you need standards and

226
00:15:01,075 --> 00:15:01,818
training.

227
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:06,882
If you're going to really get the benefits of it and then you have to deal with this

228
00:15:06,882 --> 00:15:12,261
issue of prevalence versus encountered it, there's a difference between the two.
