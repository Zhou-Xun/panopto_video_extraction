1
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:12,310
Yes. Oh, there it is.

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:20,460
The idea. My mom has been sending me this for like two weeks.

3
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,719
She keeps sending these, like, they're still on the shelf. Do you have them? Like, I don't have any of these.

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,810
I promise. So. All right, you guys are up.

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:51,739
These are all folks. Okay.

6
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,760
So today you're going to be talking about carcinogens in dry shampoos.

7
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,440
So this company called Unilever, which is a good consumer goods company,

8
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:08,540
they recently recalled a bunch of their dry shampoo products such as TresemmÃ© Dove, other products like that.

9
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:18,590
As of October 20, 21. So this was due to a fear of benzene being there in excessive amounts in their products.

10
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:25,010
So benzene is a chemical that can lead to leukemia and other blood clotting cancers.

11
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:34,610
So it's also present in a lot of everyday products, such as detergents, homes and household and stuff like that.

12
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,170
So yeah, so balance here, which is an independent testing laboratory.

13
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:45,380
Benzene in 70% of dry shampoo samples that they tested among multiple companies.

14
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:55,280
So they filed an FDA citizen petition which asked the FDA to request recalls and update regulations on the use of benzene in these products.

15
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:03,110
And some products that are tested contain benzene levels as high as 170 times the EPA's concentration limit.

16
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:09,740
That's very high. And I feel like dry shampoos deserve special attention because they're likely used indoors.

17
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,270
And because of this, benzene may linger and be inhaled for prolonged periods of time.

18
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:23,370
Can I just. That talk that's. So we think this article is a really good example of the dangers of the cosmetics industry

19
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,670
because it's something that affects a lot of Americans or a lot of people in general.

20
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,510
I really don't know the long term effects of these on our health.

21
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,870
And this is really significant because these are some of the most widespread and popular brands in shampoo and cosmetics.

22
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:43,960
And I think we I've heard of all of them. So the exposure was relatively pretty high for this.

23
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,980
Like I said, because we don't know what the long term effects are. We know what's going to happen before the level of exposure was recognized.

24
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:57,670
And as such, it's pretty safe to assume that there are a lot of other products that we don't know about that have other carcinogens or benzene.

25
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,390
Like I said, something else and we just. Sorry, I didn't just want that happen to be caught.

26
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:09,389
So overall, we picked this article to shed light on the fact that it shouldn't really be up to consumers to do independent

27
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,500
research and try to sort out right and wrong articles to figure out what products they should buy.

28
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,690
It should be up to the very first figures we have in place like the FDA to actually to do the job in this case.

29
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,620
It's really scary to think that there's over 170 times what was allowed.

30
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,600
So thank you. You have any questions? Is this something?

31
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,000
Sure. Also,

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:42,560
I will say so the company released a statement saying that the levels that are assumed to be present in their products currently shouldn't lead to.

33
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:48,560
Like cancer or other risk factors based on, but they're just being overly cautious.

34
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,800
So they did release a statement on that. But yeah, I love all those.

35
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:58,320
The statements are always very interesting. Right. Because it's it's like spinning it.

36
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,849
You know what I mean? Like, they're always trying to be like, oh, no, we totally we totally it.

37
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:07,610
We did it saying, look, we talked about it, but they always kind of spin it in a way that makes it be like, but it's really not that bad.

38
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:13,820
But out of an abundance of caution, like, if you don't want to use this her, that's fine.

39
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,560
Do you know what I mean? Like, everyone was very. Yeah, they did use that, like.

40
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:26,990
Sure they did. Yeah, of course they did. Out of an abundance of caution, even though it's probably nothing at all in my eyes.

41
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:35,540
I was just listening to a podcast about, you know, what does that mean?

42
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,649
That they always it's like one of those healthcare companies and they do a lot of advertising

43
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:45,320
on a podcast and they have the crumbles that were like making everybody really sick. Daily harvest, that's the one.

44
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,790
So they were just like talking about how they like the emails that they sent out.

45
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,330
Didn't even say like recall or anything like that. It was just very like, Oh, it's probably no big deal.

46
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:04,340
But you know, while we were in the hospital had to go and they still don't know what caused it anyway.

47
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:15,330
Good job, guys. All right.

48
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,370
Yes. I'm going to pass this around because you guys got.

49
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,370
It's still. But this one that.

50
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,490
Yes. Okay.

51
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,580
All right. So that's it. That's the that's a wrap on the news article presentations, guys.

52
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:45,919
The pier will completed in the segment. I hope those were kind of I always think those are sort of fun.

53
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:52,549
I think it's interesting to see what catches you guys as I and I think it's interesting to see kind of what's coming up these days.

54
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,080
So. Okey dokey.

55
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:04,810
So today we're going to be talking about infection and cancer. So this is just our outline.

56
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:10,620
I'm not going to go into this. So lots of different infectious agents have been associate with cancer risk.

57
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:17,190
And we've talked about some of these before, kind of in our introductions or as we've gone through last week and have met, we talked about HPV.

58
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,370
So HPV has been associated with number one with the bullet of cervical cancer, but certainly head and neck cancer as well as other cancers.

59
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:31,080
Right. H pylori is a bacteria that's been associated the risk of gastric cancer and then HIV.

60
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,420
There are actually several cancers that are AIDS defining illnesses.

61
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:41,510
So do you guys know about what that means? I see blank faces.

62
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,680
So being HIV positive means you're HIV positive.

63
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,890
It's distinct from AIDS, which is when your immune system gets depressed enough that you start getting some of these opportunistic infections.

64
00:06:52,760 --> 00:07:02,659
And I think somebody like a clinician has told me this has changed a bit, but historically, AIDS was defined as having a CD4 count lower,

65
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,180
like a lab test result for your CD4 lymphocytes below a certain level or

66
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,780
presence of one or more kind of signature opportunistic infections or diseases.

67
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,810
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Kaposi sarcoma are two cancers that are AIDS defined as illnesses.

68
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,280
Meaning, if you're HIV positive and you get one of these, then you're considered to have AIDS.

69
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,240
HPV and HCV. Hepatitis B and hepatitis C cause liver cancer.

70
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,710
Again, I do not know why all of them have to start with an H.

71
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,640
It's for for test taking purposes.

72
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,809
It is not ideal. And beyond that they all. HPV.

73
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,900
HPV. HCV arrived too late.

74
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,440
So it's like the worst lecture to give and the worst thing to try to remember for a test.

75
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,100
So I don't know why I'm apologizing. I didn't name them, but that's what they are.

76
00:07:52,970 --> 00:08:00,230
I recognize that that is less than ideal. So it's estimated that more than 20% of cancers are caused by infectious agents.

77
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,160
Okay, so we know there's an association, but is it causal?

78
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:15,169
So one of the ways that we try to decide if something is a causal factor or not is is there a biologic mechanism that we can say?

79
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:19,910
Is it, you know, is there some plausible biologic mechanism by which this thing could cause cancer?

80
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:26,989
And absolutely, these viruses, these direct oncogenic viruses in particular cause increased mutation rates.

81
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,250
They reduce ptosis, you get increased abnormal cell proliferation.

82
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,760
And there are indirect mechanisms as well that we all talk about.

83
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:45,200
So this is an ironic monograph. It's a little bit old now, but you can see that there's lots of different agents that are associated with risk.

84
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,440
So Epstein-Barr virus is associated with these differential carcinoma and lymphomas,

85
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:58,430
and established mechanistic events include cell proliferation, apoptosis, inhibition and genomic instability.

86
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,660
Okay, so there's lots of established mechanistic events for these viruses.

87
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,639
Hepatitis C causes liver cancer. This one is a little bit less direct.

88
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,570
It causes inflammation and cirrhosis, which can then lead to cancer. We'll talk about that in a bit.

89
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,690
HPV causes all kinds of stuff. As we've talked about, this one is a directly pathogenic virus.

90
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:23,060
It causes DNA damage, amortization of cells, and it's cancer talk.

91
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,760
And then each pylori, which is the bacteria we've talked about, causes inflammation, methylation and mutation.

92
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay. So we're going to talk about a bunch of different examples. Okay.

93
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:44,490
I'm not going to do this list again. I will say, though, that, like Epstein,

94
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:51,209
some of these viruses that have been very canonically associated with a very high risk of one cancer in particular,

95
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,930
like Epstein-Barr virus has been strongly associated with Nasopharyngeal cancer.

96
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:00,569
Right. But now people are starting to find less strong associations with other cancers.

97
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:06,540
So there is starting to become some literature that actually bar breast cancer, which seems much less clear.

98
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,370
Right. But it is there HPV.

99
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,710
You know, we started with cervical cancer. Now we know it causes throat cancer. People are starting to move a little bit down.

100
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,540
There is some evidence that perhaps HPV could be associated with esophageal cancer.

101
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,559
Right. And so I think, um, you know,

102
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,410
we've gotten a lot of the low hanging fruit kind of these canonical cancers that are very strongly associated with these infectious agents.

103
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,500
But we may be finding, like other associations that are kind of less strong.

104
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:44,159
Yes. They don't like.

105
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,490
How they don't like. Yes.

106
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,550
Yeah. So they're actually able to see the virus in like the cancer cells and how it is affected.

107
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:02,020
So it is I will say that Epstein-Barr and these differential cancer is very it is really only in like Asia, East Asian countries.

108
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,360
So there's something else going on, right? A lot of these infections, HPV is another good example.

109
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:14,920
Right. Like so many people get infected with HPV, a lot of I mean, that's why we vaccinate people when they're nine,

110
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,110
ten, 11 years old is because as soon as people become sexually active, everybody gets exposed.

111
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:24,640
Right. And most people even who are exposed, you know, so there's so many different types.

112
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:33,430
There's the oncogenic types. Even people who are exposed and infected with the genotypes don't have the persistent infection that leads to cancer.

113
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,579
So that's why we don't know we're going to get into this.

114
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:47,770
That's why we don't screen women younger than 30, I believe, with the HPV DNA test, because we expect them to have an even high risk,

115
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:52,030
but most of them will clear it and not have this persistent infection that leads to cancer.

116
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,990
So there's all of these viruses are associated, but it's like that plus.

117
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,600
Right. You need something else to like have that virus lead to cancer.

118
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:06,210
Does that make sense? All right.

119
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,890
So this is all kind of immune related, right?

120
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,110
And it can happen in a couple of. A lot of it is immune related.

121
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,399
Some of it is directly oncogenic.

122
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:24,059
So, for example, the HPV inserts itself into the host cell DNA in particular places that cause cause disruptions in tumor suppressor genes.

123
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:32,280
So we'll talk about that. But often infections act by being either immuno stimulation, immuno stimulating or immuno suppressing.

124
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:37,859
And we're going to talk about it seems odd that both of these like opposite things could both lead to cancer.

125
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:46,379
But we're going to talk about how that can happen. So if you have HIV infection, you have a depressed immune system which then allows HIV,

126
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:51,720
the Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpes virus, to set up an infection and lead to Kaposi sarcoma.

127
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,970
So in this case, immune suppression allows another pathogen to come in that can cause cancer that it would

128
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:03,299
not normally cause in a healthy immune person with a healthy immune system lymphoma.

129
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:10,500
On the other hand, there's lots of different infections that have been associated with lymphomas.

130
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:18,910
Also lifestyle and occupational factors have been associated. Right. So let's talk specifically about Epstein-Barr virus and Africans Parkinsonism.

131
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,400
I just told you, Epstein-Barr causes Nasopharyngeal cancer. It also causes this cancer.

132
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:29,969
And this is one where we kind of have the mechanism worked out. So this was actually the first human tumor virus to be recognized.

133
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:36,720
It can actually transform normal human lymphocytes, like in cell culture, so it can actually change normal lymphocytes into cancer cells.

134
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:42,150
Infection with EBV occurs earlier in populations that are poor and disadvantaged.

135
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:47,880
So in Equatorial Africa, for example, about 100% of people are infected before four years of age.

136
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:55,230
And as you said, worldwide, about 90% of adults shows here, a lot of serologic evidence of prior EBV infection.

137
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:02,070
We know that is causal and in mono and maybe Olympic lymphoma,

138
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:05,670
proliferative syndrome that can be fatal in young adults who are genetically predisposed.

139
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:11,660
So mono is no fun. I had it when I was in college.

140
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,790
I don't think I've ever been that sick before. Did not like.

141
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:24,560
But this is a member of the herpes virus family. It can have asymptomatic presence in the host.

142
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:31,040
And as we said, it's associated with these lymphomas. It's a necessary but not sufficient cause of lymphoma.

143
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,210
And these are potential cancer.

144
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:41,000
So in Burkitt lymphoma and protection in particular, we know that co-infection with malaria causes depression of T cells and loss of viral control,

145
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,040
and that is how you end up with that Burkitt lymphoma. That makes sense.

146
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:57,180
All right. So that is one where it's actually in, you know, proliferative.

147
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:05,670
All right. Hepatocellular carcinoma, on the other hand, is caused by hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses.

148
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:12,210
So there are kind of low, intermediate and high prevalence areas of the world, low prevalence areas like North America, Western Europe.

149
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:17,560
So there's Hbsag, which is the hepatitis B surface antigen.

150
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,970
So this is a marker of current infection with hepatitis B.

151
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,570
There's also hepatitis B antibodies which indicate recent or past infection.

152
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:34,980
So the prevalence of current infection is up to a half a percent in these low prevalence areas and recent or past infection, 4 to 6%.

153
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:45,930
Compare that to these intermediate prevalence areas where you have up to 7% of current infection, 20, 55% past infection.

154
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,930
And these high prevalence areas, China, Southeast Asia, you got up to 15% current infections,

155
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:55,950
60 to 90% of people have the antibodies indicating recent or past infection.

156
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,600
Right. Hepatitis B vaccination works.

157
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:08,950
There is definitely a causal relationship because if you if you vaccinate against hepatitis B, you get a reduction in liver cancer.

158
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,560
So they instituted a nationwide vaccination program in Taiwan in 1984.

159
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,740
They started with neonates of HPV carrier mothers.

160
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:24,310
Then they moved to all neonates in 1987 and expanded up to adults by 1990.

161
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,360
And you had hepatitis B positivity declining quite a bit.

162
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:34,520
And we've had liver cancer rates declining as well. So vaccination does work.

163
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,440
Unfortunately, we do not have a vaccine against hepatitis C, which we will talk about.

164
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,820
So what? This is an ugly old picture of how this works.

165
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,870
But you have this is a healthy a host cell.

166
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,329
A lot of these viruses work by inserting their viral DNA into the host DNA.

167
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:57,010
And then when the cell replicates, it actually does the work for it and creates the virus,

168
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,350
replicates the virus DNA, and then you get the viral particles coming out of the cell to infect other cells.

169
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:10,889
When you get problems and when you have a directly academic virus is when the virus tends

170
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:15,750
to incorporate its DNA into a place where there is an important cancer related gene,

171
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:21,090
like a really important tumor suppressor gene, for example.

172
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,320
And then it disrupts that Gene's activity in the host cell, transforming it.

173
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:34,400
This is a mutation that is known to be associated with poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma.

174
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,780
It is actually evidence of aflatoxin related carcinogenesis.

175
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:47,690
Right. So this is an example of how you can look for particular genetic mutations as evidence of a particular.

176
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:57,320
Etiologic agent, right. In this case is not a viral agent. It's aflatoxin, which we've talked about before.

177
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,460
But it's it aflatoxin inserts itself into the p53 gene.

178
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:08,209
Right. Which we know is very important. And you can see actually that this is this can show you kind of where in the

179
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:12,650
world aflatoxin is most important and similar things can be done with viruses.

180
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:22,740
So now let's talk about cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

181
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:30,210
So in the 1950s, we had reports that at least 80% of liver cancers occurred in cirrhotic livers in the U.S. and Western Europe,

182
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,600
3 to 10% of men with cirrhosis went on to develop liver cancer.

183
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,150
And it was higher in Africa and Asia. And in studies in Japan and Taiwan.

184
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,729
The hepatitis B antigen carriers, meaning, of course,

185
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:47,580
that they had they have a current infection with cirrhosis, were in 4 to 6 fold greater risk than non carriers.

186
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:56,669
So these two things kind of seem to go together, right? This is how hepatitis C leads to liver cancer.

187
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:00,960
Right. So if you get infected with hepatitis C, you might end up with an acute infection.

188
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:05,910
20 to 30% of people might have symptoms. Lots of people clear it.

189
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:14,130
Some people go on to have this rare, fulminant hepatitis. But 75 to 85% will have a chronic infection with HCV.

190
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:22,490
You might get things outside the liver happening, but a lot of these people go on to have chronic active hepatitis.

191
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:28,280
And what that means that over 20 years, 10 to 20% will develop cirrhosis, which is like scarring of the liver.

192
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:33,670
Right. You can actually die of cirrhosis.

193
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:40,370
Right. But of those 10 to 20% with cirrhosis, 1 to 4% per year will end up with that cellular carcinoma.

194
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,790
And this is kind of that inflammation pathway.

195
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:53,690
Right. So as we've said, imagine that you have remember over here, we have people who had a hepatitis B plus cirrhosis.

196
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:58,490
So sometimes that you can get cirrhosis through other ways. Right. Heavy alcohol consumption, for example.

197
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:03,980
But if you're CO-INFECTED with hepatitis C and hepatitis B, that can be extra bad, right?

198
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,879
Okay. So we talked a little bit.

199
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,600
Ivan alluded to this, that there are direct oncogenic viruses and indirect viruses.

200
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:23,690
Right. So the direct are the ones that actually the viruses infect the cell and disrupt an important cancer related gene.

201
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,520
So they actually alter the DNA directly transforming that cell into a cancer cell.

202
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,940
HPV, EBV, HPV, all work that way. Indirect acting viruses we talked about like hepatitis C,

203
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:40,600
how it causes cirrhosis and HIV depresses the immune system, allowing other viruses to come in.

204
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,810
Those are not directly interacting with the DNA of the cell to cause cancer.

205
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:51,370
Right. So direct oncogenic viruses modify host cell proliferation by modulating these

206
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:55,239
proliferation and anti-proliferation pathways through direct gene regulation.

207
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,640
Direct interaction with oncogene or tumor suppressor genes often interfere with apoptosis.

208
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:06,850
They stimulate cell growth by forming a complex with epidermal growth factor receptors and gene environment.

209
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:15,219
Interaction is still important. Write even if you mess up one being, you still have to have other genes, 3 to 7 heads total to end up with cancer.

210
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:20,960
Right. Here is and this is HPV.

211
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,540
So this is very well worked out. This is the HPV genome.

212
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:33,510
Viral DNA is a little circle, so it's got the L1, L2 and then e one through seven genes in its genome.

213
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:41,280
The E6 and E7 genes are the real problem. These integrate into host cell DNA and they interact with many cell proteins,

214
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,270
notably RB and p53, which we have learned about are very important tumor viruses.

215
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:52,800
Remember, we learned that if you have a mutation, if you're born with a mutation in these very bad hereditary cancer syndromes occur, right?

216
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:59,400
The constant activity of E6 and E7 proteins lead to increased g, increasing genomic instability,

217
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,780
accumulation of marker gene mutations and for the loss of cell growth control, ultimately cancer.

218
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:10,080
Okay. And they found this because they actually have been able to find the viral DNA in cancer cells.

219
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:17,770
You can actually find quantitative differences in the 67 proteins between high and low risk HPV.

220
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,430
Indirect tumor viruses, as we've had a couple examples of, do not cause malignant transformation directly.

221
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:31,320
It's a little more difficult to assess causality with these, right?

222
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:36,940
Tumors aren't inevitable, and many other factors may contribute to carcinogenesis.

223
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:44,020
Right. HIV immune inhibition was one of our examples of this, so it's a little bit less like of a direct line.

224
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:49,480
You can have a little bit less of like direct laboratory evidence, for example.

225
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:54,520
So it's a little harder to assess. All right.

226
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,929
So let's talk about some of the major cancers that are caused by infections, cervical cancer we've talked about before.

227
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:05,170
It's the second most common cancer among women worldwide. But more than 80% of the global burden is in developing countries.

228
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:10,960
There is more than a 20 fold difference between the highest and lowest incidence rates of cervical cancer worldwide.

229
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:18,750
This is a very important disparity. Noninvasive cervical cancer is typically typically symptomless.

230
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:22,980
Once you have invasive cervical cancer, you might have bleeding, discharge and discomfort.

231
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:31,100
How many women do you know who are going to run to the doctor, particularly if they're in a developing country, if they have bleeding a discharge?

232
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:39,330
I hear women in the audience going, yeah, that that can be anything that can be a weird day.

233
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,349
You know what I mean? It's can be like, oh, my period came early. It can be a million different things, right?

234
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:48,540
So like nothing, none of that is going to send any woman running to the doctor probably.

235
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:53,550
Right. Advanced disease, which of course, is bad.

236
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:58,080
You have more severe symptoms, right. From the growth and spread of the tumor.

237
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,690
And so often this is where it's found in developing countries because the symptoms tend to get pretty bad before people go.

238
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:09,899
And we don't have great screening programs often in these developing countries.

239
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,430
Right. There's a couple of different pathologic types.

240
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:20,100
So again, a common theme with all of these cancers, right, is there's usually multiple subtypes.

241
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:29,429
Cancer is not one disease. Even within the anatomic site, there's different subtypes that all behave differently and have different risk factors.

242
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,810
And I think all of you are finding this with your cancers that you are doing for your projects, right?

243
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,879
So there's squamous cell carcinoma which originates from the epithelial cells

244
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,900
and this is the most common but 80 to 90% of all malignancies in most settings.

245
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:50,730
There's also adenocarcinoma which originates from the glandular cells, and there's this recent trend work toward rising incidence.

246
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:59,690
And that that's a little bit unexplained, I think. All right, so we have histological classification.

247
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:03,470
So we have this various different systems.

248
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,959
I'm not asking you to memorize these, but just know that we have we have the best the system,

249
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:16,610
the sense system and common dysplasia terminology for categorizing these cervical lesions.

250
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,089
So this is all pre-cancer, right?

251
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:29,770
So you have maybe cellular tips and ones into two and three, which kind of overlaps with the beginning of the cancer staging, right.

252
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:35,690
So the beginning of cancer staging is stage zero, which is the same thing as some three that's carcinoma in situ.

253
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,030
And then you would have stage one, two, three, four.

254
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:48,430
So remember, this is a continuum, as we've talked about before, of cellular changes from normal to very bad in advanced cancer.

255
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,989
Right. And in cervical cancer, we know about the pre-cancerous lesions.

256
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:59,630
And so we've got these nice we can we can stage the pre-cancerous lesions all the way up through front cancer.

257
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,110
Right. Does that make sense to everybody? Okay.

258
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,460
So this is what a pathologist would look at.

259
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,990
I always think this is kind of fascinating because does anybody look at this and be like, oh, yeah, I can see the difference there.

260
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,590
Pathologists are amazing, super well trained. They can just look at this and know.

261
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:29,620
I mean, I can sort of see here that like there's this. I don't know.

262
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:35,259
Actually, I can't tell. It's all purple. I have no idea. But they look at that and I can tell you said one sent.

263
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,710
You said three cancer, not cancer.

264
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,380
Pretty amazing. But again, keep in mind,

265
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:49,729
you want a well-trained pathologist who knows what they're doing because they're the ones deciding and this is what they're looking at.

266
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:53,420
So they better know what they're doing because otherwise they're going to be like me and go, Oh, that's pretty purple.

267
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:04,180
That one's more purple. This one. This one's the most purple. Okay.

268
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:10,960
So how do we diagnose cervical cancer as a combination of physical exam, visual inspection and colposcopy?

269
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,030
We'll get into what that is in a minute.

270
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:21,010
Pap smears are useful in revealing malignant cells, but it has a very low sensitivity, meaning it has a high rate of false negatives.

271
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,780
We'll talk about sensitivity and specificity a little bit more detail next time.

272
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:30,729
But this is why if you're only doing a pap smear without additional HPV, DNA testing,

273
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:35,230
you have to go every year because it's very likely that you will miss it.

274
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:40,060
Right. If there's cancer there, you might miss it. So you have to go back really frequently.

275
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:47,710
So the frequency of having to go back, plus the need for well-trained pathologists to look at this and tell you what it is,

276
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:53,200
means that pap smears are difficult to use in developing settings.

277
00:27:53,200 --> 00:28:00,080
Right. And in order to provide definitive confirmation, you have to do a biopsy.

278
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:03,259
Right. You have to take some of the tissue and look at it. Okay.

279
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,650
So the treatment depends on the stage. You might do surgery.

280
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,370
You could do a radical hysterectomy. You can do called tokenization.

281
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:16,520
You can do more conservative cryotherapy or local excision. Cryotherapy, as you know, how you use like freezing wards up.

282
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,930
They'll do that on the cervix. Four lesions.

283
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:37,190
You can also do radiation therapy. Usually radiation therapy for cervical cancer is not external beam radiation, but intra vaginal radiation therapy.

284
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:43,550
So women will go to the hospital and have like a really radioactive thing put into the vagina to irradiate the cervix.

285
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:49,960
So it's like an inpatient thing for several days. QUESTION Just wondering why it's categorized as radical.

286
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:57,459
So the radical the hysterectomy, they're taking out the entire uterus, ovaries, uterus and the conservative,

287
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:02,980
they're just they're leaving the cervix there, but they're kind of freezing the lesion on the cervix.

288
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:07,420
We're just taking out the ones that are, you know. And how did they decide on this?

289
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:14,230
Yes. Okay.

290
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,379
All right. So both incidence and mortality from cervical cancer have decreased globally over the last few decades.

291
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,380
So that's great. We have had some major declines in some developed countries.

292
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:33,909
A lot of people have been working really hard to implement routine cervical screening in these developing countries, right.

293
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:41,229
To to come up with screening programs that are acceptable and effective for that population.

294
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:46,360
Right. We've had very minor declines in developing countries.

295
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,620
Right. Oh, scars, very major declines in developed countries.

296
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,179
That's like the US. Right?

297
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:59,260
So we've had major declines because we've instituted since like the seventies and eighties, very, very good cervical cancer screening programs,

298
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:04,600
minor declines in developing countries because we are still working on instituting

299
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,499
those culturally appropriate and accessible screening programs in developing settings.

300
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,680
Does that make sense? I think I said that backwards the first time. I apologize.

301
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,770
Okay. We've seen this before. Incidence of cervical cancer, dark blue is higher.

302
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:25,120
You know, this is really a disparities problem. It is a very big public health problem in developing countries.

303
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:30,810
Mortality is that none of us should be bright red.

304
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:34,890
Like we know we have a pre-cancerous lesion. We know how to find this cancer early.

305
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:41,850
We know how to treat it like this is one of the more frustrating public health problems in cancer epidemiology.

306
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:47,280
I feel like because we have tools, we just need to figure out how to institute them in these lower resource settings.

307
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:53,910
Okay. So number one, with the bullet risk factor for for cervical cancer is HPV infection.

308
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:54,660
We know that. Right.

309
00:30:55,050 --> 00:31:05,670
Other risk factors include sexual intercourse at an early age, multiple sexual partners, many offspring long term use tobacco smoking,

310
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:13,110
low escs infection with these other sexually transmitted infections and micronutrient deficiencies.

311
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:23,220
I think what becomes very difficult is you can see how most of these are also associated with a higher risk of HPV infection.

312
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:33,270
Right. So trying to figure out if any of these things are independently associated with risk is very difficult because you have HPV is necessary,

313
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,130
but like I said, not sufficient.

314
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:44,190
There are obviously other factors that contribute to someone developing a long term chronic HPV infection, not clearing it.

315
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,589
Right. That then leads to cancer, but like why? Right.

316
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:52,649
And a lot of these seem like sexual intercourse, early age, multiple sexual partners, multi parity.

317
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:57,330
If you're using those, you're not using condoms probably. Right. Which would prevent HPV.

318
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:06,629
So infection with other things. This could just be a marker of unprotected sex, but HIV could also be related to that chronic infection.

319
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:11,880
Right. So it becomes kind of unclear. It's difficult to sort out whether these things are independent risk factors

320
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,170
or if they're just associated with a higher risk of being infected with HPV. Yeah.

321
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,870
Oh, yeah. How did they, like, connect?

322
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:25,620
Term like birth control use. Cervical cancer was the.

323
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:32,010
Yeah. So it could just be related to HPV infection. Right.

324
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:37,150
Because if you're using a CS, you're probably not also using condoms to prevent pregnancy.

325
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:45,280
I would guess that condom use there or contraception use is probably lower in people who are taking oral contraceptives,

326
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,880
particularly if they are in a monogamous relationship.

327
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,790
So. But you're right.

328
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:03,370
I mean, you could make arguments that there's something biological there's some biological plausibility

329
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:06,820
for why that might actually increase your risk of setting up some sort of chronic infection.

330
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,270
So that's what I mean is it's really hard to sort out like is there something real

331
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:15,580
going on here with these things or is there is it just markers of HPV infection?

332
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:25,250
Okay. So HPV infection is, of course, the causal risk factor for cervical cancer.

333
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:29,000
The relative risk with HPV infection is 20 to 100.

334
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:36,860
I would argue with you that any person who appears not to have HPV infection, who has cervical cancer, is the subject of a laboratory error.

335
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,860
People who you must have HPV infection with in high risk HPV type two get cervical cancer.

336
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:47,989
Okay, high risk are these types 16.

337
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:51,440
18 are the most common. They cause about 70% of all cervical cancer.

338
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,980
And the low risk are six, 11, 76 and 11 because the majority of anal genital warts.

339
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,729
So again, this is necessary but not sufficient to cause early changes in the cervix,

340
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:08,270
like we've said, can be detected years before invasive cervical cancer develops.

341
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:19,590
So our screening methods include. Pap smears, which we've talked about, which is just taking like a sample of the cells on the cervix,

342
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,819
hearing them on the slides, sending them to a pathologist. She's going to make them purple and tell you what pieces he or she sees.

343
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:31,390
Right. There's visual inspection with acetic acid, which is frequently used in low resource settings, and they may know what this is.

344
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,640
They actually just paint the cervix with acetic acid and any lesions where there are cellular changes will show up later.

345
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:47,720
So it's a very simple test to do, and so that's frequently used in low resource settings.

346
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:53,390
The other nice thing about it is that when the white shows up, they can treat it right there, right?

347
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:57,110
They don't have to wait for a pathologist to say and then come back again.

348
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:01,430
So especially in low resource settings where like getting to the doctor may be like

349
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:06,200
if you live in a very rural place and you made the time to come to the clinic,

350
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,399
right? You don't want to have to come back again. So that is a very limiting step.

351
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,420
So this is often used.

352
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:23,050
HPV, DNA testing, this is becoming this is now the standard in the US for women over 30 to combine pap smear and HPV, DNA testing.

353
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,710
If you have a negative HPV DNA test, that means that you are not infected with a high risk type.

354
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:32,870
And if you have that combined with a normal pap, you don't you don't have to come back in one year.

355
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:39,650
I think it's five. Right. So the DNA testing is nice because the screening interval is longer.

356
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,399
So this is actually easy.

357
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,240
It's pretty easy to implement in compared to a pap smear,

358
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,020
pretty easy to implement developing settings and people are really working on trying to get that going.

359
00:35:51,110 --> 00:36:01,570
Yes. Why we sort. Because if you have if you're infected with that high risk, high risk type,

360
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,770
it doesn't mean that you actually have cervical changes that need treatment.

361
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,440
Right. You have the risk factor.

362
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:15,440
But we don't know if has done anything for your service that in the past they're telling us, do you have cellular changes in your cervical cells?

363
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:21,430
Right. So that's what you kind of have to do both. But if you have no changes and you don't have the virus.

364
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,420
Than you. You're pretty good. You don't have to go back in one year, right?

365
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:33,240
It's very unlikely that we missed something. Right. Because, remember, pap smears are low sensitivity.

366
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,140
It's easy to miss changes because you're just sort of getting the sample.

367
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:44,520
So if you have the virus but no changes are detected, you still come back frequently to have your service checked.

368
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,819
Right. But if you're clear on the virus and any changes, then you're cool.

369
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:53,160
You can wait a longer time to come back. That makes sense.

370
00:36:54,580 --> 00:37:08,310
Yes. Able to see it. Um, the issues with having a baby was okay.

371
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:14,660
So you probably couldn't see anything on an ultrasound until it's large and has invaded other, other tissues, I would guess.

372
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:17,670
I'm not a clinician, so but that is my guess. I'm looking.

373
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:21,750
Let me I put my phone in a weird place and this is my clock.

374
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:25,259
Okay? Now I feel like I can listen to you and pay attention.

375
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:34,340
Um, yeah. So I don't think ultrasound is going to work until it's actually disrupting the structure of the tissues and organs.

376
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:38,190
Right, because that's what you would see. It's like a change in the shape or the size of something on an ultrasound.

377
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:49,410
And as far as having a child, I think if you've only had I think there is some issue with like how much of the cervix they take.

378
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:52,769
So like if you had cervical cancer and they take a pretty big chunk of your cervix,

379
00:37:52,770 --> 00:38:01,409
I think there is some concern about can the cervix dilate properly, kind of close enough to keep the baby in and safe and all that kind of stuff.

380
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:07,020
I don't know the details of that, but there is certainly. But if they've just taken a tiny chunk, I don't think it's this big of a deal.

381
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:13,770
Right. So if you have like they found early charges on a pap smear and they take a little piece of the cryotherapy,

382
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:21,780
I think mostly not a problem for bigger too, like actual tumors where they have to take a pretty big chunk of the cervix.

383
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:28,170
I think carrying the pregnancy safely such that the cervix doesn't can hold.

384
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,950
Baby, I don't know how to better say it.

385
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:36,240
I'm sure there's a better way of saying that, but the cervix can keep the baby inside is probably more of an issue,

386
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,180
or that the cervix can dilate correctly during birth maybe is probably more of an issue.

387
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:49,110
So I know that there are reproductive issues if you've had a more extensive surgery, but I'm not 100% clear on exactly what they are.

388
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:07,540
Yeah. I think it's not quite as sensitive and it's not there has to be, you know, big enough to actually visualize.

389
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,909
So to have like really microscopic changes.

390
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:13,980
You could catch that with the pap smear, whereas you're not going to catch it because probably have to be big enough that.

391
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:20,880
Right. So it's pretty good, right? Particularly if you don't have a biologist.

392
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,389
But in this country, we've got plenty of pathologists.

393
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:29,910
We just do. The past year, we. Okay.

394
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:35,220
You can also do a colposcopy. So this is people who have abnormal screening results.

395
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,630
This is basically a magnified inspection of the cervix with a binocular and the scope.

396
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,990
And then you would do a biopsy if abnormal cells are found.

397
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:52,230
So this is kind of you would do the via your white spot that you lose with the colposcopy and you probably take you treat it right there.

398
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:56,560
Right. All right.

399
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,840
Prevention vaccination. Okay.

400
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,340
So until so the first vaccine was I think came out in 2006.

401
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:13,000
It was originally only for women. And then shortly thereafter, within a few years, they they approved it for men as well.

402
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:21,070
Until 2014, we had Cervarix and Gardasil, which protected against fewer subtypes.

403
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:24,850
They started with the 16 and 18 because, like I said, those caused 70% of cervical cancers.

404
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:30,610
But then as of 2014, Gardasil nine was approved, which included a lot more of the high risk types,

405
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:37,990
including six and 11, which caused genital warts, not cancer. But, you know, I think everybody would like to avoid those as well.

406
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:48,220
So all remaining doses of Gardasil expired in May 2017, and Gardasil nine was the only FDA approved HPV vaccine in the U.S. thereafter.

407
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:56,540
Okay. So vaccination is recommended for all kids ages 11 to 12, recommended for women three,

408
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,860
age 26, and then 321 who did not receive the vaccine as a child.

409
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:06,950
As of 2010, we had pretty low coverage. It's still fairly low. It's about 50% of people who are supposed to be vaccinated.

410
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:17,020
Right. Part of the issue with this is there's a lot of research going on about patient provider communication.

411
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,809
And a lot of people the way people put it sometimes is that we need to take

412
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:24,040
the discussion of this vaccine out of the bedroom because a lot of parents,

413
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,930
you know, touch their pearls about it when they go in and are told that they're going to be vaccinated for an STD,

414
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,170
they're like, oh, my God, my baby doesn't need that. He's only 11, you know?

415
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:41,410
But I think if you put it as it's a cancer vaccine that has a much better response from parents.

416
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:49,270
But, you know, I think there's a lot of parents that still, you know, because they know it's an SDI or kind of like, oh, okay, it doesn't need that.

417
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,410
Yeah, they don't need it at 11, hopefully, right? Probably.

418
00:41:54,490 --> 00:42:04,180
But sometime thereafter they will. And guess who they're not going to tell when they do their parents.

419
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:10,120
I think we can all agree that like an announcement was not made in the household at the moment,

420
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:14,259
that we would have needed the HPV vaccine for the first time. Right. Like nobody's doing that.

421
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:18,700
So that's why we vaccinate kids when they're 11 to 12. They're covered for when they need it.

422
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:24,460
Right. So and I think anybody who had seen those pictures that you guys saw on Tuesday would, like be rushing their kid in there.

423
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:31,729
Right? They are. They love me at the pediatrician's office because they're just always like they're always pulling up the pamphlets to convince me.

424
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:34,780
And I'm like, I'm an epidemiologist. I'm a cancer epidemiologist.

425
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:38,800
Just go get the shot. Just go get it. We're doing it like, oh, great.

426
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:46,900
You know, you can just see kind of the relief wash over them. They don't have to argue and convince, like, I mean, easy want just go get the shot.

427
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:53,589
All right. I will also say that the FDA has now approved the vaccine for people up to 45.

428
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:58,960
But because the CDC has not recommended it for people up to 45, insurance will cover it.

429
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:06,520
So you can pay out of pocket and get it. Your doctor could give it to you if you were over between 26 and 45.

430
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:16,509
Right. But. Does that make sense? So this is data as of 2016.

431
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:20,680
So a little newer than what was on the previous slide. Five out of ten boys have started the series.

432
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:26,760
Six out of ten girls have started it. And there is, you know, differences across the U.S. in terms of who's getting it.

433
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:34,520
I will also point out so. You guys are.

434
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:41,630
I think we've said this before. You guys always want to. I think because you have all grown up with the HPV vaccine,

435
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:47,570
as in your mind kind of one of the primary ways of preventing cervical cancer and these other HPV related cancers.

436
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:53,520
But keep in mind that the people who are currently getting those cancers did not have the vaccine available to them.

437
00:43:53,540 --> 00:44:01,040
Generally, we are just starting to get into the age range where people who could have been vaccinated might be getting these cancers right.

438
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:05,570
So all of the previous decline that we've seen in developing countries,

439
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:13,130
in cervical cancer in particular, is because of screening, not because of vaccination.

440
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:19,580
We're about to enter the era where we might start to see the effects of vaccination on population rates of these cancers.

441
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:25,920
Right. Yes. So it's like a like a three shot series.

442
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:32,880
I think in kids, it's too if they're young enough, it's too if you're a little older when you get it, it's three.

443
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:38,570
So I was like, is there like. To.

444
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,040
Probably some, but not all. Yes.

445
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:52,069
If. That's interesting.

446
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:56,870
I don't know. I mean, a lot of this on a state by state, too, right.

447
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,930
So they may have some. That is interesting question. I don't know the answer to.

448
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:07,100
It could be like some sort of statewide program where they're paying for it or something or they may have done some sort of like big outreach.

449
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:12,030
I don't know. But that is interesting.

450
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:14,540
It's not the state I would have guessed right.

451
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:21,170
If you'd asked me which states have the highest coverage, I probably would not have piped up with North Dakota as my first choice.

452
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:29,500
I would guess there was some sort of state health department program of some kind.

453
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,620
Insurers that have. Agreement around.

454
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:41,090
Not possible. Don't want to cover it.

455
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:47,989
So I think the issue is that being up to it is most effective to vaccinate younger

456
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:52,510
people because they are the ones who have not yet been exposed to these viruses.

457
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:57,470
Right. Probably by the time people are 45, they have been exposed and either cleared it or have the infection.

458
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:03,540
Is that is the idea. Right. And that's that's really why the CDC doesn't recommend Pass 26.

459
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,070
So the FDA has approved it, meaning it's safe and it's fine to give it.

460
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:14,580
The CDC has not recommended it because the there's some cost benefit analysis there.

461
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:19,819
Right. Like vaccinating people after 26 of them between 26 and 45 is kind of a big cost.

462
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:24,560
And at that point, it's probably like closing the barn door after the horse is already out for most people.

463
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:36,320
Right. Does that make sense? Yeah, I think it's that rather than anything else, it's more of a is this a good use of resources question?

464
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:41,720
How much bang are we going to get for our buck in this group? It's low.

465
00:46:42,230 --> 00:47:06,130
Right. Well, I think and this isn't totally my area, but I think most other immunizations are required for kids to go to school,

466
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:12,249
like when they start to feel like you have to participate. This isn't given until 11 or 12.

467
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:19,590
And so I think that. Paperwork of my starting school had already happened and I had it in the system.

468
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:26,340
And when we send them home at that point, I think it's just because of the age at which the event, like the logistics of that are probably.

469
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:35,669
I would guess. But also, I think, you know, we make a lot of concessions for these kinds of things.

470
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:46,530
Like a lot of parents would scream for TV and their baby is not going to do that and their baby doesn't need access to vaccines.

471
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:52,230
And, you know, and so, like, I think they already kind of have trouble getting people to vaccinate their kids from measles that.

472
00:47:54,570 --> 00:48:03,840
You know, trying to get this passed would be an extra hurdle because of this kind of stigma around it that it's a sexually transmitted infection.

473
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:08,910
And I'm sure there's some political stuff there, too.

474
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,890
Makes sense. I mean, no, it doesn't. But yes, it does.

475
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,400
Okay. Okay.

476
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:23,370
So there are definitely even in the U.S., there are disparities that have narrowed over time.

477
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:28,470
Cervical cancer used to be much more common in black women than white women.

478
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:39,900
There's still a small disparity, but it has really narrowed. Um, the age specific incidence rates are a bit different by race, which is interesting.

479
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:45,060
I think this is kind of a niche question about why this has been happening.

480
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:49,980
Could be because of lower like women.

481
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:52,049
White women are getting screened more perhaps.

482
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:57,330
And so if they had a pre-cancerous lesion, it was removed, whereas black women were not having that happen.

483
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:04,170
And so the risk just increases over time. So there are still disparities.

484
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:08,700
I will say that the black white differences is has narrowed a bit.

485
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:15,450
But there are still I mean, there are inner city areas in the US where cervical cancer is like that.

486
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:18,540
The cervical cancer rates are like those of a developing country. Right.

487
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:29,040
Sex worker populations, IV drug user populations, people who live in very rural areas who don't have great access to pap smears in clinics.

488
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,700
And then also certain cultural groups. Right.

489
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:38,640
So, I mean, one of the issues in developing countries can be getting women to go to a provider for a pelvic exam.

490
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:45,149
Right. That's how you get a surgical sample. That's how you look at the sort of think about countries where the vast majority of providers

491
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:52,140
are male and where it is uncomfortable or maybe not culturally appropriate for women to be,

492
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:55,560
you know, and have a pelvic exam by a male writer. Right.

493
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:00,600
That is maybe uncomfortable in some cultures. There's also a lot of stuff where, you know,

494
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:10,709
we have gone to not we a colleagues of mine have worked in this area and they've gone to developing countries in rural villages and said,

495
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:14,280
you know, hey, we're here to talk about cervical screening. And the husband is saying she doesn't need that.

496
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,450
She only sleeps with me. And you kind of want to go, that's nice.

497
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,610
Who are you sleeping with, sir? But that's, you know, maybe not the best thing.

498
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:29,640
You just keep that in your head. You don't say that out loud. Right? But I mean, so there's a lot of like cultural stuff about that.

499
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:35,660
One of the ways around that that people have thought of is, um, cervical self sampling.

500
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:42,299
How many people have heard of this? So in rural areas and things like that, they're offering these devices.

501
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:46,110
They look like see, one of the one of the ones is.

502
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:55,570
It's this little guy. Now be big. I want a big picture.

503
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:59,920
Now, I don't want this. Images.

504
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:06,020
Looks like that. I. I know you didn't ask me.

505
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:10,729
So you see how this has, like, this little line here it turns, right?

506
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:15,320
And then a you can see that this little pink brush comes out.

507
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,660
So you inserted in the vagina kind of like a tampon.

508
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:22,790
But the, you know, this would be the upper side like toward your face and this would be down toward the floor.

509
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:26,870
So when it goes in, it is angled correctly to hit the cervix.

510
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:31,640
And then you open it, you turn it like lipstick tube and a little brush comes out and takes the cervical sample,

511
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:35,690
and then you push it back in and then you can send it in for HPV, DNA testing.

512
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:39,260
So you don't have to go to a provider to have the swab done. You do it yourself.

513
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:43,550
And then your contact is if you have high risk HPV, DNA, you can go to the clinic.

514
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,969
So this circumvents a fair number of issues.

515
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:51,290
Right. And we're we're also looking at this.

516
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:58,310
People have looked at this in rural populations in the US, for example, they're looking at it in MENA populations through access.

517
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:02,810
So this is one of the one of the things that people are doing.

518
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:13,640
That's pretty clever. Oh, the other the other group that someone in the School of Public Health is looking at this for is transmission.

519
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:22,370
Right. Trans men have a cervix. Generally, they are still at risk of cervical cancer.

520
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:25,390
But it is very upsetting.

521
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,420
Right. As a man to go to a gynecologist to get a pap smear.

522
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:35,040
Right. Or maybe just generally difficult, like causing a lot of dysmorphia to to have a pelvic exam.

523
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:41,000
Right. So doing it yourself eliminates a lot of that discomfort around seeking care for that kind of thing.

524
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:47,000
So I thought that was really interesting and it was a group I hadn't actually thought about before, but I think it's really important.

525
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:56,830
Okay. All righty.

526
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:04,130
So we've seen this. These are HPV associated cancers overall. And by sex in women, it's largely cervical cancer.

527
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:09,740
But there are also others. Vagina, vulva, oropharynx and anus.

528
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:13,490
Whereas the vast majority in men are oropharynx cancers.

529
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:23,860
I'm not going to go into this in detail, but there are certainly. Race, ethnicity.

530
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:32,870
Differences as well. Okay. So let's talk about bacteria and helminths that are suspected in the cancer etiology.

531
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,460
So the helminths are these parasites, right?

532
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:43,340
So there's various just aromas which called schist which cause schistosomiasis.

533
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:49,010
And then there's the versus liver flukes.

534
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,760
I'm just going to call them liver flukes for now. I'm done with that Latin.

535
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:58,340
Okay. So schistosomiasis is nobody heard of this before?

536
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:06,800
Probably people. So this is a parasitic infection that can happen usually by swimming in like still water.

537
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:12,080
Super, super common in a lot of parts of like the Middle East and Africa.

538
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:22,090
And it can cause like bloody urine, that kind of thing, because what ends up happening is it's a weird life cycle, right?

539
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:25,850
These things have a really weird life cycle. So they get into the water, right?

540
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:35,570
And then the eggs hatch releasing these mirror Cydia, they get into snails in the water,

541
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:44,510
then you get these faucets in the snail and then eventually they release this surgery that are in the water, just free swimming.

542
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:48,739
They penetrate the skin and get into circulation and blah, blah, blah.

543
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:56,840
And then they end up in the bladder. Okay. And they actually cause irritation of the bladder lining, which is why you get the bloody urine.

544
00:54:56,850 --> 00:55:01,310
But chronic irritation over time will lead to a lot of cancer.

545
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:08,120
Right. So that's it's kind of this chronic irritation that just leads to cancer over a long period of time.

546
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,219
The life cycle is kind of fascinating, though, right? There's like smells and water.

547
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:16,490
And so there's all kinds of different mechanisms.

548
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:20,930
You know, it's this very detailed lifecycle situation.

549
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:25,280
Similarly, liver flukes snails, again.

550
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,650
So people pass these eggs and feces.

551
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:33,170
It gets into the water, eggs are ingested by the snail.

552
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:37,100
Then they get these they're carrying, they get into fish.

553
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:43,760
And then if you eat the fish, you can get these things that grow in your biliary duct.

554
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:49,400
So this causes a very particular kind of liver cancer called cholangiocarcinoma.

555
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:58,010
So anybody who's the liver cancer group you probably have seen this mentioned like the most common kind of cell carcinoma,

556
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:01,910
but this tiny portion is this bile duct cancer, right. This cholangiocarcinoma.

557
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:09,080
This is data from Thailand. Let's just look at like Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Songkhla.

558
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:12,319
These are different regions of Thailand.

559
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:22,540
So lung cancer, liver, colon, bladder. You know, it's kind of this mix of what you would expect for a developed and developing country.

560
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:26,060
Right. But oh, my God.

561
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:33,630
What is happening with liver cancer in Konkan? Content actually has the highest rates of cholangiocarcinoma in the world.

562
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:39,570
And it's because there is this kind of raw fish dish that is culturally eaten there.

563
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:43,890
This is a fisherman. He caught the fish. These are the rivers.

564
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:49,350
Beautiful. But if you don't cook the fish, you get liver fluke.

565
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:55,560
So there's a big public health campaign that's been going on in the area for a while to get people to stop eating raw fish.

566
00:56:56,310 --> 00:57:02,520
It has been somewhat successful. They have seen decreases, but this is still kind of a cultural thing that people eat.

567
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:08,370
So if you ever go to compound, don't eat raw fish. There's also a dish that has antiques in it, which I have eaten.

568
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:13,090
I can't say I recommend it, but it's not dangerous. Yes.

569
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:20,900
I mean, it's just like a public campaign like this. It's bad for you.

570
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:24,170
It can cause liver, fluke, you know, that kind of thing. It's not like banned or anything.

571
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:33,299
It's just information. Public education. I'm sure there are like the older people who are like, I've given this my whole life, you know what I mean?

572
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,600
So and then there are people who are taking it more seriously, like, I mean, any place, right?

573
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:39,180
You're going to have the people who are adopted and people who are like, whatever.

574
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:46,620
So it's still it's just decreased etc. seems a concomitant decrease in I just that.

575
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:57,000
But I think it's interesting that it's like linked to this very regional dish and it's very, very high in this one area.

576
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:00,940
I think that's kind of interesting. Well, detective story.

577
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:10,840
All right. Let's talk about bacterial infections now. We've got H. Pylori.

578
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:16,120
This causes chronic inflammation, production of carcinogenic bacterial metabolites,

579
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:20,710
cell proliferation, production of mutagenic free radicals, and you get gastric lymphomas from it.

580
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:28,240
Anybody know the story? I tell you the story of H. Pylori and the guy who won the Nobel Prize for figuring out that is associated with ulcers.

581
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:34,690
Somebody has got their computer open. Look it up. I can't remember his name, but it was like I think in the eighties that he did this.

582
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,860
Do not recommend but he self experimented and.

583
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:43,870
Yes. What's his name. Barry Marshall. That's how bonkers.

584
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:49,209
Like smart but bonkers. So he nobody believed it, right?

585
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:52,210
Everybody thought ulcers were just due to stress. And I'm sure there are some that are.

586
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:56,950
But he was like, no, no, I think there's this infectious cost to it. Everyone is like, You crazy Barry.

587
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:05,049
So he was like, I'll show you. So he drank some, gave himself an ulcer, took antibiotics and cured it, and he ended up winning a Nobel Prize.

588
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:12,459
So, I mean, I guess that's one way, but like, I don't think it's a really, really generally recommended method of experimentation.

589
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:15,940
But that's what he did. So he's the guy who figured this out.

590
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:20,060
And then later it was it was linked to stomach cancer as well. Right.

591
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:23,890
But the ulcers were kind of the first step. Okay.

592
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:33,430
So chronic inflammation is sort of a one of those general hallmarks of cancer, right?

593
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:39,819
Remember, the hallmarks of cancer, the newer hallmarks of cancer when we talk about chronic inflammation is one of those.

594
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:43,690
Right. So it is definitely a mechanism by which lots of different things can cause

595
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:47,649
cancer and some of the protective things that we know about reduce inflammation.

596
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:52,660
Right. So all of the studies like aspirin and cancer, aspirin is an anti-inflammatory, right?

597
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:56,680
And so that is part of the reason people think that aspirin is protective for some cancers.

598
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:04,760
Okay. So Helicobacter pylori is on there, but all of these other things,

599
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:10,610
some of the infectious things we've been talking about, but also gastroesophageal Castro esophageal reflux disease.

600
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:20,120
Right Gerd. So stomach acid coming up into the esophagus and causing really bad heartburn that is associated with the type of cancers.

601
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:28,280
Right. Or stomach cancers. Ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, COPD, chronic diffuse lung disease.

602
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:36,380
So important inflammatory atrophy of the prostate. So all of these kind of inflammatory conditions like chronic inflammation kind of conditions,

603
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:40,660
some of which are infectious and some of which are not, are related to risk of cancer.

604
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:43,850
Right. So this is kind of one of the big overarching mechanisms that you think about.

605
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:49,190
All right. So it can cause free radical from oxidative stress, which can cause DNA damage.

606
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,330
Damage. We know that h. Pylori gastritis can cause stomach cancer.

607
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:58,370
This is the mechanism by which just so much hematuria causes bladder cancer.

608
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,970
These inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's disease cause cancer that way.

609
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:07,100
So that is an example of how that works. All right.

610
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:11,090
So there's lots of molecular and biochemical events that happen during chronic inflammation.

611
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:17,150
You get activated macrophages and lymphocytes that are releasing a lot of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

612
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:22,250
You get metabolic products of phagocytosis and reactive oxygen radicals.

613
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:28,159
You can have better plasma and cellular regeneration. So it's trying to replace all of these damaged cells.

614
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:32,870
So you get a lot more like cell turnover, remember?

615
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:39,590
And every time you have more cell cell turnover, you have the opportunity for DNA damage.

616
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:45,270
And one of the things that people say is that tumors are basically worms that do not heal.

617
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:49,480
Right. All right.

618
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:53,260
So how can we translate these things into prevention?

619
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:57,400
Right. So we need to understand the role of other factors, right?

620
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:02,830
So what is it that causes a viral infection to become chronic and then lead to cancer versus someone clearing it?

621
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:07,660
Vaccine development. Right. So we've got a vaccine for which one's.

622
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:14,390
Two of. HPV and.

623
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:20,890
HPV, hepatitis B does not seem right.

624
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:24,820
So people are working on vaccines for some of these other things.

625
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:30,969
And then also, we need to work on early detection, right. We know we can do it for cervical cancer.

626
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:32,590
We need to figure out how to do it better.

627
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:40,450
And then some of these other cancers, you know, people are certainly working on screening for stomach cancer, for example, but in higher risk places.

628
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:46,479
Right. So stomach and liver cancer, people working on screening for those maybe like in East Asia,

629
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:52,240
for example, as well as we will discuss next time in our screening lecture,

630
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:58,240
screening for rare cancers is really tough because you have to have an almost perfect

631
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:05,020
screening test for your positive predictive value to not be total trash for a rare cancer.

632
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:11,580
So that's kind of where most of them fail. But we will talk about that more next time.

633
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:18,030
Okay. So this is our summary. I'm not going to read it to you. Any questions?

634
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:32,420
We had a lot of good questions as we went. No, no, no, no.

635
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:38,379
We're just doing your hair. Okay. All right, let's see.

636
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:41,560
What do we have? Anything I need to announce to you guys?

637
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:45,370
Let's look at our next time.

638
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:48,700
We'll be doing cancer screening. Bring your thinking caps.

639
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:51,750
That one's a little bit of a, if you like, epi methods.

640
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,270
You're going to love this one. But a lot of people kind of scratch their heads at it.

641
01:03:55,270 --> 01:04:03,520
So everybody be awake, have an extra coffee that morning. Then next Thursday, we're going to have time in the class to work on the final project.

642
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,549
I did see one group emailed me about office hours. I'm going to get back to you.

643
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:09,550
I did see that. I just didn't have time to respond this morning. So I will do that.

644
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:15,910
And then it's then it's your time to shine. Then we're doing presentations.

645
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:19,810
I just get to sit back and coast.

646
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:26,210
You guys do the work? Yes. For presentations. We sign on for a certain slot or you sign.

647
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:30,900
I'm going to send you. I will. I will go do that. I should have done that earlier, but I will go.

648
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:37,080
Does anybody have a known conflict with any of the dates?

649
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:41,100
Yes. I have my flight for Thanksgiving on the 21st.

650
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:45,630
All right. Anybody else? Email me.

651
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:49,770
Email me. Is yours also on the 21st? Okay.

652
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:57,550
You too. Are you all in the same group or different groups? All different.

653
01:04:57,580 --> 01:05:01,190
Okay, that's fine. Okay.

654
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:04,600
So I will randomly assign you two dates. One email you three email me.

655
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,830
Like now, if you can tell me I can't do it on this date.

656
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:13,060
Okay. And then I will assign them today. Okay.

657
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:27,790
Who's got the sign in sheet? She and Candy.

658
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:34,780
Everybody's got to take at least one more piece if it's still fall. Press TV For.

659
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:50,530
Not out there? Yeah, for sure. Yeah. I think things.

660
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:57,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

661
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:02,390
Bye. Yeah, I.

662
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:11,310
I know. But don't be polite.

663
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:17,370
Everybody take a hole here for what is it?

664
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:21,050
For what you trust out of them. Like what? Yeah, it's what I pass out.

665
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:25,200
And then, like, we just did not get very many perpetrators. I guess. So it was raining.

666
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:30,120
But also our neighborhood only has sidewalks on one side and ours is on the non sidewalk side.

667
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:34,979
So I think they don't come up as much. So that's all I heard the people walking along.

668
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:40,390
But I think especially people like little kids just don't want them crossing the street. And she was so we didn't get that.

669
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:43,730
Any question is it possible to post?
