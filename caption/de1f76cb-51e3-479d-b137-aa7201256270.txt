1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,380
Hi, I'm Carrie
Karvonen-Gutierrez.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,920
I'm a faculty member here in

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,095
the department of Epidemiology.

4
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:13,630
Right now, we're sitting
in the research clinic

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,955
for the Center for
Mid-life Science.

6
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:17,770
In this room is where we visit

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,420
with our research participants,

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,710
we ask them questions,

9
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,090
and we collect
their biological specimens.

10
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,390
That information helps
us understand about

11
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,330
their health now
and in the future.

12
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,505
I first entered the field of

13
00:00:30,505 --> 00:00:33,220
epidemiology and public
health so that I could work

14
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,230
to understand the causes and

15
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,700
consequences of human diseases.

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,430
In doing so, much of

17
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,800
my work has centered
on researching and

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,675
understanding the mechanistic

19
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:45,369
and biological underpinnings

20
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:47,500
of disease processes.

21
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,360
Those samples that
we collect from

22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,255
our participants helps
me do just that.

23
00:00:52,255 --> 00:00:54,670
One of the areas of interest for

24
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,685
major health impact
has been genetics.

25
00:00:57,685 --> 00:01:00,790
This field has
changed so rapidly,

26
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,950
it has and continues to hold

27
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,755
promise for transforming
health and medicine.

28
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:08,290
Since I began working
in public health,

29
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,935
there have been major advances
in the field of genetics.

30
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:15,310
This includes advances in
laboratory capabilities,

31
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,295
analytical innovations
in computing power.

32
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:20,410
Most notably, the mapping of

33
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,345
the human genome
project which took

34
00:01:22,345 --> 00:01:27,280
13 years to complete was
finished in April of 2003,

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,050
before I reached public health.

36
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,500
These innovations have
allowed us to ask

37
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,180
more complex questions about

38
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,890
the role of genetics
in health outcomes.

39
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,830
With the increasing interest
in personalized medicine,

40
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,935
the field of genetics is
more relevant than ever.

41
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:48,220
Epidemiologists are at
the front lines in this field,

42
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,630
working to determine how

43
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,360
individual genetic
information can

44
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,975
increase or decrease
the likelihood of disease.

45
00:01:55,975 --> 00:01:58,750
In this module, we
will learn more about

46
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,070
the biology basics of

47
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:04,015
genetics and the role of
public health in this field.

48
00:02:04,015 --> 00:02:06,580
With respect to health outcomes,

49
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,340
our interest is not
in genetics solely,

50
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,265
but more broadly in
the field of genomics.

51
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,180
Genetics is the study of

52
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,910
single genes and
their effects on health.

53
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,850
Well, there are
definitely examples of

54
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,060
many diseases dictated
by single genes,

55
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,100
most diseases are thought to have

56
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,895
both genetic and
environmental etiologies.

57
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:31,235
Thus, for public health,

58
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:33,890
it is more appropriate for
us to use the language of

59
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,605
genomics rather than genetics.

60
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:39,080
Genomics is the study of all of

61
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,310
the genes in the genome
including their interactions,

62
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,600
and thus includes
both the genetic and

63
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,224
environmental
contributions to disease,

64
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:49,445
not just one or the other.

65
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:52,610
The field of genetics is
particularly relevant for

66
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,710
many common chronic diseases

67
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,500
such as cardiovascular
disease and asthma,

68
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,645
which have known
genetic risk factors

69
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:02,155
as well as environmental
risk factors,

70
00:03:02,155 --> 00:03:03,560
and the understanding of

71
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,540
their biologic interaction is

72
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,285
really critical to
understanding the field.

73
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:11,495
Thus, regardless of
your area of research,

74
00:03:11,495 --> 00:03:14,200
even if not explicitly
in genetics,

75
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,680
it is likely that you will be

76
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,510
confronted with
important findings

77
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,190
in your own field
that are related

78
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,125
to genetic risk factors.

79
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:24,020
This module provides
the basic overview of

80
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,910
genetics so that
you can be better

81
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,995
versed to understand
those findings.

82
00:03:28,995 --> 00:03:33,470
DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid

83
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,940
is the chemical blueprint that

84
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,505
directs all of
the cells activities.

85
00:03:37,505 --> 00:03:39,710
It provides the
genetic information

86
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,840
needed to direct growth,

87
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,775
development, functioning,

88
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:46,865
and reproduction at
the cellular level.

89
00:03:46,865 --> 00:03:51,565
The genetic code is used
to synthesize or make RNA,

90
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:55,610
RNA then helps tell our body
how to make proteins.

91
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,655
This process is
called translation.

92
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,740
DNA is organized as

93
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,010
a double-stranded helix
as shown on this slide.

94
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,900
The backbone of that helix or

95
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,785
the outer frame is made up
by sugar phosphate groups.

96
00:04:09,785 --> 00:04:11,600
Attached to each sugar is one of

97
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,180
four chemical bases
either adenine,

98
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:20,950
thymine, guanine, or
cytosine also known as ATGC.

99
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,240
The organization and pattern of

100
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,160
these four bases provides

101
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,280
the code needed for
protein synthesis.

102
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,529
Humans have approximately
three billion

103
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:33,510
base pairs in our DNA.

104
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,205
However, most of our
genetic information,

105
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:39,875
up to 98 percent of it
is actually non-coding,

106
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,200
meaning that no proteins
are created based

107
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,780
upon the information
in those areas.

108
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,100
We'll learn more about
those areas later.

109
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,475
Humans store most of
our DNA inside the nucleus

110
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:54,140
of our cells and nearly all

111
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,315
of our cells have the same DNA,

112
00:04:56,315 --> 00:04:58,835
it's our identical signature.

113
00:04:58,835 --> 00:05:01,715
Some genes contain
genetic information

114
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:03,575
that will code for proteins,

115
00:05:03,575 --> 00:05:06,470
these areas are called exons.

116
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,220
Other genes do not
code for proteins,

117
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,255
these are called introns.

118
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:14,250
Based upon findings from
the Human Genome Project,

119
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,920
it is estimated that humans

120
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,805
have approximately 25,000 genes.

121
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:23,890
Within our cells, DNA is
organized into genes.

122
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,874
Long sections of DNA,

123
00:05:25,874 --> 00:05:29,480
including both exons and
introns are coiled tightly

124
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,040
around a histone protein

125
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,620
forming a unit
called a nucleosome.

126
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,690
These nucleosomes then are

127
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,150
organized into a unit
called a chromosome.

128
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,230
Genes are the organizational
structure for our DNA,

129
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,520
they are the basic
functional unit

130
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,875
for inherited information.

131
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,305
Genes contain our genetic code.

132
00:05:51,305 --> 00:05:55,325
Some genes, the exons
code for proteins.

133
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:58,850
Each person has two copies
of a given gene,

134
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,570
one is received from each of
their biological parents.

135
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,109
Understanding the variation
in genes across individuals

136
00:06:06,109 --> 00:06:09,845
helps us understand genetic
risk factors for disease.

137
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:12,635
Alleles are forms of a gene with

138
00:06:12,635 --> 00:06:16,055
small differences in
the sequence of the DNA bases.

139
00:06:16,055 --> 00:06:18,380
So small differences in those A,

140
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,750
G, T and C bases.

141
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,820
These alleles can be related to

142
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,670
individual features such
as disease outcomes,

143
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,230
and this information will tell

144
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,970
us both about the mechanism,

145
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,850
but also about
the heritability of disease.

146
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,380
Genes can be varying sizes,

147
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,660
and so it is important that

148
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,140
the identification of the
gene's location can be found.

149
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:45,290
A gene's locus is its physical
location on a chromosome.

150
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,960
Chromosomes are the ways in which

151
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,010
our body organizes our genes,

152
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,420
it is the organizational
structure for our genes.

153
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,120
We have both autosomal
chromosomes

154
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,295
and sex-linked chromosomes.

155
00:06:58,295 --> 00:07:03,395
We have 23 pairs of chromosomes
or 46 chromosomes total.

156
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:06,050
Twenty two of those pairs
are autosomal,

157
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,680
meaning that they are similar
among males and females.

158
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,770
Sex-linked chromosomes
are different

159
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,615
between males and females.

160
00:07:14,615 --> 00:07:18,065
Males have an X and
a Y chromosome,

161
00:07:18,065 --> 00:07:21,125
whereas females have
two X chromosomes.

162
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,900
Regardless, total
in normal humans,

163
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,460
the number of chromosomes is

164
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,182
23 pairs or 46 chromosomes total.
