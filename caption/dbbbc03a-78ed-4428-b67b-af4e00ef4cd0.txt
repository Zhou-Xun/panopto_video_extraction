1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:11,520
Europe. All right.

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,590
If you want me to give you, like, a little five minute warning like this, um, we have.

3
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:28,670
We're going to put a timer up here, so. But I really didn't.

4
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,080
I'm however one that's not.

5
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,820
So just to introduce thyroid cancer.

6
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:52,670
Thyroid cancer is a cancer that's characterized by the thyroid gland responsible to make hormones regulate metabolism,

7
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:58,850
heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and other homeostatic function.

8
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:06,050
So fluctuations in thyroid function can lead to a lot of your regular body processes and functions,

9
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,220
and that can impact a lot of important functions throughout the body.

10
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:19,040
Issues such as cardiovascular. Seniors osteoporosis facility and increased quality of life.

11
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,610
Um, so we can start by looking at thyroid cancer in the United States.

12
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,489
So here are some statistics.

13
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:44,710
So the five year survival rate for Americans are about 98.4, and higher cancer cases account for 2.3% of all new cancer cases.

14
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:55,559
And as we can see in this graph, talk about the 1990, 2,010% increase in thyroid cancer diagnoses.

15
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:06,799
And that could be attributed to. Screening and on thyroid ultrasounds which are pretty important for a households and those the

16
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:16,730
estimated number of cases per year is about 48,000 and cancer accounts for about 4.4% of all.

17
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,820
And then now we can kind of look at cancer around the globe.

18
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:36,450
So the darker regions of higher incidence and some of this higher incidence are in the regions of the America and the West and that's okay.

19
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,220
And the lower incidence events are more so because the region.

20
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,020
Yeah.

21
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:53,580
So we're going to pick up a little bit in terms of access to screening and the trends that we've seen a little bit before about income level and.

22
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:05,900
Fatality, which will get a little bit more. So here we have a chart, a graph showing thyroid cancer.

23
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,390
So that's an income level that we just saw earlier.

24
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:22,240
So what we can see is the areas that have the highest incidence are more high income, upper middle income, very close to each other.

25
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,920
As we can see, there is significantly lower incidence rates.

26
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:34,390
Low income countries. And so we can think about the factors that are kind.

27
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:42,520
This is starting to take a little bit more credibility about what's causing these very concerns here.

28
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:50,920
And again, he attributed it to an ultrasound screening and this better early stage detection.

29
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,490
Also an issue that's kind of a little bit.

30
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:03,440
Overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer is also not, in my view, looking at upper middle income countries.

31
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:11,540
And I see we kind of look at the small incidents, but looking at it through mortality.

32
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:30,799
And so we can see from this chart that the lowest rates have become entirely at a rate of 4.67 400,412.47 per 100,000,

33
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,610
for which so I can see that there is a disparity there, although we saw the last chart, the incidence.

34
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:51,270
Okay. All right. And the lowest rates of mortality are very, very modest there, which have more incidence.

35
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:01,530
So some risk factors for thyroid cancer that we can see include the many common ones we see with other cancers,

36
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:11,670
including age, family history and obesity. Thyroid cancer peaks earlier in women between the ages of 40 and 50 than in men, which is around 50 and 60.

37
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:18,990
And then the risk factor is more specific to men or more specific to thyroid cancer include radiation exposure,

38
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,100
lower high iodine intake and then also being female.

39
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:32,249
So radiation exposure is a proven risk factor for thyroid cancer as excess iodine and radiation is absorbed by the thyroid cells,

40
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,610
which may precipitate hypothyroidism or thyroid.

41
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:43,679
Autoimmunity. Children, especially, are at increased risk for thyroid cancer if they're exposed to radiation at a young age,

42
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,550
since their thyroid is still developing and is highly sensitive.

43
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,900
On the other hand, low iodine intake will prevent the body from being able to produce thyroid stimulating hormone.

44
00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:03,360
And then lastly, females are three times more likely to get thyroid cancer than men, and there's not a lot of research that can explain this.

45
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,690
But new research suggests that estrogen plays a big role in the development of thyroid cancer,

46
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,690
and it's a potent stimulator of both benign and malignant thyroid cells.

47
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,759
And as of today, there is no known cause of their cancer.

48
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:31,270
But there have been cases where there's genetic mutations of the BRAF gene or changes in the RET gene that are linked to thyroid cancer incidence.

49
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,870
And your research suggests that if there is a mutation in the RET gene, a THYROIDECTOMY,

50
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,890
which is the removal of the entire thyroid, is a suggested course of treatment.

51
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,719
So social determinants of health are important.

52
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:57,340
Non-medical factors that influence a person's health and healthy people is a government program seeking to improve population health.

53
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:02,959
And they identified five main social determinants which were education, health care,

54
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:09,980
access economics, stability, social and community, context and neighborhood and built environment.

55
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:18,740
And so one of the main social determinants of health that influences cancer survival is access to care.

56
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:25,040
So people who are under-insured or uninsured are less likely to receive quality health care.

57
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,470
And as a result, these individuals are less likely to see specialists for care,

58
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:38,000
and insured patients are also more likely to receive surgical treatments and radiation therapy.

59
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,660
And these are both associated with better cancer outcomes.

60
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:51,020
Another really important component of access to care is the physical distance one lives from the hospital or their ability to see a provider.

61
00:07:51,380 --> 00:08:00,860
So in general, people in rural areas are less likely to live near a hospital and as a result, rely more on their primary care physician.

62
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,500
So another major social determinants of health is socioeconomic status.

63
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,339
So individuals with high socioeconomic status are generally less afraid to seek medical care

64
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,870
because they don't have to worry as much about the cost or fees associated with treatment.

65
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:27,490
And as a result, these individuals are more likely to have screenings and access to better treatments during cancer management.

66
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:34,960
Whereas, on the other hand, patients with lower socioeconomic status often present to the hospital much later.

67
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:43,750
And that's because they might be delaying their cancer care because they don't have the resources to afford the treatments.

68
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,629
So there's also a lot of environmental factors that are tied to socioeconomic status.

69
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:58,410
So people who are living in poverty often live in neighborhoods that might be

70
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,660
more exposed to environmental toxins like contaminated water or air pollution.

71
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,340
And so there are a lot of chemicals that are associated with thyroid cancer,

72
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:14,010
which may not be checked as often or regulated as much in these low income communities.

73
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:21,319
There's also many different disparities in regards to thyroid cancer.

74
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,680
We already touched on a few between high and low income countries, as well as the disparities between men and women.

75
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,430
But in the United States, there's many racial disparities.

76
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,120
So on this graph here, it's looking at overall survival from thyroid cancer by race.

77
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:48,830
And this study found that Hispanic populations and Asian and Pacific Islander populations actually fared better than white populations in this study.

78
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:59,180
So as you can see, I'm looking at the survival for their alliance are above the white population line, which is in the middle right here.

79
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,919
And the authors didn't really have a big conclusion about this.

80
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,000
They thought there might be some genetic protective factors, but it's kind of unknown.

81
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:14,510
A lot of the research currently looking at thyroid cancers is looking at the disparities between black and white populations.

82
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:23,090
And in this study, as well as numerous other ones, they found that black patients fared worse in terms of survival compared to white populations.

83
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:31,130
And this was true even after even after controlling for tumor size, socioeconomic status and insurance status.

84
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,450
So in addition,

85
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:42,350
black Americans also present at the hospital much later than white populations and are less likely to receive appropriate thyroid cancer treatment.

86
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:50,179
And so I'm a big part of this is racial inequities stemming from the unequal social conditions in this country,

87
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:57,470
and that can be due to discrimination in health care providers versus an overall health care system.

88
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:08,900
Okay. So primary prevention for thyroid cancer is actually pretty difficult as there are not a lot of preventive measures that can be taken.

89
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:16,400
However, one precaution is to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure, especially at a young age,

90
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:24,740
and people are generally exposed to radiation from background radiation from either the sun or radioactive gases from the rocks and soil.

91
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,930
Medical radiation from either dental X-rays or CT scans.

92
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:35,360
And then manmade radiation such as nuclear power plants and waste.

93
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:42,860
So a 20 a 2018 study actually discovered that those who had repeated excessive

94
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:48,229
exposure to dental arteries had a 13% increase in developing thyroid cancer,

95
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:58,309
especially for women. And as a result of this, the American Dental Association Association recommended that people get X-rays either 2 to 3 years in

96
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:04,970
healthy individuals or 1 to 2 times a year for those who have oral health concerns and chronic tooth decay.

97
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:15,649
Additionally, there has been several studies that have linked increased thyroid cancer to children who have been exposed to nuclear power plants.

98
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,820
Radioactive fallout.

99
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:25,430
And as a result of that, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission recommended that if a country is going to build a nuclear power plant,

100
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,570
they have to build it in a less densely populated area.

101
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:39,319
Finally, as mentioned earlier, that iodine actually has an impact in thyroid cancer and regulating the proper

102
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,340
function of the thyroid in order to produce hormones and regulate metabolism.

103
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:50,630
So iodine deficiency actually acts as a initiator for thyroid carcinogenesis rather than a promoter.

104
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:56,630
So one strategy to address this was the implementation of iodized salt,

105
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:02,420
and this occurred in 2006 when the World Health Organization and UNICEF recommended

106
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:07,550
that salt should be iodized with an average between 20 to 40 milligrams per kilogram.

107
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:17,240
And now it's actually currently estimated that over 100 countries have implemented iodized salt into their food,

108
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:26,920
and increasing the amount of iodine consumption will help to ensure proper growth and development of the thyroid and releasing certain.

109
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,149
So over the past three decades, as mentioned before,

110
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:39,660
the incidence of thyroid cancer has significantly increased and this has been largely due to overdiagnosis as

111
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:45,870
a result of improvements in screening technologies such as ultrasound and fine needle aspiration technology.

112
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,360
So there are two screening methods that we use for thyroid cancer,

113
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,890
and one are neck palpitations that your physician does when you go for your checkup

114
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:01,650
and they are able to feel nodules that could be cancerous or develop into cancer.

115
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:08,130
However, thyroid nodules are actually pretty common and occur between in 47% of adults.

116
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:17,250
So the other method used is an ultrasound. So the ultrasound can identify these thyroid, not these thyroid nodules,

117
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:22,260
and it can identify those that are smaller than one centimeter that you can identify with neck palpitations,

118
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:29,100
and that can help better predict whether the nodules are going to be either benign or malignant.

119
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,040
So those are the two screening techniques.

120
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:39,780
But there's also a diagnostic test to determine if you have cancer, and that is a biopsy through the fine needle aspiration.

121
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:47,820
However, one third of the time pathologists can't determine based on the appearance appearance of the cells if it's actually cancerous or not.

122
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:58,200
So these patients with inconclusive results generally undergo diagnostic surgery to remove the lobe with the nodules or the entire thyroid in general.

123
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:07,740
However, recently, genetic testing has become more common and that is helped to measure changes in tissue samples in the

124
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:14,070
thyroid to identify whether a patient actually needs the diagnostic removal of the thyroid or not.

125
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:24,540
So one test is the thyroid sequence genomic classifier, and that was used to test 112 genes in a patient that has been linked to thyroid cancer.

126
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:31,560
And it can determine if a cancer has a high or low risk of metastasizing and whether the patient actually needs to have their thyroid removed.

127
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:41,700
And so with this test, it was it analyzed 257 biopsies and correctly identified 94% of those nodules that ended up being cancerous.

128
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:43,979
Additionally,

129
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:51,900
the current screening recommendation from the American Cancer Society and the United States Preventative Services Task Force is a D rating,

130
00:15:53,640 --> 00:16:01,140
and that was last updated in 2017. So that means that those who are asymptomatic and healthy should not get screened for thyroid cancer.

131
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,750
But is different if you present with symptoms.

132
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:13,409
And this was the D rating was determined because it was established that there was no benefit to screening and early detection as the

133
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:21,600
outcomes were pretty much the same due to the rarity of thyroid cancer and the high survivorship that comes along with thyroid cancer.

134
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:30,060
And then finally for tertiary prevention, that generally relates to treatment of thyroid cancer.

135
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:35,880
So the major treatment that is still occurring is the removal of your thyroid surgery.

136
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,700
But there's also other treatments, such as radioactive iodine treatment, chemotherapy and radiation.

137
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:51,230
Okay. So I'm going to talk about a little bit more about treatment. So what treatment of thyroid cancer is pretty well-established.

138
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:58,600
It's the most common endocrine cancer. And for most stages and grades, doctors will remove your entire thyroid.

139
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:07,730
So total thyroidectomy. But in cases where a stage or grade is particularly low, they may only remove one remove one lobe of the thyroid,

140
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,610
and they also will remove any lymph nodes that they can tell are infected surrounding the thyroid.

141
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:16,790
So you can see the anatomy of the thyroid right there.

142
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,200
So thyroid cancer uses a unique staging system.

143
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:28,190
T one, two, two, three, four and at t three and four, if your tumor is determined to be at those stages,

144
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:33,140
that means it's either four centimeters or larger or has any form of metastasis.

145
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,820
And in that case, after undergoing surgery for a total thyroidectomy,

146
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:50,270
patients also undergo radioactive iodine therapy to support the effects of the surgery to make sure that any further metastasis is identified.

147
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:59,600
And then sometimes if they don't think that the radioactive iodine therapy is working, they also support that with chemo and external beam radiation.

148
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,089
And after they undergo these treatments, patients will be monitored for recurrent cancer,

149
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,870
which can be found with blood tests and a bunch of different types of imaging.

150
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:18,840
So there are multiple types of thyroid cancer. They each have their own known aggressiveness.

151
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:28,920
So papillary and thyroid cancer are considered to be very well differentiated thyroid cancers and they make up the majority of thyroid cancer cases.

152
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,939
And these two cancers, because they're considered well differentiated,

153
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:41,640
have a very high five year survival rate and are generally just treated with the surgery and potential iodine treatment.

154
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,030
So another possible treatment for these two also is thyroid stimulating hormones.

155
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:58,770
So there also are poorly differentiated thyroid cancers, which the majority of time are caused by recurrent well differentiated cancers.

156
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:07,200
Um, so most people don't develop poorly differentiated thyroid cancer on their first development.

157
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,510
So we know that patients with poorly developed thyroid cancer have often have worse outcomes,

158
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,310
and this is because they are nearby spread to worse lymph nodes and sometimes distant metastases.

159
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,429
So we also can see that genetics play a role in thyroid cancer.

160
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,150
And one main example of this is Larry, thyroid cancer.

161
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:37,800
It's pretty rare. It doesn't have it's not very different than popularity or follicular thyroid cancer, but it has a strong link to the red gene.

162
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:46,019
And so if a family member is diagnosed with this form of thyroid cancer, it's recommended that you get genetic tested.

163
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,580
And if you're found to be positive for the mutation to undergo a total THYROIDECTOMY

164
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:56,790
And then the last form that is clinically relevant is anaplastic thyroid cancer.

165
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:04,410
And this is the rarest form. It only accounts for 1.7% of all cases, but it accounts for about 50% of the thyroid cancer deaths,

166
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,420
and it has about a 3 to 6 month survival rate post diagnosis.

167
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:17,309
And the reason that they speculate that this is so deadly is because it has resistance to the classic treatments that we use,

168
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:29,010
like the iodine and chemo. So after surgery and treatment, as we mentioned, thyroid cancer has a really high survival rate,

169
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:33,900
which is great, but it has really bad reported quality of life.

170
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,519
One reason is because after you have your thyroid removed, those hormones.

171
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:44,910
Hormones are still really important and you have to go on thyroid replacement hormones for the rest of your life.

172
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,310
And these hormones can have side effects can cause heart issues, low bone density.

173
00:20:52,650 --> 00:21:00,240
And because the clinical prognosis is so good, doctors often forget about quality of life when it comes to thyroid cancer patients.

174
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:06,240
One study showed that quality of life for thyroid cancer patients is lower than that of breast cancer,

175
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,230
which is certainly considered by the medical world to be a worse diagnosis.

176
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,740
So we're going to talk next about why quality of life is so bad and what we're doing to fix it.

177
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,149
So like we've talked about quality of life.

178
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:29,940
These are really important factor to consider because a majority of thyroid cancer patients are going to live for many years after their diagnosis.

179
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:36,120
So in 2015, there was a large multicenter study that was evaluating quality of life,

180
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:42,120
and they looked at the physical, psychological, social and spiritual effects of thyroid cancer.

181
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:50,850
And after surveying over a thousand patients, the study showed short term decreases in all four quality of life domains.

182
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,980
So thyroid cancer survivors also had higher rates of fatigue and depression.

183
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:04,499
And then another study showed that patients who underwent a thyroidectomy or thyroidectomy also had worse scores in

184
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:11,670
mental health and lots of physical and emotional problems in some of these patients even face like voice alterations,

185
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:16,350
swallowing, dysfunction, pain and just overall worse mental health.

186
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:24,000
A lot of these drug therapies and hormone replacement therapy are really difficult and sometimes lead to weight gain and exhaustion.

187
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:31,530
So there's a lot of ongoing research looking at how we can improve the quality of life for a lot of these patients.

188
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:38,130
And so one thing that's really important is creating new assessment tools to assess these patients.

189
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:48,990
There's not really a thyroid cancer specific tool that can correctly assess patients experiences specific to thyroid cancer.

190
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:53,999
So there's been a lot of research calls to develop these tools,

191
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,200
and this can help guide future interventions and create programs more tailored to thyroid cancer survivors.

192
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:10,960
So from what we've already discussed, we know that thyroid cancer can come with many social, psychological and physical changes.

193
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:19,890
And so one way that can simply improve one aspect of their quality of life is changing the way we talk about thyroid cancer prognosis.

194
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:27,820
And research suggests that by changing, instead of saying like it's a good cancer because of its low mortality rate,

195
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:37,000
people think that that can be more dismissive towards patients because of their the outcomes of their treatment.

196
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:45,610
However, thyroid morbidity is still a cause for concern since the fire gland has direct implications for many other functions throughout the body.

197
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Doctors can also discuss both treatment and survivorship plans much earlier for patients,

198
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,090
which can give them better ease and more comfort and more of what they might face in the future.

199
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:06,310
And then several studies have also called for new assessment tools to evaluate quality of life in thyroid cancer patients,

200
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:12,250
creating new, valid and reliable measures that indicate barriers to high quality of life.

201
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:18,820
And the tool can also guide future research and interventions to maximize quality of life for thyroid patients.

202
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:26,790
Thyroid cancer patients. Look at it in terms of quality of life.

203
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:33,110
The difference between genetic testing that's been out there recently and so previously in more traditionally

204
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:38,950
a lot of cancer patients had to go additional biopsies and procedures to make their diagnosis.

205
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,259
But recently,

206
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:51,190
there have been further tests that have been done that are open procedures like that are a little bit less invasive as to determine cancers.

207
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,820
And so they can still use biopsies and.

208
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:02,410
That's what was going on. And this has been shown to improve quality of life under both the traditional generic.

209
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:10,530
Procedures and their previous more traditional biopsies have been linked to exciting depression.

210
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:27,520
Research done to show that if. So another area of ongoing research is the Scala surgery technique.

211
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:34,030
So previously what would happen is that the surgeon would make an incision in your neck between one and four centimeters,

212
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:38,230
and you can see that in the picture or the middle picture there.

213
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:46,180
But a new method that is being researched is the scar list or a minimally invasive one where there is no incision in your neck,

214
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:51,070
but rather it's a robotic surgery using the Da Vinci machine, which is shown there.

215
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:56,710
And it makes a small incision in your armpit instead and goes from your armpit to remove the thyroid gland.

216
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:07,570
And patients who are eligible for this procedure are ones who have smaller nodules and those patients who are not obese, obese as well.

217
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:15,100
So a study was done in 2017 and examined the this method compared to a traditional surgery,

218
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:21,700
and it concluded that it was safe and there was minimal adverse effects that resulted from the scarlet surgery technique.

219
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:31,120
And additionally, there was a decrease in surgery time compared to the traditional method and the cost actually decreased as well.

220
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:37,510
So now the cost is comparable to that of a CT scan, which is a lot less than what a surgery would cost.

221
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:43,450
And then an additional study assessed the quality of life for this minimally invasive surgery,

222
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:50,020
and it used the European Organization for Research Treatment of Thyroid Cancer for Quality of Life questionnaire,

223
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:56,409
and it determined that this technique actually could offer a more rapid recovery for

224
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:01,300
emotionally and physically for those patients compared to a complete open thyroidectomy.

225
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:11,580
So this procedure has a lot of promise, but further research needs to be done as it has to follow the body of life over a long period of time.

226
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:15,070
As the follow up times for this research where only for a couple of years.

227
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:23,330
And then so as I talked about, anaplastic thyroid cancer is one of the deadliest human cancers.

228
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,940
It's accounts for a very, very small percent of overall cancers.

229
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:38,479
So this study look is looking into new treatment options for ACG to improve

230
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,710
those the quality of life of those living with this kind of thyroid cancer.

231
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,130
As I told as I mentioned, they don't usually live very long.

232
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:52,190
And if they do, the chemo radiation surgery that they've undergone drastically impacts their quality of life.

233
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,780
So as you can see in the picture on the right that this cancer involves many different molecular pathways.

234
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:07,490
And so they are developing new treatments that target these molecular pathways and can be specific to the patient and their tumor,

235
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,679
which should improve quality of life because use of these terrible,

236
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:20,210
tailored, personalized therapies can avoid the use of things we know doesn't work very well with this form of cancer, such as chemo and radiation.

237
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:27,800
So despite there being a few studies that we found in the United States on quality of life,

238
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:35,660
there's no definitive actions or recommendations in place to improve the patient's quality of life after thyroid cancer diagnosis.

239
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:44,329
So in the future, we need to continue looking into quality of life following a thyroid cancer diagnosis both in the United States and globally,

240
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:49,250
to address the disparities and propose new treatment recommendations to improve the standard of living.

241
00:28:52,930 --> 00:29:04,140
The questions. There's no questions.

242
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:12,110
You guys go first. Yeah. What are the.

243
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:28,040
Yeah. So the mechanism is still unclear, but there's a lot of new research now that says estrogen, which is the primary female sex hormone,

244
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:35,060
plays a really important role and especially because females tend to have more fluctuating hormones.

245
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:40,820
And they think that's also part of the reason why it's more common, three times more common.

246
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,280
So the question from the screening side,

247
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:57,030
I noticed that there was like needle going into the thyroid with the ultrasound with that part of the diagnostic criteria,

248
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,549
or was that just like the screening? No.

249
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:04,060
So I kind of combined the picture.

250
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:09,309
The needle is for the biopsy. Yeah.

251
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:14,410
So that needle there is the fine needle aspiration to get the by the idea, which is a diagnostic test.

252
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,100
But they use the ultrasound to guide where the needle goes.

253
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:23,330
I mean, can I make some of my questions were around the screening thing, too.

254
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:27,120
So why did the screening sort of take off when it did?

255
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,700
Do you know, like, why did people start using ultrasound for this?

256
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:36,190
Um, I don't know that question specifically.

257
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:43,180
Yeah, I just, I know it increased a lot because of the technology improves greatly over the past couple of years.

258
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:48,800
So the ultrasound was able to. Look, I guess these nodules more clearly.

259
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:56,560
Yeah. And I think if you go back actually and look at the recommendation from the USPSTF, it was changed in 2017 to be it.

260
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:01,290
Yeah. And before that, it was actually a C rating for the use of the ultrasound.

261
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:06,329
So I think there were some probably I don't actually know. I'm asking you a question I don't know the answer to,

262
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:11,729
but I think probably some paper came out suggesting that this might be good if were like, oh, okay, let's try it.

263
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:17,390
And then more research came out which showed like, you know why it's a D and then why would they have changed it?

264
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,750
Like what is the downside of screening? You mentioned that I think in the presentation.

265
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:25,860
Um, well, they just showed that the screening and the early detection,

266
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:32,550
it didn't change the outcome of the patient regardless if they had screening or not because the survival was so high.

267
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:37,490
Yeah. Um, and also, was there a difference so much in overdiagnosis as opposed.

268
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:42,780
Yeah, like a lot of patients have, like those thyroid nodules that are necessarily like cancer.

269
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:46,420
Yeah. Oh, yeah. So then you're going in and you're doing fine needle aspiration on those.

270
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:50,850
Yeah. And then a lot of the time it was inconclusive, which is why they would remove your thyroid.

271
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:58,320
And then that resulted in overtreatment. Got it. Okay. So that's kind of the deal with that's why the screening was not mentioned in

272
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,850
my screening lecture is because we don't really do it on a population level. I think there was some like, oh, let's try.

273
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:07,140
Oh no, it doesn't work kind of a thing. So there you go.

274
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,820
But there was another question. How did you find research that.

275
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:21,480
We didn't look too much into that. Why do you ask?

276
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,510
Oh, I was just curious. Well, my grandfather spent most of his career studying.

277
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:34,979
Interesting. Yeah.

278
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:39,630
I mean, there are certainly for other cancers, there are definitely associations with diabetes.

279
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:48,840
Prostate cancer is one and there are some interesting associations where like so insulin is a growth factor.

280
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:55,770
Right. So at the beginning of type two diabetes, your your pancreas is making more and more and more insulin trying to keep up.

281
00:32:55,950 --> 00:33:00,930
Right. And then eventually you get beta cell burn out and you end up having to be insulin dependent.

282
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,670
Right. So like at the beginning, you are making too much insulin and then you're making too little.

283
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:12,690
So there's actually like a timing thing with diabetes and most cancers where like the risk of cancer is increased.

284
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:20,190
Kind of when you're in that phase where you're making a lot of insulin and maybe less so later, maybe not so much for things like pancreatic cancer,

285
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:27,540
which is it's actually like related to the disease process of of, you know, because the pancreas makes the insulin and it's a cancer of that.

286
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:34,440
So that's a little bit different. The mechanism is not I don't think about the insulin increasing cell division, right.

287
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:37,709
Or being growth promoting. It's more just the tiger as makes the insulin.

288
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:42,120
And so there's these kind of associations there. But yeah, it's a big mess, right?

289
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,589
Because there's this timing issue. What if you're treated right?

290
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:49,020
So there's all of these studies that have looked at metformin,

291
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:55,770
which is kind of the number one first line treatment for type two diabetes and seen that metformin protects against various cancers.

292
00:33:56,310 --> 00:34:02,700
But is that because it's reducing diabetes or is that because it's like if you gave it to someone without diabetes, would it still reduce cancer risk?

293
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:09,050
It's very complicated and unclear, but that's interesting. Sorry I stole your question.

294
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,650
And the other questions. Yeah.

295
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:21,230
Yeah. I think it's cool that you. That's exactly.

296
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,920
Diagnosed with cancer that may have adverse outcomes.

297
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,260
They? I.

298
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:41,580
Like How do they go about? I like how you.

299
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:51,590
But I like the way they. Refusal.

300
00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:00,660
I think just by eradicating the whole thing, it's a good cancer is like a good way to start.

301
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:11,350
Me personally, my grandmother had thyroid cancer for like ten years and it like spread to her lyrics and her trachea and it mic terrible the cord,

302
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:14,750
so she couldn't speak and she had to remove her trachea.

303
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,800
So it's definitely not like a good cancer and there's a lot of adverse outcomes that come with it.

304
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:26,639
But I think just addressing it and like understanding that there can be a lot of really

305
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,520
serious outcomes despite the fact that like if they can probably remove the cancer,

306
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,479
then you can still live with all these like really bad outcomes.

307
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:42,270
So I think just by addressing it like doctors just making sure that they know that like, yeah, like this is serious.

308
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,750
You know, I think a lot of these things get disseminated right,

309
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:52,389
because there's a paper published and then people start talking about it like people who are in academic medicine who treat this cancer,

310
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:57,820
start talking about it. Doctors go to conferences and things like that and they start talking about there's a

311
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,500
lot of discussion about patient provider interactions and the ideal way to do that.

312
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,890
So I think that's kind of how it gets disseminated through the medical community.

313
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:15,370
You know, those sorts of ways. And then of course, once once a change starts to happen and these things tend to happen first,

314
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:19,000
I would say like more like academic medical centers and then it sort of trickles down,

315
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:24,300
particularly as people are trained at those places and then maybe go out to more community hospitals.

316
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:27,880
You know, it sort of disseminates over time.

317
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:34,000
It's not like an immediate sea change. But yes, I think that's probably probably true.

318
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:39,440
And it's weird, right, because you would lose influence and that's very destructive.

319
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:45,829
Yeah, that's gross. Going. So you probably do.

320
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:49,580
I mean, it's a weird balance, right? Because you don't want to, like, free people out about their cancer.

321
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:55,280
You do want to tell them, hey, you know, it sucks that you have this, but, you know, you're prognosis is good.

322
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:03,109
So that's the good news. But also, like, these are the things and really just this came up too in there's a a woman named Daniella Whitman

323
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:08,150
I may have mentioned before who does work on like sexual outcomes in prostate cancer patients.

324
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:17,780
And she has shown that just like adequate communication with the patients beforehand,

325
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:23,960
like she does these training sessions, these kind of like online sessions for men in their partners.

326
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:31,160
It was originally started for men and their wives, and then they expanded it to number of male partners and maybe single men.

327
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:36,620
And they were talking, you know, it's all about like kind of what to expect, right?

328
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:44,410
Like what are the setting reasonable expectations for what your experience of sex is going to be after having a prostatectomy?

329
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:50,440
Right. And and if you want to get your sexual function back, you have to do these things.

330
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:55,910
It's not just an automatic weight, it kind of thing. There are actually like rehabilitation things that you can do, right.

331
00:37:55,910 --> 00:38:04,940
So just that training and setting those expectations improved everybody's outcomes in terms of their quality of life, right?

332
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:10,070
Because they didn't think that everything was going to be they didn't like go in and they'd be like, wait, what's this?

333
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:16,760
Right. I feel like I got beat and switched. They knew, okay, I have to have a street for my cancer,

334
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,729
but these are going to be some of the outcomes and these are how things are going to be different.

335
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:23,300
And just just that was like really, really a good start, right?

336
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:32,120
Great job you guys are. Oh.

337
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:37,519
One thing I did want to say, though, as we switch and I always try to bring these things up, not to like pick on you guys,

338
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:43,729
but just because I think it's important, these stupid looking names, there are ways that people see them and they're not real words.

339
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:48,200
So you don't know how to say them. And that's fine, but it's not. Usually people don't say BRAF, they say BRAF.

340
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:55,400
I don't know why. Just so you know, next time I'm not picking on any of this will come up again.

341
00:38:55,790 --> 00:39:00,259
Because again, it's not a real word. Like it's just this acronym. Like, how would you know how most people say that?

342
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,680
But that's how most people do. All right.

343
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:09,959
Good job. Time for the other team.

344
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,960
Testicular. It's testicular time.

345
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:40,150
Right over here. Should we have?

346
00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:29,160
That was US executives here. Okay.

347
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:33,570
Hi. Um. Um, we had testicular cancer.

348
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:43,170
Um, and I'm going to start out with just quickly going over the public health burden with some statistics for y'all.

349
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:59,150
Um, so starting off with incidence in the US, there's about like 5.9 new cases per a thousand people identified as male at birth in 2019.

350
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:10,150
Compared to like on a global scale. There's about 1.8 new cases of testicular cancer per 100,000 in the US.

351
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:17,370
Again, it's about like a point eight increase that they've seen between 2020 20 I believe.

352
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,070
And then the highest incidence in the US again is in non-Hispanic American,

353
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:32,850
Indian and Alaska Native populations, and it is the most common cancer in males ages 15 to 35 in the US.

354
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:38,670
So going back over the global side, it is the 20th leading cancer type worldwide.

355
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:47,819
So not the most common but certainly still significant and the highest incidence they usually see in people of European ancestry.

356
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:53,459
So like Europe and Americas and there's definitely, um, as we'll talk about a little later,

357
00:41:53,460 --> 00:42:03,270
a positive correlation between like the HDI that I think also thyroid talks about, um, and testicular cancer incidence.

358
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:12,960
And so as your income kind of increases, you're seeing more testicular cancer per mortality.

359
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:20,309
So there's about 0.3 deaths per 100,000 in the US and that's pretty similar on a global scale,

360
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:24,870
a little less, um, actually equate to two deaths per 100,000.

361
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,310
So obviously like not usually fatal.

362
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:37,110
Um, no significant change has been seen in the US in this number over the past 20 years.

363
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:44,580
And actually like high income mortality in high income countries has decreased since like the 1970s ish.

364
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:52,650
And then on a global scale, the highest mortality is generally in like Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.

365
00:42:53,100 --> 00:43:01,499
And there's actually the opposite effect. So we see a negative correlation between HDI and, um, testicular cancer mortality.

366
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:13,950
And that's how I like to hypothesize, likely due to like access to screening treatment, etc. in those of lower tend to be lower income populations.

367
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:25,170
Okay. So there are multiple social determinants and disparities involved in testicular cancer that affect its statistics,

368
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:29,160
diagnosis, treatment and psychological outcomes.

369
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:35,790
The first thing I want to touch on are incidence and mortality rates.

370
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,440
They are affected by whether someone is living in poverty or not.

371
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:55,540
Their occupation and their rates. Between 1973 to 2008, the age adjusted testicular cancer incidence rate was high, was lower,

372
00:43:55,810 --> 00:44:03,820
was higher for those living in high poverty areas than low and also manual occupations.

373
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:08,740
And having a lower education was linked to having a higher incidence rate.

374
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:13,750
It's also important to note that research has shown that metal workers,

375
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:20,710
agricultural workers and equipment technicians had an increased risk to the cancer.

376
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:26,980
Lastly, in the U.S., black males had the poorest survival rates out of all races,

377
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:33,400
and additionally, those that haven't under insured status had the poorest outcomes of the cancer.

378
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:44,070
Mortality ratio so that incidence rates and mortality rates are usually higher in developed areas.

379
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:50,250
But these of these areas also have a low mortality ratio, which is favorable.

380
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:54,870
For example, in Europe they have the highest incidence ratio.

381
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:59,880
Yeah, in Africa, which is just about who is still developing continent.

382
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:04,830
They have the highest Emory are at point five, 7.6, seven.

383
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,880
And you can see it to the right in the graph on the slide.

384
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:15,059
And then also additionally favorable and my are in countries that have a higher

385
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:19,650
percent of their gross domestic product going towards their health care system,

386
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:27,210
which involves which and then give them a better ranking in their national health care system,

387
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:31,140
which is included in the World Health Organization ranking.

388
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:38,550
For example, France, which has a World Health Organization ranking of one, has an MRI, are at .04.

389
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,620
And remember, the lower they are, the better.

390
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:52,350
Whereas in country, the South African Republic has the last World Health Organization ranking at 175 and they have an AM I are at .50.

391
00:45:56,010 --> 00:46:04,290
Education levels about testicular cancer vary. And this then delays the detection and diagnosis of when it could be treated.

392
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:13,620
For example, in Northern Ireland, in this group, there is a study was conducted about self-incrimination and only 17% of the men

393
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:19,020
within the at risk age range had even heard of testicular cancer self-examination.

394
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:32,050
And then. But at this stage, testicular cancer diagnoses is higher for those living in areas of high poverty and low educational education,

395
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:40,809
low education attainment. And this is defined as having the population greater than 20% of them living in

396
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:45,820
poverty and then greater than 25% for men who are not graduated from high school.

397
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:52,750
In the US alone, blacks have been diagnosed significantly later in comparison with white and Hispanic.

398
00:46:52,790 --> 00:47:00,850
And this could be due to the fact that the white and Hispanic populations are screened more often and then have the disease detected earlier.

399
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:07,900
These outcomes postpone treatment for people, and this gives them a greater intensity and toxicity of care.

400
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:13,630
His care is escalated to achieve the treatment, and it's very hard for these patients to get through.

401
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,220
On the topic of quality of treatment.

402
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:25,180
It's associated with the quality of the health care programs, and it's different for the color of someone's skin.

403
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:31,780
The higher the health care system ranking the priority detection and treatment in Africa.

404
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:36,730
I have a quote with that. It's just inside this planning phase.

405
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:39,559
Chemotherapy, which is a treatment for testicular cancer,

406
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:46,550
isn't routinely used in the country in African countries, which also have a low health care system ranking.

407
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,100
This could be due to it's a very expensive treatment and for a lack of adequate

408
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:58,880
support from health care systems in Africa for this treatment and also in the US,

409
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:05,570
there are regional differences in treatment, quality and how often someone to receive treatment.

410
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:15,890
Has shown that black males receive treatment far less frequently than any other races, even after adjusting for age, stage and socioeconomic status.

411
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,850
Lastly, among the survivors, the psychological outcomes varied.

412
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:30,760
Those with less education and paid employment were more likely to experience cancer related distress and higher levels of avoidance.

413
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:34,910
Coping. Okay.

414
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:40,250
So I'm just going to talk about some of the risk factors for testicular cancer.

415
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:47,810
So just to clarify a risk factors, anything that increases one chance, one's chance of getting that cancer but does not directly cause it.

416
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,229
So this is particularly important for testicular cancer,

417
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:57,980
but someone can have like eight risk factors and never get that cancer and then none of them could get it.

418
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:04,580
So organism is the strongest risk factor associated with testicular cancer.

419
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:11,630
So this is when the testicle does not descend normally from the abdomen to the scrotum before birth.

420
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:16,280
So this is on the screen like a normal descent of the testicle.

421
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,840
And this does not happen in a man you have kept organism.

422
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:25,430
So this does affect approximately 3% of boys.

423
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:29,390
And frequently that testicle does end up descending within that first year of life.

424
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:35,900
But there's also a 4 to 6 fold increase of this cancer development in boys that you have organism.

425
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:41,360
So if they don't end up descending during that first year or obviously before birth,

426
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:47,780
there is a recommended surgery that is available, but there's not very strong data that supports its effectiveness.

427
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:54,229
And this uncertainty in its effectiveness is largely due to the fact that this higher

428
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:58,940
risk of testicular cancer is not due to the fact that the testicle doesn't descend,

429
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:03,650
but rather to some abnormality in that prevents normal physiology.

430
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:10,340
So because of this, there's also an increased risk of testicular cancer if you have it had it in one testicle.

431
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:13,120
Okay.

432
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:23,600
So carcinoma in situ or it's been renamed as germ cell neoplasia in situ for testicular cancer is another strong risk factor for testicular cancer.

433
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:34,040
So it's a noninvasive condition where the cells do appear abnormal under the microscope, but they have not invaded outside of this universe tubules.

434
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:39,829
So this is an issue because there's often no lump or anything.

435
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:45,590
So even if a man were to perform a self screen, they likely would not feel anything.

436
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:51,410
So this they wouldn't know that there was an abnormality. So a biopsy is one of the only ways to confirm this.

437
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:56,060
So this is an issue because a lot of times once that cancer is found, it is already metastasized.

438
00:50:56,070 --> 00:51:01,130
So even if it did start as a carcinoma in situ, it would have been found at a later stage.

439
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,820
So due to this like lack of physical symptoms.

440
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:13,340
Okay. And then, like most cancers, family history is a relatively strong risk factor for testicular cancer.

441
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:19,340
And men who have a brother that has it are at an 8 to 12 fold increased risk.

442
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:26,390
And then if their father had it, they're at a 2 to 4 fold increased risk of developing testicular cancer.

443
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:38,180
There is no gene that specifically links testicular cancer and families like it's not on a specific gene or a locus or anything,

444
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:43,760
but it's obviously heritable. Like an 8 to 12 fold increase risk is a pretty large number.

445
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:54,110
However, the average age of diagnosis for someone that has a family history of this cancer is younger, which is a good thing,

446
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:59,389
which because but this is likely due to the fact that these people are aware of their increased risks and are either

447
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:04,670
performing worse health screening or getting more biopsies to get that diagnosis sooner and get that treatment sooner.

448
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:14,960
So there's also like a weak association of KLINEFELTER syndrome, which is what I have on the board there, which is X, x, y sex chromosomes.

449
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:19,280
So there's a weak association between the syndrome and developing testicular cancer.

450
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:26,450
But again, it's not strong. So. There's not a ton of data that supports it.

451
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:35,570
So HIV, AIDS and AIDS are the only infectious agents that are linked to developing testicular cancer.

452
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:39,380
But it's not because of a direct or indirect genetic link.

453
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:47,930
Instead, it's largely due to the fact of the fact that AIDS weakens the immune system and allows this cancer to progress more quickly.

454
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:53,750
So it's relatively weak. And when this link was first discovered, it was a lot stronger.

455
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:59,630
But it has since become a little bit weaker and slightly disproven, I guess, for lack of a better word,

456
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:05,870
as scientists have discovered that correlation does not always mean causation.

457
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:09,770
However, it does weaken your immune system. So there is some link between the two.

458
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:16,610
And then finally, age is also a risk factor for testicular cancer.

459
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:25,220
However, it's in the opposite way of most cancers. So younger men are at a higher risk of developing this cancer when compared to older men.

460
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:31,130
And half of testicular cancers do occur in men who are between the ages of 20 and 34.

461
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:35,030
So younger men are at a much higher risk of developing this cancer.

462
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,860
And then also, I wanted to touch on this before,

463
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:46,880
but having cancer in one testicle also increases the risk of developing in the other other testicle by 4%.

464
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:52,340
So at some point in a man's life, if they have been cured of it in one testicle, it might develop in the other.

465
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:59,569
And again, this is just kind of a hypothesis, but this is likely due to the fact of that abnormality that might have either caused

466
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:06,890
the testicle to not descend or caused the cancer to develop in the first place. Okay.

467
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:13,550
So moving into some prevention efforts there, there's not routine screening recommended right now.

468
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:23,480
It's you have a very high survival rate we'll get into. If you have additional risk factors, then you will do screening more often.

469
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:29,630
So when should screening occur? Only if you have like family risk factors, things like that.

470
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:36,350
Then it's important to get screened if you have symptoms.

471
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:44,520
So there's two different kinds of symptoms. There's like symptoms which can be acute pain in testes or scrotum and scrotum,

472
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:51,200
your abdomen, firmness of testes, painless, solid, testicular, mass, things like that.

473
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:56,160
Then you go get checked out. And then screening would occur.

474
00:54:56,180 --> 00:55:01,460
Then there's also symptoms that are a lot less common for metastases,

475
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:08,090
and that is like gastrointestinal symptoms, headaches or back pain, different things like that.

476
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:14,479
A lot of times, if there is a change, it will be detected by the patient or the sex partner.

477
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,760
And then you'll go and get screened.

478
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:29,600
So in terms of screening, they kind of when you come in with like something off there, they want to rule out epidemic rates.

479
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:33,980
So they'll prescribe you antibiotics to make sure it's not something else going on.

480
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:39,380
And if that's not effective, then they'll go do scrotal ultrasonography, which is imaging,

481
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:46,250
and then they will move into like for me, which is a surgical removal of one or both testicles.

482
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,390
I just want to just make a quick clarification.

483
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:53,870
So this isn't really screening, right? Because you're not doing it in asymptomatic people.

484
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:57,319
This would be like a diagnostic. Okay. Is that right? Yes, yes.

485
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,730
Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

486
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:07,490
That's a that's a common like conflation because often the thing we would do to screen is also what we do to check if someone has symptoms.

487
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:11,780
But if you're doing it in someone who has a symptom, it's a diagnostic test.

488
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:15,139
Okay. Does that make sense? Yes. Okay. Right. Okay.

489
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:23,460
Just a clarification. No worries. And then we did talk about this organism.

490
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:27,560
Um, and so there's kind of mixed data on it.

491
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:33,940
It's recommended that you get the training, which is that word need to move the test.

492
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:41,850
Back where it's supposed to be. It still will have an elevated risk because there's other contributing factors.

493
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:49,890
But hopefully it will help improve that. And then moving into treatment and survivorship.

494
00:56:50,760 --> 00:57:01,799
There is two different kinds of main like germ cell cancers that makes up 95% of the testicular cancer.

495
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:06,780
So that's those are the sperm forming cells. There's some anomalies and some anomalies.

496
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:13,740
Some of those make up about 40% of those kinds.

497
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:19,680
So some in almost have a low rate of metastasis and a very good prognosis, not in some anomalies.

498
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:24,410
It's just kind of like a larger category with different kind, distinct terminal cancers.

499
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:30,270
They're more mature and specialized and they have different like varying degrees of aggressiveness.

500
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:43,520
So in terms of treatment, um, like we mentioned before, that word you have to me, so that's the removal of that testicle.

501
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:53,510
And then depending on how severe it is, it will move into like chemo or radiation and things like that.

502
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:59,810
A lot of times they try and prevent doing that because those have different like impacts for quality of life.

503
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:09,170
And the prognosis is usually pretty good, but it's usually conversation based on stage and with the doctor and the patient and what works best.

504
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:21,320
So first stage one Seminole Law. Um, it's a very high likelihood that you will be cancer free five years after that against me.

505
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,670
They just like to do surveillance, which means it's just that word get to me and nothing else.

506
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:33,169
But if you have additional family risk factors or something like that, then you might do like chemotherapy and radiotherapy and that will give you a

507
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:40,040
even higher relapse free rate and the five year survival rate for stage one.

508
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:44,390
Like 99%. So it's really likely that people will survive.

509
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:49,760
For stage two, then you're a lot more likely to get radiotherapy or chemotherapy.

510
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:58,400
There is 11%, 8% relapse rate. It just kind of depends on a conversation, what works best.

511
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:02,210
And there's, again, a very high six year survival following up.

512
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:07,930
And then stage two or three, we'll definitely get chemotherapy in addition to that for me.

513
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:17,120
And then sometimes there will be a all'interno dissection happening as well depending on the case and then for the non seminal treatment.

514
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:25,490
Stage one is also active surveillance or chemotherapy or in addition to chemotherapy and sometimes the lymph node removal,

515
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,110
it's a 30% relapse risk with active surveillance.

516
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:39,590
But if you take out the patients with additional risk factors and put them into surgery or you get them out of work after the chemotherapy,

517
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:50,629
then it is reduced a lot to 12% and has a 3% relapse risk rate and it's recommended

518
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:56,600
over that lymph node dissection and removal because it's a lot less invasive,

519
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:06,559
things like that and fewer surgical complications. And then stage two or three will get chemotherapy in that removal.

520
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:10,400
And then if it's a larger mass, then you'll do a M.S. as well.

521
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:19,640
Again, the survival is really high for this. So all stages of the seminal Ms. have over 90% cure rate.

522
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:25,459
The stage one and two and on some animals have a little bit lower survival rate than

523
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:32,420
some of the some enormous and at like 95% with stage three has a 78% survival rate.

524
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:40,520
In terms of survivorship, you have to follow them really closely for five years.

525
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:48,110
The majority of the relapses for stage one and some anomalies will happen within six months to two years.

526
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:51,690
At least 70% of them will happen very soon after.

527
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:56,360
And so it's important to follow them up with different screening, go to the doctor,

528
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:00,530
get different scans and things just to make sure everything is all right.

529
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:07,219
So long term challenges, a lot of those are seen as a result of the treatments.

530
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:16,760
So chemotherapy and the radiation, it has an increased risk of neoplasms and secondary leukemia.

531
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:20,930
So cancer risk and then also cardiovascular disease.

532
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:28,790
So that's a lot of the big reason that they want to do the active surveillance instead of going in and doing the chemo.

533
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:35,630
And right after that work to me as well, because you can always go back and then do that later.

534
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:43,320
So lifestyle considerations, all of those treatments that were against me, chemo and radiation,

535
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:50,760
they all have a risk of future infertility and survivors because they are younger, free to use assisted reproductive techniques.

536
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:58,770
So sperm banking should be offered early treatment. It's not offered super often right now, but it should be more common.

537
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:03,810
And then a testicular procedure. Should be offered as well.

538
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:08,280
So now I'm going to talk about ongoing areas of research.

539
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:19,160
So as we've kind of mentioned, testicular cancer is distinct amongst other cancers for the early age that it affects.

540
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:28,219
So it's usually 15 to 34 year old men who have this diagnosis and there's a really high survival rate as well.

541
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:33,110
So there's a 97% five year survival rate with this.

542
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:38,239
It kind of brings up the question of what do these survivors do later in life?

543
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:45,410
Like what are the long term effects? So there has been a link between hypogonadism and cardiovascular disease.

544
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:52,480
So they found that people who have chemotherapy as an early treatment, it leads to a late.

545
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:55,970
Okay, so I think I'm saying that rate function deterioration.

546
01:02:56,630 --> 01:03:08,270
And so this has been linked to hypogonadism, which is the lack of or decrease reduction in the sex hormone from the male and sex gland.

547
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:13,370
So this can lead to increased rates of cardiovascular disease.

548
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:21,020
And so there's also high dosages of chemo and radiotherapy are shown to be linked

549
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:26,120
to increased rates of diabetes and cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome.

550
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:32,080
So now the question is how do we prevent these long term effects?

551
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:39,040
So this is kind of where the research has been and there's been a genome wide association study.

552
01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:47,200
So this has been assessing platinum based chemotherapy to see which single nucleotide polymorphisms also known as that SNPs,

553
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:49,330
are linked to cardiovascular disease.

554
01:03:50,170 --> 01:04:01,310
So what they were able to find was that the C two and the C three network were correlated to a third was cirrhosis and senescence.

555
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:05,530
So those are linked to increased rates of cardiovascular disease.

556
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:17,890
They were also able to determine that two of the 179 SNP so against single nucleotide polymorphisms were correlated to cardiovascular disease.

557
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:24,810
And so the goal from this study was to assess and.

558
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:35,879
Yeah. Sorry, this is the slide into the goal from this study was to assess population, cardiovascular disease, genetic risk scores.

559
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:42,600
So that's what the researchers kind of concluded from this, and that's what they're saying to do as one preventative set.

560
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:56,089
So another study kind of looked at potential interventions and it's hard to really say what to do because it's unclear from the research.

561
01:04:56,090 --> 01:04:57,020
But again,

562
01:04:57,020 --> 01:05:05,480
they're echoing the sentiments from the first study to look at platinum based chemo radiotherapy and factor in other things such as genetics,

563
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:11,840
lifestyle habits and seeing how that plays a role in the risk for cardiovascular disease.

564
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:18,320
So they're also saying for public health officials to kind of step in and have targeted interventions.

565
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:23,420
So these interventions can help people stop smoking, for example,

566
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:29,420
and to make them eat healthier and practice healthier lifestyle habits like physical activity.

567
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:34,880
So those are some of the conclusions they came up with from the research.

568
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:45,660
So any question? So I want to talk really quick.

569
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:52,050
The really, really important time trends with this cancer in the US in terms of incidence and mortality.

570
01:05:55,290 --> 01:06:01,889
There aren't any significant ones that I could find related to like particular public health behaviors.

571
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:08,160
But I do know that incidents has been steadily increasing over the past few years, particularly in developed nations.

572
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:16,020
And so when I was doing a lot of my risk factor reading, trying to determine maybe where that correlation lies, it's pretty unclear and unknown.

573
01:06:16,050 --> 01:06:19,800
They don't really know why it's increasing. How about mortality?

574
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:23,430
What's happening with like, like a little bit longer term trend with mortality?

575
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:30,050
Yeah. Where like with, you know, when they you're on the 1970s.

576
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:33,390
That's right. Do you know why? Smoking cessation.

577
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:39,780
Cisplatin. Cisplatin, chemotherapy. It came on the mark.

578
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:50,040
I had to look it up. Actually came on the market in 1972, 79, and it actually changed the mortality rate, the survival rate from 10% to 85% overall.

579
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:55,919
For testicular cancer, like testicular cancer is the huge success story versus what it is.

580
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,649
I mean, cisplatin is used for other things. It's successful with it.

581
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:04,170
But like people can have metastatic testicular cancer and if you give them cisplatin, they will live.

582
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:12,690
They'll be fine. I mean, fine with without the there's all obviously these longer term effects which in your was your whole area of ongoing research.

583
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:17,520
But like it's kind of magical almost how well it works for some testicular cancers.

584
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:25,680
So that's like a huge story with with testicular cancer is that cisplatin was so useful.

585
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:31,500
Right. Which is why they always use it, which is why now you have all of these longer term effects of a platinum.

586
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:36,930
So cisplatin, platinum, platinum based chemotherapy, that's what cisplatin is now.

587
01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:43,500
They'll often use it with other stuff too, like combos. But, um, it's the kind of the backbone of therapy for.

588
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:50,960
Testicular cancer. Sorry for the thing we're talking about, the one that we're talking about right now.

589
01:07:53,060 --> 01:08:01,190
You guys have questions? Yeah. You mentioned how depending on your occupation.

590
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:07,700
Here's an agricultural. Anything like that exposed to you that was causing.

591
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:15,680
From the reading. We weren't sure yet. We were looking at each occupational health care setting,

592
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:22,339
working at working at home or closer to home, and it just really landed on manual occupations.

593
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:28,430
So yeah, so the metal workers, agricultural workers, equipment technicians, they have increased risk.

594
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:37,669
Not sure yet why it could be maybe due to, you know, those occupations have sometimes a lower education like people working.

595
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:41,750
Those have a little bit less education and that was linked also to a higher rate.

596
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:48,790
So there are lots of factors that could go in to that and maybe we can look at the workers and their background.

597
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:54,920
But as for the actual work, we're not sure. So what kind of study design do you think they're doing?

598
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:59,150
So first of all, what's the biggest? Why is testicular cancer hard to study?

599
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:12,600
Anybody. It's rare, right?

600
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:19,290
It's really, really rare. I'm sorry. I kind of asked you to read my mind there, but it's super rare, right?

601
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:24,690
So what kind of study design are they're probably doing when they're studying these agricultural or whatever workers?

602
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:31,020
Very large population. Yeah, but if you're studying workers, that's going to be really high.

603
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:34,110
Like what kind of observation?

604
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:37,680
Although we talked about a couple of different kinds. There's cohorts, there's case control.

605
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:42,810
Which ones are good, for better or worse, are really tough for rare diseases.

606
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:51,390
Right. Because you got to get you got to get you got to get healthy people, a bunch of healthy people and then follow them until you get cancers.

607
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:56,070
Right. So you have to have huge numbers of healthy people to accumulate enough cancers.

608
01:09:56,070 --> 01:10:02,250
Right. So I think it's probably if you go back and look at the papers, it's probably case control studies, right?

609
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:10,560
So if there were smart, you were saying that like these jobs are lower, as high as generally lower education jobs.

610
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:16,170
If they were smart, like if you were going to design a study that got around that, what would you do?

611
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:25,020
You'd get maybe two circular cancer cases who were then you'd get people who were

612
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:28,910
exposed to these metalworking jobs and who might your comparison of jobs be?

613
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:32,900
Jobs. You know what? White collar jobs.

614
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:39,469
Would you want to compare that to white collar jobs or would you want to compare them to other blue collar jobs maybe that don't have the same?

615
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:45,410
Like if you think it's a chemical exposure of someone who's doing I don't know. I don't remember that it was a welding or whatever agricultural work.

616
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:51,620
Maybe you get someone else who does some other blue collar job and then compare them to them and then also compare to white collar.

617
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:55,639
Right. Because if if it's just the blue collar job in the education,

618
01:10:55,640 --> 01:11:00,770
you might expect that all of the blue collar job folks would have higher rates than the white collar job folks.

619
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:08,030
But if it's something specific about that, you're exposed to with that job, you would expect higher there, but not in the other blue collar jobs.

620
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:11,420
Like that's how I would do it. I would probably get a few different populations.

621
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:20,599
I also wonder if because there's such a high survival rate that it's not like a priority or research for like a lot of a lot of people.

622
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:27,049
I don't know, just I don't know how, but like it's like, oh, so it is, it isn't even a very high survival rate,

623
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:30,350
but it has like you guys have identified these people live a really long time, right?

624
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:32,420
And it affects younger people.

625
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:39,829
And so I think there is I think it's the rarity of it that makes it less of a priority and also maybe also the high survival.

626
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:42,920
But it's it is because it affects younger people.

627
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:51,260
I think that does motivate some. But like all of you, it's tough to study even in all of the big cancer cohorts that we have.

628
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:57,049
First of all, most of the big cancer cohorts that we have recruited people in middle age because they

629
01:11:57,050 --> 01:12:02,120
wanted to get enough cases of cancers in a reasonable amount of time to study that.

630
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:06,409
So if you if you recruit 30 year olds, you're going to be waiting 30 or 40 years before they get cancer.

631
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:10,340
If you recruit 50 to 70 year olds, you're going to get some cases in the next decade.

632
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:19,040
Right. So if most of your testicular cancer cases are happening in 30 year olds and 20 year olds, that's done right.

633
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:23,960
So your traditional cohort study for cancer, you can't use them to study testicular cancer.

634
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:30,290
And any cohort studies for other things that are recruiting younger people aren't recruiting enough people for you to get in our cases.

635
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:36,950
So we've been sort of stuck with case control studies. And it's just it's a tough nut to crack.

636
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:45,220
But it's an interesting one. Sorry. I think there were more questions to be.

637
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:55,920
Mortality. I saw it right here.

638
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:10,920
Per this speaker? No, I. Well.

639
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:21,860
So what's what country? Grant Oceania. Australia is a pretty high income country.

640
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:26,120
I don't know that there's a huge difference between point 0.06.

641
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:34,020
The other thing I wanted to point out to, as you mentioned in your correct,

642
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:38,640
that the American-Indian, Alaska natives have the highest rate for who has the second highest rate.

643
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:43,620
You know, we had white people, right? And the black people have a much lower rate.

644
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:50,190
So some of this incident stuff you were talking about, the differences in income in the countries.

645
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:57,389
And I think that certainly has a lot to do with the mortality dissonance ratio because if you don't have access to cisplatin therapy,

646
01:13:57,390 --> 01:14:03,290
you're back down to your 10% survival rate. That's bad News Bears, and it really is for this one.

647
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:06,720
The mortality really is driven by access to that chemotherapy drug.

648
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:18,180
Right. But the incidents, I think, you know, when you see these really high incidence rates in like Europe and North America,

649
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:21,510
I mean, that's where we have a whole lot of white people.

650
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:27,610
So I think part of that is racially driven is that you see these high incidence rates in places that

651
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:33,070
have a high proportion of white people because white people have a much higher rate than other groups.

652
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:48,059
Course. All right.

653
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:56,490
Well, good job. This is kind of a weird one, guys, different than a lot of the cancers that we talk about.

654
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,870
All right. So that's how it's done. Good job, everybody. Thanks for taking us off.

655
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:04,319
I know it's always a little awkward to be the first people to go, but you're done, though.

656
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:10,890
You don't have to worry about it. It's off your plate. Any questions about anything before we pack up and leave?

657
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:16,290
Go on Thursday, you guys and you guys.

658
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:21,510
All right. We will see you then. And I look forward to seeing you.

659
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:34,790
Have a great rest of your week. I forget to design it.

660
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:38,960
I didn't see anybody get it. That.
