1
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:10,810
So we are very delighted to have she went the other view.

2
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:19,660
No nonsense this work. Oh good to have Kevin Thompson here to speak to us about ventilator associated events.

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,389
And I wanted to say a little bit about yourself and how you got through.

4
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:33,580
And second of all, I think we can all get to know you a little better myself, so I'm sure they'd like to hear a little bit.

5
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,840
Yeah, no, thanks. Thanks for having me here. Hello, everyone.

6
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:44,890
There's a couple of people that just walked in here, so let me make sure you have the sheets here.

7
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:50,600
Yeah. So my name's going to go.

8
00:00:53,210 --> 00:01:00,920
So it's worked. I work at Infection Control here at U of M for the last five and a half years or so,

9
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:10,640
I've been in infection prevention for the last nine and then in health care for the last 15 years.

10
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:17,900
So this quick math and figure out that this wasn't my this wasn't my first job or first career.

11
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:26,090
Yeah. So when I when I completed my undergrad, I completed my undergrad in physiology.

12
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:38,630
I worked in the stress lab in the hospital and a couple of smaller hospitals up north for a few years and then knew I wanted to go to grad school,

13
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:41,660
get my master's, but it wasn't really sure in what.

14
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:49,070
And I grew up in a really, really rural area up north town or village of like 200 people.

15
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:58,280
So I mean, it was the closest hospital that was closer than an hour and a half away, was a critical access hospital that had about 20 inpatient beds.

16
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,370
So compared to this thousand bed behemoth over here, you know, that's quite a different experience.

17
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,029
That said, there wasn't a lot of it that didn't there wasn't a lot of people that worked there.

18
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,940
Not a lot of jobs and a lot of exposure. So I didn't even know what infection control was when I went to college.

19
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,750
So my first exposure to infection prevention was actually like working in the hospital.

20
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,720
And then on behalf of our department, I, I was able to sit on a few safety committees,

21
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:34,670
a few AP committees, and, and that's really how I got my first exposure to that was really cool.

22
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,850
So, so yeah. So I started my master's.

23
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,810
Yeah. About four years into my in into while I was working.

24
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,970
So I was working and going to school at the same time and then went down the epidemiology route

25
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,980
for my MPH I did in Chicago because I lived on the other side of the state and I got into it.

26
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:03,730
So thankfully I was able to get into a program at a at a smaller 100 bed hospital.

27
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:09,790
I worked there for a little while and then moved to a kind of moderately sized hospital, 450 beds in Kalamazoo.

28
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,120
They had a lot more services available there.

29
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,310
So you get to see a little bit more complexity of different,

30
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:23,800
different things that happen and go on within infection control, just hospital setting in general.

31
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,990
And then I moved over here. So it was really nice.

32
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:34,149
I've had I feel like I've been very fortunate to have some experience doing IP work at very big place, medium place in a little place.

33
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:42,340
And there's a lot of differences and pros and cons that go into advantages and disadvantages of working at all, all of those different size hospitals.

34
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,799
But that's kind of how I got into the IP program was really through work exposure.

35
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,400
So pretty, pretty neat.

36
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:59,490
I know some of you may have been working for a little while and then come back to school.

37
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,320
Some of you may have just gone from undergrad through right up through.

38
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,709
You know, we have a lot of people in our department and pretty much every pathway has been covered.

39
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:16,270
So, you know, I think it's great to have, you know, just like that, those differing experiences because they all complement each other.

40
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:26,950
So it's a little bit about me right now here at U of M, I support from an infection prevention perspective.

41
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:34,029
I support surgical ICU and the ALMO Department, radiology, emergency services.

42
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:45,100
So that would be adult psychiatric and children's emergency departments as well as a other a few other general care units.

43
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:50,050
And then also I look at the prevention projects for C difficile hospital.

44
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:56,530
So seriously, if a seal infection and then ventilator associated event reduction,

45
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:02,620
which is why I'm here today to talk to you about V.A. e r ventilator associated events.

46
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:09,219
So for those of you that just came in, there is a handout.

47
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:15,129
We don't we're not going to get to it right away. But maybe what I'll do is just use our pass it around it very have one.

48
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,850
Just skip it. So we'll just use this a little bit later.

49
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:24,669
It's, it's a nice kind of cheat sheet, one stop shop with all the definition, all the definition criteria on it.

50
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:30,489
So when we go through some case studies at the end of this portion of the lecture, you can use that as a reference.

51
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,600
Okay. So any questions before we get going?

52
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:43,000
All right. So just some quick background on ventilator associated events.

53
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:56,379
First of all, this is a this is a device associated infection, health care associated infection that happens while somebody is on the ventilator.

54
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:01,630
Right. Hence the name. So, you know, you've I think you're talking about shortly later.

55
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,210
Do you already talk about plans to have you recover that or not? Yeah.

56
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,240
Okay. So very similar.

57
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,469
But the device we're talking about is not central line. It's not a full catheter, it's a ventilator.

58
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:19,720
Right. And patients get put on the ventilator when they're unable to breathe on their

59
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,460
own or after some type of trauma in order to protect their their airway.

60
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,980
Yeah. So before you get put on a ventilator, you have to get intubated.

61
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,589
Right. And this is typically the device that we're talking about.

62
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:43,960
So I have this I can I'm just going to show you real quickly, but then you can kind of come take a closer look later, too, if you want.

63
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:53,589
But this is one of the three types of airways that that does most of the heavy lifting in the hospital as far as intubation activation go.

64
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:59,140
So this on the first point here is is an endotracheal tube.

65
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:09,700
So this is an advanced airway goes down the patient's trachea and then this distal end terminates.

66
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:18,730
But on the trachea, beginning with the patient's lungs. So there's a cuff here that gets inflated using the syringe,

67
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,580
which basically blocks the rest of your trachea so that any type of respiratory secretions, etc.,

68
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,650
that you have since you're propping your airway open,

69
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:34,780
doesn't like flow down into your lungs because there's bacteria in that and that can cause respiratory infection, namely pneumonia.

70
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,870
Right. So there's this little balloon that pops up.

71
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:47,620
Preventing that. And then there is this one actually is of some galactic secretion drainage suction tubes.

72
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:56,740
So this actually has another channel here which kind of terminates above the balloon so that if somebody does have a lot of respiratory secretions,

73
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:04,060
you can have some suction up to this and it what kind of suck out those extra secretions

74
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:09,790
before they have a chance to even potentially get past that and get down on a patient's lung.

75
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:14,410
So it's just one more thing that we do to kind of keep the patient safe.

76
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:21,850
But again, this goes through the mouth, through the trachea and then gets inflated.

77
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,680
There's also an empire nasal, a pharyngeal airway, which is the second one here.

78
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,290
So it goes into the trachea via your nose instead of going through your mouth.

79
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,320
So you can imagine it's not this big. It's a lot smaller.

80
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:42,129
They don't have one of those to show you, but it's a lot smaller. But there's different, different uses for that.

81
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,810
It's used far less frequently.

82
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:52,899
But if somebody isn't appropriate for and a tricky one to push and you might use it as a pharyngeal airway and then lastly, tracheostomy.

83
00:08:52,900 --> 00:09:02,830
So that's one if you've never seen the airway that goes through cuts made in the in your neck and then it goes directly into your trachea,

84
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:12,250
not by your mouth, but by you're not use less often, but especially somebody is going to be on a ventilator for an extended period of time.

85
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:21,820
Very often the patient get tracheostomy just to to protect their airway from from damage over long term use of mandatory deal to.

86
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:37,440
So once that's in place, the team gets connected to the ventilator and the ventilator starts providing oxygen to the oxygenation in patients lungs.

87
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,980
Once the ventilator is turned on, right, that would be day one.

88
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:50,760
That's the day the patient was intubated and placed on a ventilator. That's mechanical ventilation day one or device day one.

89
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:57,840
Okay. So the patient can't be evaluated for VR until the third day of of mechanical ventilation.

90
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,900
So if you think back to like the collapse of a talk you had.

91
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,560
Right. Like a patient has to have a central line for at least three calendar days.

92
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,550
Right. You can't have an infection show up in the first two days. The device is placed.

93
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:17,850
If you do, that's just considered a play or present on admission or or non device associated infection.

94
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:22,290
Okay. And you'll kind of see why when we started going through the infection criteria,

95
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,639
why you have to have at least three days because you have to have at least three days worth of settings

96
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,950
and data before you can even consider calling anywhere but just about any device associated infection.

97
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:40,650
The device always has to be there for three days. So why do we care about ventilator associated pneumonia and ventilator associated events?

98
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,870
Well, the more often they happen, the higher the instances of mortality.

99
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:54,600
You know, when we have complications while on the ventilator that can increase your length of ventilation or the time that you're on the ventilator,

100
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:01,580
not breathing on your own, which can cause some downstream issues as far as coming off,

101
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:07,190
being liberated from the ventilator eventually and also longer, you know, increased length of stay.

102
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:16,049
So the longer you're on the ventilator, longer you can be in the hospital, longer are going to be in ICU and the costs start piling up.

103
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,960
And then that's just not good for the patient, right?

104
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:24,720
It would be better for them to get off the ventilator, start breathing on their own, get into urgent care, but get better and go home.

105
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,230
So the longer they're in the hospital, it's not good for anybody.

106
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,000
So that ventilator associated pneumonia.

107
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,750
There was a good study that was done. And so several years ago now.

108
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:42,470
But they approximate the cost of every ventilator associated ammonia has an additional cost of about $40,000 per patient.

109
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,709
So it's not nothing for sure. It's those costs.

110
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,340
Those extra costs can add up over time.

111
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,160
Right. So we've talked about VAP, we're talking about V today.

112
00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:01,829
So I, we've mentioned VAP. Well, years ago we used to do VAP surveillance or ventilator associated pneumonia surveillance.

113
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,310
So this would be patients on the ventilator to develop pneumonia.

114
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:10,709
Right. While on the ventilator, we don't we don't do VAP surveillance anymore.

115
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,880
That's it's kind of migrated over the VA. And there's a couple of reasons why.

116
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:24,270
One, our reporting standards, we have to complete the surveillance and then report them to the CDC via NHS, our national health care safety network.

117
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:28,649
And then they and then they report to CMS on behalf of us.

118
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:35,219
Right. And then our performance matters as far as how we're doing compared to other institutions.

119
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:43,620
Well, the VAT definition was so complicated and so subjective that what they found was there are some very low interim reliability.

120
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:52,230
So basically, you know, we do valve surveillance at this hospital, hospital A and then hospital BCD do have surveillance as well.

121
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,030
And if you look at the same cases, they could come up with totally different answers.

122
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,370
This is about this isn't this isn't this right?

123
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:08,340
So if you can't get a consistent kind of surveillance accomplished across different institutions, and how do you benchmark them against each other?

124
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,180
Right. You can't really compare apples to apples when people aren't doing the same thing.

125
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:21,870
So in 20 and 2012, 2013, the VAP deaf and the VAD surveillance was abandoned.

126
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,379
Then we adopted this new VA ventilator associated event.

127
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:32,550
Progressive definition for adults, and this doesn't include any type of radiographic findings.

128
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:37,890
So before you had to do all this like x ray interpretation to figure out if this patient may or may not have had pneumonia,

129
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:45,510
which is pretty complicated. And again, part of one of the more subjective pieces, there's a very specific time frame for the event.

130
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,440
And it's it's a very, very objective definition.

131
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,979
So if you're really into just like deductive reasoning, like this is definitely this or this definition for you,

132
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:02,670
there's not a lot of room for really like interpreting or it's there's some pretty

133
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,110
well defined criteria and you just kind of move through it in a stepwise fashion.

134
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:15,480
And if you get to the end of the algorithm, then, you know, kind of what what ventilator associated that we're talking about.

135
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:21,960
So I just want to ask, so what does he mean by interrelated into.

136
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,580
Your reliability. What does that mean? Yeah.

137
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:38,620
It means that two people could go through that surveillance and get different results from the same data because it's difficult to determine,

138
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,769
like especially for the radiographic findings. It's difficult to characterize.

139
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:50,110
Right. Very good. That's great. Yeah. So remember what we write. Reliability is, does this have anything to do with the validity of the definition?

140
00:14:54,030 --> 00:15:02,400
No. Why not? I see you shaking your head with the lack of reliability of the statement.

141
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:14,460
Oh, that would be completely different. That is really the problem between two people interpret the data and they said the definition is wrong.

142
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:21,089
This is a very difficult thing. And I do think that to reject that subject, say that that's a difference.

143
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:33,830
That would make something very. When we say something as valid, what does that mean?

144
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:46,260
Then it's authorized by some authority. Well, that's one idea that arises like summarily so.

145
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:52,090
But that we're always talking about when you tell us something that we talk about it, reflecting truth somehow is true.

146
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:59,540
Okay. So authorization of authority in this case is part of the definition is authorized by CDC.

147
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:05,150
But when we say something is valid, we mean that it actually that that we've gotten that the truth.

148
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:10,930
If something's reliable, it means that you can do it over and over again.

149
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:16,190
And if it's one person, it's repeatable or in the same word, if it's reliable.

150
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,409
Different groups can use the same definition and all get the same answer.

151
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:25,060
And that's something really important. Civil, right?

152
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:30,590
So you could have people in different hospitals as long as they use the same definition,

153
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:37,610
you know that you're comparing apples and apples as opposed to apples, oranges, pears, tomatoes, bananas and all those things.

154
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:46,820
And that's really important to your. But it is important to remember what makes something valid relative.

155
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,170
So these definitions are made up of and relative to clinical.

156
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,250
So physicians will say, well, this person has it or not.

157
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,720
And then they try to come up with some definitions that everybody would agree on.

158
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:12,830
So it's quite a process to come up with a surveillance definition that has both is valid and reliable.

159
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,840
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I mean, when you're when you're comparing, right.

160
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,189
Performance from one hospital and you want it to be as consistent as possible.

161
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:28,400
So case definitions, cardiac classifier, all of them are very specific.

162
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:34,909
There's very specific criteria, right, that you have to meet to meet the case definition.

163
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,460
And the whole point is so that we're comparing apples to apples.

164
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:47,130
So what you'll find and we've got a couple of good examples in here when we get to them, is that for the most part of the surveillance,

165
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:53,970
the case definition for whatever we're talking about, we'll capture most of the cases that we're talking about.

166
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,620
However, there's always going to be outliers, right? Is from a like a clinical perspective.

167
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:11,029
So there's always going to be to a much lower like there will be outliers of a much lower number that may not get captured by the case definition.

168
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,839
Right. So we may have true colony collapse here, that right.

169
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,499
That may be admitted. But then on the other side of the spectrum,

170
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:25,350
there will always be there will be rare cases that are included in the case definition but don't necessarily mean,

171
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:31,040
but by and large it's a consistent way to measure performance.

172
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,229
So as far as VA egos, we call them ventilator associated matters,

173
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,889
not to ventilator associate pneumonias because there are three different types of events.

174
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:44,270
So this is unique to VA, right? These classes are classes.

175
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:51,260
Cardiac records with Vas can be Vacc AWACS and perhaps, okay, we're gonna talk about those momentarily.

176
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:58,580
But there's three different levels essentially of ventilator associated events.

177
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:05,240
All right. So now I'm going to toggle over. To the definitions.

178
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,160
Questions on anything we've cover so far. All right.

179
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:26,660
Com's. So first of x och vax or ventilator associated conditions could be anything that causes worsening oxygenation.

180
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:32,060
Oxygenation. I can never get that right. There's a couple examples up here.

181
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:36,440
Acute respiratory failure, chronic heart failure and pneumonia.

182
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:42,080
So that's cover a pretty broad spectrum of events.

183
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,779
Okay. This is basically if you want to look at your sheet here, we're going to review it again.

184
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:54,589
But if you want to look at the top of your sheet, we're just at the very top, right for VAX, a ventilator,

185
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,970
associate conditions, anything where somebody has had a period of stability on a ventilator.

186
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:06,350
Okay. And then it's followed by a period of worsening oxygenation or increasing oxygen requirements.

187
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,399
Okay. This might be infection related, but it might not be infection related.

188
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,620
It could be due to something totally non infection related like chronic heart failure.

189
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:15,799
Right.

190
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:28,910
So if you have congestive heart failure, you can have a volume overload that causes, you know, an increased need for O2 settings in a patient's lungs.

191
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:34,890
But that's not infection related. And we have I don't know if everybody goes with it to work tirelessly.

192
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,720
Yeah. Anyway, you want to help with that, Dr. Stone? Yeah. Yeah.

193
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:53,360
It's basically we see it a lot in patients, maybe following surgery or if they've been kind of lying in bed for a really long time,

194
00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:01,610
whether or not like taking in full, deep breaths and expanding the lungs, it can basically cause sort of like a partial collapse of the lung tissue.

195
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:12,980
And it's something you can see sometimes on an x ray, but it basically kind of reduces the surface area in your lungs or oxygen exchange.

196
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,210
And so you're it can cause your oxygen saturation. To drought.

197
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:22,220
So that's what Adam, I guess this is it's tricky word to say.

198
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:26,290
Yes. Yes. And explain much better than I can.

199
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,360
So thank you. So anyway, that's the basis for our video surveillance.

200
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:38,060
Okay. And, you know, as you'll see, these surveillance definitions kind of build on top of each other.

201
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:44,389
So this is a progressive definition. Right. So effects for infection related ventilator associated complications.

202
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:52,459
Right now we're adding a couple of things. And so not only do we have a period of stability followed by a period of worsening oxygenation,

203
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:57,590
but we also have some signs of symptoms and infection that clinicians are treating.

204
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:04,400
Okay. And we'll get into the specific signs and symptoms of infection in a minute.

205
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,970
But this could be pneumonia related or non pneumonia related, right.

206
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:16,129
It just means that somebody the patient's having a period where they need increased

207
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,640
ventilator settings and now they're having a symptom of some type of infection.

208
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:25,609
Could be pneumonia, could be bronchitis, but it could be just some other infection that they're dealing with as well.

209
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:33,769
Right. They could be totally independent of each other. Like somebody could be developing a bloodstream infection or a urinary tract infection

210
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,250
at the same time that they're starting to struggle on the ventilator a little bit.

211
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,709
So the fact that this nonspecific signs and symptoms of infection is why we have this

212
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:49,490
kind of middle definition of infection related ventilator associated complication,

213
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:55,050
but not necessarily ventilator associated pneumonia. And again, we're going to get into the specifics here in a minute.

214
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:04,280
And then the third or kind of the highest tier of value is pivot, which is it used to be two different.

215
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:12,590
There used to be four levels. Now there's three and we rolled possible and probable ventilator associated pneumonia into and to one level.

216
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:18,350
So now it's just not possible or probable that and this is what's hopefully

217
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:24,020
capturing actual pneumonia because now we need actual like culture PCR results,

218
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:28,790
identifying some type of organism found in the patient's lungs.

219
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:33,229
That's what's causing that may be causing these signs and symptoms of infection that

220
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:38,570
might be causing this period of increased need for higher ventilator settings.

221
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:42,230
Okay. So that's the that's the goal. All right.

222
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:49,460
So when we're talking about that settings, there's kind of two different values or settings that we're looking at.

223
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,770
Okay. If I were to I'll talk about every 2/1 and then P.

224
00:23:53,990 --> 00:24:03,530
Okay. But they're both are important as most ventilator modes have these settings with the exception of one.

225
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,889
Right. So effort to fraction of inspired oxygen.

226
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:11,270
So this indicates the amount of oxygen that the ventilator is delivering to the patient.

227
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:17,330
Right. So rumors about 21% oxygen. So you're never going to see events, settings like 20%.

228
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,380
Right. Because there's no point. That's what you're getting when you're just breathing room air.

229
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:30,290
So really the minimum settings that we really deliver oxygen on the ventilator is 30%.

230
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,850
Okay. That would be kind of the lowest. And then it goes all the way up to 100%.

231
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,950
Right. You can't really go over 100% oxygen.

232
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:47,270
So when we're looking at ventilator settings, the amount of oxygen that the ventilator is delivering to the patient is relevant.

233
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,690
Okay. And then we have these peep settings. Okay.

234
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,290
Which is positive and exploratory pressure. So this is a little bit different.

235
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:59,840
So most ventilator settings will include a p value as well.

236
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:05,150
Okay. And this can just be one way to kind of boost the oxygenation in somebody, his lungs.

237
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:13,159
Okay. So this is kind of like the ventilator is doing to your lungs, kind of like like it says here, like blowing up a balloon,

238
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,389
but then, like, deflating it and not letting it completely deflate before blowing it up again.

239
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:26,240
So the higher the p value, it's kind of like the the more pressure that's delivered to the lungs to help kind of facilitate the oxygen delivery.

240
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:31,300
So the higher the settings kind of the the more the patient struggling.

241
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:35,630
Right. Like the lower the settings, the less dependent the patient is on the ventilator.

242
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:41,690
So that's what we start looking for. We're looking at ventilator settings from day to day.

243
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:46,040
Okay. And they can fluctuate. All right. So they can fluctuate throughout the day.

244
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,890
Patients needs may be especially early on, somebody gets put on the ventilator.

245
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,490
You're not going to know exactly what the patient needs the first hour.

246
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,050
Right. So these settings might fluctuate. They might go up and down over the course of the day.

247
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,800
So we're really only looking for a very specific value of each day.

248
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:12,710
Okay. Which, again, we'll get to when we go through the full definition as far as signs and symptoms of infection go.

249
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:18,820
These are these are the things that we're really. Looking for us so we don't have fever on here.

250
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:25,240
But fever is one anybody with a high or low core body temperature,

251
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:32,740
basically over 38 degrees Celsius or under 36 degrees Celsius, would be concerning for infection in a patient.

252
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:37,000
And then white blood cell count is another one that we look at closely.

253
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:42,190
Right. The normal range is 4 to 12000 cells per cubic millimeter.

254
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:55,240
So anything that we see above 12,000 or 12.1, as it's usually reported in the patient's chart or below four or 4000,

255
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:08,920
would be concerning for infection in a patient. And then we've got respiratory culture and respiratory secretions, respiratory culture.

256
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,890
We always we look at first quantitatively, right?

257
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:18,100
So if we have quantitative results for a respiratory culture in an organism, right?

258
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:27,580
Somebody has a respiratory culture that's growing 1000, 10,000 or 100,000 colony forming units of Klebsiella pneumoniae.

259
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,470
Our E coli are entero, bacteria, species.

260
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,000
The the quantitative result is significant, right?

261
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:42,910
Depending on the depending on the respiratory specimen.

262
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,740
And we've got a slide in a minute for that. But that's but that's going to be very, very important.

263
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,819
And then when we're talking about semi quantitative results,

264
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:58,420
sometimes things don't get reported in specific colony forming units depending on the order.

265
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:06,280
The culture might their respiratory culture might be collected and it may just be reported as this organism was identified.

266
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:14,530
There is a few present, moderate, many present. Right. And in that case, that's less specific information, a little bit more subjective.

267
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:19,360
So then we need some additional information on that culture as far as like how

268
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,800
many neutrophils and how many epithelial cells were found in that specimen.

269
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,870
And if and if we have the right number,

270
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:32,620
then that shows it's like a good quality specimen and that we can rely on those results

271
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:37,540
versus there might be like some or four that may have contaminated the specimen.

272
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,710
So there would be a window period.

273
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:47,830
All right. So it's a it's a little shorter than the cloud C window.

274
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:54,150
Okay. And the audio window, as you'll see in a little bit. So, Clancy, you had a blood culture and then you counted back.

275
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,120
Do you remember how many days you counted backward and forward from that culture?

276
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:01,780
Three. Right, you got it. So for var it's two.

277
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:08,169
Okay, so there's a five day window, the data setting start changing and then two days before and then two days after.

278
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:09,760
So it's a little bit shorter window.

279
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:18,490
And the one caveat to that is that could be even shorter if that day that the setting started changing is on day three.

280
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:26,200
Okay. In that case, we wouldn't count before because those first two days would be the first two days of intubation.

281
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,200
Right. So nothing can happen in those two days.

282
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,069
We don't look at anything from a surveillance perspective,

283
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:38,290
from the first two days that the patient's been on a device and then qualifying antimicrobial days,

284
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:41,770
that's one more good term we're going to be looking at here shortly.

285
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:49,930
And this is just representative of a day, calendar day that a patient had and probably also administered to them.

286
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:55,330
That could be unrealistic. Could be anything. Those antivirals.

287
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:03,010
Right. But there's a whole list in the case definition chapter for VA from the patient safety manual,

288
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,180
which you should have access to that list all of the qualifying.

289
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:15,400
Amy Kolby All right. And if the patient was given was started and was given and started on one of those antimicrobials within this five day window,

290
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:21,490
it counts as a qualifying day. Okay. And that's that's significant for our case definition.

291
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:25,780
All right. So we talked about respiratory specimens. I hinted at this earlier.

292
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:38,440
Right. But there is growth requirement, depending on the type of specimen that's collected when we're talking about respiratory cultures.

293
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:43,870
Okay. Endotracheal experts and sputum.

294
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,950
Right. Word are less invasive.

295
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:51,090
Right. And they require a higher or higher calling count. Right.

296
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,180
So anything identify any organisms identified in aspirate or sputum,

297
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:03,970
we have to have a colony count of greater 100,000 colony forming units of that organism to meet the case definition.

298
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:08,140
So bronchial bronchoalveolar, lavage or bao?

299
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:15,820
That's a specimen from deeper in the patient's lungs. So due to the invasive.

300
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:24,390
Ness of that of that type of specimen, we only need ten to the fourth or 10,000 colony forming units or greater right.

301
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:31,260
So have 100,000. Great. But 10,000 meets the case definition as well.

302
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,919
Same with lung tissue and protected specimen brushes the least.

303
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:40,590
But I don't think we really do that here at U of M I've seen that at a few other places,

304
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:45,930
but for the most part, when we pull respiratory specimens, it's somebody on the ventilator.

305
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:50,070
It's usually endotracheal aspirate or bal.

306
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:54,809
So do you understand why they might have those different definitions than what I want?

307
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:57,900
And I guess what? What, why?

308
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:01,230
Why would you need a higher number if you had sputum?

309
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:12,530
A certain amount, but, you know, stirring them out might be normal, right?

310
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,879
Yeah. So and also what happens when you take a human specimen?

311
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,290
Has anybody seen anybody in the specimen? Well, tell us about it.

312
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:31,520
I mean, it's kind of gross when you go through that coming through the mouth that you get contaminated, like the mouth.

313
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,070
It's coming through the mouth. Right.

314
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:39,710
So sputum comes up through your mouth if you do it and retrieval aspirate, you gotta put something in and take it out.

315
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,990
Okay. What's in your mouth? Lots of stuff.

316
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:49,850
Not just bacteria. Actually, I look at that, so I can tell you all about that.

317
00:32:49,850 --> 00:33:00,709
But, um, and then the laboratory, they actually put something in and suck it out so there's less contamination that,

318
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:05,480
you know, any time you go, if you have to go down, you have to go down through the the mouth.

319
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:18,890
So there's always this risk of contamination. And as best as we know, lungs in a healthy person are almost I mean, they're effectively sterile.

320
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:27,800
There is that one microbiome, which is that there are, as you can imagine, because you breathe and stuff all the time.

321
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:33,980
There are bacteria and things that live there, but they're extremely low levels.

322
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,480
So there's been a lot of controversy over whether they really work along.

323
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:46,850
And I mean, medically, it's just it's essentially sterile at first, you know, for years, microbiology people.

324
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:51,980
Yeah, but I just wanted you to think through why that might be the case.

325
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:59,400
Sure. Thanks. All right.

326
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:05,340
So just kind of one quick recap, right?

327
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:08,940
Patients been on a ventilator for greater than two days.

328
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:18,209
Right. There's a period of stability, consistent ventilator settings followed by a sustained period of worsening oxygenation that

329
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:24,020
meets our criteria for a ventilator associated condition are back right when we get there.

330
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:27,040
If we meet our criteria for VAC, we move on.

331
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:39,630
If we see objective evidence of infection, that means plus antimicrobial administration that meets our criteria for evac.

332
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:48,960
Right. And then when we start looking into the laboratory culture results, would we add that on to our evac criteria?

333
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:52,440
And that's where we get our possible ventilator associated pneumonia. Right.

334
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:59,040
So we've already talked about patient being on for a greater than two days.

335
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:06,870
Right. The ventilator is going to be going we have to be getting data on the ventilator for at least three days.

336
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:14,610
Right. And then when we're talking about baseline period of stability or improvement, followed by a sustained period of worsening oxygenation.

337
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:22,620
Again, I said, you know, these values might kind of ebb and flow like they might be adjusted right over the course of the day.

338
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:27,810
So we're talking about the daily minimum effort value and the daily minimum P value.

339
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:33,240
Okay. So any so the lowest value for that day.

340
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:37,950
Right. And if we pull up the patient's chart and look at all of the data flowing in from the ventilator,

341
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:47,680
you can see all the way down to 15 minute increments of the data that's flowing from the ventilator into the chart, what the settings are.

342
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,790
Right. So we look for the minimum settings that were held for at least one hour, right?

343
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:54,750
If something was adjusted and then 15 minutes later it was adjusted back, that doesn't count.

344
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,740
Right. It has to be at least one hour. And we look for the lowest setting for that day.

345
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:03,899
Okay. And again, that's so we have some consistent data to start looking at.

346
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,200
Right. We don't look for the lowest one day or the highest another day like this. Is that make sense?

347
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,550
Right. So we always look for the minimum setting that was held for at least an hour over the course of the day.

348
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:18,179
And if for two days those values are the same, those minimum values are the same,

349
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,440
or they're getting better, that's considered a period of stability or improvement.

350
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,020
Okay. If you see if I.

351
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:34,050
Oh two of 30. Right. Minimum yesterday and then today the daily demands 50.

352
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:38,840
That's not a period of stability. Right. That means we're still trying to figure out what's working for the patient.

353
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:43,630
And there's a lot of different things that might be going on that we're still trying to figure out.

354
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:52,469
Again, what's best for the patient. So we're looking for that stable or or improving or decreasing values right over the course of at least two days.

355
00:36:52,470 --> 00:37:03,750
If we have two days like that and then followed by at least two days or more where the settings start going up, then that's about right.

356
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,960
So 40 has to go up by at least 20%.

357
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:16,319
The minimum effort has to go up by at least 20% for at least two days, or the daily minimum has to go up by a value of three for at least two days.

358
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,770
If it's just one day up and then back down, it doesn't count.

359
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:27,090
Right? But if we're talking about if I go to daily, I'm 30, 30, 60.

360
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:35,220
6030. Right. That means criteria for back right has gone up by at least 20%, 30% in that example.

361
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,910
Right. And it's gone up and stay there for at least two days. Minimum values.

362
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:44,000
Okay. So if that happens, we meet criteria for fact.

363
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,010
That's a fact at least. Okay.

364
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:53,490
If that doesn't happen, we move on. So based on what we were saying so far, everything starts as avec.

365
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:58,110
Okay. All of our vacc, all p labs are both ibex and bax as well.

366
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:01,830
Okay. Um, again, this is a progressive thing.

367
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:10,080
Right. So if we meet the criteria for VAC, then we move on and say, well, can we meet the criteria for IVAW or not?

368
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,620
All right. So the criteria for that is, again, signs and symptoms of infection.

369
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:26,040
So when we're looking through this, we're looking for body temperature as well as white count over the course of each of those days as well.

370
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:36,270
Okay. So if we see a maximum temperature or a minimum temperature of greater than 38 degrees Celsius or less than 36 degrees Celsius,

371
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:45,510
or if we see white count greater than 12,000 or less than 4000 on a given day, that would meet our case definition.

372
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,500
Okay. So either of these have to be present in this V window.

373
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:57,700
Plus, we have to have a new antimicrobial agent that was started in that five day window and then continued for at least four days.

374
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:08,890
We meet all of that criteria. So if we meet one of these and this antimicrobial piece, then we meet criteria for event.

375
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,750
Right. But again, we also have to have the ventilator piece as well.

376
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:16,379
So you don't ever want to just start looking for this information.

377
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,860
Right. And kind of forget about the ventilator part. We always start with the ventilator part.

378
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:25,139
All right. So then if we meet that, then we go on. Right.

379
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,230
So if we say, yes, this patient meets criteria for evac,

380
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:40,410
we move on and start looking for laboratory results as far as culture results or viral PCR testing results.

381
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:50,370
Okay. Um, so this patient has to have pure respiratory secretions and their indicated on their culture

382
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:57,540
or positive respiratory culture identifying the organism at the right growth criteria.

383
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:06,090
Right. Um, or some positive pathology from, from the lab or respiratory viral testing.

384
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:15,389
So if the patient, the patient doesn't have, have a positive respiratory bacterial culture, if somebody is on the ventilator for two weeks,

385
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:19,620
all of a sudden they start having fever, increase ventilator settings,

386
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:25,980
they get put on antivirals because they had a respiratory panel collected and they have influenza.

387
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:34,140
Right. Like that counts. Okay. So it doesn't have to be just bacteria can be a viral pathogen as well.

388
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:37,530
Yeah. So I know that she has a little asterisks there. Mm hmm.

389
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,910
So. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

390
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:46,590
So what I was wondering is normal.

391
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:53,010
Normal flora or microbiology, as we know, since they're not plants.

392
00:40:53,820 --> 00:41:00,330
Mm hmm. Um. Can also cause pneumonia under these conditions.

393
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:04,170
So when do they make that cut? Right.

394
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:08,700
So this has to go with how the respiratory culture is reported out.

395
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:20,100
So if the culture is set up and the results reported in to identify a specific organism, say, Klebsiella pneumoniae.

396
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:27,150
Right. Um. Or a streptococcus pneumoniae or something like that at the right growth criteria that that counts.

397
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:38,760
But if the respiratory culture just results without an organism I.D. and then just says respiratory normal respiratory flora identified,

398
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,540
that does not meet the the case definition.

399
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:49,430
So we're not talking about like the organisms within that would constitute like what we normally found in your recipe for.

400
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,250
But if that's the way the cultures report that results are reported, that gets discarded from a certain perspective,

401
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:00,360
they might find mixed cultures that are consistent with what you find in your your mouth.

402
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:07,200
Exactly. But if it was like a single organism that grew at higher rates, then you might make a different judgment.

403
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:15,720
Absolutely. Yeah. So, yeah, cause like, if it was comparing staph aureus in the mouth, for example.

404
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:21,749
Mm hmm. So it could be low, normal, mixed amounts with a bunch of other things.

405
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:26,340
But if it was a single. Commensal.

406
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:29,950
That's also possible causes pathogens.

407
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:34,600
Sure. Pathogenic pretender, we call them. Note that they keep changing the terminology.

408
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:43,420
Sure, they call it a path of iron because they show life so it can be pathogenic or it can be normal.

409
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:52,630
Yeah, I was just want to clarify because you know, some candidates can also be a problem to you to get something in the space.

410
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:57,190
Sure. It's just a matter of, you know, so that there's got to be some judgment in there.

411
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,220
Yeah, absolutely. So, yeah.

412
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:07,000
So this all has to be as far as this normal flora goes, that's just how the cultures report it and they just exclude this from the case definition.

413
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:15,020
But to your point, I mean, if they if they do identify specifically like Enterococcus for Karlis and somebody else,

414
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,640
Val is still excluded from the surveillance definition.

415
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:23,200
So it doesn't matter if they find 10,000 colony forming units or not that

416
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:29,110
coagulation negative staff step out of step epidermidis like normal skin flora.

417
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:34,370
Those are excluded from our surveillance and then any type of species is as well.

418
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:45,010
So again, this is this is not the way the case definition is structured is to catch most everything by event,

419
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,910
but unfortunately like to keep the specificity up.

420
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:52,240
Like you're going to miss some of that. So oh yeah, go ahead.

421
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:59,200
Like the timing of things. Mm. To be positive like that.

422
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:04,690
Like a legionella cultures could not take like weeks to like find out it's a problem.

423
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:14,349
Good question. Yeah, so it all has. So the result, the time that it results is is not significant.

424
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:21,040
The time that is collected is significant. Right. So this is a good question, though, because, yeah, you don't send something to the lab.

425
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,899
You're not going to get the results that day. Right.

426
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:28,270
It's going to take for most bacterial cultures, it's going to take a couple of days to get the results.

427
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:33,120
And, you know, for some some fungal cultures, it takes a lot longer than that.

428
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:39,130
Right. Some slow growing as a fast facility time like can take like a long time to grow.

429
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:43,810
So you might not. Yeah. A lot of this is retrospective surveillance as well.

430
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:50,979
Right. So you're not doing this like in real time, this surveillance in real time.

431
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:56,710
You're looking, um, you know, you might be doing this surveillance on a patient.

432
00:44:56,950 --> 00:45:00,220
You know, that was for a period of time that might have been like two weeks ago.

433
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:10,240
Right. And we have some automated, um, like tools at work that will auto data mining and abstract some of this information.

434
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:15,700
So we get it faster, um, so we can do it as close to real time as possible.

435
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:23,709
But yeah, you're absolutely right. If you are doing surveillance and you see a culture has been collected and it's the results aren't finalized,

436
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:29,260
you can't just make a determination on that case until you have all the information as complete.

437
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:37,780
Right. So if there's still fungal culture sitting there, just cooking, not growing anything, not finalized yet,

438
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:44,860
you can't actually say like this is a case or business in my case or anything until you have all of that information as complete.

439
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:51,190
So but yeah, to your point, the collection time is the this the piece that matters the most.

440
00:45:52,510 --> 00:46:03,459
One point less practical tips. Mm hmm. A lot of these things we can detect using PCR polymerase chain reaction in a lot of hospitals is why do that?

441
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:12,880
Because you get the turnaround so much faster. So but then you get a different kind of you know, it's not like a colony forming unit.

442
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:18,250
Sure. So I don't know that they are approaching that now or how stretched were.

443
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:32,549
Yeah, that's a good question. You know, for example, Legionella, if you suspect Legionella, I mean, you know, you go up, you have a test.

444
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:37,680
So but I mean, but a lot of it it comes down to the normal Florida thing.

445
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:44,110
I mean, you can detect presence, absence really quickly. The PCR. Yeah, you can get you can get somewhat of that.

446
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:50,160
You know, you can you keep PCR and it's a somewhat of a tool for me to that calculation.

447
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:58,200
And I'm just wondering, you know, a lot of things you can check the PCR, you can't really grow very well.

448
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:05,549
True. So it's I mean, it's one thing if it's TB, but in this case,

449
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:13,140
you can end up with a definition that's way too sensitive to the PCR because you just take things that really didn't have clinical.

450
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:18,720
Yup. You are right. Yes.

451
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:21,620
So for religion specifically, what's really off the top of my head?

452
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:29,990
I think the only thing that I know of that we do pieces are like, you know, that we can do a piece for a solo culture.

453
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:39,639
Yeah. Legionella PCR. It doesn't matter what the felony count is.

454
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:44,980
If you identify legionella by via PCR results in patients lines, that that's one of the criteria that's met.

455
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:54,400
As for the surveillance piece, that's the same for the whirlpool with the Bush factory virus.

456
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:57,850
Absolutely. No one wants a culture virus anymore. Right.

457
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:03,790
Olivia? Yeah. Yeah. All of our viral results are PCR positive.

458
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:07,450
And if you have PCR positive results, then it just counts.

459
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:12,820
So, yeah, it's just it's going to be an interesting change as we move more towards.

460
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:17,160
Mm hmm. Um. Or use molecular techniques in terms of interpretation.

461
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:25,300
Yep. Absolutely. So again, just to recap.

462
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:31,060
So this is a little bit of like a nesting table, right? So just a different version.

463
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:35,710
Right. So we talked about our our ventilator, like our oh two criteria here.

464
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:42,730
Right. Everything starts out as a vac. If we meet the vaccine, if we meet the back case criteria, we move on to the eventual criteria.

465
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:47,240
If we meet all of that, we move on to the pivot criteria.

466
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:51,819
Right. But you're never gonna say, oh, this patient's been on the ventilator for two weeks,

467
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:57,780
and now they have like 100,000 staph aureus growing in their female or whatever.

468
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:02,050
Right. Um, it's a pivot. Well, back up.

469
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:10,420
Right. All these other pieces have to be met first. So I think it's just a good point to make right when you start doing surveillance.

470
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:16,920
In the very beginning, it can get I don't know if exciting is the right word, but it's like,

471
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:20,500
oh, I think this is this, I think this is this and need to start skipping steps, right?

472
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:27,270
And then you find out, oh, shoot, these people like the patient wasn't even on the ventilator for long enough for something like that.

473
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,510
Right. Like, I don't know how many times.

474
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:34,300
When I first started out in infection prevention that I was looking at like we'd get the positive blood culture reports,

475
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:38,770
like, oh man, we can't call this secondary to anything. So this is the clamps and I look ship.

476
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:42,549
The patient doesn't even have a central line like it's not a it's not a club.

477
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:45,940
Z Right. So it's just a good like kind of word of caution.

478
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:50,559
Like just be slow, be diligent about the process, but start at the beginning.

479
00:49:50,560 --> 00:50:00,850
Don't skip any steps or you will make a mistake. I think all of us have probably made several, you know, like over the course of our like development.

480
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:05,530
It's infection prevention, right? So couple of exclusions.

481
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:18,100
Right. So anybody receiving extracorporeal or corporeal life support and including atmo and VAD or ventricular assist device,

482
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,530
we just exclude them from from the surveillance.

483
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:33,840
Okay. So the ventricular assist device that helps your heart keep working and pumping blood.

484
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:43,360
Right. It's just an external assist for somebody that's that their, their heart is not doing it on their own right.

485
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:56,110
And then almo right. We have atmo program at U of m, um, this is, this is just a different type of life support,

486
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,360
very similar to perfusion technology in the operating room.

487
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:06,879
So if you have open heart surgery, right, they have to stop your heart so they can do surgery on your heart.

488
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:12,730
And what they do is they'll reroute all of your blood to this other machine outside of your body.

489
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:15,740
Right. Which basically access kind of heart and lungs.

490
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:21,850
Right. It circulates your blood throughout your body because you have to continually have a continuous blood supply.

491
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:26,649
All of your other organs and tissues need to have oxygenated blood. So it will reaction it.

492
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:31,270
Your blood re deliver it to your body, bypassing your heart.

493
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:39,550
Right. And then once your open heart surgery is over, they take you off of bypass, and then your heart's supposed to start doing the work on it.

494
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:44,680
So. And again, sometimes your body's not quite ready for that,

495
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:50,320
but they can't just leave you in the O.R., like, and just let the perfusion machine keep running.

496
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:56,530
So atmo is essentially that it does the same work, but it does it at the bedside.

497
00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:03,460
So you can go to the surgical ICU or the cardiovascular ICU, and you can have this life support at the bedside.

498
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,299
It's not offered everywhere. There's a lot of places that don't offer it.

499
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:11,590
So, um, you know, it's very good that we have that here.

500
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:17,950
And it was actually the whole program was created years ago and then deployed to other hospitals across the world now.

501
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,639
But mostly it's done for cardiovascular cases.

502
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:33,190
That said, it can also be done for a respiratory failure sometimes because you have such a poor, like respiratory response to.

503
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:38,120
When you are something that you need extra help, right.

504
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:41,300
So that they can put a patient on at the bedside.

505
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:49,890
We used to just outside of cardiovascular conditions, we used to mainly just do it for patients with really severe influenza infection.

506
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:53,450
But over the last couple of years, beginning of the pandemic,

507
00:52:53,450 --> 00:53:02,950
they found that actually there were some patients that would benefit from more support for severe COVID related pneumonia or respiratory failure.

508
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:09,380
So that became a big piece of our our kind of pandemic response program for for a long time.

509
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:14,570
Now it's not being used as much. The cases are much less severe than they were three years ago.

510
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:21,559
But at the same time, that was a big thing. But anybody on that support gets excluded from surveillance.

511
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:27,470
And one of the big reasons is once the support is withdrawn, right, when somebody can start,

512
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:32,930
doesn't need the support anymore, and this machine is doing all the work for your body.

513
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:34,670
So then when your body has to start doing that work,

514
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:41,750
the very natural thing is that your your ventilator demand and settings are just going to start going up.

515
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:45,380
So there's a pretty good reason for for why that would happen.

516
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:49,690
And you're going to get it like a ventilator associated event every time somebody comes off of the back.

517
00:53:49,700 --> 00:54:00,770
And so for the period of time that someone is on Eckman or receiving or has a van, they just they don't we just don't do surveillance on them.

518
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:09,440
That makes sense. All right, cool. So example, we've got this.

519
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:16,220
This one you can kind of see like a lot of the answers are kind of already outlined for you, but that's okay.

520
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:20,540
So, um, Mr. Vader here started.

521
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:24,740
He his first ventilator day was the first row here, right?

522
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:32,150
His final two and p values were 3502 534 502 35 right.

523
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:43,010
Daily minimums for these days. And then as you can see, um, you know, his priority went up from 30 to 35, right, for a few days.

524
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:47,030
Um, kind of stayed that way. So nothing really concerning from here.

525
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:51,739
But if we look here, we can see his PIP values daily minimum p values were Phi Phi Phi Phi for all these days.

526
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:55,220
Right. And then all of a sudden it jumped up to eight, right?

527
00:54:55,490 --> 00:55:00,410
So now our daily minimum P values are eight starting out 422 and going on, right?

528
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:07,310
So increase of at least three the right form for more than two days.

529
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:10,430
Right? It could be two. It could be five. It doesn't matter.

530
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:15,409
That's the date that r r that's a date of our event.

531
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:18,440
Right. That's the day that things start going up.

532
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:26,390
So that right. So now we count two days before, two days after.

533
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:31,070
And this is our VA window here, right? This like gray section here.

534
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:38,330
So once we meet the vet criteria, if you're looking at your sheet, we move on to the signs of symptoms of infection.

535
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:41,950
Right. Which is this here. So of headings here.

536
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:50,300
My other examples are better, but temperature, temperature, maximum temperature, minimum here.

537
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:54,950
Okay. You can see here right below 36 degrees Celsius.

538
00:55:54,950 --> 00:56:04,340
So that's significant. Move on during this window the patient was patient started on an appropriate obvious during this time.

539
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:09,580
Yeah. On the 20th which is day one of the window. This patient started on something, right.

540
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:17,270
That was continued for looks like five days, but at least by this chart.

541
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,830
But it needs to be four or more, right. So that means as well.

542
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:28,250
And then we look to the lab criteria.

543
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:34,310
Right. So. Do you see any.

544
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:38,870
You see anything here that would meet our criteria?

545
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:45,310
Yes or no? Anyone?

546
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:52,630
No. You don't think so? Well, you're right.

547
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:56,980
Why? We have a culture that had that culture about anything specifically.

548
00:56:57,010 --> 00:57:00,819
Right. So oral.

549
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:05,920
More oral. Flora president does not meet our criteria for prep.

550
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:10,380
So we didn't meet our criteria, but we did meet our evac criteria.

551
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:19,000
Right. So this would be counted as an event. So just quickly touching on pediatric VA.

552
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:24,590
There's not three different and there's not three levels like there is for adults.

553
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:32,169
This is actually rolled out 2019 right before the pandemic started the following year.

554
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:39,220
But yeah, as you can see, there's no we used to have we used to do surveillance for pediatric vet.

555
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:45,310
Again, same kind of reason that we don't do adult VAP surveillance anymore.

556
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:55,209
We move to pediatric VA. We use some different ventilator settings instead of people like we do for adults.

557
00:57:55,210 --> 00:58:02,790
We use this map value, which is mean airway pressure, but we have a very similar kind of like progression.

558
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:07,480
So it's essentially the pediatric Vas or essentially adult VAX.

559
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:12,160
We just look at FIO two and airway pressure versus peep.

560
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:21,190
Again, this is highly complex, similar to our adult valve surveillance and it was abandoned in 2019.

561
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:31,630
Okay. So for pediatric VA patients on mechanical ventilation for greater than two is a period of stability, period of worsening oxygenation.

562
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:37,250
Right. Again, daily minimum PE or mapping effort to assess.

563
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:43,510
And then there's this a little bit different criteria here, right?

564
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:47,139
So for Biota, for adults, the change had to be at least 20%.

565
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:50,620
For pediatrics, it has to be at least 25%. Okay.

566
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:57,700
And then for me, mean airway pressure. The value has to increase by value of at least four versus three.

567
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:03,790
For patients, pediatric patients less than 30 years old.

568
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:09,640
Any math values between zero and eight are considered equivalent.

569
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:18,250
So if your mean airway pressure values for you would indicate on your surveillance essentially eight.

570
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:23,170
Okay. So anything is here to eight is eight. And then anything above eight is its own value.

571
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:29,200
And then for anybody over 30 days or anything, 0 to 10 would be considered equivalent.

572
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:34,690
Essentially ten for surveillance purposes. And then anything over time would be its own value.

573
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:39,190
But same kind of like progression.

574
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:46,600
We do the surveillance in the same way as far as assessing per FAC versus pediatric age.

575
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:55,750
So this should be available to you as well. But if you want to like practice a little bit, there are value calculators on the CDC's website,

576
00:59:56,950 --> 01:00:03,549
so you can just use these links and then kind of type in some of the diagnostic criteria and it all tally it all.

577
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:07,270
I crunched the numbers on its own since it's super objective and it will tell you like,

578
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,720
yeah, this is a V, this is a fact, this is and I this a that, right?

579
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,059
So before I started working here, I worked at a different hospital in any VA that we called.

580
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:22,209
We also had to run it through the CDC's VA calculator to kind of like double check our work.

581
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:28,150
So, you know, we don't necessarily have to do that anymore, but it's like one good double check,

582
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:33,340
especially if you're going through the surveillance definition. You're like, I think this is right, but I'm not sure.

583
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:41,499
Just plug everything in to the VA calculator and it will literally tell you what it is and it will explain if you're like, Wow,

584
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:49,629
I don't understand why this is in my back and not a vet or an IV or why this is an IV and not a p value based on what you answer.

585
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:52,780
It will explain basic, you know, like why the variance.

586
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:56,469
So they're good tools, they're good practice tools, they're good validation tools. Again,

587
01:00:56,470 --> 01:01:01,570
if you want to double check your work and then the patient care safety manual that and it's just a manual

588
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:08,100
for this were all the case definitions for every AGI that we perform surveillance on can be found.

589
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:12,430
It's dense, right? It's like 400 pages or something like that.

590
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:17,230
But there's a really nice like hyperlink table contents in the very beginning.

591
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:25,240
And I think also you might have a will available to you like specifically the VA, a truncated chapters as well.

592
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:33,040
So if you want to look through those, it's the long version of basically we went through today.

593
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:41,350
But yeah, those are good tools to kind of have in your back pocket going forward.

594
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:45,640
Okay. So. Surveillance and prevention efforts.

595
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:49,820
I just want to touch on a couple of things as far as like we do the surveillance and then what do we do with it, right?

596
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:56,270
So up until 2019, there was a very manual process for doing this, right?

597
01:01:56,270 --> 01:02:01,280
We didn't have the same automated tools that we'd have now through our electronic

598
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:06,979
medical record to auto abstract and to a lot of this a lot of this data,

599
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:14,959
what we would get is this spreadsheet. Basically every patient on a ventilator, what all of their ventilator settings were for the entire time.

600
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:20,750
They were on the ventilator. For every patient that was on a ventilator in the hospital, it would just be thousands of lines.

601
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:24,950
And we had somebody that had to go through it and start pulling that information out.

602
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:27,350
So as you I mean, that's super laborious.

603
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:38,690
And then the more manual work you have on something that detailed in that long, the higher the risk for for error or missing something.

604
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:46,940
Right. So when we had the the opportunity through our our EMR to have this automated abstraction tool,

605
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:53,930
it made our lives a lot easier and probably increased the accuracy by a pretty good amount.

606
01:02:55,880 --> 01:03:02,060
So now the way it works is our MRL crunched a lot of the numbers.

607
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:11,120
They'll kick out, you know, all the way up to the level of evac whether this patient, you know, met all these diagnostic criteria or not.

608
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:15,710
Right. They'll look at the minimum values of the ventilator settings over the course of each day.

609
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:21,530
If it meets that criteria, it will look for temperature, maximum, a minimum white account,

610
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:26,960
minimum and maximum, and then any culture error and then any antimicrobial administration.

611
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,470
And it will let us know if this patient meets for four Tier four backup evac. Right.

612
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:35,480
And then we just need to do a quick cursory look to validate that it's accurate.

613
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:40,700
And then if for any events we have to evaluate before for pivot.

614
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:48,410
So that tool is great, it can automate a lot of our process, but it can't do the pivot piece.

615
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:55,550
And part of it part of the reason why is because the way the culture results are reported in our in our EMR,

616
01:03:55,820 --> 01:04:05,420
there's it's not like discrete data that flows in so the charts really smart but it can't look and say,

617
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:07,999
oh it can just say, oh, this is a positive culture or it's not.

618
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,219
I can't say, Oh, this is positive culture from this type of specimen that had this idea that this growth rate or,

619
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:20,900
you know, it just it doesn't have the ability to do that. But thankfully, you know, it does like 90% of our work for us.

620
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:25,910
So that again makes, you know, like our our accuracy and reliability a lot higher.

621
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:30,470
And then it gives us opportunity to like look at them and then try to improve.

622
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:41,630
So there are some prevention measures. So we do have like a VA prevention bundle at, at U of M and all of these things.

623
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:52,940
Okay. Having the head of the bed raise to 30 degrees or greater right helps prevent hopefully a ventilator,

624
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:57,770
associated pneumonia and continuous and daily oral care.

625
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:06,410
We don't really do we don't really necessarily recommend with in most of our rescues use anymore they do do it so in the cardiovascular ICU.

626
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:17,000
Oh yeah chlorhexidine gluconate so it's it's an antimicrobial agent that versus just straight up like fluoride toothpaste.

627
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:24,830
But yeah, daily oral care has been shown to reduce incidence of ventilator,

628
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:32,930
associated ammonia, daily sats and beats or spontaneous awakening and breathing trials.

629
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:41,810
So that means on a daily basis, patients should be evaluated for trying, for minimizing sedation, waking them up,

630
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:49,370
and then trialing them at a reduced settings or off the ventilator, if appropriate, for their condition.

631
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:54,770
Because the whole point is you're trying to get somebody off the ventilator. You're not trying to make them more dependent on it.

632
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:56,270
You're trying to make them less dependent on it.

633
01:05:56,270 --> 01:06:00,290
So the faster you can get somebody off the ventilator, the lesser risk for ventilator associated ammonia.

634
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:04,520
Right. If someone is not on the vent, they can't get a ventilator associated pneumonia.

635
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,150
So I've got suctioning. So I kind of mentioned that earlier.

636
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:17,330
But again, this special tube here does have a channel like a dedicated channel and port right above where this balloon is,

637
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:27,800
which can suction, can be attached to it to suction out any type of secretions that may be or secretions that the patient may be producing.

638
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,670
Again, to reduce the incidence or risk of that getting like pass the balloon into the patient's lungs.

639
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:42,690
Good hand hygiene, obviously, anytime time we handle anything, the ventilator circuit, the YouTube, anything like that, you always have to practice.

640
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:43,940
Good. Hygiene and hand hygiene.

641
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:52,429
So we're not introducing some other type of like, you know, foreign microbe to that environment and then proper equipment cleaning.

642
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:52,819
Again,

643
01:06:52,820 --> 01:07:02,600
just good disinfection practices go a long way as far as not introducing kind of new things to an environment that's basically a property at risk.

644
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:12,330
Right. So. So those are some of the prevention tactics we have at U of M, and then we have our prevention work group.

645
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:20,640
So it's a multidisciplinary work group. So there's folks from our department that sit on this, this work group that meets every other month.

646
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:25,680
And there's people from respiratory care, respiratory now ECP, respiratory therapy.

647
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:29,810
But all the rest of tour therapists can make up that department clinical staff.

648
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:37,470
So from the different units, different issues that have patients that are on the ventilator, we have physicians, nurses,

649
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:46,889
nursing leaders from those departments that have a vested interest to do the work and then our quality department and then I don't have it on here,

650
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:52,800
but our Environmental Services Department as well, that does a lot of the cleaning and disinfection for the rooms, the equipment and things like that.

651
01:07:54,780 --> 01:08:02,100
We all get together, look at our data, look at our practices, see what we're doing well, see what we're maybe have room for improvement.

652
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:06,810
And it's a good way to kind of get a lot of different perspectives and different

653
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:12,840
eyes on things so that we can continue to do better through this work group.

654
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:20,310
We've made change. We've assessed a lot of information, peer reviewed information that's come through case data that we've had,

655
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:25,139
kind of put everything together and adjusted our our bundled measures. So all those prevention efforts,

656
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:33,270
you see a lot of those have come through our work group and then deployed in an effort to increase patient safety and reduce VA.

657
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:38,040
So it's a pretty it's a pretty good group.

658
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:38,999
But again,

659
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:44,340
you don't want and you never really want when you're talking about like big picture things like this and there's a lot of different working pieces.

660
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:48,299
You don't want just one area kind of like looking at things from one angle, right?

661
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:54,030
You want people looking at it from a lot of different angles because we have a lot of different, different perspectives on the same.

662
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:01,400
So that's what we do with the data that we collect.

663
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:08,800
Questions. All right.

664
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:13,250
So time to practice. So I gave you this sheet, right?

665
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:19,870
The longer part on the front is the adult side, and then the shorter part on the back is the peed side.

666
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:26,680
Okay. So we've got a few adult cases to look at practice with and then a few pediatric cases.

667
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:33,970
So let's start on the long side. All right. So I'll give you a minute to look at this.

668
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:40,570
But case one, we've got a patient New Year's Day on the ventilator.

669
01:09:40,570 --> 01:09:44,710
Right. And then we've got our settings here or 502 settings here.

670
01:09:45,190 --> 01:09:47,709
Um, over the course of this time frame,

671
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:56,950
we also have our minimum and maximum to body temperatures that were recorded and then our daily white blood cell count.

672
01:09:58,930 --> 01:10:09,069
So does anybody see an appropriate change in if I go to after a period of stability increase after period?

673
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:14,920
Similarly, anybody see? Mm hmm. So people are nodding already.

674
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:24,740
What do you think? What did the 919 and what have I or two or three you've picked, right?

675
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,920
Yeah. So five, five, five, five, five, five. Oh, yeah.

676
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:33,040
And then it goes up to eight. That's a value. That's three or more, right? Next day, minimum is ten.

677
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,240
What's not eight? Does that matter? No, it's higher.

678
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:40,420
Right. So increasing values are significant.

679
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:45,130
So you're right. So based on this information, what's our window?

680
01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:52,990
If this change happened on the ninth, our window would be from 1 to 1 to 7 to 11.

681
01:10:52,990 --> 01:10:57,070
Right. Two days before or two days after. You got it.

682
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:02,080
All right. So does this make this basic right here for vac?

683
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:05,660
Right. All right. So we're moving on to the evac pieces, right?

684
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:08,950
So what's the first part of the evac piece we look for?

685
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:14,350
We look for temperature and white count. Right? Do we see anything up there that might meet?

686
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:25,370
Hearing. Some noes might have heard a yes in there somewhere.

687
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:31,760
One or the other. We need to temperature for white count.

688
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:35,149
For white count. Right. Yeah. We've got a few up there.

689
01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:39,410
Right. So anything over 12 or 12,000.

690
01:11:39,410 --> 01:11:42,799
Right. We've got three different days here.

691
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,400
Right. Increasing values. 13, 21.8, 20.4.

692
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:50,870
Okay, so we've got that.

693
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:54,590
So do we have an evac based on what we have up here or not?

694
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:59,750
No, y yeah.

695
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:02,870
The patient is not on any, any antimicrobials. Right.

696
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:07,460
So we didn't quite get there. So it's a fact.

697
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:14,750
All right. Fair enough. Questions on that one. Yes.

698
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:22,380
It doesn't matter what's happening for the final two if you have that right.

699
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:28,610
It just has to be one or the other. Yeah. And it is in almost every case, it will be one or the other.

700
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:37,340
I don't know that I've ever seen both. Yeah. The part that we have have with the increasing ranges.

701
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:42,680
Yeah. Yeah. Which, like in a way messes with the stability.

702
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:47,479
Yes. So yeah. So it's a very good point.

703
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:53,610
And that's part of why it's up here. So you got it? Yeah. The way the way the surveillance definition works, you have to look at them independently.

704
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:57,360
So you can you just look at this and you just look at this.

705
01:12:57,550 --> 01:13:04,490
Right. So even though the filter you might be adjusting a little bit up and down, the p was steady.

706
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:07,430
Right. So we see that here.

707
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:15,520
But yeah, but if this was if the pip was five the whole time, if I were to start a jumping around, that would be more or less.

708
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:20,300
Right. So yeah, but it can get a little tricky. So you yeah.

709
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:24,530
You've got to look at you've got to look at them both, but you have to look at them one at a time.

710
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:31,910
Cool. Anything else on this one? Yeah. So why do they have to be on an antimicrobial?

711
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:36,480
Like, I know it's part of the definition, but is there a reason why for that?

712
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:43,999
Yeah. If you have a new antibiotic started, I mean, that's indicative of that, that you have an infection.

713
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,440
Right. But what if it was just not caught at that time, you know?

714
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:55,730
Yeah. I mean, that's I mean, it's not part of that kind of stuff and it's not part of the case definition.

715
01:13:55,970 --> 01:14:02,830
You can also have, like, transient fever, right? So your temperature can go up and down for like, you know, like other reasons too.

716
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:07,130
So if somebody has like a fever for one day, then it goes away.

717
01:14:07,730 --> 01:14:13,130
You know, it's not super high. They might not start somebody on antibiotics right away.

718
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:17,059
Hopefully not. And sometimes. Yes, but yeah.

719
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:21,440
So but that's that's just part of the like the overall picture.

720
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:28,159
If you have fever, you have high white count, one of the two plus this, you know,

721
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:33,560
the clinicians started new antibiotics on somebody like that's pretty indicative that there's some type of an infection going around, right?

722
01:14:34,730 --> 01:14:37,940
Yeah. I think this is this issue between surveillance physicians.

723
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:43,100
Yep. In terms of what's clinically relevant and what surveillance.

724
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:53,000
And sometimes, you know, the clinicians will treat based on what they understand of the whole patient picture.

725
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:59,360
But you wouldn't count it, you know, so like with the same size, for example, remember,

726
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:03,290
you know, the clinical versus the surveillance perspective will be different.

727
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:12,470
So it will come to that. You have to think about what we're doing surveillance for as opposed and it's not to treat the patients.

728
01:15:14,030 --> 01:15:18,080
It's a different purpose. Yeah, you're right. Cool to make sense.

729
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:22,630
Yeah. All right. Other questions on this one? Yeah.

730
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:27,500
For the anti-microbial, like what happens if they have the virus?

731
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:32,140
You know, you don't really use. It's a virus.

732
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:40,219
Very good. Yeah. You're going to the. Yeah, I think we'll answer that question in a few minutes but but yeah.

733
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:43,670
No it's, it's again I've remember.

734
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:48,829
Does that mean that right. I mean is infection related to ventilators, those to complications?

735
01:15:48,830 --> 01:15:54,380
So it means that there's ventilator settings that are changing and then some type of infection going on at the same time.

736
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:58,460
Um, but not necessarily matching.

737
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:06,660
All right. Next. Same deal.

738
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:16,770
So let's look at the paper and let's look at the final two. And then anybody sees something, say something.

739
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:22,740
What they do, we see a change in. Oh, the ninth again?

740
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:27,390
Yes. April 9th this time. Right. And if I to your pee pee pee.

741
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:31,530
Right. You've got good eyes. All right.

742
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:39,540
So based on that information, what they are make up our infection window, period.

743
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:44,580
721. You got it.

744
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:49,290
All right, so we've got two back at least, right? All right.

745
01:16:49,290 --> 01:16:58,800
Let's move on. So to the evac pieces, do you see any significant temperature or white count criteria up there?

746
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:04,020
You might see more than one. Yeah.

747
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:08,670
And you got a white count every day.

748
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:14,130
Right. Very good. And then we look at the end remarks.

749
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:18,580
Do the patient have a new antibiotic started in that five day window?

750
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:24,870
Yeah. Was it continue for at least four days? Yes, more than four days, actually.

751
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:30,540
But yeah. So did we meet our criteria for evac? So far, yeah.

752
01:17:30,930 --> 01:17:35,339
All right, so then what do we do? We move on to the. And that's something new right now.

753
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:42,210
We move on to the pivot criteria. So do we see any culture results up there in the window, period?

754
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:51,540
Yeah, we do. Staph aureus from viral specimen greater than 10,000 colony forming units.

755
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:56,250
We look at your cheat sheet there. Does that mean criteria for prep or not?

756
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:02,390
Yes. All right. I see some nods. Yes.

757
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:07,900
You got it now? Yeah.

758
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:14,630
Feedback. We're good. Now, this next question. Well, I've got another question here.

759
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:21,260
Um, but, uh, yeah, we've got a pivot now.

760
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:32,040
This question here. You probably I want to bring it up because that's a little nuance to the definition and you can find the answer in the chapter.

761
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:36,720
But if you've not read the chapter yet, it's going to be a little bit of a difficult answer.

762
01:18:37,890 --> 01:18:42,930
But if the antibiotic listed in the chart was vancomycin, would it matter?

763
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:55,500
Yes or no? And the reason I ask about vancomycin specifically is because there's the one nuance in the whole antibiotic chapter.

764
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:58,680
Okay. The rule for vancomycin matters.

765
01:18:58,770 --> 01:19:04,050
Okay. So you can receive vancomycin by I.V. or orally.

766
01:19:04,170 --> 01:19:13,080
Okay. And for for purposes of VAP surveillance only I.V. Vancomycin is significant, right?

767
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:21,820
Primary reason for oral vancomycin treatments for GI infections, so not respiratory infection.

768
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:25,770
So that's like the one carve out in the whole antibiotic chapter.

769
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:35,040
But it's significant to now. So if you see that in the patient's chart, you just have to double check and make sure the room is I.V. not working.

770
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:41,760
All right. Next. You know the drill now.

771
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:47,130
Right. 16. What happened on the 16th?

772
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:52,410
From 5 to 1. From 5 to 8. For how many days?

773
01:19:53,850 --> 01:19:58,679
One. Oh. So does that.

774
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:02,070
Does that meet our criteria or not? No. No.

775
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:06,330
Okay. Do you see anything else on there?

776
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:14,400
Sorry, it's 1770. What's significant about the 17th?

777
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:19,320
Oh, the effort to an opera from 40 to 50.

778
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:23,490
How much of a change is that? Ten. 10%.

779
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:27,780
Right? What does it need to be? 20%. Hmm.

780
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:32,040
So it went up, but not by enough.

781
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:36,570
Right. You see anything else?

782
01:20:40,430 --> 01:20:46,440
I mean, you know. So do you think it's the VA? No, it's not.

783
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:54,090
All right. So, yeah, there's no there's no appropriate like that.

784
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:58,440
Settings that meet the case criteria for a vac. Right. So we wouldn't care about the rest of the stuff.

785
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:05,730
This is not a view. Do not pay us to go. Right. So you're not collect $200, so we just end there.

786
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:17,430
Not a case. Little tricky. Next one, now that I put one up there that's not one know anybody.

787
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:36,030
We see anything that meets criteria up here peop or effort to pick where the 18th very good which means our window is window when 16 to 20.

788
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:41,069
Yes. All right. So we have at least have a vac now.

789
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:44,070
We're moving on. Hmm.

790
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:51,210
Do we see any anything up there from a temperature or white count perspective comes by both.

791
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:56,760
Yes, yes, very good. But yes, there is some temperature here.

792
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:00,480
Um, increase on the 19th and the 20th.

793
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:05,099
There's a white count here elevated on the 18th and 19th.

794
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:10,990
So count. Right. But we only need one. What about antimicrobials?

795
01:22:11,590 --> 01:22:15,150
Yes. Yeah, yeah. So. Oh, there's two different ones out there.

796
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:18,390
Huh? So what? I what one is significant.

797
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:24,420
The vancomycin, right? Why not a not why not? The level one started in that time.

798
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:28,829
You're right. It was started outside of the time frame. Right. And continued into the time frame.

799
01:22:28,830 --> 01:22:34,550
But it needs to be started now. You can see I like include the ones outside the window too.

800
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,889
Right. So that's the one thing we need to look at.

801
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:44,170
Right. And that antibiotic means we started in the window, but then we just counted as many days is as continuing before.

802
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:48,240
Right. So it could start on the last day here and we continue here.

803
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:55,650
That's for qualifying days. Okay. So I don't know that I said that specifically earlier, but but yeah, so there's,

804
01:22:56,040 --> 01:23:01,140
there's six qualifying days up there of antibiotic therapy, starting with the 18th.

805
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:05,880
All right. So does this mean greater for Iraq? Yeah.

806
01:23:06,990 --> 01:23:10,950
What about Pivot? No, no. Why would you.

807
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:16,680
Yeah. No, no. No micro data. Right.

808
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:22,280
You guys got it. I see.

809
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:26,640
It's pretty straightforward. All right. I think we have one more adult case.

810
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:33,510
Um, maybe two. So now we're getting good at this.

811
01:23:33,690 --> 01:23:38,880
All right. So we see something. Anything up here? The 14th.

812
01:23:40,170 --> 01:23:46,590
Oh, what happened on the 14th? To the forward to this time?

813
01:23:46,590 --> 01:23:50,070
I think all of our examples have been piled up to this point. So that's good.

814
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:55,780
Yes. So when's the window? Well, the 12th to the 16th.

815
01:23:57,090 --> 01:24:02,280
Do we have anything else up here? Minimum temperature, white count.

816
01:24:02,990 --> 01:24:09,730
No, no, no. We do have some antibiotics in there this week.

817
01:24:09,810 --> 01:24:13,560
New criteria for evac or. No, I don't see a lot of handshaking.

818
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:20,309
Means you were listening? Yeah. We don't have all of the criteria on some of the criteria for evac.

819
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:24,180
Right. So since we can't meet everything, this is a vacuum.

820
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:29,160
Very good. Okay.

821
01:24:29,430 --> 01:24:33,330
So this is an interesting one.

822
01:24:35,850 --> 01:24:43,700
Any takers on our event change between the 18th and PEPFAR, too?

823
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:51,090
You got it. So the window is 616 for 2017.

824
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:55,180
17? Why the 17?

825
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:02,190
Mm hmm. Why only four days this time?

826
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:08,950
What did you say? The 16th is, what, 16? Mark Colvin.

827
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:14,170
You can't count the first two days. You're right. Yep. So anybody that's on the 17th finance.

828
01:25:14,170 --> 01:25:18,970
Right. So that's that's one thing with this example that I wanted to highlight.

829
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:26,679
This was the first day that the patient got put on the ventilator. We exclude all of all of the criteria for the first two days.

830
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:34,399
Right. Except for the ventilator settings. So the patient had a period of stability followed by a period of increase.

831
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:42,190
There were two settings on the right, but for our window perspective, we can only start the window on day three, right?

832
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:47,709
So that's why this one is just a little bit shorter and that's why we put it up here, because it happens sometimes.

833
01:25:47,710 --> 01:26:05,020
Not a lot, but sometimes. Right. So moving on, any evac stuff up there, the 19th to the 19th where the temperature.

834
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:10,840
Yeah. And white count both. Right. Okay. So we meet that piece under the antibiotic piece.

835
01:26:13,730 --> 01:26:16,910
Anything there? Yes, I ve vancomycin.

836
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:29,060
So we've met the criteria. Right? And then do you have anything else up there that would meet our pivot criteria?

837
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:34,280
Okay. So we've medivac rates and our two.

838
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,940
Yeah. So bail up there collected during the window.

839
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:42,980
Is there a good organism on there? Yeah. Good growth.

840
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:47,840
Yeah. So does this count as a VAP then?

841
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:54,590
It does. And I'm pretty sure.

842
01:26:56,450 --> 01:27:05,389
Pretty sure we've gotten scalded on this specific example by some of our clinician partners because

843
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:14,870
this patient clearly didn't meet the criteria because the antibiotics and the organism don't match.

844
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:18,140
Is that fair to say? Yeah.

845
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:24,100
That's not how the algorithm works. Exactly.

846
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:30,470
So if you were to show all of this data to one of our clinician partners, they go,

847
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:34,970
no, no, they were receiving this antibiotic for something totally different.

848
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:45,500
No, this isn't a VAP. This is you know, this is this patient's got something else going on, some other infection going on, whatever, ABC or whatever.

849
01:27:45,830 --> 01:27:52,670
So, no, you can't use that for this. So sorry, there's limitations.

850
01:27:52,670 --> 01:27:54,730
There's pros and cons limitations to everything. Right?

851
01:27:54,770 --> 01:28:04,099
So remember earlier, earlier, an hour ago or whatever, when we were I was saying that our case definition isn't as specific as compare the same thing,

852
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:07,219
but there are going to be outliers like occasional outliers,

853
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:17,629
some that are excluded from the definition that may be true vamps and then others that are included from time to time that don't meet again.

854
01:28:17,630 --> 01:28:20,660
The bulk of everything is is true.

855
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:27,560
But every now and then, we do have these outliers on both ends of the spectrum that sometimes get way over capture in some cases,

856
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:34,190
and under capture and others. So regardless, there are limitations to the definition, and this is one of them.

857
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:35,870
So I just wanted to share.

858
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:44,840
So when you get into the when you do start doing your own IP work and you start getting in these discussions and you can be prepared.

859
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:50,690
All right. We get an adult via surveillance.

860
01:28:50,930 --> 01:28:57,350
I think we've had some good examples there. We've covered most of the kind of nuances to the using the objective definition.

861
01:28:57,350 --> 01:29:03,079
So we've got a couple we don't have as many, but we have just a couple PVA cases.

862
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:10,460
So flip your page over and again, this is like basically PTV is pediatric VAC only, right?

863
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:17,420
We use mean airway pressure and if I were to and be cognizant of the the couple of caveats there right.

864
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:21,560
If I were to change does have to be at least 25%, not 20 like adults.

865
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:25,850
And then that value change has to be at least four, not three.

866
01:29:26,210 --> 01:29:30,950
Right. It says right on your sheet there. So.

867
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:37,899
Oh, yeah. There was something about 30 days old, right? Less than or greater than 30 days old.

868
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:44,200
So let's just keep that in mind. All right. So, K seven patients under 30 days old.

869
01:29:44,860 --> 01:29:48,519
And this is their their event setting values, right.

870
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:56,890
So much simpler. We don't have all of the other diagnostic criteria on here, but do we see anything that would constitute like inappropriate change?

871
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:05,419
That would be the case definition, given that under 24 you got it map on the 24th.

872
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:10,510
I mean, airway pressure went up from 8 to 12. Right. Which is change value for right.

873
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:16,870
Which is what we need. So for at least two days.

874
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:21,850
So does that meet criteria for view? Yeah.

875
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:32,920
Yeah. So much easier. Right. Like this is this is very straightforward as to whether it's significant or not.

876
01:30:33,070 --> 01:30:37,059
Great question. But this is what we do for pain surveillance.

877
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:43,180
Now, would it matter if the patient was 40 days old?

878
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:50,920
It would. Why would you why would you say that? It would also turn out it's considered time.

879
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:57,760
So it goes kind of cool. Yeah, you're right. So for anybody over 30, for anybody that didn't care, right, for anybody over 30 days old,

880
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:01,179
any of any mab value zero ten are considered equivalent, right?

881
01:31:01,180 --> 01:31:07,030
So they're ten. So if that was the case, this increase of eight from 10 to 12, right.

882
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:15,970
So it would not be a pediatric value for somebody that was two weeks older.

883
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:25,629
All right. So in this case, this patient is 40 days old in the nephew and here are their event settings.

884
01:31:25,630 --> 01:31:31,920
So do you see anything that would constitute review?

885
01:31:33,490 --> 01:31:36,610
Yeah. The 24th.

886
01:31:38,020 --> 01:31:41,200
Yep. Change from 50 to 80.

887
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:44,230
Right. So that's greater than 25%, right?

888
01:31:45,970 --> 01:31:50,440
Very good. Yeah. PDA.

889
01:31:50,470 --> 01:31:54,470
There you have it. That's it.

890
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:59,470
So just a couple. I mean, there's a lot more nuance, right, to the adult sport.

891
01:31:59,570 --> 01:32:05,000
Hence the six case, six examples versus two. Not a lot of moving parts on the kids piece.

892
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:13,160
You know, we're doing pediatric V.A. surveillance due to our kids reporting standards.

893
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:24,409
But right now, I mean, it's very new. So I think right now it's it's collect and submit and then analyze and see for significance.

894
01:32:24,410 --> 01:32:28,250
But a little too early to tell on that one so far.

895
01:32:29,660 --> 01:32:35,720
So anyway, that's that's the long and short of VA surveillance.

896
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:43,759
What questions do we have our asking as we're going along?

897
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:46,760
So hopefully we got everything answered. Yeah.

898
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:52,190
Circling back to that, when you get that commission pushed back with you, other than just stating this.

899
01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:56,870
This is what it is. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think it's valuable.

900
01:32:56,870 --> 01:33:03,739
I mean, like, thankfully, we've we've had a lot of history with a lot of folks that we're engaged with.

901
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:07,520
Right. And we've we've been doing this for a long time.

902
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:13,920
So I feel like more or less that is generally known, however.

903
01:33:14,330 --> 01:33:25,580
Every now and then it does come up. And I think it's just important to underline the fact that like these are this is eight year surveillance.

904
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:28,670
Right. And surveillance definitions can vary.

905
01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:32,060
Right. And it shouldn't drive like the clinical decision making.

906
01:33:32,660 --> 01:33:34,640
And sometimes they're going to agree.

907
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:44,000
Occasionally they won't, you know, typically get pushback when something like that happens because they want it on our metrics.

908
01:33:44,030 --> 01:33:52,240
Right. But I think also, you know, just reinforcing the fact that there's hours.

909
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:59,750
Right. In everything. And for every one of these that gets picked up, that that maybe doesn't jive with the clinical perspective.

910
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:04,310
There's another one that got thrown out, right,

911
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:12,530
that somebody that had heavy respiratory growth on their respiratory culture and they've

912
01:34:12,530 --> 01:34:17,059
been on a ventilator for a month and they but they didn't meet all of the minutia.

913
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:21,980
Right. So and so, you know, it balances out.

914
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:28,430
And it's all about like the majority of the cases that we review, you know, are accurate.

915
01:34:28,430 --> 01:34:32,120
So I think it's good to have that conversation.

916
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:36,050
And in most cases, people are open to, you know, to hearing their peers.

917
01:34:36,230 --> 01:34:40,700
So and the more we talk about it, the more familiar people will get with it.

918
01:34:40,710 --> 01:34:48,860
Right. I think it you remember your really nice job of sharing a lot of this information with like stakeholders and clinicians, right?

919
01:34:48,860 --> 01:34:56,599
So like nurses, nursing leaders, clinicians that are leaders on units but also that are involved in the cases when they're identified.

920
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:01,400
So, um, so that's pretty routine for us here.

921
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:06,080
Um, we share that information when the case has with the teams involved, they can look at it,

922
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:10,340
they can offer feedback from their perspective on what they think happened or didn't happen.

923
01:35:10,970 --> 01:35:14,060
Um, we look at different processes, right?

924
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:19,310
So maintenance processes, they, we do all of those bottle measures in this case like, you know,

925
01:35:19,310 --> 01:35:25,910
were there opportunities for improvement or not regardless of the outcome of that case?

926
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:29,629
Um, and that's, I think something that's a little unique.

927
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:34,540
I think there's probably a lot of other bigger institutions that do the same thing, but there's a lot,

928
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:45,410
there's other places I've worked where the resources just aren't there due to the size of the place or the engagement is lower, right?

929
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:50,630
So we're reviewing these these cases and looking for those like opportunities.

930
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:55,310
And at least in some of the places that I've worked have been like less frequent.

931
01:35:55,670 --> 01:36:01,550
And in those cases that can get a little bit more difficult to have some of those conversations sometimes.

932
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:09,740
So I think, like we are fortunate, you know, like working here at a teaching institution that's used to looking at stuff,

933
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:13,100
learning, you know, offering feedback back and forth.

934
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:18,170
Um, and I'm not saying that doesn't happen elsewhere too, it does, but just to a different degree.

935
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:23,629
But what I can say is, like a lot of smaller places that don't have very many events and you know,

936
01:36:23,630 --> 01:36:31,220
like if you have one, it might really, really screw up your, you know, your hospital's performance metrics.

937
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:39,169
It can become like a very tenuous thing when you're not used to having those conversations on some regular basis.

938
01:36:39,170 --> 01:36:42,590
So those accounts every but.

939
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:46,250
Good question. What else?

940
01:36:50,570 --> 01:36:55,129
So thank you so much. Really? Yeah. Another major sticking out a few minutes.

941
01:36:55,130 --> 01:36:58,310
We're going to have to give people a bio break and then Jeff's going to come here.

942
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:10,540
Sounds good. Let's think. I know Jeff is.

01:37:10,810 --> 01:37:13,870

944
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:18,340
Should I pause or stop and say, you know, that you'll do it right?

945
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:20,730
I'm going to.
