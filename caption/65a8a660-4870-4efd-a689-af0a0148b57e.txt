1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:20,310
And now they're saying, well, you know, I can think about it because, you know, I'm scared because I feel like I pay my bills.

2
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,440
I don't really know. I was scared of the climate.

3
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,510
I was like, That's definitely scary.

4
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,920
You, like, freaked out and like, I can't. Yeah, I didn't.

5
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,630
I definitely really I don't know. I watched a few announcements for to get started.

6
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:56,580
So we're I'm I'm like one this little I'll have we'll have it posted sometime later this week and then homework too.

7
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,210
Just a reminder that to do this on Wednesday.

8
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:12,320
So again, feel free if you have any questions both specifically about answers about homework problems or about homework, just let me know.

9
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:19,750
Neat. And then exam two is a reminder that that's a week from next.

10
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:30,320
Next week. On Wednesday, both you and I can actually be at a conference in Seattle, so I have my post-docs going to be proctoring that exam.

11
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,230
So lots of questions about the transmission modeling lecture,

12
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:45,190
which I realized was a whirlwind tour of transmission modeling with a lot of information there.

13
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:52,220
It was recorded. So if you, you know, you could listen to it again to get some of the detail,

14
00:01:54,290 --> 00:02:04,670
I wanted to capture some of the questions and maybe an overview of what I think is I'd like everyone to get out of that lecture.

15
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:13,010
Again, I don't mean for you to understand all the equations that I presented,

16
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:18,680
but some of the insights into what goes into the reproductive number, for example.

17
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,260
So one was just sort of at one level.

18
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:35,720
So just to appreciate that our models and our models are kind of the base model that we work off of when we model transmission.

19
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,679
And we'll talk about this slowly later in this slide.

20
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,270
But there's a lot of extensions and I mentioned some of the extensions to the our model,

21
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:55,100
but this is kind of a base model that we use and it's used to capture both the endemic processes as well as epidemic processes.

22
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:01,700
And so here is just an example of an endemic process that I.

23
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,479
The question that I mentioned last time,

24
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:14,830
which is what is the optimal quarantine time to minimize disease burden given given that longer

25
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:22,000
quarantine times minimizes the chances that you that an infectious person actually transmits to somebody.

26
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:31,990
But at other hand, there's costs to increased quarantine time, and that is to noncompliance,

27
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:38,290
both for structural reasons that people can't necessarily comply to a larger,

28
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:45,400
longer quarantine time due to, for instance, for economic reasons, for example.

29
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:55,060
And just that it just it's harder in general to actually quarantine for 14 days versus ten days or just seven days.

30
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:01,929
So this is and it's also highlights the way in which these, I think, transmission models are the most powerful.

31
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:08,890
And that is sort of asking a tradeoff question and asking you to kind of quantify that tradeoff.

32
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:15,880
We know that there is a tradeoff between longer times with respect to the benefits and the costs,

33
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:22,400
and there's diminishing returns often when you actually increase that time longer and those costs start increasing.

34
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:29,170
So that is an example. And of course, we didn't use a simple SARS model as an extended SARS model.

35
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:38,500
But is it an example of a question that transmission modeling is really well-suited to answer?

36
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:44,920
And the second example here. At what point in the epidemic process do interventions become less effective?

37
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,020
And we've talked about this a bit, and we're going to talk about it more in the outbreak.

38
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,960
Just this lecture on outbreak investigations.

39
00:04:53,740 --> 00:05:02,170
But intervening earlier, you know, is when there's just sporadic cases occurring, not a lot of transmission.

40
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:09,940
So in an intervention is going to be much more effective once you start getting into that exponential phase of the outbreak.

41
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:19,100
Things that might have worked early on might not work at all or might be much, much less effective.

42
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,850
And so that's an important concept to understand.

43
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,770
And transmission models can actually help quantify that tradeoff.

44
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,870
And so that's so these are two examples of an endemic and an epidemic process where

45
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,640
and I say our model is useful and has been in addressing these kinds of questions.

46
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:52,370
And again, tradeoff questions are the most powerful asking what is the risk going to be on May 23rd, in my opinion, as a less useful question.

47
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,250
You know, and because it's just that it's wrong with uncertainty and you're not.

48
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:05,630
And there's so many things that can affect what that risk is going to be.

49
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:11,930
So an example was everybody wanted to know when the peak was going to occur.

50
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:25,580
And so transmission models had anywhere from a thousand cases to 100,000 cases because it was so uncertain about what that answer was going to be.

51
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:38,149
The transmission model wasn't really actually that useful. So just a prediction of a specific value is where the models in general I think

52
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,830
less useful tradeoff questions now that's getting insight into what's happening.

53
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,450
Much more useful.

54
00:06:48,380 --> 00:07:00,120
So there was a lot of questions about extensions to the ACA model, and I just wanted to capture three very broad categories of extensions.

55
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,560
One is capturing environmental dynamic processes.

56
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,470
The waterborne and vector borne become very good examples of that, and that's what I presented.

57
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:18,260
Let's start modeling explicitly what's happening in the environment, in the pathogens, in the water or vectors in mosquitoes.

58
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:24,450
So that's one big group and extension capturing social processes.

59
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,070
This is largely done in SGI.

60
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:34,730
For us, this is another prerogative and it could be used for a lot of different for almost any infectious disease process.

61
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:40,759
But STIs is where it's often used, and that's where we're modeling social structure.

62
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:48,260
We talked about core and non-core group. That's a very simple way to think about heterogeneity in the population.

63
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,960
That's maybe that can be very useful.

64
00:07:51,530 --> 00:08:00,769
But social networks broadly understanding how social networks affect transmission is a much more complicated question,

65
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,250
but one that we can extend the SRM model.

66
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,379
Start talking about transportation processes.

67
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,530
That is huge. Like how? How?

68
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:17,660
To what extent can people move from one place to another place and how easy it is to move and how cheap it is to move back and forth?

69
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,190
Migration processes another important social process.

70
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:28,160
So capturing social processes is another category, I think extension to an essay or model.

71
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:36,110
And then there is one specific question about modeling how do we model the different variants and with respect to COVID?

72
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,670
And that's true for most infectious diseases.

73
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,410
And there's a lot of work on modeling variants and crossing that cross immunity.

74
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:54,440
So the thing that's most important when we have all sorts of variants is, you know, you have a vaccine for one variant.

75
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,150
How much price immunity do you have for the other variant or you get exposed to one variant?

76
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:06,350
How protected are you? And there's now a new variant. You're not going to be completely protected, but you're going to be somewhat protected usually.

77
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:12,419
So that's another category of extending the answering model and modeling the immune process.

78
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,479
But I didn't give any examples of that specifically.

79
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:23,540
But those those give you hopefully a flavor of the ways in which we can start with a very simple SARS model and make it more complicated.

80
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:30,860
But the important point here is you only want to make it more complicated if you need to.

81
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:38,840
Your question should be driving the level of complication that your model takes on.

82
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:47,240
And of course, in my course next semester, we talk about that in a lot of detail about how that occurs.

83
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:53,920
Now the pattern is going to be modeled once we begin to understand underlying transmission processes.

84
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:58,040
So there's a question about what a novel pathogen, what if we don't know much about it?

85
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,879
Can we still model it? Yes we can.

86
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:07,480
Once we start understanding the transmission process and with COVID, we immediately understood that was respiratory.

87
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:16,210
We didn't understand how important droplet versus airborne was, but we did understand that there and how important fomite transmission was.

88
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:23,200
But we can start modeling that process, and as we get more and more information, that model becomes refined and more valuable.

89
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:35,460
And last there was a question about parameter of estimating parameter values to ways in which we can estimate parameter values.

90
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:42,890
One is the fact that because the parameter values already have biological interpretation and meaning,

91
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,080
we can use independent data, for instance, to estimate what latency period is.

92
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,060
And that gives us a parameter value that we can use in the model.

93
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:59,360
We can also estimate, like we do all statistical models by fitting in epidemic or endemic data.

94
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,880
And so we, we, we generally use a combination of those two.

95
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,690
Approach is to estimate the parameter values. Have a transmission model.

96
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,630
So this captures a lot of the questions that were asked.

97
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:32,490
I also wanted to bring up I did present a lot of some of this in the lecture on line transmission, which was, I think week two of the course.

98
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,020
And so this is these are all very useful we talked about.

99
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,229
If there's a train, you know,

100
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:50,960
for a basic I say our model two parameters in that model at transmission rate and recovery rate and that there's an air model that people often use.

101
00:11:52,760 --> 00:12:00,860
They flew the latency thing. They include the fact that the moment you're exposed, you're not actually infectious.

102
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:06,620
There's this exposed period in which it takes time before you become actually infectious.

103
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,969
So often people use an SBIR model that puts them at, say, our model.

104
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:17,150
So that's another extension that I talked about in that second week of class.

105
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:30,870
And the immunity part, temporary and partial immunity, which ties in to the fact that we also to look at cross immunity as another extension.

106
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:40,399
And then this is the other part that I want conceptually everyone to appreciate.

107
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:47,870
And again, these are slides from the second week of class, but what is the transmission rate parameter?

108
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:53,330
But that's a product of a social. Social factors are behavioral factors.

109
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,550
It's the contact rate among individuals and a biological factor.

110
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:04,100
The probability infections of the contact. That's what we generally think of is infectivity.

111
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:16,700
So transmission rate, the rate in which a susceptible becomes infectious or susceptible become infectious is

112
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,570
proportional to the spread and transmission rate parameter that has these two pieces to it.

113
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:33,460
And we talked about how contact rate in this kind of very proximal thinking has

114
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:42,580
means something different for each of these different transmission processes.

115
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:52,420
So sexual practice for an SD mosquito biting rate for vector borne water ingestion rates for waterborne disease.

116
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:56,080
Next week, when Jim Trussell comes in, talks about social processes.

117
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,110
He's going to make this a lot more complicated.

118
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:09,159
Not these these are very these are very proximate behavioral factors that determine whether or not you are going to be infected or not.

119
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:15,129
But there's also larger scale social processes, such as migration patterns, transportation networks,

120
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:21,820
poverty and such, that also come into play and that we'll talk about that more that next week.

121
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,250
But from the process from the perspective of transmission model this is.

122
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:31,940
What I want you to appreciate about what goes into this transmission parameter.

123
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:38,760
And lastly. Or not. Which is?

124
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:50,110
Contains these three factors, one of which is basically the transmission rate parameter.

125
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,490
Again, the product of the contact rate among individuals in the probability infection.

126
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:05,890
So that's the rate in which new cases occur. And if we add this duration of infection, the lifespan of the disease, how long somebody is infectious,

127
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,260
we get our reproductive number because that reproductive number is basically

128
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:17,080
the number of infections one person will cause during its infectious period.

129
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:25,840
So if we multiply the rate of generating cases by the time the length of time someone is infectious, we get our reproductive number.

130
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,990
So I don't really care about. How this relates to Pacific.

131
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,870
You know what the Pacific equation is for our not for this cause.

132
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,209
You know how we use our different parameters to get that.

133
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:44,670
But I wanted this concept to be understood about what a reproductive number is.

134
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:56,080
So that's a kind of overview. Hopefully. I had a lot of the questions that you had during first session evaluations.

135
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,970
Any lingering questions on this?

136
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,360
There. Okay.

137
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:14,470
It is a different way of thinking about risk than your standard, where you think about risk and epidemiology with respect to risk factors.

138
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:24,040
And so it is a conceptual leap in that sense, but it is high too, and it is a way,

139
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,180
another way of thinking about risk in that dynamic as opposed to a static.

140
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:36,970
So. That.

141
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:46,040
I'll move to today's lecture outbreak investigations so we're going to have a week of

142
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,810
this is going to be for this week we're going to look at outbreak investigations. I'm giving you the introduction.

143
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,129
And then Laura Bauman, who's the director of the Washtenaw Health Department,

144
00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:02,750
is going to come in and talk about outbreaks in the real world now, how we have outbreak investigations in practice.

145
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:07,940
And so it's similar to how we did surveillance, I think.

146
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:18,200
So. There's some basic definitions that we're going to go over in this lecture on this segment.

147
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:28,609
Suspected probable confirmed cases, an outbreak versus an epidemic as a pandemic outbreak types, infection risk infection risk ratio.

148
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:34,580
And then we'll talk. It's kind of a chunk of time on the steps of an outbreak investigation.

149
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:43,940
So an outbreak is defined as the number of cases of disease above what is normally expected in a localized area.

150
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,870
So the important thing to realize here is this definition is subjective.

151
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,080
It's not a quantitative estimate. It is.

152
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,129
What is about normal is a subjective decision.

153
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:07,800
And that's why it's always whether or not something gets defined as an epidemic or an outbreak may vary from outbreak outbreak.

154
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:16,320
This is an example of measles, where in 2014 there was a clear increase in cases of measles in the United States.

155
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:27,690
And considered an outbreak. Epidemic is generally used for something that's larger than an outbreak.

156
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,409
Again, very subjective with respect to whether or not you're going to call something an epidemic or an outbreak.

157
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:39,010
And it's probably in the literature and in the media used interchangeably to a large extent.

158
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:44,949
But it is again when we talk about endemics, it's in contrast to an endemic.

159
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:50,979
So you may have this normal fluctuation occurring year to year or over time,

160
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:57,190
and then all of a sudden there's a much bigger increase during a given season.

161
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:07,930
We call that an epidemic. A pandemic is something is an epidemic that is worldwide.

162
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:12,040
And again, as we all saw with respect to COVID,

163
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:19,030
there was a lot of tension with respect to whether or not when we were going to call this a pandemic, COVID 19.

164
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,310
Strictly speaking, for W.H.O., it's at least two of these W.H.O. regions.

165
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:31,540
As to have spread a disease for there to be a pandemic.

166
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:43,210
And here's the seven regions or eight regions here in which which W.H.O. define so technically speaking, the Ebola.

167
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,890
2014 D'ebola.

168
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:57,480
Epidemic was not a pandemic because it was all confined in West Africa, but it often is listed, as we can see in the next slide as a pandemic.

169
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:11,730
I just look this up 249 recorded pandemics in the history recorded in over history the plague has been

170
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:22,230
very few is probably the most represented in this in this in this array are 249 recorded pandemics.

171
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:33,650
And it really has influenced history and human history tremendously more than any other disease outbreak and many diseases have.

172
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:39,660
And it has has had huge impact on our history.

173
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:52,169
This is just a picture of a physician, what a physician would wear in the during the plague, in the Middle Ages to protect them again.

174
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:56,730
It was still viewed as some sort of contamination in the air.

175
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:07,529
My asthma type theory and this book was supposed to prevent that or delay the air in which it was coming in.

176
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:14,010
And there had been native aromatics in the region that was supposed to protect the physician from infection.

177
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,490
This was another.

178
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:28,760
Infographic that I thought was interesting with respect to showing the different relative sizes of these pandemics that have occurred over history.

179
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:43,129
And how many of these, like smallpox, really gives you a sense of how big of an issue smallpox was before it was eradicated?

180
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:49,850
And again, the plague and was it was caused huge, huge mortality.

181
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:57,940
We see COVID right here. Even when this graphic was made, it was 1.8 million deaths.

182
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,980
We are up to 6.5 million in the world.

183
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:09,360
It's creeping up. So it is clearly significant, endemic relative to the history of all pandemics that we've seen.

184
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:21,220
So why investigate an outbreak? So first goal is to interrupt transmission.

185
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:32,290
And this is challenging. Again, this is this idea of it's challenging to act quickly enough to actually have an impact.

186
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,140
And the challenges are both about measurement.

187
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:42,820
Outbreaks can go, you know, can be transmitting for a long time before we actually even know that it's happening.

188
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:50,980
And it's also the politics of whether or not somebody wants to act sooner than later,

189
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:57,489
given the costs of implementing mitigation with a certain amount of uncertainty.

190
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:06,910
And I will mention this later. But the idea the idea is you act early with uncertainty and have high impact if there is a

191
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:12,130
problem or you wait until there's certainty and you have much lower impact because you're here,

192
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,850
you're in this, again, exponential phase of the outbreak.

193
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,900
But there's a lot of other reasons why we want to investigate outbreaks.

194
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:28,270
We and these are much easier tasks to do. And these are really what CDC does.

195
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:34,480
I think the best identify the risk factors to prevent future outbreaks from occurring.

196
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,730
So learning characterized the public health problem.

197
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:46,780
Provide new research insights into the disease that's causing the outbreak again.

198
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:52,900
Either it's a novel or an ongoing disease and evaluate the existing prevention strategies.

199
00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:00,700
And so help us move forward. I think and I will look at this with respect to food,

200
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:07,600
but I think foodborne outbreaks is is probably the area where CDC and the health departments do the best.

201
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:11,740
We have a lot of food for an outbreak and there's a lot of mitigation that can occur.

202
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:19,420
And this works well. Didn't work so well with COVID 19 and because of a variety of reasons.

203
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:30,760
And but here are basically the stated reasons for why we want to investigate an outbreak.

204
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,690
So it can interrupt transmission in several ways.

205
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:40,230
We can prevent transmission by case basis.

206
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:50,160
So we can either through education and to or through isolation, into quarantine, we can restrict.

207
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:55,070
The activity of the case to prevent them from transmitting.

208
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:05,180
We can administer prophylaxis, vaccines, antibiotics, which again have their costs if you're going to administer as a prophylactic.

209
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:16,850
But there's a lot of different ways we can kind of work at trying to keep people from being infected or catch them early.

210
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:22,879
And we can eliminate the cause we can in a foodborne outbreak.

211
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,450
We're going to recall that food item. We can close a pool.

212
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:31,320
If we're talking about a recreational water outbreak, we can do disinfecting.

213
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:36,920
So cruise ship outbreaks, for instance, they try and disinfect the whole ship.

214
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:49,310
And so limiting the cars is another way in which we can interrupt disease transmission again in an ongoing outbreak.

215
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:54,770
That's a rising and intense exponential curve phase.

216
00:25:54,770 --> 00:26:04,340
Interrupting transmission becomes much more difficult, and COVID 19 is a good example where simple social distancing without the lockdown

217
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,650
wasn't really going to have an effect once we were in that exponential phase,

218
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,320
whereas when we were in that earlier phase, it might have had a stronger effect.

219
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:20,570
So this is an example of an E coli O157 investigation.

220
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:31,940
E coli 157, an emerged pathogen that emerged in the 1980s because of its serious cause of foodborne outbreaks.

221
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:41,990
We just had one in Michigan recently. This is an example of one that was connected to prepackaged cookie dough that was contaminated.

222
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:54,350
And so here we see that we start with an epidemiologic investigation that indicates this association between eating raw,

223
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:58,850
prepackaged cookie dough and a case of E coli.

224
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:07,400
And then the second step through lab analysis, they were able to identify E.coli 157 in the cookie dough.

225
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:19,120
And so those two. He says kind of nailed the causal causal linkage between the cases and.

226
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:29,390
And then due to that, there was. Nestle the cookie dough which was implicated here.

227
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:41,490
Actually, this this investigation resulted in some longer term mitigation using flour that had been heated to kill dangerous bacteria.

228
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,840
They talked about testing,

229
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:56,759
beginning to test samples and began typically beginning to test every batch of cookie dough sample and folding that cookie dough before its release.

230
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,440
Then waiting for the actual results show that there was negative. It was negative for this pathogen.

231
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,740
So, again, with foodborne. Diseases there and outbreaks.

232
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:21,190
There is a more fine tuned machinery to be able to address these outbreaks and probably one of the biggest cause of outbreaks in the US ongoing.

233
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:28,320
As far as number of outbreaks. So how do we recognize outbreaks?

234
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:34,900
I mentioned that you have often these outbreaks and outbreaks can go undetected for a long period of time.

235
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:42,340
I think I mentioned before that there was a cryptosporidium drinking water outbreak in 1993.

236
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,220
There are an estimated 60,000 cases in Milwaukee before anybody noticed that there were something going on.

237
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:59,410
And then it took the fact that the pharmacies were cleared out of all antiviral medication or over the counter medication that triggered that,

238
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:11,700
something that's going on. So hey, so one of the ways we recognize it is that clinicians or laboratory scientists detect something unusual happening.

239
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,880
And so AIDS is a good example of that, where in the early eighties,

240
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:21,540
physicians were seeing these very unusual presentations of these very rare diseases that were killing people.

241
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:25,740
And those case studies that were being reported.

242
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:33,950
Where was the first step in recognizing that there was nothing going on and that was the HIV epidemic?

243
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,580
Patients may report other cases when they present.

244
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:47,590
So this would be example, four stages of contact tracing where you get a case and through routine contact tracing,

245
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:53,710
you can get us again a sense of the extent of how much transmission is occurring.

246
00:29:55,180 --> 00:30:07,120
Routine surveillance review. So lots of health departments, for example, for example, target reportable symptoms like meningitis, encephalitis,

247
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:13,690
when there's a huge increase in cases of either those that may trigger that there's an enterovirus,

248
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:20,590
for instance, an outbreak that's occurring in a community.

249
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:27,790
And the news reports could be another way in which we actually identify if there's an outbreak.

250
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:33,249
And as I mentioned, outbreaks and easily getting this for a long time for variety.

251
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:40,870
You know, our our public health infrastructure is not set up to really be efficient in identifying that there's an outbreak.

252
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,090
Another example would be the polio outbreak.

253
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:53,220
That definition of polio is acute flaccid paralysis not only occurs one in every thousand or so infections.

254
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:59,920
So if you're waiting for that to occur, it's a very insensitive way of identifying an outbreak.

255
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:07,490
And again, thousands of cases have been occurring in the community before you actually see in acute flaccid paralysis case.

256
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:19,550
So outbreak investigations are similar to other ideology studies, but they they are different in many ways.

257
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:24,360
So one is urgency that this is an ongoing outbreak.

258
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:31,140
You want to figure out what's going on as quickly as you can to figure out what the source is enduring and mitigate and stop the outbreak.

259
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:43,400
There's great pressure to conclude rapidly by outside forces if there's a lot of cases occurring.

260
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:51,680
There's going to be a lot of legal and financial considerations involved for that cryptosporidium outbreak in Milwaukee,

261
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:57,390
huge numbers of lawsuits that occurred ongoing.

262
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:02,960
So that made things a bit more complicated to actually gather information.

263
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,690
And then there's this the fact that cases available to study may be limited.

264
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:13,480
So so there's limited statistical power to make any conclusions.

265
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:22,360
And then media reports coming out will wind up and likely bias or responses from people involved.

266
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:31,640
So. Whereas an epidemiologist study in general can be, you know, a slow, methodical process.

267
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:38,420
An outbreak investigation is something that has to happen very quickly and rapidly and rapid assessments have to occur.

268
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:48,410
I know that some people participate in the fast training that happens here, and I think that's really what they're geared.

269
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:57,200
Gearing people to do is how to do quick and dirty and epidemiologist to do to investigate these outbreaks.

270
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:13,500
So. The rest of this lecture really is focusing on the steps of an outbreak investigation that's summarized by a 1998 article by Art Reingold.

271
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,940
The first step is to establish a case definition.

272
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:28,110
You want to confirm that these cases are real, and you want to find cases and really define what the scope of the outbreak is.

273
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:35,460
That's the first set of steps. Then you want to conduct very basic analysis,

274
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:47,670
descriptive analysis that kind of highlights what types of disease there is and in what population and what time period.

275
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:55,580
And what geographic area you want to establish, what the background rate is of disease to get a sense of how.

276
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:06,700
Severe. This outbreak is going to collect and test environmental samples to identify and endpoint what the causal agent is.

277
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:14,370
Then you want to generate and test hypotheses and all of that is to come up with ways to quickly intervene.

278
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:24,540
So what kinds of control strategies to implement and how to interact with the public with respect to these interventions?

279
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:39,340
So first with the case definition. As I mentioned, it includes a clinic, the clinical features in the context of person, place and time and so.

280
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:47,980
It's important to characterize what type of person is getting infected,

281
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:53,410
whether or not they're you know, these are people with co-morbidities and out of commodities is a one.

282
00:34:56,150 --> 00:35:03,140
Group of individuals. Or or is this wider spread in community?

283
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,360
You want to figure out how localize is geographically.

284
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:15,550
So again, with the polio outbreak, it's been isolated in New York.

285
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:22,190
But you know where our concerns are? How? To what extent could that spread to other geographic areas?

286
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:29,890
A lot of outbreaks, that is norovirus that can be focused in a nursing home at first.

287
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:38,900
But if it's not contained, it can just it can pop into the general community and hit schools and other categories also.

288
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:44,090
So characterizing the person, place and also time period.

289
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:54,770
So is this something that's ongoing? Some outbreaks and last year's hepatitis A outbreak in Michigan lasted for a number of years.

290
00:35:54,770 --> 00:36:01,490
The HIV was classified as the epidemic was occurring over years.

291
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:09,800
A virus outbreaks occur over weeks. And so understanding that time period and the extent over time that this is occurring is important.

292
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:19,830
And this is just examples of case definitions of ways in which you can find cases with respect to person,

293
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:23,770
place, time, clinical features and laboratory criteria.

294
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:31,820
So children under five males, you know, health care workers in a hospital, ex residents of y county or state.

295
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:43,720
So. So it's also important to note that cases can be suspected, probable or confirmed.

296
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,850
So suspected case means that the case meets clinical criteria.

297
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,780
A probable case means it meets these clinical criteria and there's some epidemiologic link.

298
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:04,580
We see an outbreak in a nursing home and this person has a clinical criteria and a live in nursing home.

299
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:15,800
So the epidemiologic link means some sort of risk factor, that kind of connect that connects this case to this outbreak.

300
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:21,830
And then the last is confirmed when there's laboratory evidence that that person actually has that pathogen.

301
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,980
It is an example.

302
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:40,660
Of an epidemic where what they often plot is a plot confirmed cases that's described and probable cases that's the the light blue in for each day.

303
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,280
So they can say how many confirmed cases they have, how many probable cases they have.

304
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:51,400
That can shift because it can be a probable case or even a suspected case.

305
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:57,700
And the lab results come in three or four days later and it becomes a confirmed case.

306
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:04,870
So anybody's tracking the COVID cases early on.

307
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,929
Those numbers change all the time.

308
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:18,759
So they may report a number at any given time, but those numbers for prior days get in, prior weeks, get adjusted based on evidence they've gone on.

309
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:23,110
So they would respect to if it's a confirmed case or probable cause.

310
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:34,920
So confirm that case is a real clinical case that they may they need to be reviewed.

311
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,780
They need that can be through examining the patient.

312
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:47,640
That can be through examining medical records that could be connecting a lab finding with a clinical finding.

313
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:53,940
So there's a lot of work done into once we find cases to confirm that they're actually real.

314
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:01,919
And then the next level is to establish what the basic background rate of the disease is,

315
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,200
and that is to take advantage of surveillance records to get that baseline.

316
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:12,660
So for a notifiable disease, that's a lot easier than for a non notifiable disease.

317
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:19,889
But there's a lot of other ways through surveillance records and discharge records of the hospitals that we can get at the

318
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:29,430
baseline rate and then determine whether or not is there a number of cases is truly excess or greater than the usual number.

319
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:37,640
So then whether or not we're going to classify this as an epidemic, an outbreak or not.

320
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:52,139
So there once once cases start coming in, you want to continue to find additional cases by reviewing hospital data,

321
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:58,860
by reviewing surveillance data to see whether or not there's cases that initially people missed.

322
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:06,930
But now that we know that there's an outbreak they can catch and again deciding is there an outbreak or not an outbreak?

323
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:16,040
To what extent are the cases that are being identified is above what would be expected based on the background or baseline rate?

324
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,520
So now there's the next phase is descriptive epidemiology,

325
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:31,889
where we're kind of looking at the features of this this outbreak and the shape of the outbreak

326
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:36,660
curve can tell a lot of whether or not it's what we would call a common source outbreak.

327
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:45,420
So everybody is drinking the same contaminated water or they're swimming in the same contaminated pool.

328
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:55,950
And you see that there's, you know, somewhat of a uniform onset day of onset of cases.

329
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:01,650
This is going to be a function of each individual's incubation period.

330
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:09,479
It can also be if they if the source is interrupted, the source of contamination,

331
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:20,730
you might have this kind of feature with respect to the number of cases that you see when you plot that as a function of date of onset.

332
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:29,120
Point. That point source outbreak is the idea that there is, for example, the cook.

333
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,740
Is, in fact, yes, they're handing a lot of food.

334
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:40,660
And you get this norovirus outbreak in a nursing home. And so.

335
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:49,360
The comments are as outbreak with a brief exposure period just as long as this was infectious.

336
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:57,489
There is this point source which is parsing this outbreak and then we have a sense

337
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:04,760
of what the incubation period is by timing between a case and that exposure.

338
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:09,070
So we have a point source and we identify what that point source is.

339
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:14,620
We actually this is a one way in which we can get at the patient period for this particular outbreak.

340
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:30,430
And then the last is a propagated outbreak. So that is where there is person to person transmission that is resulting in continued transmission.

341
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:41,160
So you wind up with you wind up with cases that are spaced where there's no case.

342
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:45,580
So you get your initial cases here and there's a certain of that amount of time

343
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:52,390
due to the incubation period before you start seeing these secondary cases.

344
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:58,150
And then eventually you start seeing again, this is that sporadic phase of an outbreak that I've been talking about.

345
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,610
And then you start seeing this increase.

346
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:10,840
And for a while, if this is, you know, constrained in a community, you'll see these mini outbreaks that are increasing over time.

347
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:20,359
And that's evidence of a propagated outbreak. So three types of outbreaks that are possible and they could be combined that you

348
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:26,380
could get a point source outbreak that then turns into a propagated outbreak later on.

349
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:32,120
Norovirus is a good example of that since environmental exposures in a big way in which people get sick.

350
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:39,920
But it can also be person to person transmitted infectious disease.

351
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,230
So it can so the epidemic curves can tell you the source.

352
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:55,459
We can tell you the average incubation time as we talked about, the time between the exposure date and the first peak is the average incubation time.

353
00:43:55,460 --> 00:44:00,680
So you basically look at that for that peak and.

354
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:11,600
And you can look at that time period as being the time, the incubation period in a propagated outbreak.

355
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,830
That's going to be the time between these peaks.

356
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:21,440
And then if you know the incubation period already,

357
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:29,060
then you can actually get at for a point source outbreak you can get at or common source outbreak you can get at the exposure date.

358
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:38,350
So there's a lot of important characteristics of the case is that in an outbreak investigation,

359
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:47,790
they need to collect to better understand what some of the risk factors are with respect to the outbreak and again,

360
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:58,620
with respect to person, place and time. So the next phase is you want to generate hypotheses for the source and the route of infection.

361
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:04,990
So you want to review the descriptive data and.

362
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:13,070
Come up with. And and that's what the encrypted data is most valuable for to come up with and generate hypotheses.

363
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:19,280
And often that's not quite enough. And you might be collecting some qualitative data,

364
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:27,920
open ended interviews and inspections to try and get a better sense of what the source of infection is.

365
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,160
And then you want to Jen, you want to test that hypothesis.

366
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:40,569
You got to posit that cheesecake caused the outbreak and a case control design is a common way in which we do that,

367
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:49,540
because you've got cases available here using all the cases that you know that are due to the outbreak,

368
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:57,550
you collect a set of controls to see if there's a difference in exposure to the cases or more cases in the cheesecake than controls.

369
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:03,790
And if that's statistically significant, you can identify the cheesecake as the cause of the outbreak.

370
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:13,000
There's always a caution and you've learned about mobile testing, which, you know if you test enough.

371
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:21,610
And you can do enough comparisons, you're going to find a significant result eventually because there is that that error,

372
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,690
you know, a significant result is you're 95% confident.

373
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:31,840
So the issue with multiple testing is if you start testing each meal and seeing looking for that cheesecake,

374
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:36,400
eventually, if you look at enough meals, you'll find that association, you know, at least one of them.

375
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:42,969
And so there's statistical approaches to address this multiple testing issue that you may have been exposed to already.

376
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:48,250
But that's something to be aware of when you're doing these kind of control studies.

377
00:46:51,090 --> 00:47:02,579
This is an example, John Snow, classic example of a quote designed to test his hypothesis that the cholera, especially cholera deaths,

378
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:08,190
are being caused by people drinking that contaminated water coming from one

379
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:14,940
water or the other that SOUTHWORTH And clots all compare to the Landis and he

380
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:21,929
showed that indeed that there were 5.7 times you 5.7 times higher risk of dying

381
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:26,070
of cholera if you were drinking water from Southwark as opposed to Lambeth.

382
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:34,209
Environmental samples can provide causal evidence.

383
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:42,340
And so it's a very, really important once we identify a potential source like the cheesecake,

384
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:48,700
that we start collecting environmental samples and trying to identify whether or not we can identify the causal agent.

385
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:57,930
That could be in a variety of sources. Implementing a control measure must be timely.

386
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:04,020
We've talked about that already. You know, when do you recall the food that's implicated?

387
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,610
Acting too slowly may cause lives. Acting too quickly may have economic and legal implications.

388
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:20,399
So there's always that tension with respect to when to implement these control measures and many forms of control as we are.

389
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:28,800
We've talked about with respect to controlling the source, interrupting transmission or controlling or modifying the host vaccination.

390
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:37,710
For example, we want to communicate the findings to the public at the end of events to talk about what has occurred.

391
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:49,769
And these get communicated in different ways. And then just to end here with respect to public health and outreach,

392
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:57,719
and this is going to tie into the discussion question that we have the idea of how we instill trust in the population.

393
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:02,640
Again, something that we're struggling with today with respect to.

394
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:13,330
The public being engaged and buying into any kind of mitigation approach that you're going to take.

395
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:18,490
So transparency's important announcement announcing early is important.

396
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:20,950
Addressing public concern is important.

397
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:32,350
And then lastly, again, tied into our discussion questions thinking about health disparities and how that might impact how we think about mitigation.

398
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:40,350
So. With that.

399
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,410
I wanted to. Jump to the.

400
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:51,769
Discussion questions. So again,

401
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:56,030
Laura Baumann tomorrow and the on Wednesday I going to kind of reiterate a lot of this in a

402
00:49:56,030 --> 00:50:01,030
much more public health practice perspective for somebody that deals with outbreaks every day.

403
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:06,239
Um. The leaders.

404
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,350
Three questions that I've come up with for you to discuss in your groups.

405
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,980
So they discuss the public health dilemma, determining how soon to act, given evidence of an impending outbreak.

406
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,910
What are the implications of acting early versus acting later?

407
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:27,240
We talked about this a bit. How would you investigate this issue for some of the current diseases that we're dealing with?

408
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,840
COVID 19. One example, monkeypox.

409
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:37,560
The second one is discuss the pros and cons of a more hierarchal model of intervention.

410
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:45,610
Which I'm calling the medical model versus an approach that focuses on community engagement, which I would call more the public health model.

411
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:54,190
This ties into this issue of trust that we were talking about, that we've actually talked about in terms of surveillance lecture.

412
00:50:55,310 --> 00:51:00,860
How would you develop mitigation strategies where stakeholders who may be students at a university,

413
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:05,420
employees of a large factory or community members in a low and middle income country?

414
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:10,430
And how would you ensure that trust is built and maintained?

415
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:15,679
That decision in the last question is at one level,

416
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:21,680
intervening to address an outbreak may be simple get people to vaccinate, quarantine and social distance.

417
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:31,879
I often lecture about compliance and adherence to water filters and implementing

418
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:37,730
water filters in low and middle income countries and the issues behind uptake and.

419
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:43,880
Often microbiologists are just don't get it. They're just like, get them to drink the water.

420
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:50,240
Like just get them to use the filter. So I there's there's many people who think that these things are pretty simple.

421
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:56,360
But how does exposure and health disparities complicate this mandate and discuss how you

422
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:00,739
would approach developing and implementing outbreak control strategies given this reality?

423
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:05,390
And in this one, use a specific example to illustrate this machine.

424
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:12,780
Okay. Any questions on these questions?

425
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:21,630
They will come back in 15 or so minutes to discuss these.

426
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:34,070
Across the street.

427
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:39,560
I would like somebody to copy this paragraph.

428
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:43,930
Like the most renowned. I don't know.

429
00:52:47,300 --> 00:53:05,480
Oh, yeah. Oh, so you say, okay, we're ready.

430
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:15,070
Oh, my God, I can't wait. You're not so great.

431
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:19,420
Today is Spider-Man.

432
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:25,550
I mean, I want to be honest with you. I have to leave that right.

433
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,960
Otherwise, it's just not what I meant.

434
00:53:30,580 --> 00:54:00,840
Because I think what I also have to do something that no one else is really proud of and stuff like that.

435
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:12,830
And I was like, it was quite the content here.

436
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:40,010
That's not to say this like I did you literally my ass, you know, I believe that I was doing all right.

437
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,760
So it's really tough.

438
00:54:47,390 --> 00:55:00,810
And I don't I got to be good example of how I'm doing that.

439
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:08,300
But I don't know. I don't know anything about you guys.

440
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:14,550
I know.

441
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:32,210
But I mean, like, if it's like, you know, like for you to say, you know,

442
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:46,310
we're not sure to do something that was actually was not good for my goal is to just tell her I didn't realize.

443
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:56,690
It's like, you see, how are you going to know what you want?

444
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:11,300
So I do think that that's mainly applicable to like that kind of everything that you've written about.

445
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:20,900
Have you really? Okay, I'm sorry.

446
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:40,370
I think I only got that is basically what you know what I want.

447
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:59,930
People have been honest. But I imagine, you know, it's I oh, he has obviously tried to against it.

448
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:07,460
Why do you keep coming out like, oh, you know, like, oh, I'm thinking, is that like that?

449
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,510
You know, like I by logic is like telling me, like, that's kind of acting like that.

450
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:17,239
But at the same time, I feel like that's also them acting like really and already deciding this isn't that big of a deal.

451
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,510
We shouldn't worry about that at all.

452
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:26,260
Yeah. Mean.

453
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:31,640
So it's sort of like the reality show.

454
00:57:41,170 --> 00:58:00,400
Somebody said Show the higher up. It's like the governor desires to do something to how many times to my mother, you know, of the rise of the video.

455
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:21,050
And there's a lot of science and you just have to feel like you're trying to do this.

456
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:24,220
This is what I'm doing.

457
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:30,400
So that's why of the so sad.

458
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:40,680
They're like mask. They're like, she got a chance to do that.

459
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,140
Pretty sure is.

460
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:54,760
It's precisely Natasha. So it's really okay if you are going to be like, okay, so you get this final.

461
00:58:56,650 --> 00:59:09,250
This is the main thing. I mean, to summarize what you said and I think it matters how novel or like how much did they say?

462
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:14,850
No, I mean, just the passage of the paparazzi.

463
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:24,930
She was like, you need to replace. He's trying to figure out what went wrong.

464
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:37,740
It comes to the outbreak like no one really positive.

465
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:49,230
And I'm like, not because it's too easy by saying I would never, ever, ever have encountered encounters, I think.

466
00:59:50,920 --> 01:00:09,249
And it's hard to see a lot of places where people like like this is just like I have to either wear my favorite.

467
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:15,040
It's like, yeah, like you have a lot of questions, like, take it off.

468
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:25,650
What was that like? You know, you know, it's like now there was something about I would wear,

469
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:48,340
so it still feels like it was like when your entire life is like a scene of all the.

470
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:53,100
Yeah, I mean to just like that. Yeah.

471
01:00:53,140 --> 01:01:05,420
When American citizens like Citigroup, even in New York, which is we're not there, you know,

472
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:21,120
the bubble that was getting in this case, kind of getting people for finance, they're like, you're not going to get that.

473
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:36,220
Yeah. I mean, I think you have to like there's a lot of what we think about you are you don't feel like, oh, I love clean.

474
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:42,730
You know, there are a lot of people that are still very difficult to get people to.

475
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:53,260
Just other feeling where you have take time to get on a plane to do these long today.

476
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:59,080
These are very multi-layered. So let's the pros and cons of American movies.

477
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:17,670
Right. Okay. So you're you're wanting to look like it seems like and especially in during the 21st century.

478
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:25,760
Yeah. Some reason, you know, I'm doing like a psychological wage.

479
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:54,010
The work begins with that, and I feel like I'm probably going to be exactly where I think you might come up with the district.

480
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:58,720
So like the high school, like our schools.

481
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:11,070
And that's all for now, practically and rightfully so for me.

482
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:22,750
So I think it is. I did not report it and there was like the report is dedicated to the Senate.

483
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:32,770
This is the transportation isn't really all there is as you can't actually ever get to a doctor or a doctor.

484
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:42,100
You just have to take pictures of the kids to see where it's going.

485
01:03:42,190 --> 01:04:06,290
Doctor So everyone out there, you know, like you have insurance, you have to work and everything is not about that.

486
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:20,680
I don't really believe that the president wants to keep saying that.

487
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:35,660
It was all that was just the beginning. It was like, you don't have to get sick around like 30 000.

488
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:40,380
This is like a rebate.

489
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:49,030
I think that's sort of is certainly supposed to work.

490
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:52,470
I think that's the question is how are you going to share those things?

491
01:04:54,970 --> 01:05:15,510
It's not like you're going to pay for it and it's just like, you know, so it's just like, hey, let's start the reporting out like.

492
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:29,610
So we can start with one on the first question about the implications of acting early.

493
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:37,710
So kind of like you talked about and the acting too early impacts on the economy.

494
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:44,700
We cost inefficient, efficient, late can result in unnecessary spread and unnecessary death.

495
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:52,530
With COVID, we kind of talked about how akin to early can create like panic or like there might not

496
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:58,080
be a need for panic and then announcing too late could be again like increased spread.

497
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:05,609
People are unaware of what it is and how it spreads. For monkey pox, is it acting too early?

498
01:06:05,610 --> 01:06:08,790
Like kind of plays into the stigma around something like that.

499
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:18,900
And I think Amanda mentioned that there's like a really small window for post-exposure prophylaxis.

500
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:23,130
So announcing too late, you can kind of miss those cases.

501
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:33,060
Right now. So understanding that there is stigma is one issue, economics another issue or the other one is communication.

502
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:37,230
And this idea that you're flip flopping, that's often what is stated.

503
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:44,490
Whereas how would you how what kind of communication could be like as a public health person?

504
01:06:44,490 --> 01:06:51,240
You can mitigate those responses by communicating specifically.

505
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:55,410
In a certain way. When what? I mean, what are the key things?

506
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:00,339
I think kind of like a class thing,

507
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:08,410
like not using stigmatizing language and not speaking in a way that would cause people to, like, freak out or panic.

508
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:15,220
But then you also don't want to you want to acknowledge if transmission is if

509
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:20,350
98% of the transmission is in a certain group and you don't acknowledge that,

510
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:31,870
that's also can be a problem. So I think it's important to be saying, as you know, with uncertainty,

511
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:42,100
as far as we understand right now, and we think these are the steps we want people should be taking.

512
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:48,280
And then the next step would be we've learned that this has changed.

513
01:07:48,640 --> 01:08:00,520
And to be upfront about that could go a long ways in helping to de-politicize some of these issues.

514
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:08,960
Any other thought group to any additional outside.

515
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:30,790
The first question. I mentioned how monkeypox might be a little bit easier at the outbreak to manage compared

516
01:08:30,790 --> 01:08:37,899
to COVID just because of just how it's transmitted compared to compared to COVID,

517
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:41,950
because COVID respiratory virus aerosolization.

518
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:51,400
We know that. And monkeypox, you kind of have to direct contact, you know, and monkeypox like.

519
01:08:52,630 --> 01:09:04,570
And because of that, there's just simply less people affected from monkeypox compared to, you know, less susceptible people like monkeypox,

520
01:09:04,570 --> 01:09:14,730
kind of you have to travel weekly with the messaging, you know, because a lot of people who have it are in the LGBT community.

521
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:23,860
So you don't want to ruffle too many feathers with them, you know, with your messaging, because that could have actually adverse effects.

522
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:31,030
You know, with COVID, it's a little bit more general, you know, just because coughing can literally affect anybody, you know?

523
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:42,850
Yeah, that's pretty much all we have that I mean, I think that with monkeypox, it really it wasn't a lot of clarity,

524
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:49,030
I don't think, on how it was transmitted or not transmitted and the fact that it was a close contact that it may happen that.

525
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:58,660
Because sexual activity is close contact and it doesn't make it a sexually transmitted disease.

526
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:09,010
And by emphasizing close contact and also the way in ways in which, you know, it's either broken skin or membrane.

527
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:15,530
Touching your nose, touching your eyes, touching your mouth. No ways that it can transmit.

528
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:22,090
Might would go a long ways in order to understand how to how do we mitigate these.

529
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:32,440
Diseases with mouth monkeypox. The other reason why made monkeypox is simpler is that it's happening much slower.

530
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:39,249
Not as infectious. So there's a little bit more time in making decisions about it.

531
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:46,870
But I think it's really who's in the health department to understand, okay, more time, but not when do we really need to act.

532
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,680
Okay. So question two, group of three.

533
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:08,489
I mean, I think the heart of all three of these questions really is about what are the challenges to behavior change and how do we develop,

534
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:17,130
implement implementation plans with regards to the challenges that happen with behavior change, both on an individual level and a level.

535
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:27,630
And I think that sometimes we really underestimate how difficult it is to implement behavior change, because these changes do feel very simple.

536
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:35,400
And I remember when I was my two years in Madagascar, it really was all about behavior change and how difficult that was.

537
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:39,600
And I remember our director, one of the things that she had us do,

538
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:49,210
just kind of even individually as scientists, like what what how do you instill behavior change in yourself?

539
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:54,570
And so one thing to ask ourselves is how many of us did actually wash our hands before we ate today?

540
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:59,300
Did we all do that? Do we all know the five critical hand-washing times?

541
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:08,300
Do we all floss every day? And, you know, I do, too, because I've gotten a lot of cavities.

542
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:15,050
But the thing is, is that, you know, I think, like, we get frustrated with communities when even we don't follow these as precisely.

543
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:21,230
And then when you start to integrate with in especially in low income countries, when you have like really,

544
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:28,820
really entrenched behavioral systems which are as a result of imperialistic colonialist histories,

545
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:36,770
which is extreme poverty, asking people to change 500 years of of culturally entrenched behaviors.

546
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:45,410
It's just enormous. And there's often a rationale for their what they're doing and why they're resisting.

547
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:51,050
Yeah. And I guess that goes also into this public health model of engagement.

548
01:12:52,370 --> 01:13:00,829
The more you can engage with a community and the more that you understand what they're coming from,

549
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:05,420
then the more that you allow them to come up with solutions.

550
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:15,200
Yeah, the better. And then I use the example of Koven and the U of M because I was part of a lot of high level meetings.

551
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:19,190
And it's fascinating how, you know,

552
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:31,069
the student can be the bad actor in why there's outbreaks in the university on campus and just hearing like one or two

553
01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:37,700
people who really understood what students go through and how minute to minute you're moving from place to place.

554
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:46,360
And so even to say you need to be here. At 9 a.m. and get your test or your vaccine is not the way.

555
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:52,570
Students operate. And that if you understood that. Oh, you had things right.

556
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:56,200
I have I have five, 15 minutes testing centers right here.

557
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:05,169
I'm going to do it this right here. And so understanding how and engaging with students on how to implement a testing

558
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:14,920
regime or a vaccination plan can go a long ways in getting everyone to adhere to one.

559
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:23,370
And the moment the moment that students feel like they're engaged and they are part of the solution.

560
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:26,770
If a mistake happens, it's a mistake.

561
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:34,810
If they're not engaged, if it becomes this top down model, which I call the medical model, the mistake happens is the conspiracy and they use.

562
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:38,770
And the difference between the two is huge.

563
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:43,270
And it all comes down to whether or not you engage with the community.

564
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:50,270
And like you said, in low and middle income settings. Time and time again.

565
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:57,020
Devout people like it with water filters and they are great filters with respect to removing microbes.

566
01:14:57,530 --> 01:15:01,250
Don't have a clue on whether or not this will be an appropriate filter.

567
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:08,130
One time we did this class where we were trying to show that like, Oh, you can't tell by looking at water.

568
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:14,690
It's clean or not. Which was really funny because I literally went out and picked up some cow dung, which people thought was hilarious.

569
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:20,890
My community bins and I just took a spoon and put it in like I did a blind test and I was like, Oh, would you drink all these?

570
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:27,350
And I remember, like a lot of people in my community and other volunteers in Madagascar had the same thing with people like, Oh no, it's this one.

571
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:35,510
Like, they felt like they knew. You know? And I think, like, especially as, you know, in science, it's all about observing our natural environment.

572
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:39,680
And so for them, that feels real. And instead of just being like, no, you're wrong.

573
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:47,120
And this is why it's just sort of like working with what their reality is, is like it's better for implementation plans as opposed to just being like,

574
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:52,160
No, no, no, you're wrong because it's just starts to become a moot point when you start arguing.

575
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:56,510
Right, right, right. It's all about again.

576
01:15:56,510 --> 01:16:02,100
It's all about everyone buying into this solution, regardless of the solution it has.

577
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:06,500
You know, the solution may be the expert may say that's a suboptimal solution.

578
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:08,060
Another one's better.

579
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:18,530
But if everyone buys into this quote unquote, sellout motivation, it's likely and everyone adheres to it and is going to have a much stronger impact.

580
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:22,580
And if no one adheres to that, quote unquote, better solution.

581
01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:26,830
So I think that that's an important message.

582
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:35,420
Or anything to add on from your point.

583
01:16:39,150 --> 01:16:48,750
I'm sure. Where is that? Up there. I mean, I guess we're still in number two, right?

584
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:52,560
Yeah. Okay. I kind of lost track of where that was like.

585
01:16:53,500 --> 01:17:01,680
But with this. So we kind of were outlining how some of the cons of the medical model have to do really with distrust between

586
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:06,570
medical professionals that might arise transportation issues or access issues when it comes to trying to find like a,

587
01:17:07,170 --> 01:17:09,600
like a health provider that can actually identify a case.

588
01:17:10,770 --> 01:17:16,200
Because if you don't if you're not able to actually get to your health provider or get a confirmed case, like how would they ever know?

589
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:23,700
And you just go under the radar. And it's just important to have like a lot of coordination in that system that you

590
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:28,620
have to coordinate medical professionals with surveillance and government reporting.

591
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:33,180
And there's just a lot of coordination that goes on in that system, whereas.

592
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:40,610
The public health model or the community engagement model, we are saying it's just sort of more it's like an emergency,

593
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:47,130
one of the pros that establishes accountability and investment across different stakeholders because it kind of.

594
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:55,010
And want to say it bypasses those, but it kind of like includes more than just music, medical professional stuff.

595
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:59,180
You kind of. Things. Yeah.

596
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:05,520
It's going to be hard. There's going to it's going to be difficult to have clear communication with with this variety of stakeholders.

597
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:16,810
But it's having the communication. I mean, the stakeholders give a lot of insights that we would never have if we just as a

598
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:23,260
group here decided what's the best approach to solving a given health problem?

599
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:35,190
So. Yeah, so. Getting their voice is huge and getting a communications expert is huge, which is often missed in this whole process.

600
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:42,320
So the last question with Group five.

601
01:18:46,110 --> 01:18:51,899
So we kind of said that exposure and health disparities complicated by the mandates

602
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:56,040
because it would be difficult for people to stay home from work or school,

603
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:59,460
you know, concerns of losing a job, lack of child care.

604
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:04,560
And it would be difficult to mandate vaccination because of differences.

605
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:07,590
Insurance issues with transportation and.

606
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:17,559
What not? And then we said for implementing control strategies that would encourage engagement and improve accessibility,

607
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:25,720
things like paid leave or reduced child care, mobile vaccination clinics would be some of the things we could implement.

608
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:38,380
In. So understanding a lot of the structural limitations that people have and incorporating it into the solution,

609
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:42,610
I think has been one of the main problems with coding. Right.

610
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:47,440
Yeah. Right, exactly. And why are we seeing where we're seeing these disparities in the data?

611
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:54,480
Because. They haven't been really accounted for right from the beginning.

612
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:58,630
When? There is the essential workers are the ones that.
