1
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,440
Okay. So we what? Because you know where we are from, where we dropped out last time.

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:18,620
So we were talking about the interpretation of the Koran converting chapters of 17 year old.

3
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,470
So we have two characters have been a zero and they have one.

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,499
We have 0010 is for intercept.

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,360
And if it is, you know, one is down the slope.

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:42,820
And we mentioned last time that sometimes we want to do a transformation like centering of the covariance.

7
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:54,340
I think there is there is the reason that sometimes we want to do this is really because the interpretation is hard done,

8
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:03,280
because when we incorporated the beta zero, the intercept, we have to interpret in terms, well, when x is equal to zero,

9
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:09,340
x is equal to zero, but at x equal to zero, it may or may not make sense scientifically.

10
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,979
So if doesn't make sense,

11
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:21,100
then maybe the interpretation of what is a beta zero now becomes meaningless because there is no point of coding about equal to zero.

12
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:28,480
So that's the reason why that sometimes we want to center local groups.

13
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:36,850
So that average sentry I mean essentially the sundering as illustrated by this graph here essentially percent

14
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:43,840
true mathematically it's just the same as moving the Y and what access to the left or from the right.

15
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,829
So in this case, the moves that the Y axis to the right, to the center of the ring,

16
00:01:50,830 --> 00:02:02,490
the the range of the covariance you observe to as far as now why exactly that x bar so that now the

17
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:09,220
now this intercept now the beta zero star this intercept now has a has an arbitrary limitation.

18
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:23,650
So it is like one that of average Y value when X is equal to and for when x is equal to x bar or an x for when x y star is equal to zero,

19
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:31,960
and that's when x is equal to everybody. So that's the main reason why we like to be center looking at it.

20
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,420
So the slope because on chain, if you look at this line, this line itself, it doesn't change at all.

21
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,590
One of the what we did it was just to shift in the Y axis to the right.

22
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:48,010
So so it doesn't change the slope at all. So the slope is exactly the same as before.

23
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:58,990
So I have the exact same interpretation. And in this example that before century, before century.

24
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:07,780
So the interpretation of the interpretation of beta zero, there is the mean way for individual at 800.

25
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,200
In this particular case, we could interpret this as newborns.

26
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:18,860
But still, I mean, this is kind of you are extrapolating, right?

27
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:26,170
So we have actually because that's the covariant in our observed data that's from 20 to 20 years old to 39 years old.

28
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,940
But after a century in the cold areas, if you look at this interpretation of this below zero,

29
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:44,549
then it's the mean wage for individual with average age 40 hours with x five star equal to 0x5 star field of zero at star equal to zero.

30
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:55,130
And that that is the average age. So now this has a better interpretation is the mean way for people with an average range.

31
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:06,060
So this is the main reason that we are doing the center at the center of the career.

32
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:15,280
Now, this is just another more mathematical illustration or explanation that the slope interpolation does not change.

33
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,940
So in the original model, now this is the original slope, right?

34
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:25,950
Because this is a reasonable slope. And we know that beta one is actually it's.

35
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:44,100
Is the change in the average of why you write about a change in X as this is actually illustrative of wealth in our lives.

36
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,790
We have had a lot of plot over here, right?

37
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:57,020
So here this is actually the change in average of an average of Y and this is in a meeting of Y and this is the change in X.

38
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:02,390
And of course, the slope is just on this divided by this.

39
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:09,410
So that that is what beta one is and that's the slope.

40
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:20,080
Now if you wanna write it in more details than is actually for example that the Y

41
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:28,600
value out of some x two minus the y value at a sum x one divided by the change in x.

42
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,800
X two minus x one. And this is not a small beta one.

43
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:41,290
Now, if we recenter the covariant, if we center the clarity, then beta one star.

44
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,070
This is the new slope. The new slope.

45
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:57,170
Well, again, it's actually equal to the change in the average of y divided by the changing x start.

46
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:08,020
So after we center the coverage and then of course it's the Y makes the average Y at a do or X to when

47
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:20,650
x star is equal to actually minus the average Y at a particular x one divided by the change in xx2x1.

48
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,340
But we call that x while this is how we did the how we recenter the covariate.

49
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:36,610
So then x is they actually so exercise actually equal to x star, xy star plus x bar.

50
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:43,090
So that's why we are here. So if we look at x y, this is x bar plus x two.

51
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,020
That is not exciting star value you are looking at.

52
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,020
Right? So, so in other words,

53
00:06:53,050 --> 00:07:03,879
now this whole thing or this thing is actually equal to this similarity and this is equal to

54
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:13,780
that simply because the center left and then divided by the same difference between the X.

55
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:23,500
But then for this differ for the denominator, we're going to write it as X bar plus that is minus X bar plus this expert will cancel, right?

56
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:30,999
So that then if we look at the very board on the expression bottom,

57
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:45,370
you see that this is the Y value average y add some x bar plus x two minus the average one x bar plus x one and divided by the difference to X.

58
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:54,790
And so again, I mean, this by definition should be equal to beta one,

59
00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:05,019
this slope over here because because the slope actually does read the doesn't depend on at which particular X now that we are looking at it,

60
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:13,060
as long as we are looking at the average Y value add those two different X and divided by the corresponding difference in x.

61
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,870
So this is equal to greater light and indeed again this is equal to one star.

62
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,510
So this is another just another way of explaining why the slope does not change.

63
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:36,100
And this this is actually better can be better seen again from our point from from this to two graphs.

64
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,310
So again, the recenter of the covariates,

65
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:49,030
essentially what it does is just to shift the Y axis either to the left or the right to the center of the X range from as two x bar.

66
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:54,850
And so because we are simply shifting the Y axis, we never really change this, this line.

67
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:01,980
So this last exactly the same. But what a changed is essentially the intercept result.

68
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:07,720
When we shift to the line, we see that the intercept changed from beta 020 to start.

69
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:19,550
The slope never changed. Okay.

70
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,570
So that's a recenter in the club area.

71
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:37,740
So any questions so far? Okay.

72
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:46,540
Then we're going to move on to the next very important topic that is prime transformation.

73
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:52,780
So we talk about linear regression model, simple linear regression model. We know what it is, we know how to interpret the parameters.

74
00:09:53,410 --> 00:10:03,100
But what we haven't talked about and also is very important is how to estimate beta 0i1 how was your given dataset?

75
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:09,220
If I give you a dataset and we estimate but as we grow and talk about the underestimation now.

76
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,700
So why ask measures?

77
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:21,320
Well, first, we need to be clear that these two parameters, which are the things that we are interested in, we want to estimate these two things.

78
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,420
They are what I know they are fixed.

79
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,860
So we don't know what the various true values are.

80
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,680
And if there are things, they are not random. It's not like in the wild as far as why is running.

81
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:41,280
So these particular individuals you have different different values but these two values are they are fixed are not foreign.

82
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,540
So we are trying to estimate these two quantities based on the data we collect.

83
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:53,219
And of course, now the mean why even X that depends on both.

84
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,280
They have zero and beta one. These two are also unknown.

85
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,540
Of course the mean is also unknown and the true error.

86
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,750
This is also are not right. So of.

87
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:13,160
So what we have is essentially just our data and of the model we assume.

88
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,850
So if I give you all the data, of course you have data, you'll know what a Y is.

89
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,210
You know what I what access. That's what you know.

90
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:28,129
And also you make assumptions about the model. You assume a Y depends on X in which linear factor you assume the simple linear regression model,

91
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:32,860
you assume the error from the normal distribution right in the in the console,

92
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,160
all the major assumptions, all the big assumptions behind a linear regression model.

93
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:43,250
So that's what do you assume the model is? What you assume the data is, what you observe.

94
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:49,220
And then based on this data that you collected and of the model that you have assumed,

95
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:57,500
now we are trying to estimate beta zero and beta one by feeding this model and the betas.

96
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:07,520
Then we saw we put a hat on beta zero and beta one to indicate that these are S majors,

97
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:15,960
which means these are the quantities after you plug in the data, after you calculate these.

98
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:25,700
Well, here I mean, there is a distinction between the estimate is an estimate of so let me explain interest in just a few words.

99
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,880
But but later on, after gradually after you see more and more examples, it will become more clear.

100
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:38,569
So estimate sometimes we we say estimate and especially six or tool.

101
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:46,510
And next semester there will be a very formal distinction between this for conceptual estimate is actually the concrete about it.

102
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:56,150
So if you like if you like a concrete example, y equal to five is equal to three and would y7x equal to, you know, say for example,

103
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:04,340
you have these concrete values and then you plug them in and then you calculate a specific values of beta zero hat in beta one hat.

104
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,650
Those are called the estimate. So they are numbers.

105
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:16,070
There are specific the numerical values, what you call an estimate, the estimates these are were generic.

106
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:25,069
So so as majors, they are not specific numbers, but they they are you know, they are sort of expressions.

107
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:30,050
So, for example, I can show you very quickly and later we are going to actually calculate,

108
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:36,380
you know, for example, this is what have been on one once since Bill Gates, obviously.

109
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:43,420
Yeah. This is essentially what we are going to reach here. So this is what a beta zero is.

110
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:50,050
Beta zero had is and beta one had it. So you can see that they are they are written in terms of the original data like Y bar,

111
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:55,860
X bar and these we call them as majors because these are generic expressions.

112
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,130
They are not concrete numbers. Right. So we haven't plugged in the data yet.

113
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:10,150
So these lines, we call them as majors. And there are other variables because the Y is random, but it wasn't plugged in.

114
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,230
This is basically numbers. Once you have a particular data is those numbers,

115
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,080
then you get a vertical value for because you don't have to be the one that we called on the estimate.

116
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,750
Okay. But anyway, so here we have we have these these two.

117
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,890
I mean, they are as major as they are computed using using our data.

118
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:38,569
And after we got to those two, now, we can, you know,

119
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:47,050
estimate the average of Y at a particular X by plugging by plugging in this zero hat and beta one hat.

120
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:57,240
And this is the estimated mean. After a while after feeding this regression model.

121
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:01,370
And then we have the so called estimating the outcome, right?

122
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:07,290
So we the actual observed value minus the sort of the estimated.

123
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:19,400
And this is actually estimating our. And this error, as you call that error is equal to Y minus.

124
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:30,570
This is absolutely right. So what it was we have was we have, you know, Peter zero hat and Beethoven hat.

125
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:36,360
Now we can have an estimate of absolutely hat. I mean, got to yeah.

126
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:45,770
When we say residuals, we specifically mean the estimated errors, not the original unobserved errors of.

127
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:54,159
Yeah. I'm trying to not to make my statement.

128
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:01,989
Like to, you know, to to general. I think yes, I think I think a general speaking.

129
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:06,640
Yes. When we when we say residuals, we are we mean, you know, this this that's.

130
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:13,120
So after we finish the model, we calculate these these numbers and these are called the residuals.

131
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,080
The original ones like the ABS from this is called Run the Matter.

132
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:22,140
Right. Okay.

133
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:28,150
And one note is that in the textbook, as in the UCI, to denote the estimated gamma.

134
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:38,410
But here in this in this factor in this exercise, we use absolute hat to explicitly indicate that these are calculated values.

135
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:49,510
This is estimated to have. Okay.

136
00:16:51,040 --> 00:17:02,790
So. Now. Well, let's consider a toy example before we actually talk about, you know, how to generally ask me a big zero and a better one.

137
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:15,940
So now consider a model for temperature. Now we well, I think some of us we are more used to Celsius and some of us we are more used to in Fahrenheit.

138
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,850
Right. These are two units or two ways of measuring the temperature.

139
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:28,940
And there is a symbol and a linear transformation between these two scenarios versus a simple linear relation.

140
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,150
So Fahrenheit is equal to a linear transformation.

141
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,730
Celsius would be vice versa. So then something is a linear transformation of Fahrenheit.

142
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:51,180
Minorities, even. I have been in the U.S. for, you know, for more than 15 or 16 years now.

143
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:55,379
I'm still wow, I still need to transform a little bit.

144
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:01,140
I calculate a little bit when people say you're Fahrenheit, like what are what are the corresponding cells is?

145
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,520
So I have a rough idea.

146
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:16,620
I so for example, some 75 degree that's not so I feel comfortable rising over about 90 that becomes very hot and below zero that has to be recalled.

147
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:27,390
But but it's still I don't really know if it was something like in very critical regime I have to really to to match these these two.

148
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,430
So but anyway, so there is a very simple linear relation between this two.

149
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:44,910
Now if I give you two temperatures like the temperatures on two days, the first day is ten Celsius or ten degrees Celsius or 50 degrees Fahrenheit.

150
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:51,630
And then the seven day that's 20 degrees Celsius and 68 degrees Fahrenheit.

151
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:59,940
Now, with these two values, we are able to completely determine the speed at zero and a better one because,

152
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,920
well, two is actually you to determine those.

153
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:07,290
You say that we are determined this linear relationship on this lie.

154
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:13,790
So, of course, we determine a lot. As long as you tell me two points on this line, I should be able to complete completely determine Islam.

155
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,210
And so let's let's take a look at how a do a very quick calculation here.

156
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:31,589
Now, because Fahrenheit is equal to this. Now, on the first day, on day one, I have 15 equal to beta zero plus beta one times Celsius.

157
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:42,750
That's that's ten degree Celsius. And then on the same day, day two, I have 6 to 8 equal to zero plus beta one times 20.

158
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:50,379
And so I have these two equations. And I have to I know there's been, as it were, been a lot, of course,

159
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:58,720
that I can completely determine what happened in zero one, one of the answers and of this as it implies.

160
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:03,040
Now, if you simply your soundtrack to the first equation and from my side of the equation.

161
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,060
And so if you call this one, you call this truth and you simply.

162
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:16,730
Soundtrack one from two. Then what we get is a team equal to the Beat and Zero Council and then times ten.

163
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:23,900
Better look at this. As it implies, beta one is equal to 1.8.

164
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:35,459
And this this gives us speed, a better one. And of course, after we've got a better one that we get easily calculated, then plot a,

165
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:42,420
for example, flock rate of one into either one into other, equation into one.

166
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:51,420
For example, this implies 15 is equal to beta zero plus beta one times ten as 18.

167
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:54,810
Right. This implies that zero is equal to 33.

168
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:09,090
But this is a very simple example, showing that without any rate of noise here, if you look at this example, you know,

169
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:18,330
we assume that this this temperature matters of these temperatures on these two days, there is no noise at all.

170
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:24,900
So these are accurate values and that if we know these two values,

171
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:30,600
then we are able to completely determine this life, which means beta zero in beta one.

172
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:42,030
And that's a fairly simple example. Now, however, in practice, well, we have data, there will be random noise.

173
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:52,560
So, for example, let's say you collect data on a blood pressure and you want to study the means of the blood pressure in an H, right?

174
00:21:52,590 --> 00:22:02,909
So then we'll collect blood pressure. Now there there is, for example, matter of the matter where you matter the blood on the black heart.

175
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:09,030
Or maybe there are some, maybe the instrument may not be well calibrated or I mean, for the same person,

176
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:14,720
the blood pressure will change throughout the day depending on when exactly and what happened to matters of higher.

177
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,260
There is a variation. And also, while, of course, we do not believe that blood pressure is only a factor by age,

178
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:33,180
there are numerous other factors like people's weight and maybe gender, and there are many, many other factors.

179
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:42,029
So but here, because of our data on a matter of age, so of course we do not expect to see that of people who are at the same age.

180
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:45,990
They will have exactly the same blood pressure. Right. And that's just not the case.

181
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:52,430
So in other words, now there is there will be run of noise in the real data that we collect.

182
00:22:53,010 --> 00:23:01,400
There will be running noise. And so it's different from the previous example where, you know, these two numbers, there is no noise at all.

183
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:11,920
So we just don't know exactly what they are. We just we compare them precisely so with random noise.

184
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,450
Now, while that's actually not absolute term. Right. So.

185
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,540
Now with a lot of noise.

186
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,899
Now we. Okay.

187
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,730
So without running the noise. So if there is no absolute right like in the previous example,

188
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:41,160
then we could use any two data points we need to do to figure out what the lines as a line should be completely determined by by two points.

189
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:53,520
We can run the noise, however, with this random noise, with this random error, now we'd be a lot more careful because if you think of the like,

190
00:23:53,790 --> 00:24:02,700
you can look at this, this plot here now these different the dots, these dots, the each dot represents one data point.

191
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:17,070
So collect for example let's say this got here this is all a here x value is over here right some around 2.5 maybe and y value is maybe around two.

192
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:23,070
Right. So this is not the the figure for for this for this not for this individual.

193
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,880
Now you have these different dots and these represent different individuals.

194
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:32,010
Of course, because of the random noise, they do not fall on a perfect lie.

195
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:39,960
You see here that they scatter maybe around some line, but they never fall on exactly the same line.

196
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:44,850
So that's why here we run the noise.

197
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,329
We cannot simply pick one any two data points to figure out what lines.

198
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:56,730
For example, if you just focus on those two lines, it give you I'm sorry, this to avoid this line.

199
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,420
But as you focus on this, two points it will give you.

200
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:15,120
It will give you this light. So so then this is the complication was we have young boys, so we have to use our older data points.

201
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,159
What we use all the data points because we believe that actually the all the data points,

202
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:25,310
they actually they are generated by the same interaction plus some running models.

203
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,210
So we should center around the same the same line.

204
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,249
So let's see how to how to do it.

205
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:41,070
So in this case, we have the data points with the run noise.

206
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:51,000
Well, the question is, how do we determine a line that we think best?

207
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:59,190
Now, the best fits our data are you could ask for the pinger, for example, here we have three such examples in three lines.

208
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:05,999
So all of them seems to be well, you know, they they fall between these points.

209
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,770
This seems to be okay. But how do we pick the best line possible?

210
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:15,990
Which one do we think is is the real line that generates all of these data points?

211
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:23,700
And in order to determine which one is the best word or how to find the best line,

212
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:30,150
we need to be clear, like what we mean by, you know, the best the best line that fits the data.

213
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:39,120
So we all know what criteria we want to talk about or what does it mean to talk about our best line?

214
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:51,830
So the best agenda now is in terms of if you think about their well, let's say for this line, for any line.

215
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,210
So for anyone, just imagine this to be an arbitrary, arbitrary line.

216
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,550
You draw in four for arbitrary line.

217
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:07,610
Now we can look at how far away you the point is from this line.

218
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,840
Right? We can look at how far away each point is.

219
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:28,510
Yeah. But then the best line. So the line that we are looking for that should minimize such distances in a sense,

220
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:33,150
so that as if we are able to somehow define the line that, you know,

221
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:42,060
minimize all these diseases, then that should be that the baseline we are looking for are what we mean by,

222
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:45,670
you know, by minimizing the the distances, all these distances.

223
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:56,079
So that is actually the the method that's called at least a square estimation or ordinary at least a square estimation

224
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:05,340
of the ordinary means that a and a return we assume that they are the same sequence where there is generalized distance,

225
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,589
where which relax that assumption. But let's not worry about that.

226
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:13,180
Let's let's just to focus on the the ordinary square where there is a square estimation.

227
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:22,960
So the idea is that while we will choose the line, so here we can for each data point after you choose this after a fixed this line.

228
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:30,580
Then for each day the point we are able to calculate how far away that opponent is from their line.

229
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:38,470
We can very easily calculate this this distance, for example, from from this point to this point on this line.

230
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:47,680
What are the distances? And would if we calculate all the distances for all these data points, then we are trying to find the line.

231
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,770
But to minimize the smallest squares of these distances.

232
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:56,140
That's called. That's why it's called the least square estimation.

233
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,730
Let's take a look at the. Okay.

234
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:06,230
So yeah, let's just finish this line first. So we will choose the line.

235
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:14,840
We will choose the line that minimizes the sum of the squares, of the vertical distances from the observed points to the line.

236
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:19,850
So this is the idea behind list, a square estimation.

237
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:27,480
So if we are able to minimize. The reason that we are.

238
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:38,070
So maybe we will take a look at his expression and then I'll explain a little bit more to the Beast Square as major,

239
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:43,890
that is to minimize the sum of the square of these hours.

240
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:51,210
So this is actually minimizing the some of these absolute hash slip.

241
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:56,459
And so the had a square. How do we know that?

242
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:02,510
It's actually why I might actually have to do it on my display on one of my.

243
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:19,300
Mm. So we're trying to find a line or in other words, the lines determined by, you know, zero had been a lottery.

244
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:28,450
So we are trying to find a better zero, a better one by minimizing this estimate the sum so those smaller errors or error of some squares.

245
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:42,519
So the of the rationale while we just we just explained using this right here is that well,

246
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:49,540
we will try to find the line that has the minimum distance overall for all these distances.

247
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,239
But of course, we cannot simply take of a some of these distances because some businesses,

248
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,040
their quality of value, the sum, some some of their negative values.

249
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:03,610
It was similar to it was on the positive that it was negative out of will cancel each other as well.

250
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:08,829
That's not a good measure of the overall distance. So a good a matter of the overall distances.

251
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:14,830
First we square each distance and the square meters and then we take the sun.

252
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:21,880
So that's exactly what is what what is done here.

253
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:29,020
So so y minus this beta zero minus this bit of what happened outside.

254
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:37,600
This is the distance from the actual observer by the Y and the corresponding value from the line.

255
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,260
And then we squared the square.

256
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:53,660
And then we take the sun and. So this is the so-called square meter.

257
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,260
So if we minimize this.

258
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:04,550
To find beta zero hat in beta one hat that determines that I have to refine the beta zero had a beta what had been done abandoned.

259
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:09,320
The light has completely determined. So now our goal is to with the data.

260
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,920
So what I explained this is the data we observe.

261
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:19,580
So if I give you the data that you know exactly what y what eyes are, what x eyes are.

262
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:26,690
So once you know those that file by minimizing this, this is becomes a purely mathematical problem,

263
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:35,600
minimizing this that we're able to find beta zero hat and beta one at an event and we are able to completely determine this motion.

264
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:45,680
So now we have changed the estimation problem to a purity minimization problem or organization or minimization.

265
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:58,640
So that is after observing y, x, y for all the individuals, how do you minimize just sum of squares and minimize to minimize some of squares?

266
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:05,300
But we all know that we can take a majority and a lot of unity to be equal to zero.

267
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,670
And this is from multivariate calculus.

268
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:16,550
And of course, if the solution to that is that that could be an either a minimum or maximum minimize or maximizer.

269
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:23,150
So that's stating the points so that you can use the in order to urge you to check by here.

270
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,090
And we can skip that because notice that this is a quadratic function.

271
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:33,900
So it's a convex. It really doesn't matter too much check.

272
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:43,879
So but anyway, let's just now just solve this two equations and this should give us the solution, better as it were.

273
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,900
Haven't been at one half. Now let's take the dirty.

274
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:54,020
Now the derivative. Now, as as he is given here Ramos some squares.

275
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:00,890
And if we take the generative first we look out of the derivative of this federal theta zero.

276
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:13,300
If you take the derivative of this guy salpeter zero hat, then what we get is if you apply the chin rule over here, the smaller.

277
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:16,549
So we appear on the same screen, right?

278
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:23,180
We take the derivative of this guy in the 5000 bit as a rat.

279
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:33,890
So if you apply the chin rules, then it is just power and power square because this becomes the tool over here.

280
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:39,020
And so this narrative up here is because know there's a narrative in front of beta zero.

281
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:49,630
Right. And then what is it like? We still have this guy. And in the sun, of course, we we keep the sun.

282
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:54,740
So this is a. Yeah.

283
00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:00,830
I'll let you guys to figure out the detail of the calculation. But this is simply taking the derivative of that.

284
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:14,340
Some of the squares which had been. And a similarity we are able to take on the derivative with respect to better look.

285
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,770
And then here again we have the back to you.

286
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:26,100
We have the two, but here we have this exi inside of the in front of this.

287
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:36,360
The reason is that when we take the derivative with respect to beta one, there is an odd factor that's high in a French.

288
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,640
So if we apply the chin rule, then x i will.

289
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:51,700
Here. Here. So this is after taking a majority with a set of both.

290
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:57,160
Zero. Had it been better one hat and then we sat both dirty equal to zero.

291
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:06,320
Now our goal is just to solve this. Solving this is also quite straightforward.

292
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:10,790
Now, let's solve that first 1/1. Okay.

293
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:14,209
So now first, notice that now this is equal to zero.

294
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:19,130
So we can cancel on both sides of this negative two. And this this is a causal factor.

295
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:26,270
So it doesn't matter. We get first we can get rid of this negative two divide of both sides by enacting two is still equal to zero.

296
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:38,630
And then notice that here the sum now we're able to move assigned to each term here the sum of why this is the same as ten times y bar.

297
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:57,740
Now y bar is the simple average and touch lead bar, of course, is the sum of all the y's, the minus times beta zero and the minus beta one at heart.

298
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:04,820
The sum of ads are the same. Osama X is actually in comps x bar.

299
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:23,140
This is actually equal to zero. Right.

300
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:28,940
Are you guys following me here with this calculation? Okay.

301
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:38,299
And then, of course, this is equal to zero. We're going to we can cancel this n on both sides so we can divide both sides by by end.

302
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:42,740
So the end is up here. So what is left is locked here.

303
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:50,360
You see that beta zero is actually equal to if we move this beta zero, have it to the right of the equation.

304
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:56,090
Now we have a zero had equal to y bar minus beta one at times x bar.

305
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:06,430
That's. That's why we got it by solving the first equation.

306
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:11,380
We got an equation about beat on one hand and beat and zero out.

307
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:18,130
And now we can bring back this. Now, beat a zero that is equal to this.

308
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,900
Is equal to this. We can actually plug this into the second equation.

309
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:30,900
Now, this is better. Zero had replaced this beat as it had by the y bar minus beta.

310
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:45,490
One had had sex bar. And then what we have is actually going to be like here we do have this on the next slide.

311
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:51,370
So for first of all, this equation three, this is exactly what we just got.

312
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:56,140
The beta zero had is equal to why our money has been a long Xbox.

313
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:02,020
That's exactly what we believe we have here by solving the first equation.

314
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:10,930
And then we plug that into the second equation. So that is.

315
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:15,340
Q Harkness into the side of the equation.

316
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:20,680
It was iconic equation, so exciting equation. Here we have minus beta zero.

317
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:28,870
So if if you put in minus beta zero, then you'll have this minus y bar, then plus beta one hand and explorer.

318
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:44,910
And then what we do is we just rearrange the terms a little bit compared to the terms and we are ready to turn a little bit.

319
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:54,340
So so what we do is now from here, let's see my from one to in x five times y minus y bar.

320
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,760
So first we come by y y and y bar.

321
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:02,520
So we have minus one then. Plus.

322
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:16,690
You know the rest. I have been on one hand and I have had high hopes and spa minus, but.

323
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:35,230
This is simply you know, this is simply to combine this term and a combined Mr. term.

324
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:51,350
Right. And then. Well, here. Maybe I'll just keep writing.

325
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:59,660
I'll keep writing down here. So then we will separate this science.

326
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:06,890
So I have this x, y, y minus y bar, then this guy.

327
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:11,200
Plus I have the sun, the beta one.

328
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:18,800
I can move this beta one out of the summation. Not at minus x bar minus x minus.

329
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:40,050
This. That's actually.

330
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:52,790
That includes this whole equation here. But he has knows if we move that if we move this guy to the to the right of the equation,

331
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:58,450
if you move to the right of the equation, then here, here we have X bar minus X sign.

332
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:04,760
But when we move to the right of the equation there a value to sign that it becomes x i.e. minus x far.

333
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,950
Okay. And then, of course, we have been on one hand here that we had we have divide.

334
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:33,850
We have solved for a bitter one had that bitter one had is equal to the ratio of these two where s as x y.

335
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:41,490
That is simply. You know, the left the the left can obviously be used.

336
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,610
And even part of that is left end of this equation that is misguided.

337
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:51,340
And divided by divided by this numerator is equal to this.

338
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,990
This is the denominator. This is the numerator. I'm sorry.

339
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:07,420
This is the. So.

340
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:13,100
Yeah. So in the end. Yeah.

341
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:18,470
We found that later. One hand is equal to the ratio of this.

342
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:26,000
True. So that's how we solve for 4,000,000,001 half.

343
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:32,420
And of course, with been on one hand available that you can plug every one hack into this equation.

344
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:47,180
And when you get. So are we okay with the calculation of this calculation?

345
00:43:50,600 --> 00:44:02,120
Any questions? Okay.

346
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:10,849
So this one. This one. If I look I mean, I love the expression here, hugging and especially with the you know, with the hand.

347
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:15,670
Right? Right. He knows here it looks a little bit messy, but if you spend a minute,

348
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:19,909
you will see that it is simply for taking the diversity of the equation and then

349
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:24,980
solving that equation equals zero and solving assignment zero to solve for that.

350
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:33,230
And without solving that problem, it's just a some algebra because we only have two parameters beta zero and beta one.

351
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:41,030
So so you have for the larger defender, you know, 5 minutes, you should be very clear.

352
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:46,129
So there is nothing fuzzy here. There's no fancy theory. It's just not something I'm solving.

353
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:54,030
Apparently, it's. Any questions?

354
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:11,380
Okay. So then the main point of the LG were you can you can check that after the lecture if you're interested.

355
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:16,120
But the main point is that now we are we solved,

356
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:26,350
now we got to these fractions to a greater zero and greater one to greater zero having beta one hat and the beta one hat is actually

357
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:46,060
given by this thing as fragile as s x y divided by s s x and the x s s x y that is defined by this and as as x that is defined by this.

358
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:53,340
And then a well, this is just a very simple homework exercise.

359
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:58,460
These are entries. You can shed this very quickly. This is, again, some some algebra.

360
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:07,130
So as as X, Y can be written in this way and says X can be written in this way.

361
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,739
So that's why I actually am offering some incentives for SSX.

362
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:16,190
I mean, the name Silo Square is four for X.

363
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:20,960
So if you look at this, this is quite clear why it's called a sum of squares of x.

364
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:26,330
This is an x x minus x bar than square and take this out.

365
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:34,280
So these are some some small exercises in after the lecture.

366
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:47,150
So in this well, after realizing that this is equal to this disease to do this, then the beta one hat is actually equal to describe the model.

367
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:52,700
I just simply put in the same factor. One number in front of both.

368
00:46:55,430 --> 00:47:00,560
The reason that well, sometimes we put this is well here if you look at it this thing.

369
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:14,860
And this thing now, this thing all pop, that is this guy you find using this form divided by one over camera on his watch.

370
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:18,580
And if you look at this thing, this is the sample covariance.

371
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:22,000
If you recall the sample, how we estimate the sample will be evidence this.

372
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:30,040
That's exactly how we covered the sample covariance and and a similarity not the

373
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:38,109
denominator that is this guy this guy is is this if you look at this for a minute,

374
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:52,460
this is exactly the sample variance how we couple of similarities so many other words now that the theta one hat if you rolled will

375
00:47:52,480 --> 00:48:03,370
remember it will memorize what a beta one hat is is simply the sample covariance between x and y divided by the sample variance of x,

376
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:08,140
the sum of areas of x that is and easy to remember.

377
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:14,470
Right? So rather than you memorizing this as as x, y divided by x.

378
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:20,790
So the three I want to have at the end is simply the simple covariance between X and Y divided by the something.

379
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:33,390
That's Max. So that is why this is just to, you know, another way to interpret.

380
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:47,250
No one had. And if you are a useful fact, where you where you do this small home exercise and also a later one would do some calculation.

381
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:55,980
Very useful fact is that, you know, some of y minus y bar is equal to zero and a sum of excite minus x bar people to zero.

382
00:48:56,430 --> 00:49:04,220
This is very simple fact. So. It's very easy to see.

383
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,200
Okay. So any questions so far?

384
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:31,860
Okay. So if there is no question, then we will take, you know, 9 minutes, break your resume at nine.

385
00:49:39,088 --> 00:49:45,048
So now if we look at take a look at what we have done so far,

386
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:53,028
what we what we have done was to derive the expressions for theta zero hat and beta one hat.

387
00:49:53,598 --> 00:50:03,768
So we as we started from, let's say we are given a theta that wanted us and it has individuals and individuals and anatomies.

388
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:14,288
We have the observed values and Y and for X and we are creating I mean, in this course we are treating the X as fixed values.

389
00:50:14,298 --> 00:50:19,367
So we do not consider X to be random by the Y values.

390
00:50:19,368 --> 00:50:22,517
These are random given. That's why is run the result.

391
00:50:22,518 --> 00:50:30,167
There's a lot of noise in that in the response. So y is random in then while this is the data we had right.

392
00:50:30,168 --> 00:50:35,988
So we are given the data. And then for this data we have assumed a linear regression model.

393
00:50:36,768 --> 00:50:39,828
Assuming a regression model, that's what we assume.

394
00:50:40,268 --> 00:50:47,388
That's the model we assume and then we assume the absolute term follow here for only for an assumption.

395
00:50:47,388 --> 00:50:52,367
We assume it has new zero and causal mirrors and an error terms.

396
00:50:52,368 --> 00:50:57,098
They're uncorrelated, but generally speaking the absolute worst usually.

397
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:03,858
So under this two things. One is the data we are given in.

398
00:51:03,858 --> 00:51:12,888
Another one is the model we assume is a we derived that expression for beta zero hat and beta one hat.

399
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:18,978
If you look at the dependance, these only depends on the data.

400
00:51:19,668 --> 00:51:23,898
And so the model is after the first method that's used when we, when we do the compilation.

401
00:51:24,378 --> 00:51:27,828
But if you look at the final expressions, these all depends on data.

402
00:51:27,828 --> 00:51:36,527
So once you give me X values and Y values, I'll be able to plug the X down into this tree expressions in a calculator.

403
00:51:36,528 --> 00:51:38,718
This has been zero had been one hat.

404
00:51:40,428 --> 00:51:49,368
But generally speaking, I mean, these are the mathematical expression for for this to not because as we mentioned,

405
00:51:49,368 --> 00:51:54,268
because the Y value we your y value to be run y is rather variable.

406
00:51:54,288 --> 00:52:04,097
Although we treat x as a wise these are regular in a both beta zero for the beta one ahead depends on what so generous speaking.

407
00:52:04,098 --> 00:52:14,538
These two are random as well. By random we mean that if you collect a different dataset, if you apply beta theta from different individuals,

408
00:52:14,928 --> 00:52:19,278
then you will see this quality is very you will not get exactly the same amount.

409
00:52:19,728 --> 00:52:25,638
So this is generally true not only for linear regression, but for any other information.

410
00:52:25,938 --> 00:52:37,007
So if you if you think of a thing about in this way, so that so is statistics,

411
00:52:37,008 --> 00:52:41,988
what we do is we actually try to make an inference about the population.

412
00:52:42,648 --> 00:52:49,398
So about how about everybody? We do not of course we do not we are not able to collect data from every individual in the population.

413
00:52:49,398 --> 00:52:53,837
So we take a sample, we take a small sample from a population and we climb data.

414
00:52:53,838 --> 00:53:01,938
Let's say we take a sample of 500 individuals who have data and that based on the data we can calculate beta one had a beta zero happen,

415
00:53:03,228 --> 00:53:11,058
but if you take data from another 500 individuals, you do, you do this the sampling again, you take another 500 individuals.

416
00:53:11,508 --> 00:53:21,768
Of course, you do not expand to see that the data, the value calculated based on the seven 500 individual is exactly seen as the beta beta.

417
00:53:21,768 --> 00:53:28,278
What happened is that we have a catalog from the first 500. So if you repeatedly do this experiment,

418
00:53:28,278 --> 00:53:34,458
if you sample 500 individual calculate because there have been some another 500 individual

419
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:39,558
capital beta for a minute and assemble other 500 individual counted Benazir Bhutto.

420
00:53:39,768 --> 00:53:46,158
So each time you do this, you get two different models of Benazir in a month simply because of the randomness in the data,

421
00:53:46,158 --> 00:53:49,188
you are having different 500 individuals.

422
00:53:49,758 --> 00:53:56,628
And so that is that the beta zero, beta one, these two, they are also random.

423
00:53:56,718 --> 00:54:01,028
Depending on which particular data you are using to a capital industry,

424
00:54:01,038 --> 00:54:08,148
there will be variation if you are using different data sets for these are also random.

425
00:54:10,398 --> 00:54:13,688
So these are these are also run the variables or as.

426
00:54:16,018 --> 00:54:20,578
But once you collect a particular dataset, if I just give you one dataset,

427
00:54:21,538 --> 00:54:27,298
then you're able to plug in those one items in X values to calculate a particular number for it.

428
00:54:27,298 --> 00:54:33,088
Because there hasn't been a one that. Not because of luck.

429
00:54:33,778 --> 00:54:41,368
So here, on the other hand, we don't want that in terms of well, I mean, our interest,

430
00:54:43,318 --> 00:54:52,518
as we mentioned in I think it motivates one particular interest is to estimate the zero and beta one because we don't know the true value.

431
00:54:52,528 --> 00:54:57,288
So we want to use our data to estimate the duration and the estimate.

432
00:54:57,298 --> 00:55:03,238
But as there are two types of estimates, one is the so-called point estimate.

433
00:55:03,988 --> 00:55:08,428
That is like what we did. And so we calculated the values of this truth.

434
00:55:09,298 --> 00:55:11,218
So to say, based on this particular data,

435
00:55:11,218 --> 00:55:20,818
that might be the one value I asked maybe to be part of three my theta zero value as maybe to be, you know, back in 97, for example.

436
00:55:22,438 --> 00:55:23,998
And those are what has made it.

437
00:55:24,038 --> 00:55:33,418
You are you're just giving specifics that if you are if you are using estimates of the values as matrix post-modernist, that's the so-called spoiler.

438
00:55:36,158 --> 00:55:40,078
If there is also favorable estimate interval estimated,

439
00:55:40,078 --> 00:55:48,748
this is based on the idea that now I don't know what are the true value for beta one is for download I'll give you you say your ask me

440
00:55:49,108 --> 00:55:57,928
I want to say that that is almost sure that this is not a true value because you can collect a lot of data that you're not to gather.

441
00:55:58,108 --> 00:56:02,938
Once again, you'll probably get one, two, six, five, six, eight, for example.

442
00:56:03,808 --> 00:56:13,978
So, so there is always some variation. So instead of estimating beta one by a bigger value, I do I provide an inner inside of estimating.

443
00:56:13,988 --> 00:56:23,068
That points out. I say, although I don't know what better one is, I think it's probably a bit to want a safe and policy example of it.

444
00:56:23,848 --> 00:56:28,408
So I give you an interval rather than say, Oh, ask me to be a 1 to 3.7.

445
00:56:28,958 --> 00:56:33,148
And I see what the benefit of one is from the B 2.61.8.

446
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:37,918
So that's the so-called interval estimation. So these are two types of estimation.

447
00:56:38,278 --> 00:56:44,188
But in your estimation, it takes the uncertainty, takes the randomness into account,

448
00:56:44,668 --> 00:56:49,318
because we know that each time we climb over data that we will get a different estimate.

449
00:56:50,398 --> 00:56:54,798
And so we do not instead of just estimating beta bias visit random.

450
00:56:55,708 --> 00:57:03,198
We we estimated by interval we say that, you know, any value in this interval are likely to be the beta one,

451
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:06,748
although we don't know exactly what the truth is.

452
00:57:07,768 --> 00:57:14,518
So that's the the estimation. And another thing we are interested in is the so called hypothesis testing.

453
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:23,938
And in the formal concepts of all these, I mean in the 650, we will use all these concepts and they are also they should be easy to understand,

454
00:57:24,478 --> 00:57:31,048
but the formal, the formalization of these will be in six or doing vertical inference.

455
00:57:31,768 --> 00:57:34,828
The hypothesis testing is based on the idea of that.

456
00:57:35,608 --> 00:57:42,248
Okay, I don't know what a beta one is. But I want to test whether it's equal to or can you go to that.

457
00:57:43,578 --> 00:57:46,948
And this particular random urine is taken to be zero.

458
00:57:46,968 --> 00:57:49,427
This is common in clinical trials.

459
00:57:49,428 --> 00:58:01,278
So you want to study whether a particular drug, a particular medication or a surgery procedure, whether not that has effect on a certain disease.

460
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:04,398
So particular right, whether that has a treatment effect on the disease,

461
00:58:05,598 --> 00:58:11,258
especially for a new drug, and then your you hypothesize you will test, right?

462
00:58:11,268 --> 00:58:15,388
Well, this is so you hypothesize that. Well, I don't know how, but this is first.

463
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:21,318
Then the driver has no effect at all so that, you know, theta one is equal to zero, there is no effect.

464
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:29,748
Then I'm going to use my data to actually evaluate this analysis to see whether this hypothesis is is true or not.

465
00:58:29,808 --> 00:58:33,688
And I will I will examine this hypothesis or I should not do this.

466
00:58:35,238 --> 00:58:38,087
So that's the idea behind all this testing.

467
00:58:38,088 --> 00:58:45,428
So so you have a particular values of interest long past, whether beta one is equal to particular interest.

468
00:58:45,858 --> 00:58:54,558
And typically that particular value of insurances is taken to be zero, representing a corresponding to no effect, no association with that.

469
00:58:56,148 --> 00:59:04,698
So this is a hypothesis testing, but in order to do all either one or both of or either well,

470
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:13,818
this either was made or have all the testing we have to take the uncertainty of beta zero and beta one the hat into account.

471
00:59:14,748 --> 00:59:25,158
Again, this is based on the the the based on the the the reality based on the fact that if you take a different sample from the population,

472
00:59:25,488 --> 00:59:31,007
you will get a different estimates for this beta zeroed in on the values.

473
00:59:31,008 --> 00:59:37,368
The estimated balance will change depending on which particular example you take because the matter will change.

474
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:44,028
Not when you devalue a procedure to try to estimate a beta or to test beta,

475
00:59:44,358 --> 00:59:49,458
you will have to take that uncertainty into account because now what you have is only one

476
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:54,108
particular data set and in this particular case that gave you this particular value.

477
00:59:54,468 --> 01:00:01,728
But that does mean that the particular value you have now is the truth, because it will value if you collect different data sets.

478
01:00:03,718 --> 01:00:09,238
So then we have to take that or in other words, the sampling distribution into account.

479
01:00:09,748 --> 01:00:18,418
So what do we mean by the sampling distribution? So we will just look at this very clearly that we've gone back and forth between this two slice.

480
01:00:19,498 --> 01:00:23,218
So if you do this experiment many, many times.

481
01:00:24,148 --> 01:00:30,278
So even if you collect data, like if you collect. Well, your sample size was 500.

482
01:00:30,288 --> 01:00:35,688
You clocked one sample of 500. Another said co-founder of another sample, 500.

483
01:00:35,958 --> 01:00:43,488
You do this many, many times. Let's say you do this 1000 times, and each time you can calculate a better zero having been a woman.

484
01:00:43,548 --> 01:00:50,868
Let's be honest. There's a few times you can come up with a lot of that, and then you do this a thousand times.

485
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:57,168
You will have a thousand estimate on that one. And then you can make a history of better one at.

486
01:00:58,098 --> 01:01:03,548
Right. This is this is a he's rebel leader want to let you make of his.

487
01:01:04,818 --> 01:01:11,928
And of course the beta one had a who is is not is not going to be the same across these different replications.

488
01:01:12,648 --> 01:01:21,348
So there is variation. That's why you have this history. If you look at this history, then there is there is going to be a a center.

489
01:01:25,278 --> 01:01:31,308
And also there is going to be variation that is like how scratch our estimates are, right?

490
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:35,868
So these are actually the qualities we are interested in.

491
01:01:35,898 --> 01:01:43,968
So we want to know if we repeat repeat of the calculated based on that based on different sets.

492
01:01:44,598 --> 01:01:53,118
What are the average values of these repeated calculation and what like how much variation there is in this repeated calculation?

493
01:01:54,958 --> 01:02:01,578
Three other words we want to know what are the distribution is like if we make a history?

494
01:02:02,238 --> 01:02:12,658
What are the disputed looks like? And all for parents who are having a bit of one hand while there is a theory based on central interference,

495
01:02:12,658 --> 01:02:17,988
and you will learn that in 601 and that later we'll talk about in more detail in 602.

496
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:24,048
It turns out that under some conditions, generally speaking, I mean, of course, there are exceptions.

497
01:02:24,048 --> 01:02:30,738
But generally speaking, if you look at the disputed assembly dispute, a bitter one, and then if you repeated a couple into this,

498
01:02:30,888 --> 01:02:37,698
you may he's grabbed that his right will look like a normal distortion if there is a center.

499
01:02:38,118 --> 01:02:44,328
And then there's you know, it's kind of symmetric about center three some tails.

500
01:02:45,078 --> 01:02:55,158
So this is what it looks like if you make a his grip or the distribution on one hand and get beaten zero head on.

501
01:02:57,978 --> 01:03:03,557
So later well, actually in a few minutes, we are going to do the calculation.

502
01:03:03,558 --> 01:03:13,938
It turns out that beta zero hat and beta one has the institutions, they are the corresponding beta zero and a beta one.

503
01:03:15,528 --> 01:03:26,418
So in other words, if you make this, here's where if you make this plot, this is the plot of beta one hat, the center here will be theta one zero.

504
01:03:26,628 --> 01:03:31,308
Oh, this we'll be beta one will be the true that it will center on the truth.

505
01:03:31,788 --> 01:03:40,337
So here are the words. What it means is that although for a particular data that you collect, you may not well for this particular device,

506
01:03:40,338 --> 01:03:45,468
and you may get a beta one value beta beta one hand over here for another.

507
01:03:46,708 --> 01:03:49,168
Because now you might have got a better one when we were here,

508
01:03:49,468 --> 01:03:56,188
but you might estimated to be this battle and again a third dinos out and you might get a better one had better over here.

509
01:03:56,848 --> 01:04:02,218
So you see this narration if you do this, if you click data or data.

510
01:04:02,998 --> 01:04:10,168
However, if you do this many, many times, then on average you will get better.

511
01:04:10,198 --> 01:04:15,628
What? You will be out of the truth. If you take the average, you look at the average, you will get on the truth.

512
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:25,437
So that's actually is is the reason that we can rely on this procedure to do estimation, to do inference, because, I mean,

513
01:04:25,438 --> 01:04:33,238
if we never if even on average we are not getting the truth back, then there is no point of following this procedure.

514
01:04:33,238 --> 01:04:39,417
And so so this this this is based on I mean, there is there is a theory.

515
01:04:39,418 --> 01:04:48,538
So if we are not able to talk too much in this course, watch on average, if you do this repeatedly on average,

516
01:04:48,538 --> 01:04:55,288
although each time, you know, there will be some variation, you will see a different value from the true better one.

517
01:04:55,768 --> 01:05:04,288
But on average, if you do this many, many times, you will see that the decision is centered about beta one.

518
01:05:04,618 --> 01:05:15,448
True, that that's what it means by, you know, by the by the exaggeration equal to the truth is that Asian people do not choose.

519
01:05:16,888 --> 01:05:28,858
So every we are getting back the truth. So that's that's okay since so that's all average.

520
01:05:28,888 --> 01:05:35,098
Now of course we would also like to know the variation how, how spread, how, how, how widespread there is.

521
01:05:35,338 --> 01:05:39,868
And then we calculate the variance of both zero again and fatal on that.

522
01:05:40,498 --> 01:05:46,288
And we will see that a virus is revealed by these two to do this in a few minutes.

523
01:05:50,688 --> 01:06:00,548
Would you? But this is not, you know, the the idea behind using this computers or having data one hat as estimate.

524
01:06:00,558 --> 01:06:03,408
Well, to estimate and to make the inference.

525
01:06:06,528 --> 01:06:13,488
Again, the fundamental idea is based on well is is that if you repeatedly take a sample from the population,

526
01:06:13,908 --> 01:06:18,018
then on average you should be able to get back the truth.

527
01:06:20,508 --> 01:06:29,438
But of course, I mean, there will be variation and our goal is to actually quantify the guarantee by calculating by calculation,

528
01:06:29,448 --> 01:06:36,558
various and various variable to quantify in a region the uncertainties the estimated.

529
01:06:44,708 --> 01:06:56,107
Okay. So any questions so far? I mean, this is this is like one fundamental thought, I think, that we should have we should pay attention to,

530
01:06:56,108 --> 01:07:01,448
because this is not only for this course is this is truly an agenda for this is a

531
01:07:01,448 --> 01:07:06,757
thought that is behind almost all statistical methods we develop and this uncertainty.

532
01:07:06,758 --> 01:07:11,708
So if you if you take a sample, you will get a someone who has made the banner.

533
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:18,578
But but is that the common truth that if you repeatedly do this, then on average you should be able to get that much?

534
01:07:20,918 --> 01:07:31,838
So any questions? So. Okay.

535
01:07:33,158 --> 01:07:42,598
So another thing is that so later on, in a few minutes, we're able to calculate these two now.

536
01:07:42,758 --> 01:07:47,748
But if you're not, suppose that we are given these two expressions of errors of below zero happened.

537
01:07:47,768 --> 01:07:53,348
There is a bigger one that we see that the virus is actually involved with, see.

538
01:07:53,498 --> 01:07:55,688
So we're going to see what score is unknown.

539
01:07:56,678 --> 01:08:08,348
So in order to use maybe use of this boundaries, we have to estimate the sea square and a sea of square is estimated in the following way.

540
01:08:08,768 --> 01:08:16,028
So if I see my hat square and I see I had a square, that's the second I see.

541
01:08:16,448 --> 01:08:21,178
That's this sum of square divided by two.

542
01:08:24,988 --> 01:08:30,388
This is how we estimate. C'mon. See my square. And then later we'll talk a little bit more about this.

543
01:08:30,988 --> 01:08:39,598
So after we estimate ACMA Square, then we can plug them back into the formula for the variance of beta zero 3 to 1.

544
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:45,728
We can replace. We can replace this.

545
01:08:45,748 --> 01:08:49,958
See my square in this consumer square by the sigma part square.

546
01:08:50,368 --> 01:08:57,718
And so that we have this you have somewhere here that we are able to calculate these two variances.

547
01:09:10,588 --> 01:09:18,398
Any questions? Okay, then.

548
01:09:18,938 --> 01:09:24,698
Well, let's take a look out of the property on these two square as neighbors essentially

549
01:09:24,698 --> 01:09:29,678
walking around talking about how have you accounts of zero having been what have.

550
01:09:36,678 --> 01:09:41,358
So while here first, let's take a look at some general. I mean, these these are some general property.

551
01:09:41,358 --> 01:09:46,097
And so we are going to look at this. You guys are going to look at this in more detail.

552
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:48,648
Again, you see some tools all about the bias,

553
01:09:48,648 --> 01:09:54,947
the various sample variance means where the relationship between between all these but a here we can talk

554
01:09:54,948 --> 01:09:59,928
about the fundamental idea again let's focus on the fundamental idea rather than that macro details.

555
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:06,618
So now suppose we use the a hat to ask me to say I see the hat as a measure.

556
01:10:06,648 --> 01:10:15,868
This is as nature. This is this is random. So because each time you combine dataset to calculate theta hat, you will get a different value for data.

557
01:10:15,888 --> 01:10:19,248
And so there will be variation. So these,

558
01:10:19,698 --> 01:10:29,148
these are all so theta had a is random depending on what people are sample you are taking from that population and a theta is the so-called estimate.

559
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:33,658
So we are trying to estimate theta fellows I know is fixed quantum.

560
01:10:33,678 --> 01:10:38,478
So that's our target. We are trying to estimate you by collecting a small sample.

561
01:10:40,608 --> 01:10:46,937
Now we are using theta how a to estimate a theta in this process using theta

562
01:10:46,938 --> 01:10:52,758
have estimated theta beta is something that is called the slope of the bars.

563
01:10:53,628 --> 01:11:02,238
Y is means that on average what's the difference of your estimate are average from the truth.

564
01:11:03,678 --> 01:11:11,448
So yeah, if you think about taking the samples many, many times, you appear to take sample from the population by each sample.

565
01:11:11,448 --> 01:11:20,898
By taking either sample, you get a theta hat and if you take a thousand samples, you'll get a thousand theta hat and you can calculate an average,

566
01:11:20,898 --> 01:11:28,158
obviously a hat, and then you can look at how far away on average theta hat is from the truth.

567
01:11:28,608 --> 01:11:32,748
That's the so-called the bias, the so-called bias.

568
01:11:33,318 --> 01:11:40,068
So whether there is still a difference on average between your assignment and the truth, that's possible bias.

569
01:11:40,428 --> 01:11:48,408
Now we call has made our unbiased if the bias is equal to zero or if on average we will get a back the truth.

570
01:11:48,438 --> 01:11:54,888
Although for each sample we may not again get back the truth by that, but all average will get back the truth.

571
01:11:55,068 --> 01:12:01,398
So that's what unbiased means. It means that the explanation is equal to theta.

572
01:12:05,198 --> 01:12:09,638
And that's that's the so-called a bias. And another one is sampling variance.

573
01:12:10,448 --> 01:12:14,258
The sentiment theories is false by definition.

574
01:12:14,438 --> 01:12:23,408
I mean, it's the veterans of theta that is by definition is equal to that is the interpretation of soap operas, again,

575
01:12:23,408 --> 01:12:33,668
is that if you repeatedly sample from the population and for each sample you will get a different theater that that if you look at this,

576
01:12:34,628 --> 01:12:37,777
if you assemble a thousand times you have a thousand theater hat,

577
01:12:37,778 --> 01:12:45,818
you have a variation across this even if it happens at a that evaluation that variance is the called a sampling

578
01:12:45,818 --> 01:12:53,858
metrics because there is variation depending on which sample you take the physical so-called sample sampling various.

579
01:12:55,228 --> 01:13:02,458
Emma There's musical error. Musical error is actually the symbol bearings, plus the square of the bias.

580
01:13:04,538 --> 01:13:17,748
The Square of ice. And of these three things, these can be used as a criterion to make assessment of how good and as nature is,

581
01:13:19,188 --> 01:13:26,628
we want them as matter to have a small bias because we like on average, at least we like to get back to the truth.

582
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:29,418
So we want as we or have a small bias.

583
01:13:29,928 --> 01:13:37,368
And also we want as waiter who have small dams because we don't want the estimated or to vary too much from sample to sample.

584
01:13:37,848 --> 01:13:45,048
I mean, if you talk sample, you got 9100 on a sample, you got positive housing sort of variation.

585
01:13:45,048 --> 01:13:51,768
And then that means that the procedures, it's not not a very stable, remarkable procedure to have small variance.

586
01:13:52,998 --> 01:14:01,158
And in general, we want to the procedure to have small musical health because music marries the son of is to.

587
01:14:03,028 --> 01:14:10,288
Of course in reality it's really hard to find as major about has a very small bias very small variance.

588
01:14:11,308 --> 01:14:14,338
So sometimes if you have to make a tradeoff.

589
01:14:14,728 --> 01:14:22,828
So. So sometimes we sacrifice bias a little bit in to again in order to substantially reduce the variance.

590
01:14:23,388 --> 01:14:27,898
So but that's that's a topic in six or two.

591
01:14:28,288 --> 01:14:34,798
But here, I think the main point I want to emphasize is that the bias, centenarians and the squares,

592
01:14:35,158 --> 01:14:40,648
these are some criterion criteria that we can use to assess different asymmetries.

593
01:14:41,008 --> 01:14:49,738
And ideally, in ideal world, we will rely to all of these to be small, as small as possible, size to be small, sample variance really small.

594
01:14:50,278 --> 01:14:53,368
And thus we estimate error to be small.

595
01:14:56,588 --> 01:15:07,718
Okay. So then our goal next is to actually to calculate the exacerbation of beta zero had a beta one have and also the virus a beta zero and beta one.

596
01:15:10,598 --> 01:15:19,148
So. You know, we're going to find out that the expectation of being a zero is equal to zero.

597
01:15:19,568 --> 01:15:29,158
And it's not even a better one. It is equal to better. So that means that if both are unbiased, there is no bias for either of these assumptions.

598
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:38,928
There's the lies. And then we are going to calculate the sampling variance of this to see how much variation there is and see what happened.

599
01:15:42,328 --> 01:15:49,858
That's what we're going to do next. So again, well, in the next few slides, we're going to see some heavy algebra.

600
01:15:51,468 --> 01:16:01,828
So again, well, I mean, the expressions may be long and heavy depending on I mean, whether you have seen this stuff or not before.

601
01:16:02,938 --> 01:16:06,328
But they are large and don't be scared by the expansions. They are.

602
01:16:06,338 --> 01:16:12,798
They are they're just algebra and and there is no fancy, you know, like a calculus.

603
01:16:12,798 --> 01:16:15,868
Anybody, not even calculus. It's just a some some algebra.

604
01:16:17,098 --> 01:16:27,508
Okay. So but first, let's recall that I know some facts about any South Asia Foundation of any times y is equal to a hamstrings non-Asian one.

605
01:16:27,988 --> 01:16:37,828
And is that Asian linea always in Spanish on the sun is equal in some of these pages, so will use these facts.

606
01:16:43,208 --> 01:16:51,608
Okay. So this is one of the first calculations we're going to do.

607
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:57,698
So we're going to calculate the distribution of one of beta one hat.

608
01:16:58,028 --> 01:17:01,718
We're going to show that foundation. You see what, Capital One.

609
01:17:02,078 --> 01:17:12,847
So that means 3 to 1. Having an unbiased assessment that Mubarak's beta one hatched using being a one hands what has to be you know what the

610
01:17:12,848 --> 01:17:21,757
proving is actually so inside of you know a U-turn you can I think we will go over that the expression on the slide

611
01:17:21,758 --> 01:17:31,738
this actually is probably easier and also my hand writing is is not by now probably has already realized my handwriting's

612
01:17:31,958 --> 01:17:42,667
really pretty messy it's probably easier and also we're trying to keep the same pace as the other session.

613
01:17:42,668 --> 01:17:51,048
So so I think it's probably easier actually to score over this using the slide, basically.

614
01:17:51,608 --> 01:18:01,267
Just read it in the slide. Okay. So now if we look at to the now we want to calculate the expansion of beta one had not

615
01:18:01,268 --> 01:18:07,868
beta one that we have already calculated to be this guy and that's what we have done.

616
01:18:07,868 --> 01:18:16,148
If you recall. I mean, in the first half of the lecture today, we actually it's right here.

617
01:18:16,148 --> 01:18:23,587
So we are we calculated the beta one hat that's equal to miss here.

618
01:18:23,588 --> 01:18:30,698
We just directly make use of that. Exactly. So this is beta one hat.

619
01:18:30,908 --> 01:18:33,428
We are calculating the expression of this beta one.

620
01:18:36,118 --> 01:18:47,158
And then one thing we first we noticed is that this denominator here, this s s x, this does not mean I know why it only depends on x rays.

621
01:18:47,158 --> 01:18:50,608
So if you recall what one x is, that is.

622
01:18:54,658 --> 01:18:59,158
That is, this only depends on X, it does not depend on Y.

623
01:19:00,698 --> 01:19:05,248
Now, because x is assumed to be fixed, we can access fixed.

624
01:19:05,258 --> 01:19:09,208
Now, of course we can move this out of the expectations because it's just a number.

625
01:19:09,568 --> 01:19:20,438
It's a number. So we move it out of these positions. Not to be obsolete is that everyone asks x, y, now ask x, y.

626
01:19:20,458 --> 01:19:24,718
If you recall what that is, that is actually this expression.

627
01:19:28,958 --> 01:19:41,498
This expression? None of them. Okay, so here we have the expectation of the sun and now we are going to do because this is radically outrageous.

628
01:19:41,498 --> 01:19:54,127
So it's equal to the sum of the foundation of each term here, the expansion of each term here and now, the x minus x bar.

629
01:19:54,128 --> 01:20:00,758
This is the cost of this. Over here we are simply treating this as our constant.

630
01:20:02,228 --> 01:20:10,418
And then it's of course equal to what we can move it out of this foundation that is this line times the expansion of one.

631
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:20,958
What's. This is just a abracadabra application of the property of its.

632
01:20:23,898 --> 01:20:29,988
And then the explanation of why that is simply.

633
01:20:31,498 --> 01:20:40,898
This guy made it zero plus being a one time exile. Right.

634
01:20:41,108 --> 01:20:49,388
And then we can actually separate this to us. So we combine a zero with this guy and that's been a zero times this guy.

635
01:20:49,628 --> 01:21:01,748
And then we combine we have one line with this line that's been a one times this guy, but we knew we had sort of a sub into this.

636
01:21:02,078 --> 01:21:15,008
We separate the sub. So that we have a sum here.

637
01:21:17,698 --> 01:21:27,588
In the summers. Okay.

638
01:21:28,098 --> 01:21:35,178
And then we realized that, you know, for this first son, this is exactly equal to zero.

639
01:21:36,108 --> 01:21:39,318
This is exactly equal to zero. This is equal to zero.

640
01:21:39,618 --> 01:21:49,308
Well, the reason is that now the sum of x i let's just end on sex far and the sum of x bar.

641
01:21:49,308 --> 01:21:53,868
That's again this end times x1. So the difference is equal to zero.

642
01:21:56,148 --> 01:22:00,758
So this is equal to zero. So this term disappears.

643
01:22:01,418 --> 01:22:08,038
And then the second term, we realize that it's just s s x.

644
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:15,528
This is the somewhat square on the S. This is based on here.

645
01:22:16,068 --> 01:22:26,298
Previously we had this this sort on the table exercise as well as s x.

646
01:22:26,898 --> 01:22:31,758
We have two ways of expressing it. So that means this and this.

647
01:22:32,188 --> 01:22:39,688
They are people. So here we are, just making use of that fact.

648
01:22:42,698 --> 01:22:48,458
So this is equal to ssx then that actually then this guy and this guy the castle.

649
01:22:49,448 --> 01:23:06,107
So what is left is beta one. Okay.

650
01:23:06,108 --> 01:23:11,898
So that is the calculation. Then that means we show that exponential beta one hand is equal to beta.

651
01:23:12,198 --> 01:23:16,668
So then what happens is, as major one, there's no bias.

652
01:23:21,288 --> 01:23:25,248
Are we okay with a calculation? Any questions about the calculation?

653
01:23:27,898 --> 01:23:35,318
Well, what's the difference between the expectation of white and the expectation of white given X?

654
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:41,958
Now, are there the same value? No, they're they're not the same.

655
01:23:42,008 --> 01:23:46,428
So these values are why it is very little white, given that these are not the same.

656
01:23:46,448 --> 01:23:49,668
So this is sort of the. Martin about value.

657
01:23:49,718 --> 01:23:53,978
This is coming to light. So this expectation will depend on which acts you are looking at.

658
01:23:54,788 --> 01:23:59,228
You can add so you go to a small X, for example, a x is equal to H.

659
01:23:59,658 --> 01:24:07,538
You're looking at 18 to 30, for example. And it's all about and that's that's the exciting value of Y for people age 30.

660
01:24:08,648 --> 01:24:12,818
But this one, this is just things that are y.

661
01:24:13,118 --> 01:24:20,078
This means that, a, you are looking at the whole population dollar matter, which way you're looking at of people who h.

662
01:24:20,738 --> 01:24:25,748
The people here are people of all different age.

663
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:31,808
And you are looking at how is an average. So it does not depend on age anymore.

664
01:24:41,738 --> 01:24:55,298
Any other questions? Okay.

665
01:24:55,568 --> 01:25:03,188
So that is. So again, I mean, if you look at the calculation here, if I mean, there is something that you didn't follow.

666
01:25:03,248 --> 01:25:06,517
Exactly. That is that is that is.

667
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:11,888
Okay. So if you look at the whole calculation, here is, again, some just some algebra.

668
01:25:12,188 --> 01:25:22,028
If you look at what we apply it just on the property of expectation, expectation that some measure is equal to as an explanation and then some.

669
01:25:25,068 --> 01:25:31,638
In a some some facts we actually found we actually worried about the first half of today's lecture.

670
01:25:32,238 --> 01:25:34,728
So but in the end, the main point.

671
01:25:34,758 --> 01:25:44,928
Now keep in mind, one of the main point is the main point is that we have shown the expansion of one one half is equal to the phenomenon.

672
01:25:46,128 --> 01:25:51,678
So this means that there is no bias in using a one hand estimate beta one.

673
01:25:57,148 --> 01:26:03,988
And the next we are going to show that exponential beta zero that is 000.

674
01:26:07,128 --> 01:26:15,918
Okay. So three zero that we have calculated it is this guy.

675
01:26:17,718 --> 01:26:28,877
And this is again based on not our calculation before is equal to this and then yeah, we are using that the property of the examination.

676
01:26:28,878 --> 01:26:33,437
So the examination of that with different terms is equal to these values are y

677
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:39,738
bar minus the expression of the signature that is beta one half times x mark.

678
01:26:46,058 --> 01:26:48,488
He's not even a wine bar or wine bar is the symbol.

679
01:26:48,488 --> 01:26:55,898
Average restaurant, of course, is equal to the symbol average of the piece that agency earnings managers.

680
01:26:57,418 --> 01:27:01,138
Again, this is the property of explosions that equals any outbreak.

681
01:27:02,308 --> 01:27:08,248
And remind us the same reason why what had pumps tanks, car.

682
01:27:12,998 --> 01:27:16,638
And then here. Okay, now we have the explanation why.

683
01:27:16,838 --> 01:27:26,078
But what we know is actually why is equal to why I is simply equal to this.

684
01:27:33,458 --> 01:27:39,668
The miners. Okay. So this side of the examination about X bar, this is a constant.

685
01:27:40,978 --> 01:27:44,078
And so we can move this constant out of the examination.

686
01:27:44,078 --> 01:27:45,718
So that's this X bar here.

687
01:27:46,748 --> 01:27:59,977
So, so we I was not going to write this as X Bar Times examination on beta one hat, but we know that to expand these are beta one.

688
01:27:59,978 --> 01:28:10,428
How do we just calculated it's actually beta one? Is equal to zero.

689
01:28:11,228 --> 01:28:15,068
And then here, this is Asian.

690
01:28:15,458 --> 01:28:21,198
This thing is not any here. So we know that it is valuation of absolute high that is equal to zero.

691
01:28:21,228 --> 01:28:26,258
That's based on our assumption. Maybe assume that some things about agency zero.

692
01:28:26,708 --> 01:28:36,378
That's our model assumption. So what is left now? This is valuation is simply these valuation on this which is itself because.

693
01:28:36,758 --> 01:28:46,878
Because this is a constant. This is a number. His eagerness to see the miners this beta one x bar.

694
01:28:53,178 --> 01:29:01,788
And then here, if you look at this, this is the central average, north central average of below zero, of course, is below zero to south.

695
01:29:02,418 --> 01:29:05,778
Now, the simple average is like this.

696
01:29:06,828 --> 01:29:11,178
So this whole thing is equal to beta zero plus beta one.

697
01:29:11,598 --> 01:29:15,318
X bar beta one times the symbol of x.

698
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:23,088
And then this guy will counsel.

699
01:29:27,788 --> 01:29:44,148
So what is left is just this behind you. And this. Just in previous proofed or beta one.

700
01:29:44,988 --> 01:29:51,588
Do you also need the assumption that the expected value of the epsilon ise are zero?

701
01:29:52,458 --> 01:29:56,388
Even though we cannot write, I think we directly put the expected value of y.

702
01:29:56,388 --> 01:29:59,568
I was. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah.

703
01:29:59,568 --> 01:30:04,427
That's a very good question. Yeah. So we didn't see that explicitly but yeah, very good point.

704
01:30:04,428 --> 01:30:10,308
So yeah. So when we move from here to here, we also use that fact, right?

705
01:30:10,368 --> 01:30:18,198
So because I'm here, there's a symbol because y I equal to zero zero plus beta one.

706
01:30:19,038 --> 01:30:28,038
I was absolutely right. And then we, when we take these foundation things mandatorily, zero zero becomes less.

707
01:30:42,138 --> 01:30:55,578
Okay. Any other questions? This competition. Okay.

708
01:30:55,588 --> 01:31:04,858
So this actually again, that's I mean, again, if you if you didn't follow exactly the calculation here that that is okay.

709
01:31:05,068 --> 01:31:10,738
So if you spend 5 minutes of the lecture, you will definitely figure out the all the detailed calculation.

710
01:31:11,068 --> 01:31:16,258
But the main one is that the expansion of beta zero is equal to zero.

711
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:20,488
So this shows that beta zero is also unbiased.

712
01:31:20,488 --> 01:31:26,458
As matter of beta zero. There is no bias in estimating beta zero using betas or a hat.

713
01:31:29,888 --> 01:31:34,018
Okay. So this now we have shown two effects.

714
01:31:34,088 --> 01:31:39,008
One is that, well, what is that, a beta zero that is above that is made up of beta zero.

715
01:31:39,158 --> 01:31:42,338
Otherwise, beta one had his unbiased estimate of one.

716
01:31:43,208 --> 01:31:46,988
But we would also like to see the variation in both.

717
01:31:46,988 --> 01:31:51,968
As majors, I would like to see what are appearances are for both now.

718
01:31:52,418 --> 01:31:57,008
That's what we're going to do next. So in our vocabulary the.

719
01:31:58,058 --> 01:32:06,218
Now again here we need to get a summary fashion memory of the properties of a virus function.

720
01:32:07,628 --> 01:32:17,857
So the virus of constant times Y is equal to the square and the constant times the virus Y and also the covariance.

721
01:32:17,858 --> 01:32:26,858
If you multiply a constant of of one component that this causes can be moved out of covariance.

722
01:32:28,988 --> 01:32:38,288
And also the careers of, you know, if you have your have linear combination, that it will be equal to the son and his two clearances.

723
01:32:39,788 --> 01:32:47,198
And again, if you have variance of this linear combination of a bunch of really variable one line,

724
01:32:47,798 --> 01:32:56,828
then it's actually equal to, you know, double sun, double sun times eight times the covariance.

725
01:32:59,518 --> 01:33:05,198
Between any pairs of what I am watching. Right.

726
01:33:05,318 --> 01:33:12,127
And in particular, if you look at just our just two search terms, a111, a21,

727
01:33:12,128 --> 01:33:20,458
two, one, we have the variance of a1y1 that is this guy and the is of a2y true.

728
01:33:20,468 --> 01:33:26,588
That is this guy. And then Korea is a1a2 times the virus.

729
01:33:26,968 --> 01:33:30,978
And and also we have two terms. So last question.

730
01:33:31,118 --> 01:33:37,788
Right. When you separate a square, you have a cross term. So we have two points in one coherence.

731
01:33:38,588 --> 01:33:43,148
And these are some properties of the on this covariance function.

732
01:33:44,588 --> 01:33:48,898
And when the eyes are uncorrelated, that means the covariance.

733
01:33:48,908 --> 01:33:52,508
If the covariance is equal to zero, that means there is no coherence anymore.

734
01:33:54,218 --> 01:34:04,388
Or in this case, while there is no covariance here anymore, then what is left is just a variance of the linear combination is equal to the sun.

735
01:34:05,088 --> 01:34:10,028
And here we have a five squared on each of the Arabs.

736
01:34:12,578 --> 01:34:16,808
And these are some of the some properties of the variance function.

737
01:34:18,038 --> 01:34:21,337
I mean, unfortunately, we do not have time to, you know,

738
01:34:21,338 --> 01:34:28,888
to show like each property you might think that you will you're going to see this in more detail than 601 which,

739
01:34:29,008 --> 01:34:38,588
which is repeating itself in six or one parking lot more about different of properties of variance, mountain coherence function in the foundations.

740
01:34:39,338 --> 01:34:43,148
And here we are just, just using this property.

741
01:34:44,008 --> 01:34:51,958
So. So now let's calculate the variance of the based on what happened.

742
01:34:54,218 --> 01:35:04,748
The variance of beta one that have the calculation is in just like the calculation of the for the expansion is algebra.

743
01:35:05,918 --> 01:35:12,758
Well application of the properties of the variance. So we calculate the various of beta one hat.

744
01:35:13,298 --> 01:35:17,678
Now recall that beta one hat is again given by this guy.

745
01:35:19,348 --> 01:35:23,278
This is what we derived. That is what happened.

746
01:35:24,838 --> 01:35:28,768
And again, recall that this s s x.

747
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:37,048
This only depends on x sum of squares of x only that I asked and answer is fixed so we can move it outside of the.

748
01:35:37,738 --> 01:35:44,067
Yeah. But when we move it outside of areas we have to square it and that's the property of the virus.

749
01:35:44,068 --> 01:35:47,098
So that's why here we have this square of it.

750
01:35:52,298 --> 01:36:03,078
We have the square at times the size. And again, recall that this s s x y.

751
01:36:03,138 --> 01:36:07,688
This is simply this. Listen here.

752
01:36:10,128 --> 01:36:23,607
And that's that's what. S s. S. X y. S. And then of now again, here we apply the property of the Americans.

753
01:36:23,608 --> 01:36:33,868
Right. This is you're going to consider this to be linear, a combination of this Y by treating this API, by treating this as the weight.

754
01:36:34,318 --> 01:36:39,868
This is constant. This these are not these are constants. So these are combinations of Y.

755
01:36:39,988 --> 01:36:48,118
Then you have the areas of the sun. There is a linear combination of yeah, if you apply the property of variance,

756
01:36:48,448 --> 01:36:55,378
you have the sum of a square of this constant times, the variance of each term.

757
01:36:56,428 --> 01:37:01,108
Now the Cuba has disappeared because we assumed these were high as they are uncorrelated.

758
01:37:01,318 --> 01:37:05,338
That's our modern assumption. We assume they absolutely are uncorrelated.

759
01:37:06,598 --> 01:37:10,988
So about work rates. So the maintenance term, they are uncorrelated solar.

760
01:37:11,308 --> 01:37:27,048
So the Y is should also be equilibrium. And then the variance of Y again by definition goes by assumption, right?

761
01:37:27,058 --> 01:37:43,708
That's that's the variance of abs. There is an absolute that is Sigma Square and then the sum of this guy, this is just ss x.

762
01:37:45,058 --> 01:37:51,238
So this s x will cancel with one s as x here.

763
01:37:51,568 --> 01:37:56,218
So what is left is just one. There is still one more x.

764
01:37:59,468 --> 01:38:02,918
There's this guy.

765
01:38:07,298 --> 01:38:11,878
And this shows that, you know, the virus of beta one had its equal treatment.

766
01:38:14,158 --> 01:38:27,348
So. So this shows what are the various is for for Peter what happened.

767
01:38:31,528 --> 01:38:34,618
So any questions here for this combination?

768
01:38:41,058 --> 01:38:45,828
Well, all right. So we are almost out of time.

769
01:38:45,838 --> 01:38:49,308
So I think we will we probably won't be able to finish in the next couple of days.

770
01:38:49,388 --> 01:38:53,788
And so we've got to get from here to here.

771
01:38:54,088 --> 01:39:00,628
But now you are welcome to a lecture whether you guys can spend ten or 15 minutes before you go work out.

772
01:39:02,228 --> 01:39:13,268
My life is quite a stream always has been boosted and this memory is due on next year.

773
01:39:16,268 --> 01:39:16,458
You.
