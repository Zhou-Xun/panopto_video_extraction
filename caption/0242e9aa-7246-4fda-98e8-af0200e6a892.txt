1
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:42,580
But you. But we're.

2
00:00:51,880 --> 00:01:41,210
Know. It was.

3
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:25,770
Right now. Oh.

4
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:45,780
From each my backpack. Good morning.

5
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:53,330
How's everybody doing today? Doing all right?

6
00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:04,590
Good. All right. All right. I would like to formally apologize to the person whose spot I took this morning at the meter.

7
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,860
I have a blue pass and could not find a blue spot, and so I had to take a meter spot.

8
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,630
So please forgive me. Whoever ended up looking for a spot after 951.

9
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,710
For those who are near the campus parking sucks here. And this is the time of year where you just need to give up.

10
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:36,300
Tell somebody this on Tuesday. Just give up. Take the number for Park somewhere downtown.

11
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,890
Wash on one of the side streets. Go to a a lot.

12
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,730
A lot. To a lot more. To many A's.

13
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,820
Because parking is going to be horrible for especially once it starts to snow.

14
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:02,890
I think I want to take your spot. I apologize. I just had to take somebody spat at a meter.

15
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:08,680
I'm like, I won't. I will get here for class if I do not. So.

16
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:16,840
So that was my announcement for today. So start just parking very far away and give up.

17
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:23,799
Give up the ghost on that one. So today we're going to be talking about evaluation questions.

18
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:34,820
Yay, evaluation questions. And for those who are keeping track or who are comparing this to maybe a research methods class.

19
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:45,640
So in the past, you'll start noticing that, especially after this point, we're going to more and more resemble or research methods class.

20
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,910
So that's. You know, it will feel different.

21
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,700
We'll get, you know, continue to be technical. We'll get even more technical after fall break.

22
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:03,420
So, yeah, fall break, vacation, then technical.

23
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,530
So today what we're going to do. Oh, I forgot how long they've changed the agenda.

24
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,780
Lord have mercy. Sometimes I just light slides over.

25
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,950
I'm like. And I mean of them. We are not going to be talking about purpose statements again.

26
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,940
I'll do a review and then we'll talk about the evaluation questions.

27
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,079
So for the recording for Mr.

28
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,410
I'll just. The agenda is wrong.

29
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:42,880
So what we talked about on Tuesday, we talked about, one, the goal of step three, focusing the evaluation,

30
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:49,090
which is ultimately about identifying the purpose and the scope of the evaluation.

31
00:05:50,530 --> 00:06:00,010
And when we think about the purpose and put, you know, in thinking about what's encapsulated in that purpose statement,

32
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:10,540
we are developing that with consideration for information needs the stage of development of the program.

33
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,990
We're thinking about stakeholder audiences and vested party audiences.

34
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,280
It still does not feel smooth to me. I'm going to find another word.

35
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:29,389
And then equity. I was so excited about investor party as my director.

36
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,110
Like, I also work at Michigan Public Health Institute.

37
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,130
She's like, We're going to call it invested parties. That's what we're going to do instead of stakeholders.

38
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:43,490
I was like, Yeah, that's awesome. It just doesn't I don't know, I got to find something else anyway.

39
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:50,540
But purpose should be considered when you're developing.

40
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:56,720
Purpose should consider those parties and then finally considering equity.

41
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:06,110
And when you write your purpose statement, it should include information about which decision makers are being considered.

42
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:13,120
What information you will share with those decision makers and other audiences.

43
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:18,610
What decisions will be made from a broad, high level?

44
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,480
And then what program is being evaluated?

45
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:30,070
And I will say that when we're thinking about decisions, what decisions will be made?

46
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:42,900
It's okay to be broad with that. You don't have to be very super specific about, yes, we're going to make a decision about how this will be funded.

47
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:47,890
Using the CDC is line item, this grant, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

48
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:58,600
It is okay to say that the decisions will be around program improvement decisions about continuation of a program.

49
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,830
And these four bullet points, they really should be considered or included regardless of if the statement is one sentence or paragraph.

50
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:27,800
So the other big major part of this step is about is crafting evaluation questions and why do we need good questions?

51
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:33,080
So. First, let me state that questions.

52
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,400
These are not survey questions.

53
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,610
These are not interview protocol questions.

54
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:45,580
These are questions that are really about level of inquiry.

55
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:51,370
What what will we be learning from this evaluation process?

56
00:08:51,970 --> 00:09:00,200
One thing that I know this. When people are starting to write evaluation questions or even research questions in general

57
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:07,160
for the first time is that often time those questions are narrow because they are right.

58
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:14,960
People are writing them as if they are questions that you would carry right into an instrument.

59
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:21,440
That is not the case. Now, I will say that sometimes.

60
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:30,260
There's really no way to reword a question when it goes, especially when you're interviewing because you want to keep things open ended.

61
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:36,710
But the purpose of evaluation questions are not to translate directly into instruments.

62
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,570
They really meant to drive the learning and evaluation process.

63
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:49,680
So why are they important? Because they serve as the foundation for a successful evaluation.

64
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:56,030
They helped define and shape what data we are going to need to collect.

65
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,910
They have implications for sample size.

66
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:16,290
So when we get into sampling, you will see that your decisions about sampling will often connect directly to who's being sample and how many people,

67
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,710
generally speaking, that you would sample.

68
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:28,530
It also guides the development of the research design and then determines the type of data analysis that you will need.

69
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:34,890
Will the questions themselves explicitly reflect those things?

70
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:46,440
No. But good evaluation questions should should serve as a basis or foundation for being able to make those determinations about data analysis.

71
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,450
Whether you choose ultimately, for example,

72
00:10:51,450 --> 00:11:04,050
to run a regression analysis on your quant data or you choose to engage in more of a grounded theory and that type analysis of your qualitative data,

73
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:11,370
your evaluation questions should point the direction toward those decisions.

74
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:30,120
Your evaluation questions. If you're thinking about where to start, one place you can't think about is,

75
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,850
or even if you're assessing, is this an appropriate value evaluation question?

76
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:41,760
They should be connected in some way to determinations of merit worth, its significance.

77
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:50,250
Remember, our valuation work ultimately is about taking action.

78
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,850
So at the end of a process, we're taking action.

79
00:11:54,210 --> 00:12:03,330
And so merit determinations of merit worth as significance help direct us into understanding what types of actions we might take.

80
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,590
So just a reminder, when we talk about merit, we talk about.

81
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,120
And I've actually have if you know this, I have two bullet points for each term.

82
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:24,890
I pulled the definitions from the evaluation questions checklist as well, which I think.

83
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:30,680
If kind of the differences between these three terms aren't working for you.

84
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,410
I felt like these definitions are also helpful in kind of, you know,

85
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:43,220
being more explicit about what merit worth and significance are and how they differ.

86
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,520
Some merit we're talking about absolute or relative quality of something.

87
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:57,410
Another way of putting it excellence of an object as assessed by its intrinsic qualities or performance.

88
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:10,580
When we talk about Worth, we're talking about the value of the thing or the value of an object and the relationship to its needs or identify purposes.

89
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:20,239
And then significance, as we talked about before, is really about that value or meaning ascribed to the value.

90
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,900
And again, which is our fancy word of our fancy way of saying the thing that's being evaluated.

91
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:37,580
And so that meaning. I really like the way that this has put that significance.

92
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:44,780
That meaning is about the potential influence or importance and visibility of, in this case, the program.

93
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:59,070
So here are some examples and again question and then you can see how one could take action based on

94
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:06,570
the response or the answer or conclusion of the of the evaluation and the answer to the question.

95
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:13,500
So if we're thinking about merit, we might ask something like how well this program,

96
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:20,730
A's theory of Change align with the mechanisms of change articulated by program beneficiaries.

97
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,460
So we could take action by revisiting the theory of change.

98
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:37,469
So we find, for example, that program beneficiaries or participants have stated that, no,

99
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:49,740
this is really how change happens when it comes to decreasing our engagement and risky risk sexual risk behavior.

100
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:58,890
So that tells us. Well. Among other things, maybe we need to revisit the theory of change.

101
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,680
Another consideration worth,

102
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:13,030
I might ask a question To what extent does the edit component of program C improve service delivery for program beneficiaries?

103
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:20,500
So again, I'm thinking about the program and I'm looking at this additional element that we may have added over time.

104
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,720
So we find that the added component is super awesome.

105
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:36,100
And it really does improve service delivery. So we could take action by making the added component part of standard practice.

106
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:48,950
And then finally, if we were writing a question, what consideration for significance again, that potential influence in our visibility and importance?

107
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:56,570
To what extent does program E address the most significant needs in W County?

108
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,529
I just realized I put w Connie and I wasn't even thinking.

109
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:05,970
I just put a letter w it's funny how the brain works, but Washtenaw County.

110
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:13,830
Look at that, huh? We could take action by revisiting program structure if we need to.

111
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:27,600
So note that the questions are crafted so that the stakeholders can take action, whether it's implementing program changes or adding services.

112
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:33,730
So we want to think about when we're writing and starting to brainstorm questions.

113
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:41,200
Could somebody take action in one way or another in relationship to the program?

114
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:50,700
And even if the action and I should note that even if that action is keeping things as they stand, that is an action,

115
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:57,540
because that's a proactive decision that you've decided that the program, as it is, is working well.

116
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,090
So that counts as taking action.

117
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:13,510
We can also think about good evaluation questions in terms of some general characteristics, and we'll talk a little bit about those.

118
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,920
Next, we want our questions to be specific.

119
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:23,610
We want them to be relevant and we want them to be answerable.

120
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,750
So starting with specific. So here's the question.

121
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:41,320
Did our program work? Well.

122
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,790
It's a question. But what issues might this present?

123
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:54,240
In this case, what does work mean? We really don't know what we're talking about when we say work.

124
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,720
Are we talking about does a program work for participants?

125
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:05,070
Are we saying that the theory of change works? Are we saying that the way we implement the activity is work?

126
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:14,190
So for an evaluator, that's really not specific enough for us to truly measure if something worked and.

127
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:23,200
I will say that when we're talking with stakeholders, that this question is not an uncommon question to come up.

128
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:28,239
When you say, okay, so what is it you want to learn about your program?

129
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:34,420
What do you hope to learn at the end? They might say, we just want to know, does the program work?

130
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:43,360
As an evaluator? We again, using facilitation skills and facilitation skills,

131
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:51,790
we help guide our stakeholders into identifying what do they really mean by work and help them.

132
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,930
What we say in the humanities came from the humanities as well.

133
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:01,900
In women's studies. We like to unpack things, unpack the word work.

134
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:08,680
So what are we? What do you mean by that? So sometimes this is our starting point, right?

135
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:16,540
And then we have to work hard to dig out what they mean specifically and what relationships,

136
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,770
what mechanisms that they're really interested or prioritizing.

137
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:29,500
Your evaluation questions should also be relevant and that they'll provide information that people need.

138
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:38,380
So you're going to find, especially if this is your first time doing this, now, you can come up with all kinds.

139
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,910
You may be able to come up with all kinds of questions.

140
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:53,700
You know about especially wants to see this in the next section of this, the lecture, but really not every aspect of a program must be evaluated.

141
00:19:54,130 --> 00:20:03,640
Now, remember, on Tuesday I talked about information needs telling you not only what you know, but what the gaps are.

142
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,490
So sometimes it's it's a ten, you know,

143
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:13,540
we might come up with questions that we might already have the answer to that would make that question that relevant.

144
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:21,489
Or we might come up with a really exciting question that would address or

145
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:30,460
speak to some research that we read about recently in APJ or another journal.

146
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:41,650
But again, if the stakeholders don't need it, if those who are in some way otherwise connected with the evaluation don't need that answer,

147
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,280
it's really best to not waste the resources.

148
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:53,210
They're better used elsewhere. So here's an example.

149
00:20:53,930 --> 00:21:02,329
So a school board, you're working with them. They want to know whether the newly implemented active shooter drills that are being conducted

150
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:08,300
in their district make students feel safe or less safe at school or safer or less safe.

151
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,870
So here's a really interesting specific evaluation question.

152
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:20,410
To what extent are teachers in forcing students to participate in the active shooter drills?

153
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:28,660
The question is specific and it is answerable, as you'll see, and then the next characteristic.

154
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,490
But that's not what they want to know.

155
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:38,680
The school board wants to know, does it make students feel safer or less safe at school?

156
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:45,440
So this question is not relevant. So you can report, you will revise accordingly.

157
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:51,830
To what extent are the act of students? Do the drills helping students feel safer in school?

158
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,080
I'm also going to give you, like, my super awesome hint.

159
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:12,720
So recording, make sure. Pay attention. I love in you know this is I love to start evaluation questions to what extent.

160
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,930
Why? Because it's not a yes or no question. It's never a yes or no question.

161
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:25,760
It's always to what degree? So that's just some free hints for you.

162
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:32,389
But it also forces you to open up to the potential that there are ways that it

163
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:37,340
does help feel safer in ways that components don't help students feel safer.

164
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:46,530
So it's not just a it's just not just a freebie. It's it's because it also forces you to start thinking about different aspects of the

165
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:53,370
program and which ones are actually functioning to achieve the outcomes that you're seeking.

166
00:22:54,350 --> 00:23:01,500
Or any positive outcomes for that matter. Finally, you want a question?

167
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:12,240
It should have the characteristic of being answerable. It's answerable if it if it is asked in a way that can be evaluated.

168
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:21,310
And what we mean by that is that the resources to answer the question are available or feasible to obtain.

169
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,850
And remember that feasibility is not just in terms of finances.

170
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:33,750
Excuse me. A.

171
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,100
And you think you are going to be? I didn't think I wanted to hear me like cough into the microphone.

172
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:51,560
When we say feasibility, it's not just in terms of finances and it's not just in time, terms of tangible resources like people.

173
00:23:52,070 --> 00:24:06,890
It's also intangible resources. If I ask an evaluation question that maybe is going to get a lot of resistance in terms of me being able to answer it.

174
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:17,270
I might reconsider that question. So for example, if I ask a question,

175
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:30,950
I've given this example before about use engagement gauge and sexual behavior and a super conservative district or city and.

176
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:36,830
I'm less I'm less concerned about the answer I'm going to get.

177
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:48,940
But if I'm not going to get youth. To be able to answer that question honestly or it's going to it's going to affect my access to students.

178
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,510
I have to decide and I have to weigh my options.

179
00:24:53,170 --> 00:25:02,160
Is. Because again, in the spirit of equity and cultural responsiveness, we want to try and challenge these issues.

180
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:09,270
But at times we also have to decide, is it really worth the fight?

181
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:13,970
And so sometimes we have to think about that in terms of our questions.

182
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:21,360
I think that's kind of, you know, because evaluation is political.

183
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:25,620
I think that's one way that makes us stick out from, again, scholarly research.

184
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,570
So but in terms of.

185
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:41,600
Technical aspects. You also want to consider will you have the resources or opportunity to be able to answer a question that will.

186
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,550
Allow you the research design to be able to do it.

187
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:56,330
So in the example I have on the slide, if I ask if a program produced better outcomes for participants and non participants,

188
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,340
but I can't get access to non-participants.

189
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,320
It's really not an answerable question.

190
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:17,129
So some things that you again will have to think about is even as you're crafting these questions, you're thinking ahead what they're,

191
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:25,440
for example, B, access to a control or a comparison group for me that do either an experimental or quasi experimental design.

192
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,319
So in some ways, you're, you're writing the questions,

193
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:39,450
but you're also less you accounting for aspects of research design that you know you need to have in order to answer them.

194
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:50,250
So we do want our questions to be specific.

195
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:54,420
We want them to be our. Relevant.

196
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:59,820
We want them to be answerable. We want them to consider merit worth of significance.

197
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:06,130
So where do we start from there? Because that is very abstract in many ways.

198
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,790
How can we start crafting evaluation questions?

199
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:21,370
The reading you have for today is a lovely example where you can start, which is the logic model, especially if you're brainstorming.

200
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,820
So today, what will for the rest of the time,

201
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:33,130
we'll go through a logic model and discuss some ways and some questions that you can pull out of the logic model.

202
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:40,900
So I just want to kind of give you a primer on the logic model that we'll be using for the example.

203
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:52,090
So for this program. It was a program with youth in Buffalo County, Wisconsin.

204
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:57,860
They use Web two technologies. I think we're on Web point three, 3.0.

205
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:03,100
Now, I don't know, but they're using Web 2.0 technologies.

206
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,220
But let's safe online decision making skills.

207
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:15,880
And because of a generation gap, it really inhibits effective involvement of adults in fostering safe technology practice.

208
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:21,159
Those in the audience who have kids will probably understand what that feels

209
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:26,350
like when your kids are talking about all these technologies in your life.

210
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:34,299
And I was just talking about recent studies related to physical and verbal bullying indicate that the

211
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:40,180
principles of citizenship needed to be or need to be applied in both the physical and cyber worlds.

212
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:45,210
So here's our situation. Slash our problem. In our context.

213
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,070
So in response. Extension.

214
00:28:54,630 --> 00:29:00,290
Just if you aren't familiar with the extension programs from land grant universities.

215
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,380
I love extension. I have no reason for promoting them.

216
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:11,760
I have no skin in the game, but I just love extension programs, even though ours is at Michigan State.

217
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:17,910
It's okay. I love them, but extension is.

218
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,390
They develop a program that has different goals.

219
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,820
Fostering a culture of safe technology. Use of or technology use among youth.

220
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:34,380
Eliminating the generation gap in technology safety, and decreasing cyber bullying among youth.

221
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,220
So again, just know this. I just, you know, observe.

222
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:45,540
There's been this. A encapsulation or summary of what's going on the problem.

223
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:53,660
The situation, the context, some of the issues that are driving the problem.

224
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:59,230
And then note how the goals address those factors.

225
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,890
Fostering a culture. Culture of safe technology use.

226
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:08,210
Getting rid of the generation gap. And decreasing cyber bullying.

227
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:17,370
No, no, no. This is a continuity. And just know that, especially when we grave, I look for continuity and thought.

228
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:28,630
So how will we use logic models? We're writing both for for this course.

229
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:34,730
We're going to focus on process evaluation questions and outcome evaluation questions.

230
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:43,010
You can also identify economic evaluation questions as well, but we won't cover it in the class.

231
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:55,100
So starting with process evaluation questions, those are generally going to fall with our inputs, our activities and our outputs.

232
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:07,770
So we can ask questions like. Were there enough resources from the beginning to implement the Internet safety program will?

233
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:14,670
So that is, you know, we're pulling that from the resources we see in the inputs.

234
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:23,550
So if I were designing this, I already know I can look at different resources, staff time.

235
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,150
Research. Yeah, maybe.

236
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:32,900
You know, I might look at that. Technologies.

237
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:37,640
So I might look at what is likely to be a major part.

238
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:46,580
Of the resources needed to implement the program, equipment and then space.

239
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,720
Maybe not in the case of this intervention, but sometimes space plays a huge part.

240
00:31:53,950 --> 00:32:01,630
Another question I might ask To what extent did staff have adequate support to implement the Internet safety program?

241
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:07,480
So I can ask questions like the first one is focused all on all the resources.

242
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,690
But then the second question, only staff time.

243
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:18,640
And then I might ask a question like What challenges did extension face in obtaining the necessary resources?

244
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:29,300
So it's not a question specifically about the program's implementation, but those resources are needed to implement.

245
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,920
So that is a perfectly valid process question. Could I get access to things?

246
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:42,730
Could the extension staff get access to things, especially when we're thinking about issues of replication?

247
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,450
When we look at the activities column, we can ask questions such as did the.

248
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:04,530
Oh, sorry. I thought I lot you the question. Oh, you're cool.

249
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:10,590
Did the Internet safety program activities happen in the order they were expected to?

250
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:18,870
So say, for example, they had a particular way of implementing that they felt would.

251
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:25,270
That was important to the mechanisms of change. You know, for example,

252
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:36,110
maybe they felt that introducing the parents and addressing the generation gap was the the priority and drove the rest of the change in the rest of.

253
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:46,000
Drove the change in the program. So I might ask, did the activities happen in the order they were expected to?

254
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:50,680
You might also ask a question like this when it has a formal curriculum.

255
00:33:50,890 --> 00:34:03,560
Curriculum. And so for many of you, that might be the case where the lessons were already designed to build on one another.

256
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:11,710
You might ask. To what extent were the Internet safety program activities implemented at Fidelity?

257
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:18,350
Fidelity is a fancy way of saying. The way that the way they were written.

258
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:29,860
Um. Part of the reason I got into this field in the first place is because in doing sexual health education work,

259
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:37,810
I thought it was fascinating the way that my colleagues would take a CDC funded curriculum and change it around.

260
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:42,860
And I thought, well, that's interesting. It's written this way.

261
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:51,749
Why are they doing it? So a question like this doesn't have to be a judgment low that answer.

262
00:34:51,750 --> 00:35:02,580
Right. If they you know you might find that in the adaptation, they were responding to some of the needs in that particular community.

263
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:12,190
Then you might also ask a question How well did the different Internet safety program activities build on each other?

264
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:24,279
Again, if you are looking at a curriculum or maybe you are even thinking about writing a curriculum after this initial implementation,

265
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:30,040
which is the case for pilot studies, often this is an appropriate question.

266
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:44,700
And then finally process evaluation questions can center on outputs.

267
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:54,480
One thing that I have seen and observed is that when you're first doing this, people might write questions like.

268
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:02,550
Actually let me reset. How many?

269
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:07,760
Parents. Attended.

270
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:14,000
The blank blankety blank events.

271
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:24,920
It is a question. But think about, again, merit worth the significance.

272
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:33,460
And ask yourself, does this question help or help my stakeholders take action?

273
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:42,290
Not really. It just tells them something that they're documenting for a modern monitoring purpose.

274
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,070
So you want to stay away, especially with this output section.

275
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:53,480
You want to stay away from questions that are essentially just counting because, again, they don't necessarily really add value.

276
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:58,460
And not only do they not add value, they're going to be answered.

277
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:09,110
In the context of another question. So even this first question right here, the participants or their parents participated or too M.P. words,

278
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:15,590
did parents participate in the Internet safety education events as intended?

279
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:23,210
So part of answering that question is. How many parents attended the events.

280
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:28,910
But then there's another aspect of the question how many were supposed to.

281
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,389
Not a not a real evaluation question, just the argument.

282
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:47,390
I'm building an argument about why what why I would ask this question versus other ones.

283
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,880
Because then I have that. And then I have to ask.

284
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,520
And I have to answer why is there a difference?

285
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:09,860
And you know, this spell different. Yeah. Not a spell. So that's the value.

286
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:16,190
That's the value of the question. I want to know why there's a difference versus how many attended it and didn't attend.

287
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:28,500
Don't don't have them because ultimately because they're just they're counting.

288
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:34,290
And you're going to end up and you're going to end up answering it anyway because you have to you

289
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:41,640
have to answer that question in order to answer this more value added question of the participants.

290
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:48,320
Do it as intended. So does that make sense?

291
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:58,020
Like you're thinking like, you know, if you look at the question and you realize that it's probably encompassed into another

292
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:05,190
question that's more complex and more of a value and there's more ability to take action.

293
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:12,130
Well, go with that other question. So nasty for the number.

294
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:21,280
Precautions. Parents. And you might want to give.

295
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,930
Yeah. Yeah. Like. The question.

296
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:41,160
Would it be valuable to ask a question like that? Yeah.

297
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:48,630
You could ask a question like that as long as that proportion is meaningful.

298
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:59,310
Now, like I say, for example, you're try especially if you're trying to make change or elicit change in a population at a population level,

299
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:06,720
proportion is going to be is going to be part of kind of the mathematics, if you will, of.

300
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,860
Determining if you can make a population level impact.

301
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:18,160
So it's important to kind of think about where you're going if you ask a question like that.

302
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,180
Because ultimately it's like, well, okay, it isn't useful for me.

303
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:31,200
It isn't useful for the stakeholders to take action. So I might be concerned about, okay, I mean, a greater proportion.

304
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:36,030
I need to reach a greater proportion of parents in this community.

305
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:40,640
For this culture change, for example, to take place.

306
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:46,470
Or culture change. Right?

307
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:55,980
Yeah. So you just have to think through. You have to think through kind of the implications of the answers and how they relate to.

308
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:06,550
The program's goals. But I will say generally just counting is not going to be a good question, but counting.

309
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:12,219
But what you're saying is a proportion of not just counting that's looking at your

310
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:18,970
numerator and denominator and determining whether or not that's a valuable proportion.

311
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,100
Another question that you might ask with the outputs. Good question.

312
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:32,660
To what extent that the ISAF trainings reach youth?

313
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:43,370
Again, you're going to end up for one at needing to know to answer this question, how many youth attended the trainings?

314
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:53,100
But then. You're also going to think about, okay, why did we reach you at this level?

315
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:59,670
So the question, the answer, it's not just about the number.

316
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:07,800
To what extent that the trainings reach youth. It's not just, well, we try that, you know, we intervene with ten youth.

317
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:15,570
The answer is we treated work or worked with youth because of these reasons.

318
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:22,170
And we want it to. You know, work with 20 of you.

319
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:31,270
But here were some of the challenges. And then actually speaking to what I'm saying right now.

320
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:40,150
Accompanying question What external factors influence the number or type of program participants?

321
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:53,230
So let me ask you what might be an example of an output based question that you could also ask?

322
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,220
I've already spoken to youth and I've spoken to parents.

323
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:03,220
Well, might be. Does anybody have an example of another output based question that they might ask?

324
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,960
I do the drum roll. See who's useful and brave today.

325
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:24,640
Those fell in. Like, what's her name? Sarah Barrow. I'm an army. Be brave.

326
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:28,750
All right. We got one cop. Liar. Okay, go ahead.

327
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:34,389
I'll mess with you. I'm sorry. I'm a troll. My father, troll two.

328
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:39,980
We're all trolls in our house. I love you. Where you ask.

329
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:44,280
You're just putting your hand up. I'm so sorry.

330
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:50,090
See? She's like, Ma'am. All right.

331
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:10,830
Yeah, it was. The.

332
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:15,890
How might you phrase that as a question? Let's let's take it let's take it a little.

333
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:31,350
Hmm. Well.

334
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:38,530
You. All of.

335
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,130
A kind of you know what if let's.

336
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:52,240
So she she said, what role did teachers play? I just had to write that as a note, so.

337
00:44:53,560 --> 00:45:00,430
So what role? Do teachers.

338
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:07,120
Clay. Let's say, teacher. What role do teachers play?

339
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:11,870
And we. And forcing.

340
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:24,340
Material. Covered in the I safe.

341
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:31,200
Training. Now.

342
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:38,440
That's a question I might ask. That's an interesting question.

343
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:42,470
I might ask it if I know that teachers are important.

344
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:49,910
Kind of peripherally like there. And, you know, they're an important part of the context of the of the program.

345
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:55,280
So you could ask something like that. You could ask.

346
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,710
If teachers are seeing changes. You could also ask something like.

347
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:13,060
To what extent and tell me and to what extent.

348
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:18,059
Sorry. I can't. You can't. All right. Thank you for.

349
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:23,210
Let me know. Let me. I try to put it right here.

350
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,530
Thank you. To what extent?

351
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:36,310
Do. Teachers.

352
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:46,340
Facilitate access. Two.

353
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:55,239
I save training. And again, this is you know,

354
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:59,649
this is something you might ask if you know that in the context of the program that

355
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:05,950
often the youth are doing the trainings in school or maybe they have to be excused.

356
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:11,830
I've done evaluations where students had to be excused from their classrooms in order to participate.

357
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:20,470
So even though they're not the ones implementing the program, they are part of the external factors.

358
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:25,150
So I might want to get very specific. So it's just kind of a it's a carry on.

359
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:28,440
Yes. So I.

360
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:45,170
Support played a role. Well, especially if you think like, you know, that that's going to drive.

361
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:48,880
That's another factor that might drive it. So to what extent?

362
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:59,950
So for the messiness. Yeah, I have to clean this up later. To what extent does.

363
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,610
Peer support. Can you say the rest again?

364
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:16,080
An increasing. Ooh.

365
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:20,760
Is getting messy. The number of students.

366
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:31,830
You definitely got to clean this screen out. This is what all my papers look like, by the way.

367
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,770
Every single one is always a printed out draft that looks like this hot mess.

368
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:43,820
Yeah. And think about the actions I could take from that.

369
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:51,560
Maybe I find that peer support drives it. So I guess what I'm going to implement next time, peer support or teachers,

370
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:57,290
I'm going to get teachers on my side because if the teacher doesn't let the students are the class.

371
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:01,980
Well, my interventionist group. Or they're interventionist.

372
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:05,400
I'm so possessive. I get I get very invested in my clients.

373
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:10,470
This is our program, our community. I'm like, I don't live in Seattle, but there's still my people.

374
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:15,960
Anyway, that's good. Those were poor buildings, relationship building.

375
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:30,460
So those were examples of how we would use. Inputs, activities and outputs to address process evaluation questions.

376
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,109
But we're also, you know, doing outcome evaluation.

377
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:40,960
So how can we use the logic model to drive outcome evaluation questions?

378
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:50,620
And so those questions that we ask for outcome evaluation are really focused on different configurations of outcomes,

379
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:53,200
as you will see in the next few slides.

380
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:08,730
So one possibility is asking questions that assess changes in short, mid or long term outcomes just as singular that we elicit a change.

381
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:14,170
So for example, you see on the slide, we've got three outcomes.

382
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:21,580
And you know, in boxes you think crease knowledge about principles and actions of online citizenship.

383
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:27,060
Media increases space and attention to Internet Safety Event.

384
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:31,390
Youth are safe and responsible. Internet Technology Users.

385
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:42,980
And then we have corresponding. Questions that are simply about the outcomes by themselves.

386
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:52,030
The Youth and the Internet Safety Program report an increase in knowledge about online citizenship after the intervention.

387
00:50:53,280 --> 00:51:02,540
So here's our short. Did media sources increase their reporting on Internet safety after the intervention?

388
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:13,590
So that's our medium. And then did the program succeed in improving the safety of youth in online spaces?

389
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:32,420
And there's our long term outcome. We might also build on that to think about or try to identify where changes in that outcome sustained over time.

390
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,870
In this case. Same out, same outcomes.

391
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,570
But now with the added element of time.

392
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:51,480
The participants in the Internet safety program still report an increase in knowledge about online citizenship.

393
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:59,890
Six months after the intervention. How long after the intervention?

394
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:04,720
So again, we're asking about time, but it's still including time.

395
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:12,490
How long did it or after the intervention that media sources continue their reporting on Internet safety?

396
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:24,910
Were you participants using the Internet safety or safe using the Internet safely, even after two years post intervention?

397
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:33,760
Now. How will we get time? You can get time from literature.

398
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,770
And again, that's where your review at the beginning comes in handy.

399
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:51,780
So if you've already done some research on Internet safety interventions, you might see that for the most part, the interventions fade out.

400
00:52:51,810 --> 00:53:01,730
The effects fade out after three months. So maybe you want to see you've made this and designed this program so that the effects will last longer.

401
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:07,200
You might get your time from.

402
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:18,570
Your stakeholders, they might say, well, we really hope that since students are, you know, they might be able to get a refresher once a year.

403
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:25,230
We really want them to at least kind of use the information for six months or at least kind of keep the knowledge.

404
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:32,029
Or they might just you might get it from a funder.

405
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:33,140
The funder has.

406
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:41,510
And again, especially with government public health funders, they they they might have metrics that they are one that you that aim toward.

407
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:45,620
And but generally they will also give you the resources to do that, too.

408
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:55,340
So keep in mind that when you ask questions about time, think about the implications for a program design.

409
00:53:56,210 --> 00:54:04,010
So if I see your evaluation question says do they still report an increase after six months?

410
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:10,460
What do you need to do? Six months. Yeah.

411
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:17,760
Follow up, Will. And so that has implications for resources and time.

412
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:21,379
We get push. I get a lot of pushback.

413
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:30,650
And unsurprisingly, people say, well, our staff really don't have time to go following up with people six months after the program.

414
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:34,070
We're already on to like three other programs by that point.

415
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:41,840
So then that's why I'm at stakeholder engagement is important because they will tell you we can't answer this question.

416
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:45,110
Do you expect us to follow up? We don't have any money for that.

417
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:49,010
Or they say we've got this secret pocket of money.

418
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:56,229
Yeah. But then maybe time is, is, is open ended.

419
00:54:56,230 --> 00:55:00,850
So like you can, you know, they want to know, is this having a sustained effect?

420
00:55:00,850 --> 00:55:04,420
And so which case you could keep it open like this? How long?

421
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:13,040
And again, implications for our research design. When we talk about research design, we'll talk about TIME series.

422
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:20,360
This is a time series. This hints at a time series design because I'm going to have to do multiple

423
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:25,710
data collection points after the intervention to see how long it's lasting.

424
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:32,600
Three, six, nine months is generally like a carbon time.

425
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:51,460
Time series. And then we can also think about that when we're thinking about two different populations.

426
00:55:51,470 --> 00:56:03,400
So, for example, if we know in this case that parent and youth outcomes are important to sustain, we've asked those kinds of questions.

427
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:10,870
They participants in the Internet Safety Program report greater knowledge about online citizenship.

428
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:19,210
After the intervention where parents were likely to report an increase in their ability to educate youth about technology.

429
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:30,720
So this question is not only addressing time, but it's addressing the potential interactions that we've modeled in that theory of change.

430
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:42,420
And one thing I wanted to point out is that time.

431
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:50,380
Is particularly helpful when looking at short and mid-term outcomes.

432
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:57,950
Because those are ultimately in the the way that we're using logic models for this course.

433
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:03,440
Those are driving changes in condition which are your long term outcomes.

434
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:13,940
Right. So in order to get to safe and responsible Internet use on a regular basis, you have to sustain knowledge.

435
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:25,450
You have to sustain behavior. We might also.

436
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:32,190
Crafts some outcome evaluation questions to understand attribution.

437
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:38,790
And this is often this is kind of where people they are really wanting to to see.

438
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:49,650
So it's helpful to at least propose questions like this, because ultimately what we want to know is not it's not just that the program was great,

439
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:58,440
but we want to know that any changes we saw with an outcome evaluation, we want to see did the program actually drive the change?

440
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:04,650
And it's one thing to say that participants have a positive outcome.

441
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:09,930
It's another thing to say that the outcome was based on the program.

442
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:26,870
So in this case. We have outcomes related to communicating effectively, increasing knowledge and being safe, responsible users.

443
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:37,010
So we could ask questions like the participants in the Internet Safety Program report greater knowledge than non-participants.

444
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:48,840
We might also ask after the intervention, were parents more likely to report an increase in their ability to educate youth compared to non-parents?

445
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:54,960
So again, note research, design and sample size implications.

446
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:59,910
If I have participants and non-participants.

447
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:11,640
And I'm going to move that question forward. That means that I have a pretty good, you know, assurance that I can get a control or a comparison group.

448
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:17,950
And that has implications for resources.

449
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,930
It has implications for ethics.

450
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:28,750
Am I going to have people just straight up not participate in a program and not allow them to participate, for example?

451
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:44,509
That's an ethical issue that, you know, you should consider. And then finally what?

452
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:46,700
Actually, I want to do the example for this one.

453
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:58,400
So my what might be some example, another example of a question I could ask that was based on determining that the program itself.

454
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:04,360
Have implications? Yes. I don't know.

455
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:07,510
What would you rather be in jail for three days?

456
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:14,310
How about. Now we know they're in the.

457
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:26,709
That's a good question. So. QUESTION If you are then here it was about, you know,

458
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:33,430
do you need a baseline because how would you know where they were starting from if you don't have that baseline?

459
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:41,530
That's another implication for research design. So I might have some type of they might have data on the baseline.

460
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:48,800
You know, sometimes that is the case where you have some epidemiological data or there's.

461
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:58,430
Well, there's epidemiological data, you know, county data, health health data from the medical system.

462
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:10,250
But you can also think about research design in terms of we need to get a pre we need to get a pre post test design as part of this study.

463
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:16,700
So I need to measure in this case what is their knowledge before?

464
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:29,670
And knowledge after. So I know that if I don't know.

465
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:36,720
Where they're starting from. Ideally, I'm going to figure out where they're starting from.

466
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:44,520
And if I'm them and you can ask the question like, you know, you can have that design regardless.

467
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:50,280
It's not it doesn't have to be in this kind of control or comparison group form.

468
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:58,620
So I could just ask that for any of I would want that for pretty much any of the questions that I've already asked.

469
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:10,110
In terms of outcomes. But because in this case, I also need the knowledge before and after participants.

470
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:14,790
So I'll just write parents because it's easier and non-parents.

471
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:19,980
Or. Yeah.

472
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:28,190
When we say non-parents. Top parents not participating.

473
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:41,190
So that means I'm going to have to do at least four.

474
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:52,380
Data collection. I've got four data collection points before for both parents participating and not participating.

475
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:57,990
And then I've got after the intervention, parents participating in parents who are.

476
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:02,680
Participating. I think I've got myself screwed or mixed up.

477
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:09,070
All right. So then again, resources.

478
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:13,390
Do I have money for all that? Do have time for all that data collection.

479
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:25,470
If I don't, then I probably shouldn't ask this question. I'm going to race that one.

480
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:30,090
Any any other examples that people might have?

481
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:43,880
I promise I won't say it again. I'm sorry. In the other examples.

482
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:56,110
Well, what about we could. We could look at Generation Gap.

483
01:03:57,910 --> 01:04:05,060
It might say. To what extent?

484
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:15,090
Did. The Internet safety program.

485
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:21,970
Contribute. To closing.

486
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:37,880
Generation gaps. Yeah.

487
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:47,970
So the question was, how would you operationalize that? So I could operationalize it by talking to parents.

488
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:55,090
Participating. And I'm just going to keep calling the non-parents.

489
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:07,540
But then I might also to answer that question, I might need to account for other programs that are operating.

490
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:12,520
Maybe there was like a huge media campaign.

491
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:26,190
That happened in the community at the same time. So if that's the case, I might need a survey question ultimately to ask.

492
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:36,400
Were you exposed to other. Campaigns about Internet safety during the time of this intervention, like in the past three months or whatnot.

493
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:51,660
And then finally, we might ask outcome evaluation questions about unintended changes.

494
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:57,690
There are often unintended questions or unintended changes in the intervention.

495
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:13,650
So having a question, especially if we think that this is a pilot or this is a situation where we might observe something that we didn't expect to,

496
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:24,840
it's a helpful question. And honestly, I think it is a especially operating with a Kremlin's or a more community engage lens.

497
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:33,130
The benefit of a question like this is that it assumes that there will be some positive benefit.

498
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:43,130
So generally I like to even if I don't ask this, ask this formally, I'm going to be thinking about this.

499
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:52,100
Often times those types of answers will lead to changes in program design.

500
01:06:52,860 --> 01:07:03,030
And will illustrate to a funder that programs have unintended consequences and that they have merit worth a significant.

501
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:11,380
That is outside of the knowledge of literature and a given on a given problem.

502
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:16,950
And when we're thinking about cultural responsiveness, that's often the case.

503
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:24,630
What people who are distant from a community are going to come up with is not going to give the full picture.

504
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:33,630
That you would have if you were a member of that community. So I just like those questions.

505
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:38,810
And speaking of which, so what are some other considerations?

506
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:47,320
In addition to what I mentioned about unintended consequences, when I'm thinking about equity and cultural responsiveness,

507
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:52,450
I'm also thinking about do the questions help advance the agency's equity work?

508
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:57,760
And they may not be doing explicitly equity work, although we found that.

509
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:04,009
You know, I'm finding and I'm seeing that increasingly diversity, equity,

510
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:11,690
inclusion and just social justice is being included in a lot of organizations, work in their mission.

511
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:20,059
There's more attentiveness to it, but it can also think of you can also think about equity work.

512
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:28,070
And, you know, if you go back to when I talked about CRE a few weeks ago, there was different dimensions of equity.

513
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:39,050
But the one I wanted to highlight today is, well, do your questions just simply reflect them asset that basic view of program beneficiaries.

514
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:47,350
So instead of asking something like. Does the program solve the community's problems?

515
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:54,530
Which insinuates that a community cannot solve its own problems, that they need programs to do it.

516
01:08:55,810 --> 01:09:03,070
Consider asking or reframing. Does a program build on community assets to facilitate community growth?

517
01:09:04,150 --> 01:09:09,639
And so as an evaluator, what do I get to do? I look, I'm telling you, I get so excited.

518
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:14,620
I wish I could do this. More stupid covet can't go hang out with people as much anymore.

519
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:21,100
And learn so many community assets just by sitting in the room with people.

520
01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:25,840
But anyway, so answering this question means I have to identify.

521
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:34,930
The community assets. And I need to I need to illustrate how the community is growing.

522
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:45,890
That is a more open ended way of communicating, especially to those in power, such as funders, that, um, just because a,

523
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:54,910
a program implementation in effect doesn't look the way you expected it to doesn't mean that it was a worthless program.

524
01:09:55,670 --> 01:10:01,720
One community's already have assets, and what you should be doing is building on them.

525
01:10:02,910 --> 01:10:05,580
And then you can illustrate the growth.

526
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:14,910
So from a value or principle perspective, do you see the difference between am I solving the problem which public health loves to do?

527
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:20,820
Versus Am I working with community and community to?

528
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:25,859
Not only document assets, point out assets,

529
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:33,660
but document them for those in power and showing how they are working to elicit growth in their communities.

530
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:39,200
So that's another level of kind of sophistication to the question.

531
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:49,220
And then also our community engagement. Just simply we're communities and members interests consider and question development just like with.

532
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:54,600
Logic modeling or when we get into design,

533
01:10:55,500 --> 01:11:06,780
creating instruments are what ways are we truly engaging with community members in order to be able to

534
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:13,530
design and implement an evaluation that contributes to community empowerment versus disempowerment?

535
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:23,690
So in summary. You know, take a deep breath again.

536
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:29,410
You're like, Oh, now she gave us too much. Yeah, right. These evaluation questions, I consider all these things.

537
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:37,780
Just. It's okay. I'm not going to expect you to be, like, super sophisticated if this is your first time doing it.

538
01:11:38,350 --> 01:11:45,670
But strong evaluation questions they should consider merit worth, the significance and ways that you can take action.

539
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:52,300
They should be specific, relevant and answerable in terms of their characteristics.

540
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:57,520
It helps if they reflect components and relationships in the logic model.

541
01:11:59,170 --> 01:12:02,290
And then some considerations that are helpful.

542
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:10,420
And I would recommend that you, you know, take into consideration equity, cultural responsiveness and community engagement.

543
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:27,940
Any questions before our show, The Last Leg. Well, Professor.

544
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:39,360
What if they don't have a logic model? Well, if they don't have a logic model, you can still draw from other aspects.

545
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:45,540
Stakeholder engagement, conversations, goals that they've illustrated.

546
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:52,920
If, for example, they don't have a logic model because they're doing systems change and those logic models look a hot mess on paper,

547
01:12:53,280 --> 01:13:00,180
you can think about systems level changes. There are many ways that you can work around that having a logic model.

548
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:15,590
But if you do have a logic model, it is highly recommended that you start there and consider that in crafting them the questions that is.

549
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:21,400
Right. So just some implication.

550
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:27,130
Oh, sorry. It's going to take a lot of feedback. You can see a lot of photos.

551
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:34,560
You could do something internally. Like if it helps.

552
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:37,770
Like, I'm a I'm a very visual. Person.

553
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:40,200
And so sometimes I will do that.

554
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:50,579
I'll I have like, you know, I'll use my map software just to try and model something on the page to, to be able to see what's going on.

555
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:56,190
And even if the page looks like boxes everywhere and then lines go on all over like a

556
01:13:56,190 --> 01:14:04,200
network diagram and at least gives me some connections that I might start to capitalize on.

557
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,920
What questions? Yes.

558
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:17,979
Yeah, you could use a program goals.

559
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:27,040
And again, like especially with like systems change where it's really in where the systems are always changing and it's really hard to just model,

560
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:37,750
we're going to do this like, yeah, you can use program goals as well as like, you know, stakeholder learning interests.

561
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,180
And then you can even use gaps in literature.

562
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:50,460
Like if you you know, the literature tells you that there's an interaction between two,

563
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:56,730
two systems like the educational system and the workforce development system when it comes to employment.

564
01:14:57,790 --> 01:15:08,619
I. I. The literature is full of gaps in discussion about how education and workforce development is disconnects between those systems.

565
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:16,000
So I can use the gaps in the literature to tell me what might be some useful questions that have implications for programing.

566
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:21,920
I mean, you could just make them like you could just make them up. Don't make them up. It's just.

567
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,820
They should always be just. They should always be driven by something.

568
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:36,010
Right. Not just, oh, I'm randomly asking this because I was watching House of the Dragon and it seemed interesting.

569
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:42,620
Who's watching House of the Dragon. I'm going to stop. Okay. Good.

570
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:46,360
Everyone. All right, my kids don't talk to me.

571
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:51,079
I'm watching this totally inappropriate show. Go to bed. Oh, they're doing something.

572
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:56,330
Go the bad eyes. So.

573
01:15:56,330 --> 01:16:01,880
But for that assignment, you're probably gonna come up with a lot of questions in your groups.

574
01:16:03,530 --> 01:16:13,760
You just narrow down again. The assignment is an opportunity for you to practice and apply these skills.

575
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:18,110
So all I'm going to look for is, again, continuity.

576
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,680
So just pick some questions if you have 20 questions.

577
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:25,980
Um. Meryl them down.

578
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:32,360
If you if you really can't meryl them down. So like, say you got down to seven, then you're like, just forget it.

579
01:16:32,990 --> 01:16:38,470
I'm not doing any more narrowing down. That's fine.

580
01:16:38,770 --> 01:16:43,420
But I will tell you, the implication is that you will be graded accordingly.

581
01:16:45,330 --> 01:16:53,040
So my recommendation is just to narrow down, because otherwise what I'm going to do is and what Hannah is going to do,

582
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,979
we're going to say, okay, they have these questions.

583
01:16:55,980 --> 01:17:05,190
Does the research design reflect or does the research design and the instruments allow you to actually answer these questions?

584
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:13,600
Keep it simple. Hmm.

585
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:24,380
This the research? Well, the research design, which will we'll get more into research design next week and then after fall break.

586
01:17:25,070 --> 01:17:31,880
But when we're getting into grading for like the final plan, that's what we're going to be looking at.

587
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:36,510
Can you answer the questions with what you've included?

588
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:42,010
So this is more of a heads up as you move forward. Keep it simple.

589
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:53,430
In the evaluation plan assignment, it says like there's a bullet point that says, do the questions align with the evaluation questions checklist?

590
01:17:54,210 --> 01:18:02,610
It's a good checklist. But you you do not have to submit any questions, any checklist to ask about the questions.

591
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:06,780
Now, I give you that disclaimer. They're useful references.

592
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:12,150
So the one that you read for class as well as the one that's linked to the evaluation plan.

593
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:19,980
Again, remember that that plan is the one that the CDC actually sends and expects you to fill out.

594
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:27,630
I learned that recently. They really do expect you to fill that evaluation plan.

595
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:32,370
I was surprised. I tried to change it around. All right. Now, where is this bullet point?

596
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:39,770
Okay, cool. Whatever. You're serious about this, so don't.

597
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:52,459
Yeah, I would just say it like you can just use it like you if you want to be if you want to like just have kind of a way of saying,

598
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:57,110
okay, are these good questions? I would recommend using the checklist, either one of them.

599
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:03,560
But you don't. I'll just leave it at them. All right.

600
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:07,940
Any other no other questions? We're done for today.

601
01:19:10,030 --> 01:19:14,070
No. All right. Enjoy the weekend.

602
01:19:16,950 --> 01:19:20,400
Go visit the apple orchard if you're new to Michigan.

603
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:39,250
We have wonderful ones in Washtenaw County. You mean the time when you and I didn't just like.

604
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:44,510
I don't think we're doing that. Okay. Yeah.

605
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:57,090
Supposed to be like. Like, oh, they used to say, you can use a theory.
