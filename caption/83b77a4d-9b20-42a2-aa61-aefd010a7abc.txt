1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:27,540
I don't think you are there, but I don't really care if I did.

2
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:50,490
I don't know, I guess. I was like, well, there are five, eight, four days left if I go home and go down the road.

3
00:00:50,770 --> 00:01:07,350
Well, I was out today because I didn't know what I'm supposed to do.

4
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:15,690
Win season. That's so interesting to watch now.

5
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:39,210
I don't know what it feels like. It's got to be a minor thing, and I think I might go either way.

6
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,810
Good, everyone.

7
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,630
I want to tell you.

8
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:01,340
I wouldn't be who I let any or all of you outside.

9
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:16,690
You say something like that to me.

10
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:36,630
You know, I have to tell you that I've got something to do with this huge man, like, running it.

11
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:49,320
And I know what you're thinking at home.

12
00:02:49,620 --> 00:03:08,120
Are you ready to consider? So let me pass this around in your back like we were here at school, and I see your comments,

13
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:26,050
but you're asking me very nicely to share your statement with my colleague, with the great feeling every way he's going to throw up on.

14
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,330
We're going to talk about the elaboration and the model.

15
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:38,460
I want to start off by showing you a very short talk to sort of put into context,

16
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:46,979
to give you a snapshot of what we're going to talk about, so many things that are going to go into depth around something.

17
00:03:46,980 --> 00:04:26,170
The contact center at the heart of what is in this example we've been talking, which is, you know what,

18
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,600
I am one marketer and I now work in international development and I'm for the

19
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:44,010
first time in the 19th century and in fact the largest in Western Europe,

20
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:50,100
only has 200 miles around. The DRC is a dangerous place.

21
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,670
In the past ten years, 5 million people have died.

22
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,800
Civil war and the war is the only reason that we are seeing.

23
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:05,399
There are many health know. In fact the HIV prevalence rate is 1.3 to 5.

24
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,060
Come on now, it might not count the world's number one 876 million people,

25
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:21,840
but it means that there are 930 investment and development in the U.S. Only 25 of are receiving the lifesaving trying to continue,

26
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:33,900
which is why in the region these provide condoms at low and quality of in the DRC and spent a lot of time talking about African Union.

27
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,820
Mehdi Hasan The hotel outside the hotel only open until midnight.

28
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,500
So it's not a place that you stay for. There's a place for sex workers in their plans.

29
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,950
Nobody knows all about them because there's just not demand.

30
00:05:51,910 --> 00:06:01,360
It's not surprising that only three people in the dressing room don't even have a pharmacy where they sell a number of condoms,

31
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:11,710
despite the fact even there, if you find them and they have marketing, you know, they're customers don't buy the branded versions.

32
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,829
They like this one. And as a merchant, I know that during the service market,

33
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:24,040
what the marketing look like and it turns out that the three main messages you

34
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:34,000
can find them here financing fidelity they name the financing might be solid.

35
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:40,120
First off, the packaging with the red ribbon remind us of HIV.

36
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:47,080
Put it in Boston. It might even keep them the picture of your wife or husband.

37
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:56,400
You have them on accidently. Now, these are not the kind of things that someone can think about just before they go back.

38
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:09,100
What is it that you think about before you got to kind of sex and the private company?

39
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:19,719
Sometimes in these places they understand this. You're marketing slightly different mainly things you might get brand but the imagery here and some

40
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:29,530
brands are aspirational and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative and perhaps too jarring.

41
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:38,440
You miss out on a key to understanding who the audience and sends out her agency.

42
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:46,359
Unfortunately, the audience tends to be people little in the way that the people that whom people that's

43
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:55,450
important to people actually find people really trying to do is to stop the spread of HIV.

44
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:01,570
We need to think about the consumer behavior needs to be the problem.

45
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,730
Young women, young men lives depend on it.

46
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:19,000
And so I think you have to think about what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior.

47
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:45,700
And I think the. Well, thank you. Okay.

48
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:49,420
So thank you for watching that.

49
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:56,020
In public health, we often struggle to get people to do things we may want them to be doing.

50
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:00,820
And we've been talking about this for most of this semester so far.

51
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:07,299
And one of the problems is that the things we're asking people to do in terms of

52
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,459
health promotion are not that interesting and exciting because those long term

53
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,920
visible benefits take time to realize are many sort of struggles to make behaviors

54
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,200
that fall under the umbrella of public health personally relevant to that.

55
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:31,300
And our goal in our discipline is really to try to move behavior in the direction of health promotion.

56
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,660
So we need to sort of get creative and think about the connection between positive thinking, public health messages and,

57
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:47,500
oh, about credentials and sort of behavior change that we may be thinking about in terms of our programing messaging.

58
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:57,470
So today I want to talk about that liberation livelihood model and attitudes, as we've talked about in class so far.

59
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:04,750
They're obviously very important in terms of a concept that influences behavior on a larger scale.

60
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,310
We can change many people's attitudes and that can in turn influence norms.

61
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:14,020
So today we're going to talk about methods to change attitudes.

62
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,479
So much of this taps into health communication, and in order to effectively utilize these questions,

63
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,990
we really have to understand how these messages are processed in our brain.

64
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:32,020
So the liberation livelihood model is really focused on persuasion.

65
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,140
That's really the core of this model. It's about persuasion.

66
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:44,980
It's really organizing how we process persuasive communication into two different routes that we set out to change.

67
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:51,910
And it's a continuum that goes from kind of known thinking to a lot of thinking and cognitive process.

68
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,450
So the elaboration likelihood model really comes up with a message we have.

69
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:03,180
We're working on the message here versus a behavior in some of the other models we've talked about in class.

70
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,250
And we're really focused on a behavior, a risk factor here.

71
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:13,750
We're really talking about a message. I mean, this could be anything in the elaboration like model.

72
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:19,870
There are really two routes for processing messages that both lead to attitude change.

73
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,010
One is the central route and the other one is the verbal route.

74
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:32,020
And remember, both can lead to change, but one is more effective than the other, and they can be used together strategically.

75
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:40,420
So both of these routes, central and peripheral, can lead to some sort of attitude change.

76
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:52,990
One is more effective than the other, but often they're both used together strategically to enhance enduring sort of other teaching in the group role.

77
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,179
This really involves processes requiring relatively little thought about issue.

78
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:06,460
Relevant information of attitudes just change by simple association processes like, you know,

79
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:13,630
when you think back to behaviorism in classical conditioning, it's really, you know, X associated with Y.

80
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:18,220
And you make a lot of these mental shortcuts in here, mistakes in our mind.

81
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,420
You know, what do you think about the implicit bias literature? It's really sort of based on these mental shortcuts.

82
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:31,270
Are we really in peripheral processing and through the peripheral route,

83
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:36,000
we really rely on these simple cues and these mental shortcuts that we call carrots.

84
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:45,550
And mental shortcuts might be used so that a message from an expert, for example, is just based on the heuristic that experts are generally correct.

85
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,940
So if I see an expert, they're generally correct.

86
00:12:49,540 --> 00:13:00,669
So in this message, if it's delivered by an expert, it must be correct because it's given by basically a heuristic in the central role.

87
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:06,639
People with relative are people are generally pretty thoughtful in their consideration of the issue,

88
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,760
relevant information that's presented to them and information related to attitude.

89
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:21,700
The attitude, objectives, relationships, pertinent knowledge is really stored in our memory and it's usually focused on perceived

90
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:27,550
desirability and the consequences of the action and perceived likelihood that they will occur.

91
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:33,130
So you're really sort of processing outcomes, expectations like we talked about in social cognitive theories.

92
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,830
So if I really sort of focus on the consequences and the outcomes of the action,

93
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:49,850
you're really relying on knowledge stored in your long term memory to make decisions limits.

94
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:57,070
So let's start with central processing. This is what we want people to do.

95
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,900
Attitude change following central processing is likely to be more enduring.

96
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:07,240
It's more resistant to further change and more likely to be correlated with behavior change.

97
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:14,470
So like I said, one branch of persuasion is slightly better than the other, and it's the central role of processing.

98
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:25,719
The quality of the arguments matter whether you are centrally or personally processing a passage.

99
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,950
So it's not that just because you want people to personally process the message, you should have bad arguments.

100
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,690
You should always have quality arguments.

101
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:41,080
And as you get as you can guess, there are really two major elements of central processing, two requirements.

102
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:49,420
One is that if you're centrally processing, you should be motivated to centrally process that message.

103
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,080
And the second is that you're able to centrally process that message.

104
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:57,880
So in terms of motivation, it has some personal relevance to you.

105
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:03,129
And we'll talk about need for cognition in a few moments.

106
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:07,959
But motivation is also influenced by whether we enjoy thinking in general.

107
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:14,590
We like to have information in order to centrally process a message.

108
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:22,149
We have to be able to more effectively elaborate on a message,

109
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:27,790
and we're able to do that when we have some prior knowledge can and this could

110
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,530
backfire if we have really strong opinions about the opposite of that message.

111
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:40,750
Um, so that's something to keep in mind. But in general, we're more able to effectively elaborate on a message in central processing.

112
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:45,610
We have some prior knowledge. We must we have to be able to understand the message.

113
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:53,170
The message should be really free from distraction, and the repetition of the message really can help solidify.

114
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:59,770
So keeping the messages relevant to our context and having some sort of prior knowledge as it relates to

115
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:05,830
the message really allows us to pull back into our long term memory and bring it to short term memory.

116
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:12,490
And the more stuff we have, we're able to store in our long term memory that makes central processing a lot easier.

117
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:19,960
So if a person is going to be motivated and able to think about sort of that issue relevant information,

118
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:25,810
the result is really careful processing of an attitude that is well articulated,

119
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:34,210
readily accessible in our minds, and integrated into a person's overall structure in our daily lives.

120
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:40,540
Sometimes their lack of motivation, of the ability to really thoughtfully consider every essential,

121
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,430
persuasive communication in a way that's really characterized by something.

122
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:59,710
So when we think about the practicalities of central processing, you know, in our day to day lives, we either lack the motivation, generally speaking,

123
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:06,399
or we just have way too much information coming at us to be able to thoughtfully consider every potential

124
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,850
persuasive communication in a way that's sort of expected through this central processing power.

125
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:23,440
So that's where peripheral processing becomes very useful in peripheral processing, especially when we think about the public health context.

126
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:32,559
Strong arguments don't matter. Like I said, you're not trying to give people weak arguments and sort of trick them with peripheral processing.

127
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,760
That's not very responsible. We're still concerned with strong arguments,

128
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,579
and this is where marketers use many of these techniques to really persuade

129
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,770
us with messages that could potentially be harmful to us and public health.

130
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:51,820
We're interested in delivering messages that hopefully have some benefit.

131
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,750
Therefore, we're not trying to really sell. We were trying to sell.

132
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:04,270
So hopefully strong evidence based arguments in a way that can stick in peripheral processing.

133
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:10,270
We're making inferences about the message based on things outside of the information itself.

134
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,320
So in other words, how it's sort of packaged to us.

135
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:21,370
So we're really focused on how the information is packaged to us when we're thinking about personal processing.

136
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:31,000
So the types of cues that can help us with the curve to personally process that message could include an expert or an attractive source.

137
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:37,360
It could include mental shortcuts, like I said, an expert, a judge.

138
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:43,689
Based on that, your instincts, the experts are definitely correct me, could also be the number of messages.

139
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:49,780
So when motivation and ability is lacking, you see it or not, it might be important.

140
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:57,790
So oh, they said it about ten times and must be something I should start to pay attention to the excitement side.

141
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,750
And then it also relies on the simple association.

142
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:11,320
So here's an example of a perfectly processed public health message.

143
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,430
What are some associations that one might infer from this?

144
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:40,430
Yeah. That we can be more like Angelina Jolie if we get a double mastectomy to say Angelina Jolie did it.

145
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:53,120
So it's not that she is a good example for this messaging because she's like one of the most beautiful women ever to, you know, exist or whatever.

146
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,550
So so we perceive that she's a beautiful woman.

147
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,750
And, you know, if she can do it, it must be right.

148
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,750
That's right. I mean, you correct.

149
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,340
You know, there are there are simple associations here.

150
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:34,880
Yeah. I mean if you really want to dive into it like even that things about language choices and things like using the words empowered and strong.

151
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:39,319
So I actually work for a marketing company and we do a lot of work on hitting people

152
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,299
with very tactical language to try and basically just kind of trigger something,

153
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:50,330
even if it's, you know, very, very minor. If they read it, it's going to get that reaction that you're trying to look for.

154
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:58,090
Yeah. So some of the words being used here making that must be really important to you.

155
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,430
Powerful words. Yeah.

156
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,339
I think the combination of the strength of those words,

157
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:10,790
in combination with discussing womanhood in our community almost seems like getting a double mastectomy.

158
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:14,500
It's like special specialist. Yeah. Yeah.

159
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,280
So it's just the combination of, like, the combination of all those thoughts in your brain.

160
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,870
It's like she's, like, smiling, like she seems happy.

161
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:34,720
You know, I think there's an element of not not sad about getting a double mastectomy based on this image here, you know.

162
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:41,180
So I, I think a lot of people who are put in like celebrity positions are places of authority.

163
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:47,840
There's that association that like, oh, they have access to good doctors or access to really good medical care.

164
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,850
So her doctor, like, supported us and she had a good process.

165
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:58,720
Then there's a the possibility that I could have a good doctor, that I can be well supported, like Survivor.

166
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:07,090
You kind of. Yeah. So going a little bit deeper than that message, thinking about, you know,

167
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:12,640
she was she probably was supported by the medical community in making this decision.

168
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:17,780
So, you know, maybe I see this and I have access to care.

169
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,380
I have health insurance. That might be the same situation for me.

170
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:38,670
So persuasion typically occurs along a continuum of simple associations,

171
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:44,250
including by counting arguments or really making inferences based on experience.

172
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:50,760
And then there's careful consideration of information to make more important decisions.

173
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:59,040
But both peripheral and central processing occur along a continual continuum and can influence attitudes simultaneously.

174
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,780
So elaboration, likelihood. So elaboration of a message.

175
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,800
That's what that's why we call this model elaboration, likelihood.

176
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,459
Our ability to elaborate on a message.

177
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:21,060
This increases as that increases, central processing tends to dominate in terms of impact on attitudes versus peripheral processing.

178
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:30,890
So the more likely elaboration occurs, it appears that we're processing information more so through our central processing route.

179
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:41,129
And so it's really not the type of information that doesn't necessarily matter here.

180
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:48,330
It's really the distinction isn't the scrutiny of issue relevant information and how that information is processed.

181
00:23:48,330 --> 00:24:10,110
So let's look at a couple examples. Try not to.

182
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,270
So health promotion are really,

183
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:27,740
really concerned with the following question Which attitudes are the most important for predicting particular health behavior,

184
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:35,730
and which procedures are best used for changing those attitudes and obtaining sustained behavioral changes?

185
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,400
So we want to be able to measure each altitude separately.

186
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:51,730
So, you know, when we think about the example of same sex, do you know there's a general idea of safe sex?

187
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,850
There's the specific object of the condom use.

188
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,790
And then there's a behavior in terms of using the actual content.

189
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:11,569
So there are several factors that influence our motivation and ability to think in ways that change

190
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:17,600
the extent or direction of thinking and change our confidence in the thoughts that are generated.

191
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,780
So one of those is need for cognition.

192
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:34,230
And what this basically means is I really enjoy a task that involves coming up with new solutions of problem I need for cognition.

193
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,430
People really prefer complex intellectual tasks.

194
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:41,600
They're more persuaded by strong arguments and are less persuaded by weak.

195
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:56,070
So there have been studies, for example, where an intervention format was changed, has changed attitudes and social norms based on need for cognition.

196
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:05,670
So groups who express really low need for cognition was presented with information in a comic strip and sort of a picture version.

197
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:10,200
And they were more likely to change their attitudes and norms about a particular

198
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:16,290
problem than those presented in a booklet who also had a low need for cognition.

199
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:21,300
So where individuals with a high need for cognition, the opposite was seen.

200
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,820
So those with high need for cognition are more likely to change their attitudes and norms and presented

201
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:33,300
with a booklet with lots of information and sort of a picture version with the same information.

202
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:40,680
So there's sort of a lot of implications for how you disseminate information by tailoring materials based on need for partition.

203
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:51,959
So you just don't need a lot of information. And that might sort of prohibit you from sort of thinking about the messages.

204
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,470
Then you want to think about how you're actually presenting information and

205
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:00,360
measuring need for cognition becomes really important in being able to tailor that.

206
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:07,640
So let's talk about central versus peripheral processing in terms of personal elements.

207
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:16,129
So when the situation or behavior change context really has little relevance to our our target audience,

208
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:20,720
the quality of the arguments doesn't really matter whether they're good or bad.

209
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:27,050
It's those peripheral processing techniques that will really work best in promoting attitude change.

210
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,780
So the message has a lot of personal relevance.

211
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:38,840
More central processing will occur, but there can be some caveats relevant to how the message is tailored.

212
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:44,750
So. Want to talk a little bit about tailoring.

213
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,400
It's used to really increase message, elaboration and personal relevance.

214
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:55,730
It's the idea of matching messages to different aspects of someone's personal characteristics.

215
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:08,380
We see a lot of this and interventions now in our field and under conditions where people are likely not to cognitively elaborate on a message.

216
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:17,480
So low collaboration situations. Tailoring can really serve as a cue in terms of making it clear to someone that this is really about me.

217
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:24,950
In order to increase collaboration. And this can happen even under moderate collaboration conditions.

218
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:38,040
So. Taylor Communications are more specific, and they're an individualized form of audience segmentation.

219
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:45,790
So more precise than targeted materials and limited in population reach, or it can be expensive to develop and implement.

220
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:50,400
Those are some of the limitations of this team in communications.

221
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,350
Like they do have to be very specific.

222
00:28:52,770 --> 00:29:00,920
And if you're trying to reach a large population, trying to do tailored messaging, this can become very expensive very quickly.

223
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,149
The Center for Health Communications here at the University of Michigan actually

224
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:11,430
developed an open source software to make tailoring a lot easier and interventions.

225
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:23,670
And you can basically go to their website and sort of walk through their software and they have like several sort of tutorials on how it works,

226
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:33,320
where you can sort of feed in information about the population you're working with and it can sort of help you develop tailor

227
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:42,420
messages based on information versus writing individual tailored message messages in your software to be able to scale that.

228
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:52,500
In terms of expertise, of saws, it turns out that expertise is not that important in centrally processed messages.

229
00:29:52,500 --> 00:30:00,479
For example, having the doctor give you a message is not at all is not all that important.

230
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,639
If the message is going to be centrally process, the message is going to be personally processed.

231
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,330
You really want an expert source or an attractive source.

232
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:17,280
And for centrally processed messages, they're going to be processing the content of the message and not so much the source of the message.

233
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,189
We also know that knowledge promotes central processing,

234
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:29,489
so greater knowledge of a particular subject promotes greater differentiation between strong and weak arguments.

235
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:35,040
That's sort of the power of knowledge. In other words, we know when a message is better.

236
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,630
So it really promotes greater differentiation.

237
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,410
It also promotes less persuasion of weak arguments.

238
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:50,520
So knowledge really promotes central processing and really allows us to differentiate between strong and weak arguments.

239
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,929
And it also permits us for being persuaded by really weak arguments,

240
00:30:54,930 --> 00:31:03,020
no matter how expert or attractive the source message might be, no matter how many times you sort of see that message.

241
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:12,330
So knowledge has a lot of relevance here in terms of how people sort of process information.

242
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:26,290
So do keep in mind, as practitioners, we're interested in long term, often sustainable behavior change.

243
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:32,260
So the goal isn't to necessarily permanently process the heck out of people and hope for the best.

244
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:40,090
That's not what we're trying to do. We really want to think about a hybrid strategy and to use these crowdsourcing combination.

245
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:49,600
You might want to get people interested in using provably trustless messages and when the issue becomes more desirable,

246
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:57,220
use more active processing techniques to get them centrally, to get them to centrally process your message.

247
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:09,340
So you really need to sort of inject those peripheral cues to get people interested if they're just not interested, not in not aware or not engaged.

248
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:15,210
If you want to increase collaboration by increasing perceived personal relevance of the communications,

249
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:23,120
many questions about collaboration and likelihood. Model.

250
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:44,280
Okay. So I want to switch gears and talk a little bit about social marketing, and we're going to continue to talk about social marketing on Wednesday.

251
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:52,330
And social marketing essentially came about through this increased interest in the success of commercial marketers.

252
00:32:53,460 --> 00:33:02,850
It's widely used becoming more and more widely used in public health and studied and has provided pretty sufficient evidence for change.

253
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:15,150
That it is a recommended tool for intervention and health communication campaigns that combine multiple channels, one of which is mass media and.

254
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,180
Distribution of free or reduced price health products.

255
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:26,290
These campaigns can typically increase the use of these products such as pedometers,

256
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:34,420
nicotine replacement therapy, bike helmets, things that sort of encourage the use of health promoting behaviors.

257
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:40,060
And they can also help stop harmful behaviors or protect against disease or injury.

258
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:50,079
Successful social marketing programs seek insight into their consumers so the people on the receiving

259
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:58,840
end of any sort of campaign or messaging and the market and target segments of the populace.

260
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:04,510
They also seek to target segments of the population most likely to change.

261
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:11,920
So the method of intervention where you can integrate a whole host of theories and social marketing is not a theory in itself.

262
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:18,850
It's a technique that you might incorporate as you guys are thinking about your interventions for your project.

263
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:25,690
This may or may not be relevant, but it could be one method you use for intervention, design and theory.

264
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:29,290
In itself, it incorporates a lot of different theories.

265
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:39,669
So in terms of a definition, it's really the application of commercial marketing technologies to that analysis planning,

266
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:45,999
execution and evaluation of programs designed to influence the voluntary behavior of

267
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,520
target audiences in order to improve their personal welfare and that of their society.

268
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,240
That's the definition of social marketing and determining the target audience.

269
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:03,699
And they typically try to target the audience through, for instance,

270
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:10,030
the categories of behavioral changes and social marketing can be used to accept a new behavior.

271
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,140
It could be used to reject an undesirable behavior.

272
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:21,020
It can be used to modify a current behavior, and it can be used to abandon an old undesirable view.

273
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:29,470
And the goal is to really increase the likelihood that people will make healthy choices in the long run and improve social conditions.

274
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:37,720
So it really aims to influence a broad range of attitudes and social priorities and behaviors in public health.

275
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,590
So elaboration, likelihood was really focused on attitude change.

276
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:49,780
Social marketing is a little bit broader, but also focused on attitudes and social priorities, but also being very sensible.

277
00:35:52,690 --> 00:36:00,670
So although it's inspired by the successes of commercial marketing, there are several differences that should be noted.

278
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:07,300
So in social marketing, there's really a focus on personal and social welfare.

279
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:14,620
That is the primary feature that really distinguishes social marketing from commercial marketing.

280
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,469
It's a voluntary exchange. That's also another key distinction.

281
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:33,610
So what you're providing is not provided a loss to individuals and consumers, and consumers and marketers typically share the same sort of goals.

282
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:45,920
So the basic principles, when you think about social marketing, there's a focus on behavioral.

283
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:51,680
So the goal of social marketing is to influence attitudes, but also behaviors.

284
00:36:52,040 --> 00:37:01,070
It's not just to promote services and products. And it's really use rather than possession that really confers benefit.

285
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:10,630
So if you're you really want to really focus on uptake of whatever it is you're trying to communicate.

286
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,600
So it prioritizes consumer benefit rather than the marketers.

287
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:25,400
So Internet the benefit, it really benefits the campaign audience at large in the form of typically better health or social welfare.

288
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:32,120
And the benefits and costs are typically mutually shared, you know, as opposed to commercial marketing.

289
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:42,850
It can often feel a little one sided. There's one side sitting there and then maintaining a market perspective.

290
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:46,760
So the market revolves around consumer needs.

291
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:50,720
There's a flow of information and competition for attention.

292
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,370
The competition is really around attention. It's not necessarily other products.

293
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:58,930
It's like, how do we get our message to stick out there?

294
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:05,680
And all these other messages get. And audience segmentation becomes very important.

295
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:13,220
And this is really to identify meaningful differences among consumers that affect their response to the product or service being offered.

296
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,459
So you want to really when you're doing audience segmentation,

297
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:23,000
you really want to identify relatively homogeneous subgroups and really develop marketing strategies

298
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,090
customized to those characteristics of that subgroup of different groups require different strategies,

299
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:38,780
different groups that also may respond or relate to similar ways to a product in terms of how you segment them.

300
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:42,230
And each group sort of gets different marketing.

301
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:51,370
And then another basic principle are the four pieces.

302
00:38:52,180 --> 00:39:03,190
So what are the questions for? Peace are really important to consider when designing a social marketing intervention.

303
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,560
You want to think about the product? What are you trying to sell?

304
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:17,080
What are the gains from the recommended behavior? So it might be safety for wearing your seatbelts.

305
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:25,630
You're really trying to sell safety. So trying to sell your outcome, essentially, that's your product.

306
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,140
So when you look at your conceptual model and your outcomes,

307
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:33,880
that's if you're going to use a social marketing technique, that's what you're trying to sell.

308
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:43,030
You also have to think about the price. So price the decrease of the cost to the individual, taking the design reaction,

309
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:49,060
it can not only be a monetary cost but an emotional or psychological time cost.

310
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:55,300
So perceived costs or barriers associated with certain product or behavior.

311
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:00,790
Social marketers try to set an attractive price or influence the perceived cost

312
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:05,620
benefit ratio in order to really tip the balance in the favor of the promoting.

313
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:11,290
And then you also have to think about place to think about where and when the

314
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:15,970
audience will perform the behavior access the new or adapted product or service.

315
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:24,070
How can you make it convenient or pleasant and even more so than any sort of competing behavior with what your focus on?

316
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:32,410
Examples of this include placing condoms in vending machines and bar guestrooms, making it a little more convenient,

317
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:43,210
offering help lines that are available 24 hours a day, having breastfeeding consultants check in on new mothers after they leave the hospital.

318
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,780
So you also want to think about your sales force,

319
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:57,880
the people that will take your program to the means and strategic placement of when it really is important, and especially when the behavior is.

320
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:06,700
And then the last piece is promotion. You really use your market research to determine the communication channels and activities

321
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:11,200
that will best reach your audience to promote the benefits of the desired behavior.

322
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:15,670
So what advertising or public relations media do they pay attention to?

323
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:23,560
Is it the radio? You know, newspaper people still read paper newspapers?

324
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:32,680
Is it a postcard? What special promotional items would they use to sort of get your message across?

325
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,940
Do you think it's water bottles, refrigerator magnets, notepads?

326
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:39,280
What special events do they attend?

327
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:48,760
You really must think about selecting this to correspond with the audience preferences and sort of information about process and science.

328
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:59,510
So typically in terms of approaches, social marketing can be product driven.

329
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:02,740
So the appeal of a product to differentiate it from others.

330
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:09,340
And we have to do this with logos and branding. People tend to associate benefit with a brand.

331
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,420
It could be you could be offering a set of services.

332
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:22,670
So from your textbook reading on social marketing, they branded a set of family planning services.

333
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:28,410
This was a wide range of resources that are sort of unified as part of that behavioral volunteer campaign.

334
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:35,400
And then there's a consumer driven, and it's really building demand for the product,

335
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:40,360
changing social norms and behavioral momentum shifts from the organization to

336
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,709
the consumer and really aligns with subjective norms and normative beliefs.

337
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:51,550
And really what you're really trying to do is inform people of the positive behavior trend.

338
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:58,200
And then there's market driven and this is really attractive alternatives to the competition.

339
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:06,910
So when you have a lot of choices. So one example, healthy food options on the menus in restaurants.

340
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:10,570
Now there's you know, when you have a lot of competition on a menu,

341
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:16,200
there's something there to really differentiate healthier options through some sort of simple.

342
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,910
So I want to walk you through an example of social marketing.

343
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:26,620
Like I gave you some definitions. How, how does this sort of play out in practice?

344
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:31,630
So I want to talk about how it applies to sanitation.

345
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:37,479
So diarrheal diseases is the second leading cause of death in children under five years old

346
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:42,610
and is responsible for killing around 5 million children under the age of five every year.

347
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:48,310
A lot of these doubts can be prevented with adequate sanitation and hygiene.

348
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,490
Many of you interested in sanitation like you come into public health.

349
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:59,200
Did you apply to this program programs? This is like the plague never interested in.

350
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:11,710
So I'm always hopeful that we have someone who tells me that they hope to go into the work of sanitation after they finish therapy.

351
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,650
I've yet to come across that.

352
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:26,110
So I'm going to use this opportunity to sort of talk about it, because I think we really need to bring more attention to this very important issue.

353
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:31,960
And so I want to place this in the context of India.

354
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,790
So public hygiene has historically been one of the country's biggest problems.

355
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:43,450
In 2014, India had 60% of the world's total population.

356
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:49,599
That's still practiced open defecation, and that's more than half a billion people.

357
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,050
And that's that's not that large in 2014.

358
00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:00,460
And there are obviously a lot of health issues associated with that.

359
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:11,410
And one reason why that's been sort of the state of sanitation in India is political leadership.

360
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:23,650
So for too long, India's government failed to make sanitation a priority or, you know, the building of toilets a public health priority.

361
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,550
So urban areas are becoming more and more dense.

362
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:31,690
There are some of the densest cities in the world that are in India.

363
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:37,000
And it's really difficult to update the sewage systems with the volume of the current population.

364
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:49,600
The current systems are not adequate for the volume of people in most cities in India at the time are not close to handling,

365
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:56,770
not well equipped to handling all their ways in rural areas.

366
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:03,460
This is a map showing changes from 2001 to 2011.

367
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:10,149
In rural areas for a long time, close to 70% practiced open defecation.

368
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:16,240
And not only were there infrastructure problems around that, but also education.

369
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:22,630
And a third more controversial reason why this is.

370
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,979
Some have said they influence the religion.

371
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:31,990
So the influence of traditional Hindu culture on sanitation habits.

372
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:43,360
Studies of India's populations show a strikingly higher rate of open defecation in Hindu dominated villages compared to our Muslim ones,

373
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:57,850
despite no differences in income or education or worse water supplies in the dominantly Muslim dominated villages.

374
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:04,809
And one of the explanations of possible hypotheses for these findings is, you know,

375
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:14,740
in traditional Hindu tradition, seen in some of these ancient Hindu texts that are almost 2000 years old,

376
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:22,930
and some of them, they encourage open defecation in the open spread, far from home to really avoid ritual impurity.

377
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:32,770
So some of this goes back to religious texts from a long time ago that sort of get passed down through religious practice.

378
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:38,560
So progress isn't just about building more toilets and infrastructure in India.

379
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:42,339
You have to make sure that people are actually using them and changing behavior and

380
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:47,620
attitudes and why it's really important to their health and that of the children.

381
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:59,679
So so what this sort of suggests that a good way to at the time to get India's sanitation closer to global standards would be,

382
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:09,610
to begin with, an education campaign to really build to really persuade households to build and use their own toilets.

383
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:21,040
So the total sanitation campaign in India has been in India for about 15 years now, and it's been renamed and reshaped over the past ten, 12 years.

384
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:26,710
Economic growth has made structural changes more and more possible.

385
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:36,700
The current Prime Minister of India has made clean India and the end of open defecation a priority on the top of his agenda.

386
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:42,430
And they've made great strides in the past four years with more interventions being developed.

387
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:49,580
To ensure multiple levels of compliance and sanitation coverage has really increased dramatically

388
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:57,709
since there was more of a priority named at around 2014 for the issue of sanitation.

389
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:06,980
So more toilets, a better sewage infrastructure, and this was more of a demand driven and people centered sanitation program.

390
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:16,190
They really wanted to change behavior and social norms and less focus on infrastructure, but really mobilize people to make the infrastructure happy.

391
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:19,249
So as you can see from these maps,

392
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:29,510
the provision of toilets in India has dramatically increased between 2014 and 2017 and in 2017, likely even since 2017,

393
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:37,219
there's probably been a lot more progress, but there's always a data lag in terms of actually showing, you know, the most current numbers.

394
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:40,310
But clearly there's a dramatic change there.

395
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:49,390
So some campaigners say that building toilets is not enough and more needs to really be done to reshape that.

396
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,200
You know, again, like I've said,

397
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:59,600
this issue is really multifactorial and there's an element of adding to here in addition to really building the infrastructure.

398
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:09,170
So this is a public health campaign used by the United Nations Children's Fund in the country that came out about 8 to 9 years ago.

399
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:22,190
And I'm highlighting it as an interesting example of social marketing with a bold and quirky approach unlike any sort of previous awareness campaign.

400
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,940
And this this is called Out to the Loop campaign,

401
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:32,810
and it seeks to bring young people's attention to the health hazards associated with public defecation,

402
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:38,870
which is a deep rooted social norm in the country's rural and urban slums.

403
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:42,740
And they also wanted to destigmatize toilets with this campaign.

404
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:52,150
So remind people that if left undressed, open defecation may encroach on personal space and make existence really undesirable.

405
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:58,910
And they have an animated video with a catchy song, and they had a smartphone application,

406
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:04,820
and it was really a digitally led campaign that targeted the countries.

407
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:13,820
So they made a song to increase conversations and get people to talk about it.

408
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:18,270
So I want to play that for you would like to see this.

409
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:55,969
Imagine then you're trying to grow your family and your pregnancy has developed a complication under

410
00:51:55,970 --> 00:52:02,870
Michigan's 1951 abortion law whose hands are tied restores the protections that are there now.

411
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:41,870
Yes. And also the small 11111112.

412
00:52:41,870 --> 00:53:03,700
I see how I shoot. And that's the way to do that, is that I would say you do not have any sort of.

413
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:26,930
Extreme. St Thomas lets you do that and then I step on that.

414
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:41,280
Every business that she's lucky enough to have plenty in each week.

415
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:59,129
He wants to get on with it.

416
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:05,430
Sounds like he has the money back.

417
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:10,800
He's got me thinking about that.

418
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:32,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

419
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:52,800
See what you would do in a move with me coming up with the same thing with other things.

420
00:54:56,350 --> 00:55:15,040
Super, super, super cool.

421
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:45,340
The Backstreet Boys. People want to see that same thing happening.

422
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:52,090
I think about it to think about.

423
00:55:53,080 --> 00:56:19,750
What kid is back and watch this video and just go through his reactions to this thing.

424
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:32,799
Yeah. I thought it was interesting that like the Hindi in the video didn't really, it wasn't like translated from the English.

425
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:37,450
So I was wondering why they chose to like use both languages in different ways.

426
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:46,270
I think since you say that I'm sorry, I was saying like the Hindi that they were speak that they were singing was different from the English.

427
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:52,610
So it seemed like it didn't it doesn't cater to a large audience who doesn't speak English, is what I interpreted.

428
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:58,870
Yeah, I mean, this the one I showed you was available in English.

429
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:04,989
I'm sure they translated it, but it was like the Hindi parts weren't like translated.

430
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:05,660
They were different.

431
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:15,220
So I was just wondering why they would choose to do both and not like stick with one language that was accessible to people and other reactions.

432
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:23,260
Yeah, I think it's also really interesting that they like censored it all around like a western toilet, which would be dependent on like I mean,

433
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:28,780
I wonder if you're like marketing to more rural areas as seems like an interesting strategy

434
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:33,609
rather than like a more traditional toilet which would still kind of address like I guess,

435
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:35,019
are we going for like big changes,

436
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:40,570
everyone installing toilets or is it like getting people to avoid open defecation and going to perhaps more accessible like.

437
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:45,420
Yeah, that is definitely a good point.

438
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:53,779
Like, I think a lot of the sanitation work has been towards getting these Western toilets to address that issue.

439
00:57:53,780 --> 00:58:00,970
But you raise an interesting point there. That's not necessarily of minerals across the continent there.

440
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:06,560
What they found was a lot of you know, they put them in the home for free for people to use them,

441
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:12,409
which is why they started doing a lot of work around changing our attitudes.

442
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:16,760
But perhaps this was not the only route to go.

443
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:28,040
So I showed this to my husband and he was like very offended at first.

444
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:36,290
And why would you show this to your colleagues? Yeah, but now he sort of appreciates the issue.

445
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:48,770
So what was your reaction to it? That was my husband's reaction to that first would make you uncomfortable.

446
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,170
So I'm not, like, aware of the issue that they're looking to solve.

447
00:58:53,180 --> 00:59:00,319
But my internal thought while I was watching it was like, these are literally like everywhere.

448
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:05,720
Like, you can't walk down the street without. It's just like a period, like, dramatize.

449
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,380
Oh, definitely dramatized. Yes.

450
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:19,390
Trying to make really trying to make it so undesirable, socially undesirable, to get people to act and talk about them.

451
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:25,639
Yeah. Like some of the reaction in the class.

452
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:29,090
Like they obviously voted for something that was goofy and so silly.

453
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:34,460
Maybe because it was kind of like they might feel like, oh, you, I want to share this with other people.

454
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:39,240
Like, what are you guys doing? Like, this is goofy and so stupid or something.

455
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:47,840
So they just pushing it around to other people based on like the way it was structured, like, oh, I don't know.

456
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:58,940
So do you think it dilutes the message? I know it's the message for like, um, I think because of the way people are going to react,

457
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:05,000
like they might feel obligated to like, send it to like a group chat with their friends to see how they would react.

458
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,650
So maybe like, I thought it was silly,

459
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:12,800
but then somebody from my friend group might see a message behind like just pushing it up to more and more people.

460
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:20,569
Yeah. And that was sort of the point to get more people just talking about it and sort

461
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:26,050
of create this very dramatized situation of it and get people to do it that are.

462
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:33,780
Yeah. So my kids have a book, a children's book that's called Everybody Goes.

463
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,320
I always used to think about that. This is just a silly book.

464
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:41,040
Well, now I'm saying that, like, oh, maybe there's a point in the book.

465
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:47,700
I don't know what you know.

466
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:58,350
All right. So I want to point out another sort of example into, you know, addressing this issue about it,

467
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:03,690
too, to this is around changing attitudes, not necessarily informing structure, but norms.

468
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:11,280
So another example is that no toilet, no break campaigning to really change behavioral norms in rural areas.

469
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:19,940
And the focus here was really on increasing demand. So when we talk about social marketing techniques and what they aim to do this time,

470
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:29,129
this campaign was really focused on increasing demand and they've really focused on women because under

471
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:36,930
the premise that the private benefits accrue largely for women around having a toilet in the home,

472
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:51,160
you know, there are a lot of safety issues with women having to go far out, away from the home, potentially in the dark room where they're get money.

473
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:53,640
Pretty serious safety concerns around that.

474
01:01:53,910 --> 01:02:01,290
So they sort of built this campaign under the premise that, you know, the private benefits of this really include for women.

475
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:09,660
And again, another problem is that women may value toilets more than men because they suffer proportionately.

476
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:18,090
So in Haryana state in 2000 times, it's a beautiful thing.

477
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:28,200
It's an interesting example. They they use that as a sort of test case to put this campaign in place.

478
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:40,230
And that was an interesting place to do it, because there was widespread discrimination against women, a lot more so than in other areas at the time.

479
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:48,120
So bargaining power was really sort of constrained among women because of requirements for discrimination.

480
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:55,680
So what they ended up doing was instituting those four PS that we talked about in terms of their campaign.

481
01:02:56,070 --> 01:03:00,210
So when we think about it and then we tried it in a brand campaign,

482
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:05,970
the product is really focused on toilet ownership in the home and that's what they're really trying to sell.

483
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:10,020
What is the price that you're trying to convey through this campaign?

484
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:13,230
So a lifetime of loneliness and shame in the family.

485
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:22,620
So marriage is a big deal in India and they're really trying to sort of convey through this campaign that,

486
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:26,000
you know, if you don't put a toilet in the home, a woman's African-American,

487
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:36,420
that's basically the underlying message they were trying to get across and the place they were really focused on the age group,

488
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:48,690
the wide range of marrying age group, people who are sort of around that age range where they may typically get married in their area.

489
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:57,900
And they're really focused on radio ads, billboards and really community workers to promote this message that,

490
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:01,320
you know, families don't put a toilet in the home.

491
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:08,360
Their son is likely to get married. And that's essentially the speech.

492
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:15,060
And what they found, this was a they've done some evaluations on this.

493
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:19,830
And they found that, again, this was about creating demand.

494
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:33,360
So in areas where there was like a low woman to man ratio, where there were just fewer women, they created a little more competition.

495
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:45,839
There was a dramatic increase, as you can see, from the rate from 24 to 28 with the implementation of this campaign that, you know,

496
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:57,899
when basically sort of, you know, when you have fewer women among men of marrying age, they do need to meet the demands of women.

497
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:04,680
And if the demands were to put a toilet in the home they sat on, the toilet ownership go up.

498
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:16,710
Interesting. So social marketing campaigns have been.

499
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:20,520
So, again, this is a really multifaceted issue.

500
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:24,540
And you need to do a lot of different things to sort of address that.

501
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:27,960
Health impacts. Sanitation.

502
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:36,479
But social marketing campaigns have really been critical to these priorities in

503
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,770
India to really end open defecation in terms of changing norms and attitudes.

504
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:48,410
Because, you know, one one major factor is around that you could put the infrastructure in.

505
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:54,149
But there was still this barrier of getting over norms and attitudes and really creating personal

506
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:59,550
relevance around the issue to the population in order to really mobilize and take action.

507
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:05,520
So infrastructure policies, political commitments are very important.

508
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:13,200
They're necessary for residents, but again, not necessarily enough to push it to where they want it to go,

509
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:18,480
which is why social marketing campaigns started to prop up around this issue.

510
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:24,180
So any questions around what I covered today or any reactions?

511
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:38,820
We're going to walk through more examples of social marketing campaigns over just a wide range of issues are the ones that really start to apply.

512
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:48,240
And, you know, the four piece. What do we see people sort of what are we trying to sell?

513
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:55,650
How are we trying to increase sort of demand or what are we trying to sort of get out there and in what way?

514
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:01,560
I think sometimes social marketing campaigns can be a little complicated to discern.

515
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:06,120
You know, what outcome are we looking for? What is the population focus here?

516
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:15,710
They may not always be very obvious, but I want to go through some exercises on Wednesday to look at some pretty widespread

517
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:20,880
campaigns that we see in the US around a range of issues to really dissect them together.

518
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:29,690
So anything else? Okay, well, happy Halloween.

519
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:33,629
Halloween. Now, you don't really have a great time today.

520
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:34,770
How do you want to spend?

521
01:07:40,750 --> 01:08:39,790
I don't look at what I'm going to be like with another guy and I'm like, Oh, I like to see her all one I they really want to go there is as a man.

522
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:54,510
So here we went into 20 people telling me, you know, it's going to be people who are like, oh my God.

523
01:08:54,550 --> 01:09:02,370
I'm like, okay, I'm going to have our conversation.

524
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:16,590
I turn on like watching like Halloween.

525
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:29,590
So I know that's after to be like that for where I find around hot food.

526
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:40,250
Yeah I'd rather my skin is already but I have jam on my arms are easier to handle.

527
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:51,399
It burns my legs. I don't want to write my work so we can dress like that's why it's not my work.

528
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,730
So we could dress up, but like Saturday, Sunday.

529
01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:58,110
And we're actually closed today and like.

530
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:03,840
So I didn't work Saturday or Sunday, but they actually took off and I see all the world.

531
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:11,740
Yeah, I don't know, I. I called because I wanted to go to the game.

532
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:19,480
I could have worked, but I wanted to go to the game, so I didn't ask to pick up like my favorite shop.

533
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:24,650
He was like, Are you coming? You're not in a fair.

534
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:43,710
And there is a little upset.

535
01:10:44,230 --> 01:11:03,130
I I'm a picture of her like, yeah, it was a week, but it was about doing something that I know you can't get out of the one thing.

536
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:08,350
So you guys I know she knows what?

537
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:19,110
Because I took it off the market. And so what were you doing that you think?

538
01:11:19,450 --> 01:11:23,050
Right. I feel ridiculous it.

539
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:27,220
But I'm not going door to door and I'm right here.

540
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:35,650
Oh, no, I worksman. So. Okay, I'm putting on jean with the rest of it for you.

541
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:42,430
Thank you. So I got a different area that I do not see.

542
01:11:42,490 --> 01:12:01,270
Oh, you always go and ask your doctor about trick or treating process.

543
01:12:01,570 --> 01:12:08,660
Are you dressing up to. No, I'm not sure I get home by the time it's.

544
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:12,879
Yes, yeah, yeah. How is your first positive?

545
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:18,380
I see the guy. Any.

546
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:35,650
Talk about a very simple. Well, thank you for that.

547
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:39,690
Yeah, yeah, sure. Great.

548
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:46,090
So you've been working since you've been done.

549
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:52,410
So that's why I came to the press on time today. But like you did, it came like slightly late.

550
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:59,889
It was earlier than normal. And then I was like, Yeah, I'm on time this week.

551
01:12:59,890 --> 01:13:05,380
So I just keep. Keep that like, yeah, yeah. Well, you guys are still meeting.

552
01:13:05,770 --> 01:13:11,050
That's what I was going to ask you. Should I still. Yeah, I'll just like because I think you guys,

553
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:17,800
you can say all that your situation or at least you can get the message across and sort of get that commitment.

554
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:23,260
Okay. Do you think that example was weird or. No, they they were interested in it.

555
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:27,840
Yeah. Okay. I know you're going to be dancing, but I think they were engaged, too.

556
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:33,250
I don't know why they didn't write them in a lot. Like a lot of them didn't give their reaction.

557
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:39,309
I think they didn't know what to say. Yeah, that's sort of an out there example.

558
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:53,750
But yeah, that was the end of is that Andrew, you said you work in marketing.

559
01:13:56,650 --> 01:23:10,700
Oh it's not. We?

560
