1
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:33,130
It just means that you're gonna have to do that.

2
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:47,800
I bet you run into people who have been called the mother of two.

3
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:56,940
That is also going to be there.

4
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:12,389
I like the idea that shows you how much I love you guys.

5
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:20,670
2019. My dad, he's like, Oh, you got to do that.

6
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:29,210
So I was like, it was like I was like, kind of like, Yeah, yeah.

7
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,500
I like that. It's not really a diner.

8
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:45,740
I was like, You're not gonna end up in that place.

9
00:01:51,940 --> 00:02:14,810
Yeah. So I wasn't going to go out and it was like, I may have to go next time to, like, here.

10
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:25,620
I like, even if I get into Bryan's mom Tuesdays, like my virginity class on any other days.

11
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:56,819
And I feel like it's a huge trade to operate like you got to the next semester, we have to get fired back to back to buy only 530.

12
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:04,620
And then I see you know,

13
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:30,450
how I have to take it to my 3651 man have people that started started to talk about

14
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,790
the segmentation and implementation of Ryan's on Wednesdays and with is groups

15
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:44,459
like always your friends being in the room and definitely take advantage of that

16
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:50,340
time do you plan to get you back from your intervention right up before Wednesday,

17
00:03:51,900 --> 00:04:03,090
either later today or tomorrow? So you have that concern and then next week, Monday, we have luxury.

18
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:12,030
Then Wednesday again, group time is probably one of the last opportunities for you to sort of wrap up your project,

19
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:18,890
think of groups and work on your business. And so I believe that that's what I mean.

20
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,069
Imagine that have presentations coming up.

21
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:29,729
There are so many questions about logistics next Wednesday.

22
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:35,580
Do we have like no classes for like the whole university for the day before Thanksgiving?

23
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,020
Yeah, that's right. Yes.

24
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:49,560
So it's technically not like designated a university, which is why I made it three times if I was taken by that.

25
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:55,399
Yeah, I think I'm working on Tuesday.

26
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,130
On Tuesday, I could get the number.

27
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,830
I'm so sorry. I let me look at that.

28
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,000
I really had no idea. I don't know if that's something that changed.

29
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,550
Oh, I'm so embarrassed. Okay. I'll take a look at that and make sure I said something else.

30
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,880
So you're in compliance with how the university views it.

31
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:28,910
So I just checked the academic calendar and Thanksgiving recess starts at 5 p.m. November 23rd.

32
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,870
Tuesday. Is it 2021? Sorry, my bad.

33
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:38,960
Hold on. You've got the calendar for 2017.

34
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:46,000
Oh, that was it. Okay, Thanksgiving break is November 23rd through November 25th.

35
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,790
Glancing to Watson. Yes. So you totally deserve that.

36
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:58,980
Wouldn't stay at Harvard. I was just not aware of this. So I will update this and just send it announcements or you're all aware of it.

37
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,569
So based on that, you don't have to meet as a group, you don't want to come to class.

38
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:09,480
But if you choose to use that time to hang out with your credit watchers and work on your project, you're free to do so.

39
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:17,880
But you will have designated group time on Wednesday this week, so at least you have that time.

40
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:27,110
Any other questions or comments? Okay.

41
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:37,459
Today, I want to spend some time talking about an aspect of public health interventions where the science isn't that well developed.

42
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:44,030
But I think it's important that we need to recognize it as an issue and something

43
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,900
that we really just need to keep in mind when we think about developing programs.

44
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:56,209
So I want to talk about programs that are actually reaching people who need them or who would benefit from them and hopefully

45
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:02,690
inspire some of you to develop this science a little more as you think about where you might want to concentrate your efforts,

46
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:12,530
because there's a lot to do in this area. So I want to start off by talking about citrus and scurvy.

47
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,210
So scurvy is a condition that results from a deficiency in vitamin C,

48
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:26,180
that if you leave it untreated, it can result in the loss of your teeth, neuropathy and even death.

49
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:34,070
For centuries, it was one of the leading causes of death among naval troops in 1601.

50
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,270
That's a long time ago. That's 400 years ago.

51
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:49,370
So 1601. James Lancaster, a captain of the British Navy, did an ad hoc experiment among three ships that were sailing from England to India.

52
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:57,860
And one of the ships, he gave all the sailors three teaspoons of lemon juice every day, and nobody on that ship died.

53
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,630
But 40% of the sailors on the other two ships did die.

54
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,180
This went unnoticed.

55
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:16,190
And it wasn't until nearly 150 years later that James Lancaster's experiment was repeated again and surgeries again proved to be effective.

56
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:25,009
He took another 100 years for the British Navy to actually make citrus fruits part of the diet of Navy ships.

57
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:29,450
And as a result, when they did that, scurvy was nearly eradicated.

58
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:41,900
We don't really hear about scurvy that much anymore, but it took nearly 250 years after his discovery to become part of British preventative policy.

59
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,900
So 1601 250 years later, it became part of British Preventative Health.

60
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,000
So we've done a little better since scurvy on Navy ships.

61
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,370
However, there's still a long ways to go to zero through D.

62
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:10,960
Four are the stages that the National Institutes of Health in the scientific community use to classify different stages of health related information.

63
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,890
And zero is meant to really identify problems and approaches.

64
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:23,479
T One is they're considered foundational studies teach you and you're really focused on

65
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:31,160
experiments to see if our intervention or innovation actually works and really control settings,

66
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:39,319
and that's to test internal validity. And then T three and four is meant to test whether it actually works in real world

67
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,180
settings among a variety of different populations and in different contexts.

68
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:53,650
And most of the research dollars of the federal government through the National Institutes of Health are concentrated in t zero through two,

69
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:59,360
while a fraction of the resources are really devoted to t three and four.

70
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:09,680
So as a result of this, it takes on average 15 to 20 years for most innovations to go through 33, 94 phases.

71
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:18,230
And at the end of the day, only 1 to 5% of the population actually benefits from innovation.

72
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,260
So why do you guys think?

73
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:42,220
So like I said, I think the concentration of dollars is very disproportionate in terms of application for real world settings.

74
00:10:48,130 --> 00:11:08,459
This is alarming. So there's so few reasons why this is happening.

75
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:15,300
So one, that the disproportion in funding, there's definitely a reason from a research standpoint,

76
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:20,850
science really struggles with striking this balance between internal and external validity.

77
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:31,950
So what we mean by internal validity is how well an experiment is done and the extent to which it avoids any sort of confounding.

78
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:42,270
And if the experiment is so well done, it really accounts for all the things that impacts other relationships that might impact public.

79
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:50,430
And then external validity is really the extent to which results of a study can be generalized to other situations and are people.

80
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:59,159
So with internal validity, you might focus your experiment on a very narrow population just to make sure all

81
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,530
the science of the relationship to health outcomes lines up the way we intend and

82
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:09,030
then external validity does that do those mechanisms and those relationships hold

83
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:14,610
true when you try to do the same thing and replicate it in different populations,

84
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:25,470
there's little incentive for researchers to really consider issues related to wider implementation and to a fusion of innovation when it comes to,

85
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:42,360
you know, federal requirements around research and why when funders sort of expect you to do with that money and the research you design,

86
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,720
that's changing. That's how it was for a really long time.

87
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:56,910
I would say over the last like like about the last ten years, there's been a growing recognition of this, but we're just not as far as we would want.

88
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,920
I mean, it's great that they're recognizing this a little more than we really need to

89
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:07,379
consider issues of wider implementation and the way we actually design research.

90
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:14,310
But we still have a long ways to go. So this sort of begs the question of what we do know.

91
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:19,889
We do know that some innovations become wildly popular more than others.

92
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:24,090
And we see this in a lot of sectors from fashion to technology.

93
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:30,750
There's no question that this happens. How many of you have read Malcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point?

94
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:39,250
But this a kid who is a great father, so I highly recommend it.

95
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:44,170
This is the type of stuff we're talking about today, interests here.

96
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:53,099
It's a really good book. And what the Malcolm Gladwell talks about in The Tipping Point is he really sort of goes

97
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,320
through a lot of storytelling to describe chord characteristics that make trends happen.

98
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:05,490
And he draws a lot upon some of the same factors in diffusion of innovation that we're going to talk about today.

99
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:12,420
But I want to start with some vocabulary and jargon that's often thrown around in this field.

100
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:24,660
I want to highlight some of the distinction. So the broadest term to really describe research, moving into practice and real world is translation.

101
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:33,860
This is essentially the process of going from 0 to 84, and translation is what takes about 15 to 20 years on which.

102
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:40,130
Then we have the term diffusion, and central to diffusion is communication.

103
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:46,940
How is an innovation communicated through different channels over time to various audiences?

104
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:52,279
And then you can have you can have passive diffusion where it just sort of organically

105
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,720
happens without having to sort of plan and it spreads through a social network.

106
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:07,610
Typically, these are things we describe as sort of going viral because active diffusion is more systematic and planned.

107
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:22,430
Then we have dissemination and implementation. And these are two buzzwords right now and research for all that.

108
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:31,850
And you'll hear people say things like dissemination and implementation, science dissemination and implementation, research, R&D.

109
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:41,630
And I hear that sort of thrown out quite a bit in our field now and more and more so over the past ten years.

110
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:46,430
And both mean different things and they're both very different from diffusion.

111
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,580
So they're not the same thing as diffusion does.

112
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:55,130
Dissemination is a planned and systematic way to make innovations more widely available,

113
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:00,260
and availability is really the key to just that concept of dissemination.

114
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:08,820
The concern of dissemination is primarily around evidence based interventions, and then you have diffusion.

115
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:17,070
This is about how an innovation is communicated. But dissemination is a process by which it becomes more widely available.

116
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,510
So diffusion is about how it's communicated to different audiences in dissemination.

117
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:30,329
The process by which it becomes more widely available and the innovation also does not have to necessarily be evidence based.

118
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:40,200
When you're talking about diffusion of how something is communicated to different audiences is one outcome of dissemination.

119
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,720
You want to make it available and make sure people know about whatever innovation we want to get out there.

120
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:54,720
And then there's implementation. Implementation encompasses all the strategies we use to get the innovation disseminated in specific settings.

121
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:03,570
So dissemination is more of the process, and implementation is about the strategies we use to facilitate dissemination.

122
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,200
So I want to walk you through how these terms connect.

123
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:17,520
So our ultimate goal is for an innovation to be adopted and used in a real in the real world by populations who would benefit the most from it.

124
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:23,700
And this is influenced by two things. It's influenced by dissemination.

125
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:28,140
So the planned systematic process to make the innovation more widely available.

126
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:34,050
And it's also influenced by diffusion. So how we get the word out to our intended audiences.

127
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:39,880
We know that there is diffusion is an outcome of dissemination.

128
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:48,640
We also know that diffusion is influenced by knowing our audience or doctors, that that's what audiences adopters,

129
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:56,920
the characteristics of the innovation and the characteristics of the place and setting in which we hold our innovation is adopted.

130
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,669
We also know that there are strategies that are used that directly influence the dissemination

131
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:09,700
plan and can also change how a dissemination plan eventually leads to adoption of the information.

132
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,330
So the blue boxes denote things that we know.

133
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:21,430
We know that certain innovations get adopted more quickly than others, regardless of the evidence base for the individual intervention.

134
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:29,090
The diffusion process has been studied for a really long time across a variety of fields, even beyond.

135
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,969
Oh, well, we don't have a good handle.

136
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,950
Are are the green boxes. So the green boxes is where we need.

137
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,470
We need to do a little more work.

138
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:49,030
Little is known about the best strategies to really facilitate active dissemination and rapid implementation of evidence based practices.

139
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:58,550
So so what we're really concerned about with the green boxes are, you know,

140
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,410
what sort of dissemination processes give us sort of the biggest bang for our

141
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:07,600
buck and show evidence for that arrow between dissemination and adoption.

142
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:12,910
And what sort of implementation strategies really best facilitate the adoption process?

143
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:23,380
Again, the evidence in this area is not great and there's a national push to really do a better job, as evidenced in some of their readings today.

144
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:33,970
So the barriers to dissemination and implementation of evidence based interventions

145
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:39,790
was really highlighted in your Glasgow reading and this is directly from that.

146
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:49,760
You know, the, the Guide for Community Preventative Services, evidence based guidelines for Public Health.

147
00:19:50,690 --> 00:20:01,249
Sort of show us that, you know, when they surveyed state agencies, 90% of them actually heard about different evidence based practices,

148
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:08,150
but only 20% actually reported making any sort of existing changes to their programs.

149
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:14,970
And 35% said it was on the basis of safety guides recommendations.

150
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:24,260
So it sort of begs the question of whose responsibility really is there for dissemination when state agencies aren't necessarily using

151
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:36,110
evidence based guidelines for public health to actually make changes to various programs and how it gets infused to different populations.

152
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:46,970
So challenging and presently sort of unresolved issue really concerns this fundamental question of what constitutes

153
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:53,150
evidence and when do we have enough evidence to actually translate something to populations to benefit from it?

154
00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:01,370
So there are a lot of different types of evidence that are relevant to different sort of audiences in this table.

155
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,510
Directly from your reading sort of highlights what that is.

156
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:11,630
I thought it was important enough to put on a slide which these slides are available to you.

157
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:17,959
But it really this is really about what sort of what is the best evidence and

158
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:24,140
at what point isn't it okay to disseminate something that we know might have?

159
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:39,960
So. So what are your thoughts on this? Use the best available evidence or wait until the best possible evidence is available.

160
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,100
Sort of a thorny question. What do you think?

161
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:59,490
So obviously there's an ethical component in that you don't want to do something unless it's known to be effective.

162
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,700
You wouldn't want to cause something negative. But at the same time, being completely passive is letting negative things happen.

163
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,530
So there's this idea of you're still responsible for things that you don't take action over.

164
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,510
So I would kind of fall on the side of like, if there is some evidence out there,

165
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,400
then you're probably better off getting out there and doing work and kind of adopting and,

166
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:24,659
you know, changing what you're doing as it as the evidence comes out,

167
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:29,790
because being out there is also going to set a foundation for anything that you do later on as well.

168
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:43,740
So, okay. And I was going to kind of reiterate what was said that there's kind of pros and cons for both, but I guess arguing the opposite point.

169
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:51,330
An example that comes to mind is we thought lobotomies were good and that was probably based on the best available evidence that we had.

170
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:57,719
But then as and so, you know, we started doing those and then we obviously learned that that was not really true and

171
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:04,140
could not be waited for further evidence that we wouldn't hurt people in that way.

172
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:10,920
However, if you do, you know, wait and wait and wait, then you're obviously missing the opportunity to help people.

173
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,390
So it's a bit of a give and take.

174
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:20,250
So you just you gave an example of a situation where we thought something might be beneficial, but it actually ended up being.

175
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,150
Well, I was going to say.

176
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:31,680
You can't really get to the best possible evidence without testing the current evidence to see whether improvements can be made.

177
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:40,389
And research. So that's definitely a valid point.

178
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:48,340
So you can't necessarily get to the best possible evidence if you sort of wait to withhold it from actual people who would benefit from it.

179
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:56,750
Also. I mean, how do you know if you wait, like better evidence will become available.

180
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,360
You know, because if you like, just decide not to do something.

181
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:07,340
But who's to say that you're actually going to discover more evidence in the future?

182
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:16,580
Whereas if you had acted in the past and now that you were save lives, but you didn't because you were waiting for something that might not exist.

183
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:25,400
So it's really unclear what that threshold is to decide when when is good enough by the hand over here.

184
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:35,330
Yeah. So something similar in thinking depends on how big of a difference that evidence would make because it's like a huge innovation.

185
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:38,330
Or is it just like a small step that's going to make it?

186
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,249
It also depends on what we're talking about here.

187
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:50,850
Is is are we talking about incremental science or are we talking about something pretty game changing?

188
00:24:50,910 --> 00:25:02,469
I think something very recent. I mean, the COVID vaccine was sort of a great example of this issue where it appeared that really the threshold was are

189
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:11,000
we minimizing harm to the with the best available information that we had before we could get it out to folks?

190
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:16,729
So. You know, no clear cut right answer here.

191
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:21,380
But it is something that we we definitely grapple with.

192
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,270
So there's some important takeaways with dissemination and implementation.

193
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:36,650
And so dissemination and implementation does not occur naturally and spontaneously, even when interventions are effective and seem appealing.

194
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:46,219
So these are things that we don't disseminate or implement in just an ad hoc way.

195
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,910
And it's a process. And that's not.

196
00:25:51,150 --> 00:26:00,980
Robustly documented, but it's something that's not considered to be a spontaneous sort of approach.

197
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,850
And there are theories and frameworks that are useful for guiding dissemination

198
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:10,950
and implementation there like a lot of theories that have been developed,

199
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:19,660
especially over the past ten years. And so if this is an area that's interesting to you there, you know,

200
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:26,430
you can take a whole class of just learning these theories and frameworks that are specific to this.

201
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:36,050
Passive approaches to dissemination and implementation are pretty ineffective, and that's pretty well-established and known.

202
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:46,910
Stakeholder involvement in research and evaluation processes is likely to really enhance dissemination and implementation,

203
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:51,950
and it really should be targeted to specific audiences.

204
00:26:52,580 --> 00:27:01,510
And at the agency level of dissemination and implementation approaches should be time efficient, really consistent with an organizational climate,

205
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:10,000
culture and resources, and really within the skills of a staff of the staff members and the organizational teams.

206
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:16,370
So I want to talk a little bit more about what we know.

207
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:22,090
It's a fusion and we know a little bit more about this.

208
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:27,490
So how do we get the word about the word out about what does work?

209
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:34,150
Diffusion of innovations was pieced together by Everett Rogers in 1962.

210
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:44,560
He was in the field of communications where this idea really originated, and it's actually been used in a variety of disciplines beyond health.

211
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:50,680
The purpose of this theory is to really understand how an idea or product really

212
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,300
gains momentum and spreads through a specific population or social system.

213
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,080
And the focus of this theory is on dissemination.

214
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:06,040
And I'll get to this in a little bit. When you well, when you come across models and theories in this general area,

215
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:11,440
the focus may be on dissemination, implementation or really a combination of both.

216
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:23,590
So one of the things that influences diffusion of innovation are certain characteristics of the innovation.

217
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:28,400
So this slide will be very, very important for your theory assessment this week.

218
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:34,720
So if you would like hint to put a star next to this one, you'll be using this.

219
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:42,099
So these are the characteristics that we want to think about when we think about an innovation as a relative advantage.

220
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,610
Is the innovation better than what was there before?

221
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,549
We want to think about comparative ability.

222
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:56,620
Does it fit with the intended audiences values, their norms, their beliefs, and any sort of perceived need that they might have?

223
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:02,590
Also to think about complexity. Is the innovation easy to use?

224
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:10,900
There's also trial ability. Can the innovation be tried before making a decision around whether we want to adopt it?

225
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:17,050
I'm observability. Are the results of the innovation visible and easily measurable?

226
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:20,950
Can you actually see the innovation doing something different?

227
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:26,200
There's cost. How much time and effort does it take to actually learn and use it?

228
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:33,070
So these are the characteristics of innovation programs that affect immersion and using our.

229
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,330
We also have to think about characteristics of adopters.

230
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:50,360
This also affects diffusion of innovation. And we've heard it's been a bit of a repeated theme throughout the semester that understanding

231
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:56,500
your target audience is important and diffusion of innovation really drives this point home.

232
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,820
This is a bell shaped curve or a normal distribution that Everett Rogers described

233
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:09,980
that the characteristics of those you adopt an innovation your book has,

234
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:16,429
I believe your textbook reading has like a ship curve. But I think this curve is actually a little more intuitive.

235
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:20,810
It's essentially the same thing. It just looks a little different.

236
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,600
And there are essentially five established categories.

237
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:34,070
Most of the population really falls in this little range of early majority and late majority adopters,

238
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:39,950
and essentially different strategies appeal to different kinds of doctors.

239
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:49,460
So innovators and these are people who want to be the first to try any sort of new innovation, and they're the first in line for the new iPhone.

240
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:54,220
Typically, they are venturesome and interested in new ideas.

241
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:59,510
These people are willing to take risks and they're often the first to develop new ideas.

242
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:10,250
And you really don't need to do a lot to appeal to this subset of the population in terms of trying to convince you that you don't have to do a lot.

243
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,190
And then you have early adopters, and these are people who represent opinion leaders.

244
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:20,030
They enjoy leadership roles and embrace change opportunities.

245
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:25,040
They're already aware of the need to change, so they're very comfortable adopting new ideas.

246
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:33,230
Strategies to appeal to this population includes like how to manuals and information sheets on implementation.

247
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,670
They don't need a lot of information to convince them to change the but they would benefit

248
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:47,120
from like the how to kind of make this happen in my organization or with the population,

249
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:53,330
that sort of thing. And then you have early majority of these are rarely leaders,

250
00:31:53,690 --> 00:32:06,259
but they do adopt new ideas before the average person that they typically need to see evidence that the innovation actually works and they need to see

251
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:11,329
this before they're willing to adopt it in strategies to appeal to this population

252
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:16,370
include success stories and evidence of the innovations effectiveness.

253
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:24,440
So for the majority really want to show them some evidence before they are willing to do any sort of change.

254
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:29,090
And then late majority, these folks are skeptical to change.

255
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,130
Can we adopt an innovation after it has been tried by the majority of people?

256
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:42,799
And strategies to appeal to this population include information on how many other people have tried the innovation and have adopted it successfully.

257
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:53,030
So you're really talking about norms and trying to enhance the you know, everyone else is doing it and it seems to be working fine for them.

258
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:59,120
And then you have laggards and these people are bound by tradition and tend to be very conservative.

259
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:03,900
They're very skeptical of change and are the hardest group to sort of bring on board.

260
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:12,590
Strategies to appeal to this group include statistics, fear appeals and pressure from people and other adopter groups.

261
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:22,450
So you really with the laggards, you really have to put a lot of your resources and do a lot of strategizing to try to convince them to get on board.

262
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:33,020
Very skeptical. Any questions about different kinds of adopters, these new people that were innovators,

263
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:38,899
again, that they're more like they don't feel like they don't need a lot of convincing.

264
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,110
They're they tend to be very interested in new ideas,

265
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:48,950
very interested in taking risks and trying new things so you don't have to do a lot to convince them.

266
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:05,680
So in terms of thinking about the process of adoption, a staged model process makes sense here and has often been used to conceptualize this.

267
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:17,120
So if you're trying to get someone to adopt something, you might raise an awareness to some persuasion.

268
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:24,230
Hopefully they've made a decision, they've been implemented it and you get some sort of confirmation of how it's working.

269
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:31,490
Then we have features of a setting that can also impact the diffusion of an innovation.

270
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:39,379
This isn't really a black and white science. Like most things we've learned in this course,

271
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:43,340
it tends to be a little gray and there isn't any sort of magic formula regarding

272
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:48,200
a set of conditions that make certain innovations more adaptable than others.

273
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:52,999
What we do know is that there's very it's very clear that these feature that there are

274
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,710
features of a setting that can really have a major impact on diffusion of innovation,

275
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:02,540
no matter how sound the evidence is or how much the innovation actually appeals to people.

276
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:07,880
And I'll go into a few examples to sort of illustrate what this means.

277
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:18,079
So when you talk about data needle exchange programs, this is a diffusion paradox.

278
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:27,770
And in the context of these programs really provides a very clear picture in terms of why one of these really took off and the other ones didn't.

279
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:32,660
So DARE stands for Drug Abuse, Resistance, Education.

280
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,820
When I was a kid, this is the drug prevention education I received in school.

281
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:45,790
Did any of you guys go through there? Okay, so it still continues to be used.

282
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,460
So that was definitely what I went through in elementary and middle school.

283
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:57,110
So in the 1980s, there were essentially two simultaneous epidemics happening.

284
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:02,179
There was an epidemic of crack cocaine that led to increases in street violence.

285
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:08,780
And this intensified the sort of war on drugs that was happening.

286
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:15,950
And drugs were right around that time considered a moral failing that really need to be better handled by law enforcement.

287
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:22,640
So drugs were a moral failing, and this was an issue that was really best handled by law enforcement.

288
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:31,670
And at the same time, there was also the HIV epidemic in the 1980s, especially among intravenous drug users, that got a lot of public attention.

289
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:37,490
And what this came with was a burgeoning of harm reduction,

290
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:44,350
meaning that if we can eliminate drug use, what we can do is try to limit the social patterns.

291
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,340
And as a result, needle exchange programs look for these programs.

292
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,500
What they did was they offered sterile needles, as well as HIV counseling,

293
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,320
condoms and referrals to drug abuse treatment programs and different sort of social services.

294
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,850
Needle exchange programs started in Europe and in Commonwealth countries.

295
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:14,150
And in the 1990s there were national programs that were started in Europe and Commonwealth countries,

296
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:21,410
and the research showed that these programs were actually quite effective in reducing HIV transmission

297
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:30,620
in the U.S. In the 1990s there was delivered in nearly 80% of U.S. school districts and 54 countries,

298
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:37,910
despite the fact that there was no evidence that it was actually eliminating drug use among school aged youths,

299
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,650
which was the whole point of the program.

300
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:51,560
So there was really no evidence behind there, but it was being disseminated in almost 80% of U.S. school districts, in nearly 54 countries around.

301
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:58,979
Needle exchange programs very slowly actually diffused through major U.S. cities.

302
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:06,270
And through 2004, the U.S. did not allocate any sort of federal funding to these programs,

303
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:14,190
despite the fact that there was very clear evidence that these programs were actually reducing HIV transmission.

304
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:21,570
There was pretty good evidence from that. So this lack of federal funding and backing really limited its diffusion.

305
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:28,340
So this seems a bit maddening for those who really strive for evidence based practice.

306
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:31,950
We should be doing the things where there's a lot of evidence behind them.

307
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:37,050
But the moral of the story is that diffusion happens really in a number of ways.

308
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,040
It can be based on firm evidence of effectiveness.

309
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:49,800
It can occur during a perceived crisis situation where evaluation of a program's effectiveness really comes later,

310
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:56,070
or it can be a lack of diffusion despite effectiveness.

311
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:03,930
So again, needle exchange programs, we know they work, but there was really a lack of diffusion there.

312
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:10,050
Yeah, let me just do your standard work in drug and drug abuse, resistance, education.

313
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:27,280
If it catches. So here's another example of something that has been very slow to diffuse.

314
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:33,010
So the World Health Organization's surgical checklist was developed in response to the fact

315
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:38,590
that there are a lot of errors that actually lead to death and complications after surgery.

316
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:45,860
And a lot of these errors are on the part of personnel in the operating rooms.

317
00:39:46,840 --> 00:40:00,730
I mean, has anyone read Atul Gawande his checklist manifesto, a list of because you have the same taste and perks that you do with my dad.

318
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:08,470
It's called. It's a great book.

319
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:17,210
It's not very long, but it's very engaging. So again, I'm going to highly recommend it's called Checklist Manifesto by its global there.

320
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:27,020
And he talks about how in that boat how the aviation industry implemented checklists as part of their routine operating procedures.

321
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:33,620
And when they did do that plane crash is significantly reduced as a result over the years.

322
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:40,220
So at one time in our history, plane crashes were a huge problem and happening kind of all the time.

323
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:51,650
And once checklist started to become routine in the industry, we just don't see them as often it happens, but it's not as often as it used to be.

324
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,879
So the same logic was applied to surgery.

325
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:03,460
We're having personnel in the operating room follow a checklist, reduce complications by a third, and death by in half.

326
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:11,030
You know, when you actually use the checklist and the. So those are very dramatic outcomes.

327
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:21,050
And it's probably a sigh of relief for anyone who's undergone surgery or had someone close to you actually have surgery themselves.

328
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:26,960
So this seems like sort of the logical thing to do and everyone should embrace this, right?

329
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:32,750
Yeah. Like when you're not when someone's in the operating room, everyone working in there should use a checklist.

330
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,290
Is that an expectation we've. We want?

331
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:41,030
Yes. Yes. Okay. So it's not that easy.

332
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:46,240
And it's it's not completely about the checklist itself.

333
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,610
So, again, this is something that's been slow to diffuse.

334
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:56,060
And I think people seem to be in general agreement that this should be happening all the time.

335
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:04,130
So if anyone has ever seen a tool go on to give a talk or an interview about the subject, he will tell you that.

336
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,260
And in his book, he talks about this too. Inherent in a checklist is a set of values.

337
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,990
So using a checklist actually requires a little bit of humility.

338
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:20,629
It sort of means that what I do and what I take on a checklist,

339
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:30,820
I'm embracing the fact that I'm not always right and I require some assistance with my memory and ability to rattle things off the top of my head.

340
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:33,380
And sometimes that's going to fail me at times.

341
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:41,630
So I'm kind of not invincible with my knowledge when I am adopting a checklist, especially in a surgical situation.

342
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:47,120
So these sorts of values are sort of counter to the ones that are, you know,

343
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:53,660
that tended to be part of the culture of medicine for a long time and how healthcare trains practitioners.

344
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:01,159
So as a result, there was a lot of resistance to adopting these checklists from the World Health

345
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:05,960
Organization website where they have an implementation manual for surgical checklists.

346
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:15,140
This manual explicitly states that it won't be possible to implement the checklist without sincere commitment from hospital leaders.

347
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:23,270
So chiefs of surgery, anesthesia and nursing must publicly embrace the belief that safety is a priority.

348
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,960
And checklists sort of make that happen.

349
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:34,450
And these leaders are encouraged to use it themselves and really serve as role models to diffuse it into the organization which.

350
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:47,500
So here's another example. So one of your theory assessments, you had the choice of watching and then the video on pure violence.

351
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:54,490
And some of you maybe you were wondering this after watching the video,

352
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:02,890
given this epidemic of gun violence that has sort of taken off over the past decade in this country.

353
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:13,030
How come it hasn't been implemented in very obvious parts of the country where it has potential to actually have some sort of good impact?

354
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:20,650
You know, from that video, it really showed that their approach and their program really reduced homicide.

355
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:29,860
So in the talk, doctors like Ken talked about how they received a lot of public criticism for their methods,

356
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:35,070
which had a lot of moral undertones to it in terms of public perceptions.

357
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:41,710
They have a whole section on their website really dedicated to implementation strategies.

358
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:45,100
And one of the first steps is to really engage community leaders.

359
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:54,180
So without any sort of buy in from leadership, this sort of program is likely not to diffuse because you really need to do some education,

360
00:44:54,210 --> 00:45:01,060
get buy in from leadership to sort of convince folks that this might be an approach that might be helpful.

361
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,210
So what was the moral aspect of.

362
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:13,830
Well, part of that, if you didn't get a chance to watch it, it was basically trying to reduce a program to reduce gun violence.

363
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:25,140
And part of it was training folks who have a history of a criminal history to sort of serve as violence interrupters.

364
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:29,639
And, you know, that's been part of you know,

365
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:37,170
when we assign and we talked about social cognitive theory and talking about similar others, which is why that was relevant.

366
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,000
But again, some of the moral undertones are, you know, why?

367
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,440
Why use folks with a history to why engage them at all?

368
00:45:49,460 --> 00:46:03,100
You know, I think some people don't like that or some people don't like the sort of rehabilitation approach, that sort of part of this program.

369
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:12,439
So, you know, some of this comes down to values and beliefs, which is why you can't just show that evidence to folks like it.

370
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:20,620
So it's more complicated than that in terms of trying to disseminate a program that might have a lot of benefit to folks.

371
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:37,000
Any questions about any of these examples? So here.

372
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:51,950
Here are some takeaways with diffusion. So specific properties and innovations affect the rate and extent of adoption.

373
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,920
So when we think about the innovation itself,

374
00:46:54,920 --> 00:47:02,360
we have to think about the different properties and go back to that slide I told you to start because they'll will be part of your theory assessment.

375
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:10,130
So you really want to think about those properties. You want to also think about the properties of adopters that affects diffusion,

376
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:23,930
especially a degree of innovativeness has something that influences one subset of adopters the social system where it affects diffusion,

377
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:25,999
especially the structure of the system,

378
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:36,380
its local informal opinion leaders and potential adopters of perception and social pressure to adopt and external change agents.

379
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:46,460
Individuals who can influence someone's client's innovation stage could secure adoption by showing beneficial effects,

380
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:51,409
or it can slow diffusion by revealing undesirable effects.

381
00:47:51,410 --> 00:48:01,040
So change agents can have influence on whether something gets adopted or not adopted,

382
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:06,649
and it ends up being slow to diffuse a favorable communication relationship

383
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:12,080
between the change agent and clients is really needed to speed up diffusion.

384
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:28,910
So what you can do now working this is sort of a series of steps of what you can do now when you first start to design an intervention.

385
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:34,640
So all of you are designing interventions as part of what you're doing for this class.

386
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:44,090
And if you end up taking 651 next semester for HPD students, one of your second required courses, you'll also be designing an intervention.

387
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:53,780
So program designers should be developing programs of minimal intensity needed for change rather than maximum intensity.

388
00:48:55,220 --> 00:49:05,270
You know, when we try to come up with things that are too complex, people may not see it as feasible to actually adopt.

389
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:09,110
So we really want to aim for minimal intensity,

390
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:19,900
really needed for any sort of maximum impact rather than a maximum intensity intervention where the issue might not marinate then.

391
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,149
So there's a lot of work to be done in this area.

392
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:30,590
And again, I hope some of you consider devoting your expertise to really strengthening the evidence on getting evidence based

393
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:38,420
interventions faster into the hands of people who will be helping us build that evidence of what are those strategies that,

394
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:45,920
you know, people who design interventions can actually use to reduce that time,

395
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:52,430
that that long lag time we currently have, where evidence based practice actually becomes part of mainstream practice.

396
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:57,469
We also need more research dollars devoted to this area and accountability of

397
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:03,500
researchers to make sure and practitioners in terms of any sort of program we designed,

398
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:12,079
there are plans in place for sustainability and reach and they don't just sit on their shelf, can't be done.

399
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:19,610
So we design our programs in a way that there's a plan that it can actually go straight into practice in a sustainable manner.

400
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:24,320
And we need better methods and research designs to help researchers consider

401
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:29,360
approaches to evaluation that are pragmatic and really fit into the real world.

402
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:35,629
So sometimes are some of our more classic designs to assess effectiveness.

403
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:43,370
Just don't do that. Then we need to think from a methodological standpoint how can we do things a

404
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:48,590
little bit different to sort of speed up how we build up and demonstrate evidence?

405
00:50:53,720 --> 00:51:03,950
So I'm. So I want to end by having you guys look at an activity with learning health systems.

406
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:09,709
So on today's session, I posted an article on learning health systems.

407
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:16,910
You'll learn what it actually is. And I want you guys to discuss three questions.

408
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:23,420
In small groups, mainly like How are you learning health systems?

409
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:28,970
What is their sort of relationship to implementation science?

410
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:36,100
So we're talking about a learning healthcare system. What is actually being implemented in this model five?

411
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:42,650
How would a learning health care community enhance any sort of learning healthcare system approach?

412
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:47,810
And when we think about context from diffusion of innovation that we just talked about,

413
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:55,820
what are really why concepts are really salient to implementing any sort of learning health care system or when you talk about you.

414
00:51:56,810 --> 00:52:03,770
So when and how you sort of think about these concepts in the context of learning health care systems and learning.

415
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:29,390
I know you haven't had an agenda.

416
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:46,280
Okay. Thank you. You know, the difference is, all of this is amazing.

417
00:52:46,670 --> 00:53:03,710
Yeah, but I mean, I just do what I do, and I'm like, what are you guys like right now?

418
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:24,710
And I was like, to hear all about that.

419
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:34,120
I was able to get this done.

420
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:46,010
So I think you might be able to give me a lot of time I've ever seen anything.

421
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:53,200
I mean, I know she's from approach to see.

422
00:53:53,290 --> 00:54:03,920
I was like, this is my time.

423
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:19,200
Just kidding. And, you know, I want to show you how to use the tools.

424
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:39,850
It wasn't a cut out. And it's like it's like your like flowers, you know, to trace the directions said when you just get automatic for me,

425
00:54:40,350 --> 00:55:06,950
just like so you can stretch things now and it's super easy to go out there and what is it called?

426
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:15,950
911 calls.

427
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:30,630
So I guess I have to talk to you about what's really going on.

428
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:41,780
But you just want to say this is why you don't talk to me.

429
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:56,330
I think I was talking about that. Like, I just figured, why don't we just.

430
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:22,340
It's not going to do anything. It's like, you know, I was like, Oh, thank you for like a spiritual person.

431
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:35,900
We're talking about a text that makes up because it's not like I want to say.

432
00:56:36,500 --> 00:57:02,180
I think that's what I like. But it was really kind of I just thought about the people are not just like everyone goes like, oh, they are really,

433
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:16,040
you know, you are to you know, I have a friend who's really into that sort of family and I know like what it sounds like.

434
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:32,260
It sounds like you just have to focus on something like one time.

435
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:35,470
It's like I was really about one the other day.

436
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:44,210
I don't know what it's like. This is what make me do it to other people.

437
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:53,540
Know what it's like. It's something I think everybody is trying to talk to you because.

438
00:57:53,600 --> 00:58:01,540
I know. I know. So you don't really care.

439
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:28,510
And I was like, oh, about that time because said, is that you can bring them, you know, you're not going to change it.

440
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:39,770
Like maybe it's because they had, you know,

441
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:55,900
my brother watched like the TV version of like really bad and it was like, I like there is always like you.

442
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:10,630
To show you the way they were.

443
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:17,800
Like, I was like I was like, wow.

444
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:29,380
I was like, you know, I don't remember that.

445
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:33,010
She was in a hot shot that 45.

446
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:41,860
Yeah. Yeah. It's like it's not.

447
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:44,890
I don't get, like, a rock.

448
00:59:52,300 --> 01:00:10,320
Contradictory. Someone who happens to be like this is typically like.

449
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:25,310
I know she likes you.

450
01:00:26,890 --> 01:01:31,880
I must admit, I feel like this is actually take the Senate and the House instead of telling you this evening.

451
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:38,470
I thought you should know.

452
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:44,900
I just think you need to have that conversation.

453
01:01:45,750 --> 01:02:00,800
I don't think that it was too late for me.

454
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:14,170
I don't you. I was like, oh, yeah.

455
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:25,340
I tried to find a 14 year old guy.

456
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:42,060
Yeah, I know what you did.

457
01:02:47,090 --> 01:03:09,150
You know, like three and a half hours.

458
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:16,010
Think it was important? You said it was important to me.

459
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:35,200
We finally got to make it work. I was gonna say I recommend.

460
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:50,060
It's a nice place to be.

461
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:36,460
Yeah, but I think there's something to be said about the whole thing, which is looking out for you your whole life.

462
01:04:36,710 --> 01:05:10,460
Better. Your father. There are others about seismic that another planet is not the same.

463
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:21,730
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I can actually I think it's fair to say that.

464
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:47,390
I would say that the department is actually right behind me there in the House between

465
01:05:48,770 --> 01:06:04,370
White and the fact that there's also been like a swing back to a lot of land.

466
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:09,940
Yeah. Yeah.

467
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:30,230
But I also would be overwhelmed by your education there.

468
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:45,350
But that's not the people that are sitting there.

469
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:59,370
You know, I wasn't thinking that you're not going to stay in the hospital.

470
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:17,600
You're more likely to get in my only and I just don't doing that for all the time I things like that you

471
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:36,440
don't I think then if I take that how do you think I'd be able to take anyone who's going to take this one?

472
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:45,070
Several times I feel like.

473
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:52,170
I just feel like what you just said.

474
01:07:52,310 --> 01:08:03,630
I didn't know that. Oh, I'm okay.

475
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:11,370
We are on high school. Anything like that, it's more than that.

476
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:20,720
It's a waste of time. It's like, I don't know what my level might be.

477
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:36,830
Anything. I need to do things any time soon.

478
01:08:36,830 --> 01:09:04,370
Be a spicy. It's going to be like today you started know it's like you went for something else.

479
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:11,959
Okay. What's going on? I think some of you are still discussing plan in our last few minutes together.

480
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:20,000
Let's just debrief. So, you know, when you think about some of the concepts we talked about today,

481
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:26,570
what's being implemented in a learning healthcare system, what are they trying to implement?

482
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:42,170
I know one of the main matches the issue was like improving their data infrastructure,

483
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:46,160
like being able to more effectively collect data about the patient and health care interactions.

484
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:55,010
Okay. So one of the things is a data infrastructure that is trying to implement this kind of a learning health care system.

485
01:09:55,580 --> 01:10:07,690
What else? Yeah.

486
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:13,929
Just add on to the maximum saying I'm that they're trying to take that so like they can

487
01:10:13,930 --> 01:10:18,970
improve the data to improve the overall like patient provider experience and healthcare.

488
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:26,380
So being able to create a data infrastructure but also act on the data that they

489
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:31,780
collect once the structure is created to be able to actually make improvements.

490
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:42,970
So using data is, you know, a form of it's like evidence backing around any sort of change they hope to implement.

491
01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:46,990
So when we think about concepts from diffusion of innovation,

492
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:55,240
what's sort of particularly salient to the implementation of a learning health care system or learning health care community?

493
01:10:57,610 --> 01:11:02,950
Did some of those concepts sticking out to you are diffusion of innovation, and if so, which ones?

494
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:11,139
Yeah. I thought it was neat that they said that there could be financial assistance for

495
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:17,650
the community stakeholders instead of like I think it's like because it's like,

496
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:23,350
yeah, the community should be involved and should be involved, but it's also time and work.

497
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:26,950
So people should be paid like compensated for being able to be there.

498
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:36,219
So they address the subcomponent, of course, in terms of, um, you know, appealing to actually, um,

499
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:43,150
taking up this innovation, sort of addressing the issues and clear issues, of course, that may come to light.

500
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:49,840
I think compatibility because they focus a lot on the intended audience as a community.

501
01:11:51,010 --> 01:12:01,089
So compatibility. So really ensuring that it's, you know, the focus is really with the particular community where this would be implemented.

502
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:08,050
So thinking about the characteristics of that and how and when the beliefs and values of the community.

503
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:16,030
Thing to like. Like another thing to add on to compatibility is like with the second question,

504
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:19,569
we're talking about the health care community and how it enhances the HHS.

505
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:22,900
It's like the, like restructured the way health care is defined.

506
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:27,519
So like, like the one is like a noun versus like an adjective.

507
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:36,069
So like basic that like initially health care, they're saying is like the support system that like allows for health care system to exist.

508
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:39,850
Whereas the way they're trying to look at it is like how does a provider interact

509
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:44,410
with the patient and like how does all of the improve the health care experience?

510
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:48,550
Like the way they're redefining the word basically to fit what they're trying to do.

511
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:58,750
Yeah. So how does this sort of instead of being sort of a transactional service, it's really about enhancing an experience and.

512
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:08,810
And they seem like the health care community and the learning health care system,

513
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:15,610
they may have synergies in that in that approach to achieve that name.

514
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:25,340
Any other last thoughts on how you scientific implementation concepts show up for a learning health care system in the community?

515
01:13:30,110 --> 01:13:37,280
Yeah I know we want to later paragraphs we talked a lot about how like sort of like the place and setting and how that affects the diffusion of ideas.

516
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:40,490
Um, terms of, like you mentioned, like churches, libraries,

517
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:44,540
farmers markets and fire stations are like could be examples of important community

518
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:48,830
resources that physicians to interact with to sort of increase trust in the community.

519
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:49,590
Yeah.

520
01:13:49,610 --> 01:14:00,800
So using actual like trust entities within the community and using those as a place where health care and health care providers can really intersect.

521
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,510
Trial ability was pretty obvious here.

522
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:14,480
That's why he's sort of at the core of learning health care systems, being able to try things and see the results as well.

523
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:20,170
So why did he use this as a first sort of example?

524
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:28,480
And then your theory assessment this week, you have some choices in order to think about a wide variety of examples and

525
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:34,299
applying these characteristics of diffusion of innovation to rally support.

526
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:44,920
Why the thing you choose to focus your example on was either really did diffuse or did not diffuse and why.

527
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,990
So it's a interesting read.

528
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:57,879
You now open up on Wednesday and on Wednesday again you'll have group work and hopefully by tonight or at least tomorrow morning,

529
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:03,160
you'll have feedback on the interventions. So that's something you can work on with your groups.

530
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:24,340
So I think that fair and I will see you guys next week each other.

531
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:27,579
So you want me to write?

532
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:46,170
You got to really only have one site where you're going to do it.

533
01:15:46,420 --> 01:16:03,550
All right. I am going to do it like that.

534
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:08,890
I was like, okay, I was having a birthday party.

535
01:16:09,670 --> 01:16:25,250
I was like, Oh, what do you mean? I'll be glad to be like, You wrote my class anyway.

536
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:34,360
You just don't talk to me. It's I get I have this other New York guy who I always the person I get the stuff.

537
01:16:34,640 --> 01:17:17,010
So I don't think it's how to take so much money because I know the billionaire class near me now, but at least has to excuse me, you know?

538
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:30,780
You know, I mean, know it's like, why would I give up my job and having to do that, most of my jobs that require no connection.

539
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:35,200
I couldn't. The other day I texted you with like 3 hours of really thought.

540
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:50,890
I think I was I was going to make you got it I'm so I say that read like I thought like this is just like you in a reservation.

541
01:17:52,000 --> 01:18:02,080
Oh yeah. We were trying to get one with my friends and I tell her, mom and I think we're going to Black Girl really good.

542
01:18:02,530 --> 01:18:18,009
One of my friends works Hope Medium. Yeah. Oh, we're supposed to do her for something.

543
01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:23,560
Chills, Jersey. I remember this was pretty couch.

544
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:42,489
See how it was about like it's not it was very particular about what do think you can

545
01:18:42,490 --> 01:18:56,950
do I can imagine this is a jury of your dad using I have to say this technically,

546
01:18:56,950 --> 01:18:59,040
yes. If you don't want to start doing it,

547
01:18:59,490 --> 01:19:12,970
if you want to keep this in an article that it as to say that they feel like they're going to respond to it like that.

548
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:27,850
Excited to be highlighting Jackson's stuff. I don't know that even an event like it was a year.

549
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:31,620
This is also one more thing that I need this year.

550
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:37,330
So you can see why someone when I was going to our discussion that we had in class.

551
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:46,390
I use that too. But then not knowing that that was not the time that we had in his life.

552
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:59,230
So we had our meetings scheduled and then I only got the presentation scheduled last week because I've been that time.

553
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:07,459
Yes, but like but I'm dealing with that. And she was like, my reason or no, I'm free after I Google account is for my dad.

554
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:13,220
But when you want to make them this I've comment so now like the kids are teaching me because is that okay?

555
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:17,360
Because I don't I do have to say no to me. Yeah.

556
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:21,800
Okay. So I'll clean up space. You have 7000. Yeah.

557
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:26,810
Okay. Yeah. Find out what it me I just said to then.

558
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:31,010
Just clean. Dude, I need to meet. See?

559
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:34,310
Zero address. Yeah.

560
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:38,750
This is he ruined trash because you studied. You saved me.

561
01:20:40,430 --> 01:20:47,750
So what do I do? Like, just let me hear you like boy and delete everything.

562
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:52,040
Yes. Live like here. You like you.

563
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:56,120
Click on it, dude. Yeah, but that's going to take forever.

564
01:20:56,660 --> 01:21:00,379
I know, but you don't have to do everything just clear, like, a little bit.

565
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:03,710
Yeah, there you go. So, like, and then you can do it that way.

566
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:13,630
Yeah, but then he's just going to do it. Them? No. What if there is something that's important and you have no idea?

567
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:17,120
Like, this is just like people don't mindlessly delete everything.

568
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:31,450
Most of it is crap. Okay? You clean up space and [INAUDIBLE] like I don't even know and I'm not getting any emails and it sucks.

569
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:39,410
So I just go like, that's what I would do.

570
01:21:39,410 --> 01:21:42,860
You have a class? Yeah, 230, unfortunately.

571
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:51,410
I'm sorry. I'm just going to steal your ass. Oh, I'm so sorry.

572
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:55,160
Thank you. Is this, like, our attendance? Yeah.

573
01:21:55,220 --> 01:22:03,900
Oh, cool. But how do you do that? You know, like there are some days when I've left it on the table, but, like, I don't know if I know your face, so.

574
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:08,210
Yes. What you see is, like, I never grab mine.

575
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:13,220
Like I do. Sometimes I do. But, like, lately, Anna's just been grabbing mine, so, like, I don't know.

576
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:16,549
But you see me? Yeah, I see you, but I don't know everybody.

577
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:20,570
Unfortunately, I feel bad, but there's a lot of people in this class, so.

578
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:23,920
Yeah. So it helps some people take them home. Yeah.

579
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:35,390
But I do think. Yeah, I have to tell them excuse me, this is my like I think my dad and they always take it home.

580
01:22:35,390 --> 01:22:38,450
Oh no, no, I don't know.

581
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:42,350
Maybe I don't know her. Really. No, her face. Yeah. She doesn't belong to us though.

582
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:50,580
Yeah. Yeah. But one person she takes pics of a lot of time that you mothers that you've had this many absences so.

583
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:54,800
Yeah. And she was like, I have never missed the class. Like, Oh, I'm so sorry.

584
01:22:55,340 --> 01:23:00,169
Well, you would know because she's been taking it at home. Yeah, and I didn't know her face at all, but now I do.

585
01:23:00,170 --> 01:23:08,270
I never forget it. Sometimes I was able to clear up your account.

586
01:23:09,890 --> 01:23:13,400
Why? Like, I don't understand. Like, I deleted this many emails.

587
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,550
And why is it you I can just delete on?

588
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:23,080
Yeah. If you can select all that clear section.

589
01:23:23,150 --> 01:23:31,090
No. There's no.

590
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:41,280
She? Sometimes they day to too.

591
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:47,480
I have to do this by my coaching, but then that is still 530.

592
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:50,700
But I am going to thank you.

593
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:54,879
That's from five right here. And then meanwhile I thought,

594
01:23:54,880 --> 01:24:04,960
I'll just do and just work on my article because I don't want to work on it thinking I'll just stay here because I'm starting at 230.

595
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:11,469
What if I'm not meeting? Like, what if I don't get home on time to attend the event?

596
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:15,370
Psychologist Stay here. Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

597
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:19,500
Where are you going to sit for the event? Like, because it sounds.

598
01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:25,870
It's a zoom in. I was like, in person.

599
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:37,430
Do you have the email? Thank God for the fact that we have this.

600
01:24:40,580 --> 01:24:44,200
Or GBH in. There you go.

601
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:57,070
Oh, yeah. We're we're sharing my training wager and my training in three months.
