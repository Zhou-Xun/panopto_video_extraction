1
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,115
We've talked in the other modules

2
00:00:11,115 --> 00:00:13,020
about how public
health outcomes can

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,969
differ sometimes very radically

4
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:16,830
across countries
around the world,

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,575
but we haven't really
explored why that might be.

6
00:00:19,575 --> 00:00:21,270
In this module, we're
going to focus in on

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,740
two important concepts that can

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,360
help explain those differences,

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,200
the Demographic and
Epidemiologic Transitions.

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,450
So these are the
two major types of

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,120
transitions we'll
consider in this course.

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,650
Let me give you
definitions of both.

13
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,675
So a Demographic Transition

14
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:39,185
is a shift towards lower
birth and death rates

15
00:00:39,185 --> 00:00:41,090
that occurs as
populations move from

16
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,225
low-income economies to
high-income economies.

17
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:46,430
Then, an Epidemiologic
Transition is

18
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,010
a shift from
infectious diseases to

19
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,394
more chronic
noncommunicable diseases

20
00:00:51,394 --> 00:00:53,975
as the primary health
problems in a population.

21
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:56,660
We'll explore both of
these as we go on.

22
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,300
Let's take a deeper look at what

23
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,145
a Demographic
Transition looks like.

24
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:02,390
So the graph you're looking at

25
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,580
here is showing us a couple
of different things.

26
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,590
We've got on the x-axis the year,

27
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,560
and on the y-axis we're looking
at cumulative birth rate,

28
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,670
that's the blue line,

29
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,230
and the cumulative death rate,

30
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,899
that's the red line, as
well as total population,

31
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:16,160
that's the black line.

32
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,540
You'll see that this model is

33
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,100
broken up into four
different stages.

34
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,400
So let's look at stage one,

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,750
we would call this
the pre-modern stage.

36
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,170
Here, you can see that

37
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,850
the birth and death rates are

38
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,950
quite high and quite variable,

39
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,025
and the total population
is relatively stable.

40
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:32,660
If we move to stage two,

41
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,755
we would consider this an

42
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:36,290
urbanizing and
industrializing stage.

43
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,240
Here, the cumulative birth rate

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,800
remains elevated and pretty

45
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,930
variable but the death
rate starts to drop

46
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,150
off pretty dramatically
and as a result,

47
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,605
we start to see a sharp
increase in total population.

48
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:49,700
Stage three, we
would consider to be

49
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,620
a mature industrial stage.

50
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,960
Here, the death rate
basically bottoms

51
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,360
out and the birth rate
continues to decline

52
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,980
until it approaches
the death rate

53
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,600
at the end of this stage and

54
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,800
the total population has

55
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,325
continued to grow
pretty substantially.

56
00:02:03,325 --> 00:02:04,920
By the time we reach stage

57
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,200
four or the
post-industrial stage,

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,450
the total population
has stabilized,

59
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,150
and the birth and
death rates have both

60
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,940
stabilized at a very
similar level as well.

61
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,540
So that's the demographic
transition in a nutshell.

62
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,520
We can actually look at what

63
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,990
the Demographic Transition looks

64
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,280
like in the United States.

65
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,360
So the data I'm going to show

66
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,340
here are from the years 1900,

67
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,660
that's the graph on the left,

68
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,310
to 1950 in the center,

69
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,995
to 2000 on the right.

70
00:02:29,995 --> 00:02:32,120
So let's look a
little more closely

71
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,100
at the 1900 data on the left.

72
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,240
So what we're looking at here

73
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,220
is percent of population so this

74
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,170
is a histogram or showing

75
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,375
the distribution
of the population.

76
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,760
We've got males on the left
and females on the right,

77
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,515
and then we have
different categories of

78
00:02:45,515 --> 00:02:48,865
age groups going from
0-4 at the lowest,

79
00:02:48,865 --> 00:02:51,370
to age 80-84 at the top.

80
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,910
What you see here is a very

81
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,040
triangular shaped
distribution where

82
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,470
the vast majority of
the population is

83
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,245
quite young between
0 and 20 years old,

84
00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:02,060
and there's a vanishingly
small fraction

85
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,480
of people over the age of 70.

86
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,930
If we fast forward to 1950,

87
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,290
in the center graphic here,

88
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,830
you can see the shape of the
distribution has changed,

89
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,870
it resembles more of

90
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,120
an arrowhead shape
than a triangle now.

91
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,700
So we still have a
fairly large population

92
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,170
at the very youngest age but

93
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,850
we actually see some truncation

94
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,760
here between ages 10 and 24,

95
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,620
and basically, a shifting of

96
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,050
ages towards the upper
end of the distribution.

97
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,100
So we now start to see

98
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,375
an increasing number
of people over age 70.

99
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,610
Then finally, shifting
to the year 2000,

100
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,060
you can see the distribution

101
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,010
here is quite differently shaped.

102
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,240
So we are seeing

103
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,180
a smaller population fraction
at the youngest ages.

104
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,860
We actually have a
bulge basically,

105
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,830
between ages 40
and 54, and again,

106
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,650
a widening of the upper age
categories to where now,

107
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,420
we have a fairly
significant part of

108
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,665
the population that's
greater than age 70.

109
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:56,280
So that's the
Demographic Transition.

110
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,180
Let's talk about the
Epidemiologic Transition here.

111
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,910
I'd like to focus in on this
graph now for a moment.

112
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,800
So on the x-axis,

113
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,750
we're looking at
Epidemiologic Transition

114
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,025
happening over time,

115
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:09,680
and on the y-axis we're
looking at mortality rate

116
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,740
from low at the bottom to
high at the top of the graph.

117
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,480
Let me draw your
attention to the box at

118
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,760
the upper left corner called
least-developed countries.

119
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,350
So this would be our low-income

120
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,940
countries of which we find many,

121
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,355
for example, in
Sub-Saharan Africa.

122
00:04:22,355 --> 00:04:25,280
These countries begin the
Epidemiologic Transition with

123
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,320
very high death rates from
communicable diseases,

124
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,600
that's the blue
line that goes from

125
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,760
the upper left corner
to the lower right.

126
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,350
So they begin the transition with

127
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,480
very high rates of mortality

128
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,160
from communicable disease
and those tend to

129
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,890
decline over time
through the transition.

130
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,020
Let's look at the upper
right-hand box now.

131
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,050
So these are high-income
countries like the US countries,

132
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,760
and Western Europe, and Japan.

133
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,310
These countries actually start

134
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,020
the Epidemiologic Transition with

135
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,320
a quite low mortality rates
from chronic disease and then

136
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,270
chronic or
lifestyle-related diseases

137
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,830
tend to increase over time.

138
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,230
So things like
diabetes, and obesity,

139
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,910
and hypertension begin to
drive the mortality rate.

140
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,500
Now countries that are in the
middle, for example, India,

141
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,560
these middle income
countries suffer

142
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,780
the so-called double burden
of disease where they

143
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,610
haven't fully
transitioned away from

144
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,250
communicable diseases
being a major burden,

145
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,300
but they've started to see

146
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,300
these more modern
lifestyle-related diseases

147
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,350
come into play as well.

148
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:25,070
So they are truly facing
the worst of both worlds.

149
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,980
We can look at this
on a global level by

150
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,530
considering so-called
Group 1 Death,

151
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,730
so these would be considered

152
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,770
communicable disease
deaths on the

153
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,660
left-hand graphic
versus Group 2 and

154
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,850
these are noncommunicable
diseases.

155
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,070
So if we look between 2002

156
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,385
and all the way
predicted out to 2030,

157
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,765
we see that virtually,

158
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:48,020
every type of leading
communicable disease

159
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,580
a Group 1 death is basically

160
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,860
expected to decline over time.

161
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,210
On the other hand, looking at

162
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,445
Group 2 deaths on
the right-hand side.

163
00:05:55,445 --> 00:05:58,760
So again, these chronic
diseases we see are expected to

164
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,780
increase between 2002 and
predicted out to 2030,

165
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,430
and these both are
a direct result

166
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,380
of countries
transitioning through

167
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,960
this Epidemiologic
Transition away

168
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,770
from infectious disease and
towards chronic disease.

169
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,740
We can look at this data in
a couple of different ways.

170
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,200
Actually, this
fairly complex graph

171
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,450
is showing deaths that
are attributed to

172
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:23,210
19 leading risk factors
around the world for

173
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,820
the year 2004 and the
different colors of

174
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,460
the bars indicate different
country income level.

175
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,975
So the almost black
bar is high-income,

176
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:32,570
the blue bar is middle-income,

177
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,640
and the red bar is low income.

178
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,190
So let's zoom in on areas
where the black bars,

179
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,620
the high-income countries
are well-represented.

180
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,840
That would be things like
high blood pressure,

181
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,965
tobacco use, overweight and
obesity, and cholesterol.

182
00:06:45,965 --> 00:06:49,670
On the other hand, if we
look at ailments or death

183
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,540
causes here that have larger
blue bars or middle-income,

184
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,325
again, we see high
blood pressure,

185
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:58,940
tobacco use, high blood glucose,
overweight and obesity,

186
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,685
and alcohol use
especially jumps out as

187
00:07:01,685 --> 00:07:03,260
a risk factor that's

188
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,535
predominantly targeted towards
middle-income countries.

189
00:07:06,535 --> 00:07:08,690
Then, if we look at
causes of death that

190
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,000
are most predominant for
low-income countries,

191
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,165
we see that, for example,

192
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,540
high blood pressure is
still a factor there,

193
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,535
but things like unsafe sex,

194
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:18,785
and childhood underweight, and

195
00:07:18,785 --> 00:07:21,190
unsafe water sanitation
and hygiene,

196
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,849
and things like vitamin
A and zinc deficiency,

197
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:25,955
these are characteristic
specifically

198
00:07:25,955 --> 00:07:27,650
of low income countries.

199
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,900
So again, we can look
here and see that

200
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,110
the low and middle income
countries are either starting

201
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,020
or midway through this
Epidemiologic Transition

202
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,395
moving towards more
chronic diseases.

203
00:07:39,395 --> 00:07:41,930
We can also actually visualize

204
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,520
the epidemiologic
transition right

205
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,630
here in the United States.

206
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,450
So if we compare the top
leading causes of death

207
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,780
as a percentage of all
deaths in the US for 1900,

208
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,965
that's the graph on the left,

209
00:07:51,965 --> 00:07:54,230
compared to 1997 on the right,

210
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,730
we see some stark differences.

211
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,020
So again, looking
back to the year

212
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,865
1900, we see pneumonia,

213
00:07:58,865 --> 00:08:03,140
tuberculosis, diarrhea,
injuries, diphtheria.

214
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,020
So five of the top
10 leading causes

215
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,550
of death are basically

216
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:12,110
communicable diseases in
1900 compared to 1997 where,

217
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,440
if we scan quickly for
communicable diseases,

218
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,870
we basically see
pneumonia, and influenza,

219
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,170
and HIV infection, and
the rest of the top 10 in

220
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,620
1997 are more chronic
diseases or injuries.

221
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,370
So here's a great example
of a country that's gone

222
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,200
through the Epidemiologic
Transition in

223
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,095
a period of less than 100 years.

224
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,315
I'd like to wrap up by

225
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,100
pointing out some
different countries around

226
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,300
the world that are at

227
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,255
various stages of the
Epidemiologic Transition.

228
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:43,670
So here, we're looking
at the orange bars as

229
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,415
the years of life lost due
to communicable diseases,

230
00:08:46,415 --> 00:08:49,710
green is years of life lost
to noncommunicable diseases,

231
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,260
and blue are years of
life lost to injury,

232
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,600
and you can see we
have a range of

233
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,505
different countries
represented here.

234
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:57,320
So let's pick out
some countries that

235
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,690
are on the lower end
of the income scale,

236
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,685
for example, Kenya and Haiti.

237
00:09:01,685 --> 00:09:02,900
You'll see, for both of

238
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,030
those two countries,
the orange bar,

239
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,675
communicable diseases dwarfs
the noncommunicable diseases

240
00:09:08,675 --> 00:09:10,670
and injuries as a primary cause

241
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,660
of death or years of life lost.

242
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,240
So those are
low-income countries.

243
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,340
If we look more at a
middle-income country,

244
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,025
for example, we could
look at Vietnam here,

245
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,710
where noncommunicable
diseases remain

246
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,630
an important contributor to

247
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,970
mortality but they're
about tied now with

248
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,085
communicable diseases
and injuries

249
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:30,160
are sort of a distant third.

250
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,660
Then we can look, by contrast,

251
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,070
at a high-income country like

252
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,480
the US on the far right here,

253
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,520
you can see communicable
diseases now

254
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,655
represent a very small fraction
of years of life lost,

255
00:09:40,655 --> 00:09:43,340
noncommunicable
diseases is by far,

256
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,320
the bigger contributor
to years of

257
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,355
life lost followed by injuries.

258
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:51,410
So again, there are
huge differences in

259
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,335
health outcomes and health
equity around the globe,

260
00:09:54,335 --> 00:09:57,290
and while these differences
all represent challenges,

261
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,630
we need to acknowledge
that they also reflects

262
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,555
these Demographic and
Epidemiologic Transitions.

263
00:10:02,555 --> 00:10:04,370
As we keep those things in mind,

264
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,755
that should better
enable us to design

265
00:10:06,755 --> 00:10:08,840
appropriate public
health interventions

266
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,800
to improve health and
achieve health equity.
