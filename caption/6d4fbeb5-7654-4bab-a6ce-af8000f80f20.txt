1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,510
Okay. Can I just turn on the recording now?

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,950
And this is our campus Web site. So throughout the semester, we'll use this website to upload all the lecture.

3
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:26,139
And while for the lecture notes, I mean, it's I just realized that this computer with this screen here, it doesn't allow me to write on the screen.

4
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:36,100
So I cannot write directly on the screen. So I may need to write on the board, which is fine for me, but I'm so you guys will take notes anyway.

5
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,360
So, um, so then the lecture NOLs, I guess.

6
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,040
Then we'll see whether. Um.

7
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:51,630
Yes, amylase is you guys taking the notes? I mean, don't matter whether I'm running on the swing, I'm writing on the board.

8
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,860
So this side here, this is one probably maybe I'll switch to student view.

9
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,870
So that's what you guys will see.

10
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,930
And it's slightly different from what I see in my account.

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:16,590
So you will see files now. Thrustmaster. I will upload the homework assignments and also my solutions and some other documents.

12
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,489
Naturally, the documents under this file create a different folders.

13
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:27,510
Currently Verizon there is. I uploaded the core syllabus which we will go over in a few minutes.

14
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,160
So this is the file folder and then we have the recording, right?

15
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:42,600
So we will record all the lectures. And then if you miss any lectures, then you can definitely log on to campus and watch those recordings.

16
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,690
And then we have grace and then to completion.

17
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:56,550
So yeah, I guess that the as are probably the most relevant folder is the files folder and an Apple recording folder.

18
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:05,020
And later of course then after assignments I will create an assignment folder and also the assignment module.

19
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,070
Okay. So but anyway, that's the course.

20
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:23,150
Kemba's side. Now let's go over the course syllabus together because this contains some very important information.

21
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:45,300
So we download hobby. I'll open the pdf.

22
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,180
Okay. It's.

23
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:19,210
But since sense that it doesn't allow me to give them any reason I would just open it using.

24
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,620
What can we do to make it all right?

25
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,210
Okay. So as you guys probably already know, this is a balanced but balanced difference.

26
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:44,180
This is sort of we can consider this as a continuation of Section two or we're a more advanced level of six or a six or two.

27
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:53,900
It was about inference where essential to recover the main concepts and also of course some patterns or details, but not a lot.

28
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,970
But in this course it's one this courses that we're going to be a lot more theoretical,

29
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:10,840
where we will see technical details and we will see the main purpose of this course is to cover the commonly seen surgical methods,

30
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:17,090
the techniques that people use in developing methods, especially for community studios.

31
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:23,329
And I guess the main reason that you are sitting here, you're taking this course is because you are that is,

32
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:29,150
you are considering applying for or maybe you have already applied, but you are you are considering a period program.

33
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,990
So if you are not, then this is small.

34
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:40,280
We can definitely talk about this may not be the ideal course if you are not thinking about opportunity program because indeed

35
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:50,899
this is the but this courses actually gives the training for for for purely your vision research is all in this sense.

36
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,690
This this is going to be a quite a theoretical course and we are going to see a theory and have your theory.

37
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:03,710
And so there are three major topics that we are going to cover.

38
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:12,920
We have already seen this. We have already seen all these in from, say, six or two important estimation, have a necessity.

39
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:24,620
And you seen in theory, but it is just on here we have we are going to have a much more detailed and much more theoretical coverage of all these.

40
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,169
So now about me myself. So my name is Space.

41
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,670
So how many of you probably already know me from six also.

42
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,770
Right? So I will be the instructor for this course.

43
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:42,650
Actually, I'm very happy to teach this course. I think that I enjoy teaching this course a lot.

44
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,000
So. So yeah.

45
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:56,120
And the meeting time courses from Monday, Wednesday 10 to 1130 and we are meeting here and this is my email address.

46
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,600
So if not throughout the semester, if I have any questions,

47
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:07,010
I guess the best way to reach me is to send me an email and my office is on the fourth floor.

48
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:17,929
It's actually just around this, this, this place right upstairs on the fourth floor of the obviously drinking fountain and there is a in there.

49
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:25,550
So office hour now, Arnold I schedule office hours, which will be Monday Wednesday right after our lecture.

50
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,120
So I'm 32, 1230 or by appointment.

51
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:36,170
If you cannot make this to this office hours, then then we can tabulate and schedule some appointments.

52
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,190
And the currently scheduled office hours will be in my office.

53
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:44,179
But what we'll see depends on how, depending on how many of you show up in office.

54
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,560
Our needed I will I will book on another rule.

55
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,810
But for now I just use my office. I will office for an hour.

56
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:06,860
Now the prerequisites here, I think most of you, if not all, have must have taken six or one six or to end it, or one or equivalent.

57
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:17,410
If you have it, please let me know and let's have a have a chat and we will figure out a way because this course we rely heavily on,

58
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:29,100
on these prerequisites. So so it's actually quite crucial for you guys to have taken these prerequisites to, you know,

59
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:37,370
to to be able to learn prefer well in this course now for textbooks, we don't have any monetary textbooks.

60
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:46,550
So all these textbook listed here there are optional some of these textbooks you might be able to find in our library.

61
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:54,170
So some of you I mean, you might be able to find hard copies of the Chinese version online.

62
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:59,870
But anyway, so here these are all great textbooks.

63
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,360
So the first one,

64
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:14,790
this is we the first few chapters are the first few on and this one at least four point estimation where we're going to use this textbook a lot.

65
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,710
We'll focus on this textbook, the last symbol, as I will, testing.

66
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,180
This is. Yeah.

67
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:37,460
This is actually a chapter of Handbook of Animal Magic, so it might seem a little bit surprising that we are using a little chatbot from the classics.

68
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:41,850
But it turns out that for for those of you who actually know,

69
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:49,339
I have read papers in Mexico and those guys are doing quite a theoretical statistics, some really good research.

70
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:55,970
So there is no essential difference between it's sort of theoretical statistic and what they are doing.

71
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:04,250
So this is a great textbook. It has a very nice cover because many textbooks while there are many great textbooks.

72
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,780
But some of them, they do not cover at a level that is very easy to read.

73
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,770
And many of the textbooks, they start from matter of theory.

74
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,910
So sometimes it's a bit hard to read those books.

75
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:25,639
But this one, this one did. It is easy to read.

76
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:33,080
And also it focus on the intuition, not only the theoretical results that have new details, but also the intuition behind those results.

77
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,100
Because although we are going to talk a lot about that, right?

78
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:45,320
Well, it helps understanding the intuition, like seeing the education behind the theorems,

79
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,840
behind the results is also very important with us because all this digital theory,

80
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:56,010
I mean, in the end, they should be based on they should come from some practical problems.

81
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:02,930
We are not I mean, this is not a mathematical course. So what we are learning here, we come from real world problem.

82
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:09,799
But it is just that now when we we make things more general, so we see concrete problem.

83
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:15,110
Now we do a general theory and general theory can be applied to solve some other concrete problems.

84
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:23,270
So, so in this sense, now understanding the intuition behind the results, although we are able to see that there are other details,

85
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,100
but understanding that the reason behind terror and theoretical results is very important.

86
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,460
So this tangible result is a great tactical necessity.

87
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,170
It talks about the reason behind the results.

88
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,409
And also this is actually available online. So you can you can if you Google it,

89
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:49,610
you will definitely find it in what maybe we can just do it very quickly here since we are connected to the Internet.

90
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:13,170
Okay. So we can see that, uh, uh, yeah, this is, this is the PDF of that book chapter.

91
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,310
So, you know, this is quite a habit.

92
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:26,610
I mean, it's considered well, it's a book chapter, so it's not I mean, compared to other textbooks, it's not 135 pages.

93
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:35,060
So it's not too much. But but I don't think you guys will have time to read from the very beginning.

94
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,550
From the very yeah. Because you are taking many other courses.

95
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:46,470
So and also that's not our expectation. It's not exactly how this course, but it's just that for the topics that we cover in our lecture,

96
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,030
I mean, you could actually if you think you want to learn more details,

97
00:11:51,030 --> 00:12:00,419
you want to see more discussion because in now, of course, because of the time limited, we cannot, you know, focus on each single topic too much.

98
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:07,530
We have to move on sometimes. So but I do want to see more discussion and more examples and to refer to this textbook.

99
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:14,700
Okay. So this that's the the first textbook and then we have the another few.

100
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,320
And these are all very classical textbooks.

101
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:29,460
So the theory upon escalation by Lenin and so on and actually is the one of the coauthors of the textbook use for six or to record Berger

102
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:39,960
the textbook and also a summary of studies two by Denmark and Mathematical Statistics by Jim Schulte and testing two hypothesis by one.

103
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:47,790
And this is this I'm less familiar with this name, I'm less familiar with.

104
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:54,870
But all these books, they are they were classical very classical textbooks, but they are optional.

105
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:59,429
So in this course, we are mainly going to focus on our lecture notes.

106
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,540
I do have lecture notes.

107
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:09,330
So as long as we are really comfortable with our lecture notes, you should be totally fine for the homework and for the exams.

108
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:20,580
Now, of course, evolution. So we have in total, we will have 5 to 6 homework assignments depending on how how do you handle the pace of the course.

109
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:28,740
So we will have 5 to 6 homework assignments and in total they will account for 20% of the, of course grade.

110
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,740
In a you are actively encouraged to work together on solving the most common problems.

111
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,100
As last year, I believe students formed study groups.

112
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:44,730
And of course, you guys feel free to do that and discuss for more problems and work on them together.

113
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:50,760
That's all fine. But your final part of your final submission should be based on your homework.

114
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:57,660
So it should be based on your own understanding. And please do not call the other's work.

115
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:09,959
And then we will have two exams. One is the midterm that's going to be account for 35% and then a final 45% for us.

116
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:16,350
That was great. Out of the midterm is on February 22nd, but that's a Wednesday.

117
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,210
That's actually on the Wednesday right before our spring break.

118
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:26,670
So end of that, it's going to be in class.

119
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:37,469
So tend to get up in 20 in class and the final exam is going to be while this is the actual university scheduled final exam.

120
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:41,820
So it's April 26 and that's also a Wednesday, that's 2 hours.

121
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:46,950
And the location is to be determined how will we choose our room for the final exam?

122
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:52,560
But I will update that once I reserve the view. Okay.

123
00:14:52,570 --> 00:15:04,740
So the midterm exam now because it occurs on February 22nd, so the midterm will cover materials I'll touch on.

124
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:13,589
And before February 15th, that's the Wednesday before of like one, one week before the midterm exam and then the final exam.

125
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:21,329
We'll cover the materials counter for the entire semester, but with the focus on the second, we have not covered in the midterm.

126
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,870
So we cannot complete a separate, you know, the first half and the second half.

127
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:30,450
But the final exam will focus on the second half of the.

128
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:37,350
Alison and the both exams will be closed book so this.

129
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:49,460
I know that some some while he's ready to go or six or to the exam for six before they were they were violinist you guys were able to bring together.

130
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:54,880
That's right. So for this course, I mean, we are here,

131
00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:00,069
we are not going to have much usage so that the exam problems will be a lot

132
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:04,150
easier because with it you see it and the exam probably will be a lot harder.

133
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:09,610
So and so there there is there is a balance.

134
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:17,350
I, I think for for this course, there is really no need to to for you guys to bring cheat sheet.

135
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,719
And the exam problems will be relatively easy.

136
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:29,290
I can add to the share that the last year's exam last year's midterm exam.

137
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,940
So now you guys can see what will be expanded for the midterm exam.

138
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:40,479
So that's the midterm.

139
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,130
So so was well you guys don't worry too much about you know, oh, this is a close book.

140
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,479
Do I have to memorize everything? Well, you guys don't need to memorize everything.

141
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:59,350
Of course, that are. Well, there's certain things we need to to know without referring always referring to them, to that, to to nationals or textbook.

142
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:05,150
But of course, the examinations not to memorize everything, so on.

143
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:11,240
So things will become clearer as we progress. Into the semester.

144
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:20,450
And also, there are no makeup exams. So if you have to miss the midterm exam due to some legitimate reasons, for example,

145
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:25,310
due to medical reasons, then the weight of the midterm will be transferred to the final exam.

146
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:35,480
Of course. I mean, this is I strongly encourage not to do this because, I mean, then the final exam account is just too much weight.

147
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,890
Too much weight. And so yeah.

148
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:48,170
So and then this is the list of topics that we are going to cover throughout the course.

149
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,200
So poor four point as mentioned, we are going to talk about an as.

150
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:58,880
So what will happen? So you have you probably have already seen this one, right?

151
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:08,510
So maybe towards the very end of it, the one you guys have talked maybe in two lectures or about two lectures, going to talk about an estimation.

152
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:15,379
But in this course, we're going to take a much more detailed look at this issue and also fascinating equations,

153
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:20,720
including the so-called two step escalators. And then I have a double message.

154
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:27,650
Some of you probably already have seen this message. These are commonly used methods in causal inference, in missing data.

155
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:39,140
And we are going to and in like in many old fashion inference courses and these methods, they are not.

156
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,799
While these methods are not exclusive covered.

157
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:52,950
But I think that if works for both stat and also these methods now they are very widely used in causal inference and misleading analysis,

158
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,599
which I think is totally worth natural.

159
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:03,989
Look at this methods and then we are going to look at the soul and adaptive muscle it and then for have all the testing.

160
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:11,010
So we are going to talk about Pearson Lemma European tests and also as not just want

161
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:16,589
to test score has like a real test so I mean we have seen all this test from six

162
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:23,430
or to one in six before we mainly focus on the concepts and some simplified their

163
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:29,400
overall results without looking at where how exactly those results were established.

164
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:36,150
But here I want to look at the details, why these results, why these tests work,

165
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:43,980
and also the kind of squared tests coursework has score in manners for homogeneity and things like that.

166
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:53,520
And then we will look at a slew of decision theory concepts and framework in science later and base roles and then max roles.

167
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:59,610
And these three major habits will take up almost all the semester.

168
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,850
If we have time left, we will talk a little bit about bootstrap.

169
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,810
So bootstrapping is a very widely used technique in statistics.

170
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,740
Many of you probably have already used bootstrap in your your research or in your course.

171
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,940
That's part of the theory.

172
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,750
Like the theory is not trivial at all.

173
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,420
So the procedure itself is quite straightforward.

174
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:36,780
You just take a sample and keep you sampling and then up to a calculator, the center and then are calculated as measure using each resample.

175
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:43,560
So the procedure itself is very simple, but the theory behind why it works, it's not trivial at all.

176
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:50,340
So we are, of course. I mean, this course we won't have time to talk too much about bootstrap rebuild.

177
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:56,760
If you have time, we will look at some some essential essentials behind bootstrap.

178
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,440
And then if time allows, we will look at some. Yeah.

179
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,749
Now this is is not your maximization algorithm. This is.

180
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:18,630
So why are you that great? I think so, Steve. Okay, so then the rest of the course syllabus, I think you guys can reach yourself, so.

181
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,500
Oh, any questions so far about the consumers?

182
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,730
Okay. Well, just. If you have any questions, feel free to let me know any time.

183
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:37,560
And also, this is true for all actors who have any questions about the lecture.

184
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:47,100
Like if we are going, if our pais is too fast or too slow to let me know or send me any feedback so we can adjust for the pace.

185
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:56,009
Because I mean, the goal of this course, of course, one goal is to cover some very important topics.

186
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:04,079
But on the other hand, we want to make sure that you guys have a good understanding of the materials we cover and we do want to cover too much.

187
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,310
But I know without understanding well each of the things that we cover.

188
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,910
Okay, so this is the course syllabus, but.

189
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:20,649
Now. Okay.

190
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:30,370
So I think now before we start formal action material, I think it's essentially it would be great if we have a round of self introduction, right?

191
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:37,000
So I know some of you, but not everyone does because many of you didn't take six.

192
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,909
So when you say I didn't and also last year actually or not last year, yeah, it was last year.

193
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:48,920
And so now we're in the new year. Oh, by the way, you have new information now.

194
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,970
So, so now last year it's all six. So true.

195
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:58,780
Because because of COVID, actually, all of us had to wear face masks so on during our lectures.

196
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:10,030
I couldn't recognize it. For some of you, I mean, during the semester semester, I might not be able to recognize everybody taking my say so too so.

197
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,040
But I think now we are we are able to you know,

198
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:21,140
I think it better to have just a very quick self interaction so that I know we know each other by name and

199
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:27,550
then because we are going to work on know with each other together throughout the semester on this course.

200
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,409
So well maybe I'll just start with my self reference and self.

201
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:40,360
So again, my name is Hazel, I am an associate professor and my own research, not otherwise.

202
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:48,969
It's, it's, I used to do a lot of research on misfit analysis, but recently, starting from four or five years ago,

203
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:54,250
I started to do a lot on immigration as combining data from different sources.

204
00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:02,160
You know, there were quite a few members in our department who were actually doing such research on,

205
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:08,860
okay, so this is the second time I'm teaching it all through, so hopefully things go off a lot easier.

206
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:17,860
I did enjoy a lot of teaching it all the last time, so it took a lot of time to preparing the lecture notes as well.

207
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:24,430
But hopefully, I mean, this this time it makes things go a lot smoother than this one.

208
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:33,490
Okay, so maybe we will start from here, the actions, or maybe you can mention your name like the whether you're in the master or refugee program.

209
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:42,399
And also if you are just or a maybe as immersion who are who are working with Choose our end.

210
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,060
What time? So doing. I'm just very, very brief.

211
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:51,070
We don't have to get into details. It's a little so hello everyone.

212
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:59,200
I'm telling you what doing as a genocide for six one.

213
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:17,479
Hello, everyone. I'm with you. And I'm a second year master's student and I have been working the software genome projects of Bayesian modeling

214
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:29,810
with various applications like imaging image on image regression network analysis and brain computer interface.

215
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:36,440
Okay, well, hello, my name is Strabo and I'm a second year master's student use department.

216
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:44,600
I'm seriously work with the future of electronic health data and will work with me this semester in a new project.

217
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,140
Has to be your. I have no idea. Hi, I'm Ben.

218
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,920
I'm a second year master's student. Okay.

219
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:01,050
Yeah. So, yeah. Hello. My name is zero and volume is here.

220
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:11,870
I think here. Must have been here. Uh, my research is focused on, like, statistical computing, like, like the national of suffering of this question.

221
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,230
It be in the subject. Okay, fine.

222
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,170
We're going to send a message to do what we use.

223
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:34,290
But for the and I don't know that we are necessarily I'm working as a doctor and for medical school there are specific.

224
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:44,540
Right. Okay. Oh, I'm I'm in I'm currently working on this.

225
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:52,150
Doctor. Doctor. Hi.

226
00:26:52,210 --> 00:27:07,590
My name's Mia and I'm currently working something out in a fashion modeling intensive part of the woman's whole, you know, career.

227
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:19,200
I'm seven year master's student, and I'm currently with Dr. Vision Home and can be heard on some projecting regression year.

228
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:32,650
Hi, I'm Sarah. I'm a second year master's student and I'm working with Dr. Kelly Kidwell on clinical practice managed grants for 6 to 7 years.

229
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:37,720
And I'm working on the cancer training program legitimately.

230
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:42,910
Okay, I don't get to do that.

231
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:51,480
So I'm just so used to working with Dr. Phil.

232
00:27:54,350 --> 00:28:07,860
I'm doing fine by me. I'm time and I got to practice on.

233
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:26,560
On and most of my understanding of what's going on.

234
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:40,440
I'm not going. Hi.

235
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:55,330
I'm here to ask if I was wrong, but I would love to know that because the world of immigration is on top.

236
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,120
Everyone. My name's Jamal. Sorry also goes a lot.

237
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:07,850
And I'm a first year student and I'm currently working with some regional housing projects.

238
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:17,450
Like, um, I'm a first year student and I'm like, okay, okay, that's great.

239
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:25,340
So thank you, everybody. And we have a combination of first and second year beauty and also second year masters students.

240
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,969
So this is great. Okay.

241
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:37,550
So yeah, and with that, I think we will start our own lecture material.

242
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:43,280
Let me turn this off so that I can use the words to write notes.

243
00:29:44,990 --> 00:30:28,590
Okay. Okay.

244
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:36,280
I haven't I haven't done this for quite a while and running this is obviously my

245
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:42,060
proxies for getting my head around is going to be if it's too difficult to read it,

246
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:50,760
just let me know. So this is on as measured zero.

247
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:21,930
So here, one of the first chapters when we are going to have three meters after the first chapter is consummation.

248
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:25,049
Very important aspiration.

249
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:29,610
I believe all of us now must know what Paula has measure Nic, special.

250
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:36,990
Well, what we know what as mission is resolved, there are qualities that we are interested in, but we don't know what their values are.

251
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,830
And we are trying to collect data and estimate quantities using our data.

252
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:46,709
And important US mission is is that it means that if you are providing a course estimate for the

253
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:52,300
quality so you're estimating the mean you're asked meaning that the media assuming that running

254
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,889
coefficient they provide a poor estimate as poor an estimation and for point estimation it turns

255
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:05,310
out that the estimate of these are some of the most widely used half measures in statistics,

256
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:11,580
formats, meters and many of the escalators that a you are you have here and now you.

257
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:21,249
I guess so, because I think in six or too many folks I know there are many other I mean, we will see some examples.

258
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:25,290
Many other animators, they are so-called mouse makers.

259
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:33,520
I mean, you guys had I mean, if you guys have looked at this in six or eight or one and maybe using two actors,

260
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:41,170
and now we're going to take a much more detailed look at them as major.

261
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,990
So first thing. I want O'Malley's statue down. Yeah.

262
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:06,590
As Mater. This is. It is based on a study of this field in theory.

263
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:12,050
So the argument is based on his colleagues bi lateral assemble such as those who go to infinity.

264
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:19,400
And this is a common techniques used in studies and if you read papers you will see that many, many papers.

265
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:23,510
They actually make the argument based on a lot of assembled theory, based on politics.

266
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,610
The reason is that no friend well,

267
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:33,350
you can construct an estimate or you can construct and now you can construct this square estimate or you can construct.

268
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:40,150
For example, let's let's make things even more concrete. Are trying to estimate let's say the center of is fusion.

269
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:46,760
Then you can estimate the center by using the mean. By using the medium, by using, for example, average of the first quarter.

270
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:52,819
And if the report how you can construct numerous sarcasm features, but which asymmetry is better?

271
00:33:52,820 --> 00:34:00,920
Which escalators are worse? So to answer that question, we have to study the poverty of estimating the distribution,

272
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:07,430
but establishing the distribution those ask majors is extremely difficult.

273
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:15,799
If you consider a finite sample size in a if is if your data follow a very nice distribution.

274
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:23,180
As we follow normal distribution, then you might be able to exclusively derive the distribution of a particular estimate like the mean.

275
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:31,070
Then follow the normals to follow and the median follow some description and you might be able to derive the close forming decision.

276
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:35,390
However, not if that data follow quite a complex disorder.

277
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:47,330
And also if your estimate is complex, then it's almost hopeless to derive more than like a concrete description for a particular even sample size.

278
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:52,189
So because of this now the most major,

279
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:59,120
this is actually a very systematic way of constructing ask me to work or establish the properties of escalators.

280
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:03,670
So it is based on study of this very theory by writing the sample size to infinity.

281
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,660
As an approximation to the unknown truth.

282
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:42,570
So here we are. The end. That is M has made in theory this is based on smartness and also is an approximation to the aim of this vision.

283
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:48,740
And this approximation often comes. They are good enough.

284
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:27,970
And oftentimes these measures are good enough, at least when the sample size is not too small.

285
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:37,950
So if we have a good enough approximation and it's relatively easy to derive, then well then this is actually keen on that.

286
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:44,250
But the reason why have isolation and estimate or become so popular or the theory behind this mission.

287
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:24,770
And also it's beneficial to study the general theory no harm or.

288
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:39,050
I can't. I can move. You can move this or try to avoid a better law, no matter what it means to do the right thing.

289
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,700
So it's beneficial to start the general therapy sarcoma structure.

290
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:49,730
These are some of the reasons why we are looking at an estimate or the theory behind it.

291
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:53,460
Least now let's take a look at the definition.

292
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:59,090
So. What exactly are the majors?

293
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:12,250
So we will use the hat to denote an estimate as an estimate.

294
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,570
So it is the maximizer of the function.

295
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:23,830
We will use Q hat in theater if you know this function and n is the sample size.

296
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:30,970
And the sample size in a theater is the parameter that we are interested in and to have here.

297
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,660
While later, when you compare examples of this, means that while this depends on data as well,

298
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:41,310
so you raise a sample average so that that's why we use a hat who have had a lot.

299
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:50,520
And we maximize this function. In the wild this this year.

300
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:55,260
This is the crime for the whole crowd of spectators, those to, you know, to the whole grounders base.

301
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:00,590
So this is why it's called mass murder. F stands for maximization.

302
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:05,130
So we maximize the objective function cure in heart failure.

303
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:09,570
Then that's our estimate. Now, let's take a look at some examples.

304
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:18,940
Of course, the most well-known example. That's the amount.

305
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:36,190
Now suppose that we have IP data in this course.

306
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:40,959
We will, I think. Yeah, I think we'll go exclusive.

307
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:50,290
Consider our I.D. data. So suppose we have I.D. data with the sample size in classroom following some of them from some description.

308
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:58,630
And we will use chemical EPS will be sort of a 3 to 0 is the true value of the parameter and then Q in theta,

309
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:10,340
in this case, the function is just the like likelihood for the likelihood for the sample coverage of log small f c type.

310
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:19,680
So we are very familiar with the assassination. So we maximize the likelihood and then we get.

311
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:28,240
So this is now and then. Another example.

312
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:50,540
Is the so-called linear square meter, linear square meter, and this is mainly for regression model.

313
00:40:50,580 --> 00:41:05,549
So now in this case, Z Pi and that's it has two components as Y and Z Y is the response or alcohol and excise the coverage of covariate.

314
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:10,080
And we are interested in a regression model, a regression Y of X.

315
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:18,999
And motto is this fight as. One model is responding this way.

316
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,570
So we assume that the mean of Y, given the exclusion of X is given by this age.

317
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:30,909
So you can consider the glom. You guys must have learned GM in 651, right?

318
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:35,260
So GM is a while. You can consider that to be a special case of this.

319
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,630
GM naturally.

320
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:46,600
Well, if you consider GM g, I am specify that this fusion of y given x right follows on the exponential discriminant from the explanatory family.

321
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:52,540
But here the model only specify.

322
00:41:53,980 --> 00:42:00,680
The structure for the meeting. So is not a given that we will see it follows on your age is a no function.

323
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,790
You can if y is binary, you can consider this age to be lauded.

324
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,780
One or two are exponential.

325
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:18,130
So it's very w I consider it to be to be less so if y is binary.

326
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:24,400
Danny Wei So, so this model and only specify a structure for the mean.

327
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:30,820
Now for such a while this is common to model because you're already or in many cases

328
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:35,799
we are only increasing the means of the response where we don't care too much about,

329
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,610
you know, higher order troubles, high order moments of the discussion.

330
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:50,140
So if the mean model is specifying this way, then Q In favor, if you try to estimate a theta, our goal is try to estimate the theta zero.

331
00:42:50,530 --> 00:43:00,820
That is. I know. So we were try to estimate it. In this case, you can construct the Q in how theta should be an active assemble average.

332
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:19,430
The sun shone average of the square of the residual reservoir are at minus this h x theta.

333
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:22,630
This is the residual for the ice individual.

334
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:32,710
And then we square and we take the average. Then we put a negative sign here because we are trying to maximize how we can find them as later on.

335
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:38,170
Now that if you do not have that inside, then it becomes minimizing the sample average.

336
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:41,229
So that's why it's called the nonlinear squared.

337
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:49,570
So it's a square, but it's not nonlinear older than the because here we allow this y actually a nonlinear function.

338
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:56,660
So this is not a coup in that you can maximize in order to escalate in this case.

339
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:01,810
So in other words, this is one way to construct as this is an escalator.

340
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:07,420
Another example is the so-called GMF method.

341
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:12,430
I'm not sure if you guys have seen this or this stands for a generalized method of movement.

342
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,510
And this is a very widely used method in statistics.

343
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:27,820
You might not have seen this this particular name and generalized method moments, but you probably have used this idea in your own right or research.

344
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:40,740
So in this case, the model is given by a set of estimating equations by a set of estimating equations.

345
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:55,200
So a very. Concrete example is let's consider the case where you know that Paul Saunders vision has a special

346
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,090
feature that to me is equal to the barracks proposal as we know the means equal to the variance.

347
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:04,980
But there are many decisions that a mean is equal to the various.

348
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:07,210
They are not poisonous vision, right?

349
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:18,150
So let's say no data and you think that your data is generated from a description for which the mean is equal to Rivera's?

350
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,670
But you don't think the description is partial?

351
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:31,230
So then, instead of specifying this vision as opposing this vision, you could actually just specify the first two moments of the decision,

352
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:38,490
like which means, but if you cut your latency, then you could use the, let's say, minus three time.

353
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:47,300
Let's say the fetus scans for the mean and various parameter you think about the first moment is the means equal to bounce.

354
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:53,900
Then say the minus. The minus theta. And then the the.

355
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:05,070
So the variance is actually equal to the square minus.

356
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:26,220
So I'm trying to trying to contrive another another function.

357
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:51,440
Yeah, that's right. People can say, okay, so in this case, you could actually consider this set of ads to me.

358
00:46:51,910 --> 00:47:30,610
So the first. Appearances equal to 000 square meters is equal to various utterances equal to one this business 123200.

359
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,260
So. So this is the square minus.

360
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,300
This is in the setup squared minus theta.

361
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:51,300
Sorry. Okay. So now if you suspect the Z is generated from some discussion for which you know the mean is equal to a variance but is not a point.

362
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:56,550
So instead of assuming the data for the position description, you could actually assume this is your model.

363
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:02,220
This is your model degradation. So the expression the first guy is equal to zero.

364
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:08,820
This means that again, the means equal to say that these matters on the 7iu01 means the variance is equal to theta.

365
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:19,080
So if you are this to be our model now that's actually kind of far into the generalized matter more in the framework.

366
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:22,800
So in other words, this is how you construct it as a meter.

367
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:31,260
So once you collect your data, you can, you can solve the sample average of is equal to zero and then then get your ass meter.

368
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,490
So Beacham is just a more general way of doing that.

369
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:44,400
So you specify your model by saying that a, these foundation of a set of function of your data evaluated on a true parameter evolution.

370
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:55,890
So this is your model. So once you have such a model, then the Q and tab feeder you can take take it to be.

371
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:50,070
So we can construct as major by. There's a negative sum by maximizing by maximizing this cure in.

372
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:59,599
So if you look at this, too, and this is very intuitive, the reason is that while if you assume this is your mode,

373
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:05,420
if you assume your data satisfy this expectation equal to zero, expanding equal to zero.

374
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,479
And then once you have your data, of course,

375
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:15,890
we will look at a simple average and a you are to find the field value that may resemble average as close to zero as possible,

376
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,590
as close to zero as possible.

377
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:27,350
And then while one way to find the theta that makes this demo average as close to zero as possible is to define quadratic

378
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:36,020
form of this based on this simple average and then put the negative side here then and maximize the action of this.

379
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:41,810
Or in other words, without you, if you remove this negative sign that you minimize the square of this,

380
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:48,170
so that makes sure that you are you are searching for theta. That makes the simple average as close to zero as possible.

381
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:56,420
And that actually intuitively should be should be a good ask me to understand as zero here you got zero example average.

382
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:03,100
Right. So this is another example of so-called isolation.

383
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:25,200
So any questions so far? I remember.

384
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:44,300
So if we're EMS meter, we're going to look look at two properties.

385
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:49,340
One is consistency and one is a lot more value for a sliding dispersion.

386
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:58,250
These are very important because because based on these, we are able to infer Israel's interest.

387
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,360
Now we need to look at them one by one. So first, let's focus on the systems.

388
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:43,930
And. So if we consider the limit function by letting a sample size go to infinity so this we can definitely do this because now for each theta,

389
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:48,520
if you think they're for it, think thing about it. Now let's take a look at a concrete example.

390
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:57,390
Let's say we look at this function here. Now, for each thing fixed theta value, this becomes the symbol average, a lot of the PDA.

391
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:02,290
Right? And so you have this.

392
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:06,610
Yeah, this is the so symbol average. Now you have symbol average.

393
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:11,210
Then based on the large number, this will converge like exaggeration of log of.

394
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:17,710
Yeah. So that we can simply call that our q020.

395
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:22,450
And this is. Why we have this limit.

396
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:33,050
And again, if we define 3 to 0. As the maximizer of this limited function.

397
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:51,120
As limit function. Then of course, it's well designed to show that, you know, the theater has here involved in this way.

398
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:55,910
The theater had got to maximize this simple example.

399
00:53:56,370 --> 00:54:02,100
To convert is to the Theater Zero, which is Maximizer of the Limit.

400
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:12,150
And that's what we. Then it is the desire to establish a social research.

401
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:30,810
So fear and how to convert is improbable, even to fit a zero.

402
00:54:33,790 --> 00:55:00,980
Or in other words. Or in other words.

403
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,990
Here we go. The theater in Hatch, Sweden.

404
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:09,790
This is just the maximizer of this pure, inherent theater.

405
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:15,720
We want to show that the limit of this, there's this people, you know, probably.

406
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:22,190
So the has in goes to infinity that the companies are religious.

407
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:27,160
So the problem limit of theater. This is this here is nothing but a theater so.

408
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:34,250
So want to show that in this is equal to zero zero where theater zero of course what our vision is about.

409
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:54,190
The maximizer of humans choosing. So the idea was we wanted to show that the probable limit of Syrian heft is equal to 002 was energy.

410
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:58,180
Now, this thing of zero is actually.

411
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:33,180
Oh, sorry. Right.

412
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:37,840
Q And. Q zero theta as you would define it, it would be, you know, a limit.

413
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:41,470
Q Any kind of theta, right? That's the limit of. Q In a heartbeat.

414
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:49,030
So in other words, we will add to what we might want to show that a theta in had a converted and how to define a zero,

415
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:56,080
which mathematically is equivalent to showing that the power limit of the maximize

416
00:56:56,110 --> 00:57:01,210
on this is equal to the maximizer of the probable limit of this function.

417
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:09,280
So if you look at that, essentially what we want to show is that, well, I'm sure you can use this,

418
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:17,410
we can switch the order of this to operations threshold of the limit that goes to

419
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:22,240
infinity and also the maximization where theta we want to be able to switch out.

420
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:27,700
If we are switched order, we are able to show that to say that in fact, I'm reducing average to zero.

421
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:33,960
So this intuitively it does work intuitive.

422
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:37,990
It does work because if you imagine there is a function is a sequence of function.

423
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:44,530
Q In how to theta, you just imagine in a two dimensional space like on a plane you have a occur.

424
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:51,280
Q And theta, right, if you can theta if this sequence could have theta converters to aq0 theta.

425
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:56,250
Brenda. Yeah, they got very quick here.

426
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:00,110
So let's say on the plot. Well, this is theater.

427
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:05,160
So if you have a business, let's say cue.

428
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,520
You have theater. So this is a sequence.

429
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,900
Right. So. We have a sequence of curves.

430
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:20,280
A sequence of curves. So with two and a half and as and go 70.

431
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:28,960
Let's let's say that. This is q08 Apple goes to infinity, this sequence of curves.

432
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:32,440
To approach this limit Q zero theta.

433
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:38,080
And then if we find the maximizer of each Q in theta, this is messy.

434
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:44,860
Q One theta and this is as a Q tool theta one the sample size, these two business.

435
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:48,010
Q three that's a sample size of you three. Right.

436
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,720
And then now if this sequence of curves converge with this.

437
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:57,190
Q Zero. Theta Gamma Maximizer should converge with this maximizer.

438
00:58:57,490 --> 00:59:03,100
I'm done. Q Zero. So in you this seems to be the case.

439
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:11,980
However, mathematically, we do need some conditions to guarantee this suite of this tool.

440
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:17,050
One is okay, so now the next result is a consistent result.

441
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,810
We are going to list the conditions.

442
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:28,750
These conditions are commonly seen conditions that guarantee that we can switch the order of this tool so that we have the consistency.

443
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:33,800
This. Okay.

444
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:39,879
So so because this is these four conditions are very important.

445
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:51,560
So I think I'll start. Or you know what?

446
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:56,850
So I will. So you guys don't mind if I write?

447
00:59:56,990 --> 01:00:02,059
I'll have more. So because this four conditions are very important, so I want to keep them somewhere.

448
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:08,630
So I think, ah, we can refer to that. So maybe I'll just write them over here and keep you on at this one.

449
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:58,190
And. So to guarantee consistency, we have four conditions.

450
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:04,550
So the first one is that the lipid function. Q zero theta has a unique maximizer.

451
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:11,490
This is very easy to understand. So because you have a sequence because.

452
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:15,840
Q zero has it has to maximize it here and here.

453
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:26,150
There are both franchises that in the end you have a sequence of curves converge to those two zero theta emergent just 2001 theta.

454
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:29,930
While we don't know whether it works, this one or this one. So.

455
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:36,920
So the first condition does rule out this new scenario.

456
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:40,710
So the limiting factor has only one maximize.

457
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:47,450
So this makes sure that in a different environment maximize the risk.

458
01:01:48,230 --> 01:02:00,510
And the second one is that a prime for space? His contract.

459
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:07,710
It is hoped that all this is done by combat.

460
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:12,850
I mean, because in this course, we are focusing on your things.

461
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:16,360
I and I believe this is true for you, for most of us.

462
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:28,030
So we are actually reporting on things like various things from combat examples, phone calls also.

463
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:33,220
Okay. So that's the second and third mission dispatch.

464
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:49,700
Is the limit a function? Musical theater is continuous.

465
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:53,440
Limit is continuous. This is a very weak.

466
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:58,850
So it doesn't really care about compute.

467
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:02,890
Yeah. So I just got rid of that.

468
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:08,780
Oh, we can we can use this as an example. So remember, this is Q in half data.

469
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:13,310
So the consistent result, it really doesn't care about this function.

470
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:19,280
So it doesn't care whether this is continuous. This can, can, can be even done continuous.

471
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:27,450
But as long as the limiter function in this case, as long as the installation is a continuous function of theta, that is fine.

472
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,800
This is a very weak and you can go only as far as that.

473
01:03:31,190 --> 01:04:48,579
The limit functions and goodness you say. Okay.

474
01:04:48,580 --> 01:05:01,000
So the last museum is the convergence of the simple version, A, Q freedom for Q zero data that needs to be a uniform convergence uniform for movies.

475
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:08,590
So what is the difference between those two avanza than the Super Bowl?

476
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:20,740
You started from zero. So intuitively what this means is that now, as illustrated by this by this plot here, by this figure here.

477
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:27,670
So the Q in with the Q, the Q zero is actually a limit of two and a half theta.

478
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:31,000
So in order to have a consistency,

479
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:39,040
this convergence of the sequence of curves to Q zero theta needs to be relatively uniform like Ms. uniform, which means that.

480
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:45,030
It doesn't matter where the theater is, no matter where the theater is.

481
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:56,170
So so the convergence of this two Q in choosing a theater can be sort of, you know, the red does not vary too much does matter when I say those.

482
01:05:57,060 --> 01:06:03,990
So these those four conditions are the ones that guarantee consistency.

483
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:15,360
So we will look at each conditions one by one and assume what we'll see some examples of try to understand those conditions.

484
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:20,310
But if you look at those conditions, those conditions are are quite.

485
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:31,419
Are quite a symbol. So this the result you can the colors this result in the in the in the book chapter we mention in the first textbook we mention.

486
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:36,280
So if you look at this result, this is a very nice result in the sense that.

487
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:46,890
It. It gives you four conditions, relatively easy to understand the conditions and also relatively easy to check.

488
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:54,150
And you can read about them and talk about how to check those conditions so that once you have those conditions, you have consistency in the end.

489
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:58,020
So the parameter is consistent, converting probability to try to control that.

490
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:07,920
See the zero. So in 602, I believe we only look at the consistent result itself.

491
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:16,320
So we talk about over million years consistent as major for the truth, but we never tell about how to prove it is consistent.

492
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:26,819
And of course for yourself there is no and if we do not consider it to be and we do not,

493
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:31,260
if we just look at it yourself, we probably don't need such a general result.

494
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:33,470
However, if we do want to, you know,

495
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:42,120
formulate a general result that covers different have different as matters not only and then this becomes a very useful result.

496
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:54,009
Okay. So. We have 10 minutes left.

497
01:07:54,010 --> 01:08:03,760
So I think we are able to very quickly show proof that it news outlets it currently is not difficult at all so we can.

498
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:29,170
But let's take a look at the proof. So for any absent party number absent.

499
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:58,440
So this stands for. Would probably be approaching what was probably approaching one or any other words.

500
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:04,640
If you want to write it in a mathematical terms, it means that the limit, as in goes to infinity.

501
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:13,490
The probability of an event. There's even one.

502
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:21,080
So. So this this is essentially what means by with a probably approaching one as size

503
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:26,030
schools infinity then the probability of that event occurs and becomes one.

504
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:34,100
So for any party that we have, we probably are approaching one that we have the following three inequality.

505
01:09:55,810 --> 01:10:05,770
So the first one is that. Q In the theater, patch is longer than Q and a studio zero minus a small number.

506
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:14,110
This is simply, by the definition, how we define transient. I say that because theater is defined as the maximization of this function,

507
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:23,310
so that of course the function evaluated at its maximizer must be larger than the function without needing to add another value,

508
01:10:23,730 --> 01:10:29,500
zero and minus another party. So this is simply the definition of that.

509
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:49,730
And B. So this is.

510
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:57,860
By the commission for online court order that the uniform convergence so uniform convergence

511
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:04,310
means that the Q in inherent and AQ zero this tool functions as and goes from third.

512
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:08,420
Their difference becomes very, very small because whatever to the other,

513
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:14,880
it doesn't matter which leader you are looking at right now if we just pick this particular thing to happen,

514
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:23,629
to happen now, of course, because this function and this function and anything of value, we become closer and closer.

515
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:24,890
And then now of course,

516
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:32,200
then the difference between these two objects and the same thing about it is larger difference is longer than abstract or three.

517
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:56,700
And this is just by uniform convergence. And this is again by U2 from cartoons.

518
01:11:56,730 --> 01:12:01,920
Now we just look at the same function, also functions, but instead we look at it as zero.

519
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:19,550
The difference is that a zero must be very close. The.

520
01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:33,160
So after realizing those three inequalities.

521
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:40,740
Because those three these three events. These three are three events.

522
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:44,820
The three events. Occur with a probably approaching one.

523
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:48,840
So then with a probably approaching one, we have the following without.

524
01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:08,979
And this here, I'm just a director copy maker.

525
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:15,280
The result being I listen to. So this is just a by beat this is my back beat and then.

526
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:22,900
If I apply factor eight over there. So this function here, our theta is longer than Q.

527
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:28,800
In fact, theta zero minus epsilon over three.

528
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:33,700
So then I have another episode over three. So I have two over three.

529
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,980
So in this inequality, this is by eight.

530
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:55,030
And then if I apply, see, now this value here is larger than q0320 minus epsilon over three, and then I have two epsilon over three here.

531
01:13:55,030 --> 01:14:01,090
So then minus minus. This is by C.

532
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:17,940
Okay. So now I have this. This fact that a man could buy.

533
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:47,760
This is scary, but if so if I just use script again could be note and any organ subset containing fetal zero.

534
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:55,990
So I consider a very small neighborhood of zero I that's the a recruiter recruiting I just look out of a very small neighborhood of zero.

535
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:26,320
No. Because. No, this is open. Some said zero.

536
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:37,130
Now, this is a complement. Of course, the complement is a complex action and also I assume we are assuming a parameter space in compound compensation.

537
01:15:37,490 --> 01:15:41,180
So the intersection of these two is a compact set.

538
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:50,510
So this is a composite. Now this is common. And then if we use the provisions 1 to 3 over there, we have the falling is out.

539
01:15:50,510 --> 01:16:05,780
So. Lesion.

540
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:11,060
Three Their assessment of Q zero theta is continuous is a continuous function.

541
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:16,430
So this function is a continuous and it is not a continuous function.

542
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:23,230
Receded a compact section now because we know what this is a problem.

543
01:16:24,130 --> 01:16:30,700
So this can innovation must take its maximum or must take is superimposed over a compact section.

544
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:37,090
So in other words, if I look at a super amount of this function on this compact set.

545
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:44,740
There must exist. There must exist a state star.

546
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:58,590
So that this is the last one that. I think.

547
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:17,280
Okay. So in other words, now there must exist a fetus inside this compact section such that in all value after the star is maximum or super.

548
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:25,180
But based on condition what they are. This function is unique and maximized after zero.

549
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:31,700
So of course then the maximum theta zero zero is longer than the Q.

550
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:41,300
The value of Q and any other theta stop. I feel star is actually is not is actually outside the neighborhood of fear as it.

551
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:49,800
So we have this. Okay.

552
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:53,080
So the Rasta is going to be okay.

553
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:57,040
I've just got two more lines. Let's just finish that very quickly.

554
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:46,060
And then. But because we have shown this right.

555
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:52,370
This is true actually for an industry that is larger than this for any house.

556
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:55,400
Now, if we simply take a few who are out of school,

557
01:18:55,820 --> 01:19:03,770
if it was going to be this guy and this is doubly positive because as we know, that this value is less than this now.

558
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:06,800
So this is public. You it it simply, hey, just want to be that.

559
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:15,880
And we replaced Louis Armstrong but that that guy over there and then we have probably one that's approaching one.

560
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,090
Q Zero rather than. Q zero. While.

561
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:23,240
Q zero theater had lower than zero theater star.

562
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:38,170
Okay. So this means what this means. This means theta had a must be inside this neighborhood screwed out.

563
01:19:39,070 --> 01:19:44,830
Because this Theta Star is actually the maximum value outside their neighborhood.

564
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:47,420
Right. And this is the maximum value.

565
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:54,100
So in order for the function out of this value to be larger than the standard, a theater hat must fall inside that neighborhood.

566
01:19:55,960 --> 01:20:00,610
So that means that Assad must be inside this group again.

567
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:09,220
But this script and you see that here, the script and it's taken to be any organized subset of theater, community theater, zero.

568
01:20:09,730 --> 01:20:13,060
But because of the arbitrariness, we can make it arbitrary, too small.

569
01:20:13,930 --> 01:20:19,240
So that means theater had a must fall in the average for this small neighborhood of theaters.

570
01:20:20,350 --> 01:20:23,440
That actually shows the consistency of theater.

571
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:27,600
Had something happen, they must be arbitrary. Too close to seen as it.

572
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:37,270
So this is the proof of film. So we can see that now or apologize for that.

573
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:43,260
We have to have 3 minutes over. So but you can see that the proof is not too, too difficult.

574
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:50,080
So it's probably ten or 15 lines of proof. So it's a quite, quite a powerful result.

575
01:20:50,290 --> 01:20:58,000
But it was very easy to understand because later we will have more about those confusions and also relevant usages.

576
01:20:58,870 --> 01:21:03,760
Okay. So we will stop here today and two guys next month and next month.

577
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:21,630
I'm sorry.
