1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:21,320
Okay. So feel free to chime in anytime you have any questions, you know, clarifications, I'll be happy to, you know, make this a back and forth.

2
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:29,360
So the whole gist of one health is that human health, animal health and environmental health linked.

3
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,930
So the environment is not happy. Humans are not happy, animals are not happy, humans are not happy.

4
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:43,629
And I think we're kind of living through a moment when that's really obvious in public, which I think most people would agree is a zoo,

5
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:48,550
not a disease or disease that definitely made a jump from the wild into human populations.

6
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,470
And we're still dealing about the effects.

7
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:59,060
Another reason why we cannot think of the South as an island separate from the environment or from animals is

8
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:07,250
that over 75% of emerging infectious diseases does not occur and 60% of human pathogens also zoonotic origin.

9
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:17,720
So measles, let's see, measles, TB almost every all the big ones definitely made a jump from animals to people.

10
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:24,160
I'm not sure this most of the jumps without trouble about 10,000 years ago when they started farming.

11
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,940
So one of the really interesting things right now is that if you look at hunter gatherer populations,

12
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,130
they seem to be a lot healthier than farming populations.

13
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:37,310
So when we started farming 10,000 years ago, we went from being really healthy to really unhealthy.

14
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,360
And I think it's only now that you could say we're starting to recover from the really

15
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,960
high disease burden that we all encountered in your mind as we started farming.

16
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:52,580
The other thing in mind is that disease process, disease processes are the same between animals and people.

17
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,629
So the way we get sick is exactly the same way that animals get sick.

18
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:02,300
The way animals get sick is the same way we get sick. So nothing is an island.

19
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,250
So having unhealthy pets, having a pet that's sick is probably not good for you.

20
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:16,850
Having an unhealthy ecosystem is probably also not good for you. So as I mentioned, one health is really broad.

21
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,770
So there's a pile of different things that you can think about when you think of one health.

22
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:28,760
But there's two things that I will touch on that I think, which are more or less the way I approach one health,

23
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,800
the way I think about environmental health and environmental health, I mean, like ecosystem health.

24
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:41,240
So the first one is the dilution effect. And the second one is the concept of ecosystem services.

25
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,770
Has anyone had either one of those? Which among your ecosystem?

26
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,729
Yeah. Ecosystem services is actually a big thing. There's a lot of work actually going on.

27
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:54,620
And how do you actually quantify it? How do you quantify the monetary value of forest?

28
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:04,250
How do you quantify the monetary value of the lake? And also, you know, like carbon the carbon carbon credit trading system and all the other,

29
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:10,390
so to speak, greening initiatives and trying to monetize, you know, green, green services.

30
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,550
A lot of it comes from ecosystem services. How do we monetize this?

31
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:21,190
Okay. So the dilution effect is, I would say if you're in ecology.

32
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,700
It's rather controversial, but it's very well known.

33
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:34,820
And so the gist of it is that the disease risk decreases with increased community diversity.

34
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:42,740
So the richer bio system, the more different species you have in an environment or in a area, the less likely the less they disease risk.

35
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:48,879
And. We'll go into this. The big question is whether this applies to both.

36
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,250
It applied to every system. Is it a weird effect?

37
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,750
It's only in a few systems. And most importantly.

38
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,140
How can you actually measure and quantified? What's the what's the correct mammal species they want?

39
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,400
What species they actually need in there? What exactly is each species doing?

40
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:14,050
So this concept came about in the early 1990s, and it has to do with Lyme disease.

41
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:21,480
Lyme disease is the poster child for the pollution. And in a place like Michigan Lyme disease, I think is very pertinent.

42
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:27,510
Lots of dear, dear ticks. Ticks carry Lyme disease.

43
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,400
And so there's a lot of debate about whether this a fact that was absorbed in the northeast.

44
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,559
I think it's somewhere in New England. In New England. But it's a really fact.

45
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,050
And how well does it apply to other systems?

46
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:51,569
So the whole gist of this is that the risk of Lyme disease in an area is related to the number of competent hosts.

47
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,720
And then explain what those are competent hosts for Lyme disease.

48
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:02,310
My wife would a nice idea. So this graph at the bottom basically shows what people think.

49
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:12,720
So you have your Lyme disease risk on your Y-axis and your forestation or biodiversity on the x axis of the region.

50
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,280
Well, obviously, if there's no forest disease, it's a vacuum.

51
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,330
There's nothing to worry about.

52
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:27,120
But essentially, the richer you are the lawyer Lyme disease risk is and I will go a bit into what exactly people think of happening.

53
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,120
So just a quick refresher. What exactly is lying? So it's caused by.

54
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:40,430
But the ferry is actually a striking bacteria. So it's actually related to the bacteria that causes syphilis and it's probiotics.

55
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:45,620
So when a chick bites you and if a chick is infected with the bacteria, it may be able to transmit it.

56
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:54,910
And to go to the main culprits, go through a number of state, a number of life cycles.

57
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:01,060
I think, I think mature. And so you got to have two level stages which essentially fosters a love of an adult.

58
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,670
And at each stage you have to take a blood meal.

59
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:15,729
So what people think happens is a chick feeds on an infected mouse or tickle infected rodent gets infected, then continues.

60
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:21,010
And then as a molting continues adulthood, it carries forward the parasite.

61
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,580
But in the process of all, dogs may also bite human bite of deer and in the process infect everyone else.

62
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,879
So. This is the system we're doing, we're dealing with.

63
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,340
So you have to adjust. So one thing to remember is chicks don't really like humans.

64
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,360
They prefer to bite humans, so to speak. Incidental costs.

65
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:49,800
So chicks are not actually looking for you, but the two main hosts, you should be worried about mice and deer.

66
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,740
So those are that you're competent horses more competent.

67
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:59,820
I mean, there's a course that the disease can actually produce it, but they also tend not to get sick.

68
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:05,530
So, yes, they will get sick, but at a much lower rate than humans and slightly today.

69
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:12,870
So the reason for this is a huge of course. Let's say as soon as a mouse gets infected, we'd like.

70
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,520
The bacteria on it dies. Chances are it won't be able to infect another set of ticks.

71
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:25,260
So it's a dead end host. And in some ways, humans are what you would call a dead end host here, because we typically don't get it.

72
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,490
It's unusual to have a high tip, but a passing, for example.

73
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,810
And so 1 to 1 bacteria, in fact, you are kind of stuck on it.

74
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,750
If a picture infects a mouse, it's more likely to get bitten by another tick and transmitted to the host.

75
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:51,470
And so what is observed is that Lyme disease burdens at least Lyme disease risk or the number of infected.

76
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,980
The number of ticks infected with Lyme disease is highest.

77
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,300
When you have a really high deer population. Moderate when it's.

78
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,470
Just mice and then it's here possums.

79
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:14,090
So one thing also idea really important. The system is like deer support, a really high tech population.

80
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:19,310
The more deer you have, the more checks make sense, the bigger hosts, the range more widely.

81
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,980
So gear equals more chicks. More chicks equals to probably more.

82
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:32,720
More line to this rather. But what happens when you have costs like awesome is that they're really good at grooming.

83
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:38,000
So when a chick gets on a bus, it may actually. Got it.

84
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,680
So possums, I think an average of about 5000.

85
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,490
They go through about 5000. 5000 takes a year.

86
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:53,900
So they're really good at taking care of themselves and actually killing ticks. So what happens are job loss like possums in the system?

87
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,310
They're actually eliminating ticks. So the more possums you have.

88
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,760
Elastic shopping system. I'm sorry.

89
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:08,730
In this case, when you have a horse animal like a possum, you have a boss that's not competent.

90
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:19,020
So it's stopping the spread of disease. And so the whole idea is that if you assume a high biodiversity in an area, such an area one,

91
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:28,130
and you have a mix of mice and year and then, you know, mice, deer, possums and everyone who are like low, low.

92
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:34,440
So you have a mix story of whole school, high, high profit, high profit on state and local potency.

93
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,830
And then you have people so you're less likely to get infected in area one at high biodiversity,

94
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,420
in an area such as to where you have a whole set of that are all really high confidence.

95
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:52,570
So. In this case. What's happening in area one is that.

96
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:04,290
You're actually blocking the spread of disease by inserting costs or less likely to facilitate high tech, high tech populations in an area.

97
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,570
And so this is the whole gist of what's happening in the dilution effect,

98
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:17,219
that there's a certain kind of there's a certain kind of host that's actually able to stop the spread of disease,

99
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:24,060
whether to it whether it's to other members of its species, to humans or to other animals in the area.

100
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:29,910
So the reason why this is really controversial is that it works really well.

101
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,350
You know, people say from such 101.

102
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:42,060
So it's very well quantified for a few ecosystems in the states commodity, but it doesn't seem to apply to a lot of other.

103
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:47,430
There's not a lot of not I shouldn't say applied there's not a lot of good evidence that it works in other areas.

104
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:55,350
But in theory, on a lot of the mosques, a lot of this is derived using much of medical models.

105
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:02,860
This all makes sense. And so one of the key. Debate right now is is this.

106
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:09,130
Is this real? How exactly does biodiversity drive disaster risk if their relationship.

107
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,610
Is it dependent on the area? Is it dependent on the species or is it dependent on other unmeasured factors?

108
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:26,410
How about a confounders in the area? Yep. So this might be reiterating what we said about debating its applicability, but is it mostly vector borne?

109
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,360
No. So vectors. That's very easy to.

110
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:38,660
Vaccines are easier to understand. But this would apply to any. This would actually apply to any disease outbreak.

111
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:46,370
But it's a lot more tractable environmental diseases that actually spread either through the environment or by vectors,

112
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,120
because if it's diseases spread by close contact.

113
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:56,570
In theory, it's also possible. I mean, there's ways to conceptualize hydrocarbons.

114
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:03,500
But you're right, in some ways it's most profitable for vectors and environmental diseases.

115
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:07,280
I will actually come to a couple of examples of why doesn't it actually work in

116
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,510
environmental diseases that are spread by the environment or via the environment?

117
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,970
Okay. So. Just to wrap this up.

118
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:24,139
So there's a few things. Why there's so much debate about whether this actually works is that this seems

119
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:29,990
to be a couple of very hard conditions for this to occur and alignments exist.

120
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:36,860
The first is that the fact has to be generated by this. The checks don't really care who did by preferences either.

121
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,800
By anyone, humans, anyone.

122
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:49,440
Then vaccines have become infected by biting vectors, become infected by biting infected hosts rather than by viral transmission.

123
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:54,360
So what that means is that when you go back to.

124
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,459
The life cycle here. Eggs are never infected.

125
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:06,070
And so new generations of chicks are not, in fact, may cannot see an adult.

126
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:11,830
She cannot lay infected eggs. So the infection has to stop once the eggs hatch.

127
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,930
So there's no cross-generational.

128
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:21,340
Well, yeah, in this case, if you think about it, there's no cross-generational, cross-generational transmission of Lyme disease.

129
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,559
Next is what we talked about. What is that?

130
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:35,670
Costs have to worry in confidence. So you have to have a force that are better able to support populations and better able to support that.

131
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,720
So they say that transmission of life is so, you know, in some cases Lyme disease is pretty nasty.

132
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:50,430
In humans. It may not be as nasty. Dear, I'm saying that you need to have costs that have varying degrees of reaction,

133
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,120
so to speak, to the disease in question here and in this case Lyme to this.

134
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:00,770
And the most resilient host species must also be the most highly competent physics.

135
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:08,270
So this is actually one of the big ones is not the most the most competent of species and the systems item mice that do.

136
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:13,430
And I don't think at least affected by lack of it. So if they were heavily affected by Lyme disease,

137
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,830
what you could envision is that all the deer population would die off from Lyme disease and there would be no more.

138
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:24,500
There'd be nothing else for ticks to feed on, and there would be no more Lyme disease to be transmitted in the system.

139
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:31,040
So the most competent hosts have to be not bothered at all by the disease in question.

140
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:37,360
And then the increase in biodiversity doesn't cause an increase in accidents.

141
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,010
So just because you have more species doesn't mean you end up having more chicks.

142
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,690
And that's one of the key debates is a drive.

143
00:14:47,740 --> 00:15:06,620
Sure. Sorry. This morning, I. So yeah, just because you want to increase in cost in the number,

144
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,690
an increase in the number of cost doesn't mean you have an interest in the number of in better density.

145
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:18,140
And it's actually one of the key things is how exactly do you quantify biodiversity by the number of species?

146
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:26,629
Was it by the ratio of different species in the system? So if you have one deal, one mouse, you know, one duck, one chicken,

147
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:35,060
is that a rich system or do you need to have a certain ratio deer to mice, to boards, to, you know, whatever other animals have a system.

148
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:43,940
So that's the dilution effect. So the key to the basically to take one for the dilution effect is the richer.

149
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:51,690
What what is it about breach of biosystems or what the more diverse biomes that makes disease the risk decrease?

150
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,170
What's the link between biodiversity and risk?

151
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:03,890
And thinking about that brings us down to the next concept that I wanted to talk about, which is ecosystem services.

152
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,100
But first of all, what is an ecosystem?

153
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:14,050
So an ecosystem basically includes all living things in an area plants, animals, and that includes us on how they interact with each other.

154
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:22,389
And ecosystems are diverse, so they change their wild communities die off animals, different plants and animals die off.

155
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:26,020
New ones enter the system, but they're all interacting.

156
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:31,120
So it's very dynamic on the page. Remember, it's not an ecosystem.

157
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,100
Anything you can call anything, any system technically. I mean, this table here is an ecosystem.

158
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:42,610
A pothole is an ecosystem or an entire ocean. So it's all depending on what you're trying to understand, an ecosystem.

159
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:47,780
So the size of your ecosystem depends on what you're trying to understand in that ecosystem.

160
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:54,650
And so that's what this is. Basically, ecosystems can be evaluated in different ways.

161
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,760
And actually, one of the key ways to think about ecosystems is what exactly you also it's not only about size,

162
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,360
but it's also what you're trying to measure. So it could be talking about food webs.

163
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:12,440
You could define an ecosystem by food. So depending on how complex a food web based, it may also affect how big your ecosystem is.

164
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:18,740
If all you're interested in is, for example, the ecosystem between sort of the interaction between the grasshopper and grasses.

165
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:22,340
That's a much smaller ecosystem than if you take put in a fox.

166
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,450
So if you look at food webs, you have an ecosystem of a different scale.

167
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:33,620
If you look at hydrological cycles, for example, what happens when it rains, how rivers flow of water runs off?

168
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:38,060
And that's also a whole scale of different ecosystems that you're looking at.

169
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,739
And actually, my walk,

170
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:48,799
I spent a lot of time thinking about hydrological cycles because a lot of it is since I try to do budget and tracking the environment,

171
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,900
actually I have to think a lot about what happens when. Real slow.

172
00:17:53,910 --> 00:18:00,730
What happened to grain hoarders? What's the difference between dry and wet seasons?

173
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:06,120
What is it? What exactly is it between dry and wet seasons that increases disease risk?

174
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,340
Is it the amount of water? Is it that pathogens can last longer environment?

175
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,110
Or is it simply that water washes pathogens from place to place?

176
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,470
And so we may actually be dealing with the same amount of pathogens, simply the rain washes them better from place to place.

177
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,920
And so you have we weird exposure and risk profiles.

178
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:30,210
And finally, there is you can also look at the nutri medical system from a standpoint of a nutrient cycle,

179
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:39,330
how different how those how the nutrients are in this case, how those carbon moved through an ecosystem or rather through a federal.

180
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:47,010
Entities in what they call an ecosystem. So what exactly is on the ecosystem?

181
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,060
So you define the ecosystem now you're trying to figure out.

182
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:56,820
How you're trying to monetize it, not monetize it, how you're actually trying to understand what it does give us.

183
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:05,850
So basically an ecosystem service is the goods and services that are provided by ecosystems and that benefit and support people,

184
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,670
not necessarily benefit, sustain and support the wellbeing of people.

185
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:16,770
So anything from having a place to having a place to look at, you know, being able to grow food,

186
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,740
you know, support everyone else in the ecosystem that makes, for example, the production when possible.

187
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:28,950
Now back in 2000, 2000,

188
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:34,389
there was a big this is what I think this concept something imagine the big drive to actually try and

189
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:42,250
understand what exactly how exactly can you actually categorize ecosystem services under consensus online?

190
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:50,260
Not so much the consensus, but the definition that people came up with broke down ecosystems, ecosystem services into four categories.

191
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:56,200
The first is that the ecosystem services provide a called provisioning one.

192
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:03,040
So they provide food, freshwater, timber, genetic resources, medicine, anything you name it.

193
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,600
They basically enable us to leave the lives which we want to build. Then there's the cultural ones.

194
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,350
Such as?

195
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:19,400
Just the beauty of looking at nature, cultural heritage, recreation and all the associated all of the associated cultural aspects that go with it.

196
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:25,880
Then there's the big ones or not the big ones, but one of the big ones, which is regulation.

197
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,810
So ecosystems regulate air quality, water quality.

198
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,350
They regulate how disease spreads between how disease can spread in an ecosystem to control pests.

199
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:42,100
You know, enable food production to things like pollination. On the last one,

200
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:51,610
which is in many ways I would say confusing because in many ways this can be part of all previous all the previous three is supporting.

201
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,150
So how does the ecosystem support the proper functioning of all the other functions?

202
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:05,560
So for example, how this equals how does an ecosystem enable food production or how does that enable nutrient cycle?

203
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:10,870
So four types of ecosystem services and you can basically break it down.

204
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:16,660
So here is an example of, let's say, an ecosystem.

205
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:25,100
Right now we call this ecosystem on the different parts of the ecosystem, how they provide ecosystem services.

206
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,910
So, you know, sliding down to the ocean, out for the climate regulation, the nutrient cycling,

207
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:36,940
going to the way up to the mountains, we have food, fiber, freshwater erosion control and whatnot.

208
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:44,029
So it's a whole slew of ecosystems across. So to speak.

209
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:50,810
Environmental gradient starting from the mountains, going down to the sea with the cities on farmland and everything else in between.

210
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:57,310
And so, as I mentioned, the big question is how do you actually value this?

211
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:02,890
So what's the value of a forest? What's the value of an island? What's the value of a park?

212
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,060
And so a lot of these things tend to be treated as intangibles.

213
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,070
But how do you quantify? So let's say you cut down the forest.

214
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:18,410
It's very easy to quantify the volume of wood that you'll take out of it. But what about all the other services that it produces?

215
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:23,390
What's the net? What's the net benefit and what's the net loss of on the forest?

216
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:28,219
And that's what's one of the driving things behind the system.

217
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,880
Success is the quantification of the risks and benefits of nature.

218
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:40,740
All right, then. The take home from this slide is essentially is that.

219
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:47,760
The concept of ecosystem services. They enable us to link human and environmental health and.

220
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:54,700
It's very complex. So there's no simple answer and there's a lot of interconnection interconnections.

221
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:58,240
And that's one of the things that I think we're only just now starting to understand,

222
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,250
if not how complex this interconnections are and how actually internal matrix we all are.

223
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,970
So, you know, you may not think that nutrient cycling affects your day to day life, but in many ways it does.

224
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:15,610
And it's only now that we're trying to understand how these cycles walk and what the links between everything.

225
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:28,790
Okay. Kind of questions. So I will now go through a couple of examples of diseases that I would say.

226
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:39,180
Well. Couple of examples of showing links between, for example, ecosystem health or biodiversity, and this is a risk.

227
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:43,090
So the poster child of late for this has been dengue.

228
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:47,700
So dengue and Zika are all interrelated.

229
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,200
I think in 2005, six years ago, Zika was a big thing.

230
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:57,350
And Zika is actually, some people say, is just the type of dengue. On.

231
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,550
Dengue is a viral disease and it's primarily spread by the mosquitoes.

232
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:07,490
By mosquitoes. I just I just injected these guys.

233
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:13,260
There's a couple of things that make this mosquito species are really good at spreading Zika.

234
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:19,320
So Zika or dengue and we'll talk about it. On dengue is actually quite a big deal.

235
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:25,950
I think it infects that's probably more people than it might be more people than malaria.

236
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:31,680
So each year, about 400 million people get sick. I'm sorry I got infected.

237
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,010
100 million get sick and about 40,000 people die.

238
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:41,870
On the anger is actually really interesting because there's all kinds of viruses.

239
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:47,850
And I think you can only you only actually get sick depending on which combination of virus which have been infected.

240
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:53,100
So I think the first time you get infected by danger, you don't actually get sick.

241
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:59,460
And then I think it's the second or third time that you get infected. I think it has to be another type of danger that you actually get sick.

242
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:06,570
And so really complex. And lots of different reasons of why you might get sick.

243
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,490
And during the storm, but also what makes Zika.

244
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:14,459
So I keep saying Zika. I always think about it as dengue.

245
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:23,070
But when you think about it, what makes dengue so interesting is that the mosquito that's credit actually really well, adopted children with people.

246
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:31,560
So, for example, the mosquitoes that spread malaria actually fly pretty fast and they don't particularly like hanging around people that much.

247
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:37,100
Oh, this guy is dangerous. They actually really like being around people,

248
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:44,180
so they actually really like lay eggs and small puddles of water on a place with lots of small bottles of water.

249
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,050
It's like in shoes.

250
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:52,820
So I'm looking at, you know, little, you know, but, you know, you look at fountains, you're looking at this kind of garbage with a bit of water.

251
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,560
And so this guy is love laying eggs and that kind of water.

252
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:08,390
And so human urbanization or human community is actually really able to support actually really high densities of this mosquitoes.

253
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:16,610
Yeah. And I don't know if you know this, but how long does it take for the lava to hatch to something in a year, like a week?

254
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:22,879
So a typical life cycle. We're looking at about a three weeks lifecycle for mosquitoes.

255
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,730
They look at about three or four days from hatching and it's temperature dependent goes on.

256
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:34,219
So you're looking at about three days from hatching to other guys,

257
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:40,730
go to the little Lubbock level stage and then another like ten days I think post hatching.

258
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:46,729
But you get to an adult and establish a compound so mosquitoes really fast lifecycle.

259
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:56,480
So I look at the whole lifecycle about three weeks and people typically take about 10 to 14 days to get sick with dengue after getting bit.

260
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:02,180
And one of the things that's also when you think about disease control and side

261
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:07,520
circumstances is when does someone who was infected actually become transmissible?

262
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,390
So are you able to transmit like let's say you got sick.

263
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:21,600
Let's say you have dengue and you if a most if another mosquito bites, will you actually in fact, that mosquito would be able to transmit dengue.

264
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:25,840
I'm not sure what it is in this case, but that's another thing to consider.

265
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,810
And that's one of the things that made it rather hard to control in the beginning, is that.

266
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,120
You become transmissible before showing symptoms.

267
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:43,740
It's actually quite rare. In a lot of diseases. You only start being infectious, so you're unable to transmit when you actually sign of symptoms.

268
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,790
So it's pretty initial transmit through until you see someone sick.

269
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,990
Or like in this case, let's say you see someone with a high fever. It's got dank.

270
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:57,510
It's in a dengue endemic area. You can probably freak out. Hey, buddy, have to go to sleep on a mosquito net.

271
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:02,230
But yeah. So three weeks to go through this life cycle.

272
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:09,570
On. Dunga on Zika, actually very well documented.

273
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:17,030
It marched from the into from the edge of the forest zone in Africa.

274
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:26,770
So for example. Dang. A lot of this danger in a healthy ecosystem only circulates within primates.

275
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:36,459
So lots of different primates in Africa and Asia able to, so to speak, maintain the symbiotic social biotic means.

276
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,790
It's only in wildlife, only the wild, so it gets circulating.

277
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,370
Typically this animals don't get sick. Or if they do get sick, it's, you know, not as severe as in people.

278
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:50,380
So there's a cycle going on, a danger of Zika spread within a forest.

279
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:56,680
But what happens when people move in? You have what's called as a zone of emergency.

280
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:04,050
So what happens? The forces are stopped. You know, let's say in populations go down, the mosquitoes are like armed.

281
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:11,230
Don't forget to create excellent breeding spots for mosquitoes. So mosquito densities actually tend to go upward for destruction.

282
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,460
And so what you have is mosquitoes now starting to bite people.

283
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:23,860
And once that starts happening is when mosquitoes and actually what to keep in mind actually is a virus.

284
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:28,240
Egypt is not actually a forest dwelling mosquito. It's a forest edge mosquito.

285
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,580
So it's only Zika only makes the danger and Zika only make the jump to either.

286
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,060
Aegypti wants the forest that's getting cut back.

287
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:45,050
And once it makes the jump from the zone of emergence into, let's say, urban areas is when you have a self-sustaining cycle.

288
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:52,790
So at this point Zika's entered the human population and is transmitted by infections such as HIV certificate that are very efficient.

289
00:29:53,090 --> 00:30:01,010
Love living around people and you have a self-sustaining cycle of dengue, a spread that's actually really hard to eliminate.

290
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:05,389
And that's actually what happened to dengue. It made the jump dengue and Zika.

291
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:10,190
And it's actually quite present and I think only made the jump to humans in the 1940s or

292
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:15,080
dying of dengue and Zika probably only made the jump to humans in the 1940s in East Africa.

293
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:27,590
And so eventually what happens is that disease is actually able to move like Zika from, you know, for us all in one for some isolated ecosystems.

294
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:37,600
Rather, it must be to stop into a self-sustaining human cycle. Then I will come to talk a bit about the positions.

295
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:47,030
This is what most of my work is wrong. In essence, this is a very famous diagram if you ever do wash water, sanitation, hygiene.

296
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:57,380
People always talk about it, and it basically shows how diarrheal pathogens spread from how it basically shows the spread of pathogens

297
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:05,690
from fecal matter all the way to future victim and what and what virus may have been based to spread.

298
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:11,030
So looking at sanitation and water supply and hygiene interventions.

299
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:17,880
But the gist here is that. Though we're all diarrheal diseases, rather.

300
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:21,770
Most of the pathogens, of course, are primarily environmentally spread.

301
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,600
And so in many ways, even though we don't think about dairy as an environmental disaster,

302
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,200
it is because it's usually spread by environmental intermediaries.

303
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,040
So we're talking about food, water. S'mores.

304
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,860
So you name it. And so.

305
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,210
There's.

306
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:47,799
For the longest time, I would say the focus has actually been in the field, has been on actually figuring out how to put in these interventions.

307
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,970
What exactly do sanitation intervention, sanitation barriers do?

308
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:54,520
What exactly do this clean water do and what exactly does hygiene do?

309
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,300
And 2018, actually,

310
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:06,790
that's been studying 2010 have been a number of rather disappointing results in really big randomized controlled trials that went in.

311
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:13,780
And, you know, in different communities they didn't have like clean water and sanitation

312
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:19,200
implement and demonstrate to local if there's actually any decrease in burials,

313
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:26,500
it is in the community. And so that threw the whole field into chaos with people asking what exactly is happening?

314
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:31,720
Why isn't like sanitation walking away from clean water work? These are things we know.

315
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:37,720
It's very well documented and it's a no brainer that clean water, sanitation stops, disease spread.

316
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:46,120
But for some reason, some unmeasured reason in the studies that couldn't actually see the impact of these interventions.

317
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:54,820
There's a number of reasons. One of the first is that maybe you just need to make sure since this an environmental spread diseases.

318
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,980
Most of the time say a future victim encounters.

319
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:06,740
Pathogens in the surrounding environment. So what this comes down to the sort of Halifax.

320
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,610
So you're only you're only protect you're only as well protected as your neighbors are.

321
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:18,680
So if you're the world's cleanest possum, best drinking water in the world, you always wash your hands.

322
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:25,459
If you live in a neighborhood that everyone else doesn't have access to this guys, they're living in a very dodgy environment.

323
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,930
So you're not actually decreasing your risk by actually practicing hygiene behaviors.

324
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,110
What actually is important is how many of your neighbors,

325
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:40,550
how many of the surrounding people in your area are actually practicing the same hygienic behaviors?

326
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:49,730
And so part of the part of the problem is maybe for too long and many and like water and sanitation and hygiene, the focus has been on the individual.

327
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:55,880
So outcomes are measured at the individual level. Maybe outcomes should be measured more at the community level.

328
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:00,710
And that brings us also to what kind of metrics we should be using. But that's a whole other.

329
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:09,350
Call it the ball game. But what also could be happening is that there may be other intangibles, like I mentioned,

330
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:15,410
that are actually causing interventions such as sanitation on clean water, not to be as effective as we think it should be.

331
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:23,690
And one of the things that's starting to creep up more and more is that they may be very strong and hard to measure as of yet environmental factors.

332
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:28,520
And by this, I mean we're talking about the impact of biodiversity on disease spreading.

333
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:36,030
Even in let's say when you're in a rural area and you're trying to implement a sanitation intervention and you don't consider the surrounding area.

334
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:39,080
You may actually not be as effective as you think you are.

335
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,450
And that couple of papers along a sense of started to creep up.

336
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:51,680
So, for example, it's been found that forests moderate the effectiveness of water treatment and reducing childhood diarrhea.

337
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:59,540
And so this comes down to the shelf clean watersheds upstream, you're probably going to have clean water, less but less particulate matter.

338
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:05,480
And so a lot of times what I mean, particulate matter is if you have.

339
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:10,210
Dirty water. By that I mean lots of soil, quantum in water.

340
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,580
You're actually better able to.

341
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:19,210
What happens is pathogens actually stick to soil particles a lot better than they do to, let's say, really clean water.

342
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:24,820
So I put the equivalent of model for the equivalent amount, same amount of, let's say,

343
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:30,970
what's a, let's say cholera into a stream of water with soil and they do a stream of water.

344
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:37,030
It's really clear you're more likely to get sick from drinking water with soil than just clean water,

345
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:44,800
simply because a quarter requires maybe a quarter of cells or more likely to adhere to soil particles.

346
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:53,120
And so maybe what forests are doing or clean water, it's actually helping clean helping clear water.

347
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:58,540
So you're less likely to take up a high enough pathogen pathogen.

348
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:02,540
If you have a clear watershed about what watershed upstream?

349
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:10,640
Then it's been a couple of big studies that look across demographic health surveys.

350
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,800
Do you guys know what demographic surveys? Yeah.

351
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:23,600
So using demographic health survey data from Africa from today, it's only one study that I think the data, so to speak, local.

352
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:32,349
Study what actually looked at distance from forested areas to how disease risks change over the distance of forested areas.

353
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:41,940
And this was done in Malawi and actually found kind of the same thing that deforestation modulates or mediates rather your.

354
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:49,400
No access to clean water. Actually, the results on reserves risks that you may hide from drinking dodgy water.

355
00:36:52,320 --> 00:37:00,500
All right. So all this is taking place against the background of climate change.

356
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:05,160
So I don't think you can talk about anything environmental or.

357
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,940
Anything related to environment and health as they are not include something in climate change.

358
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:14,660
And so one of the big things, for example, that I'm looking at is.

359
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:23,820
Out of climate change. Mediate how sanitation interventions mediate the effect of climate change in business.

360
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:32,010
And so the gist of this is that. The kind of sanitation coverage that you need or the kind of sanitation access

361
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:37,350
that you need will depend based on where the immediate will will climate change.

362
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,850
So it will rather determine how good a sanitation facility you need.

363
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,620
I'm part of this goes back today.

364
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:53,670
So there's a the reason for this is as I alluded to is water may do different things to pathogens on in different seasons.

365
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:59,340
So think about it let's say you're in an area that's highly polluted, like an informal settlement.

366
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:07,660
What happens during the dry season. So what happens? So during the dry season, no water really dry, but people keep shutting it in the environment.

367
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:15,790
What happens when the first rain falls? So what happens is the rain actually wash all the pathogens, concentrate them into local water bodies,

368
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:20,230
resulting in a really area a hotspot of really high pathogen density.

369
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:24,550
So if people get water from that, get water from that water source.

370
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:33,250
During the dry season, rain may actually increase the risk because it's flushing all the surrounding pathogens into one water

371
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:38,440
source and increasing that risk by during the rainy season where you may actually be healthier.

372
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:46,390
Lots of rain will actually be flushing the environment so that same water flowing out will start connecting to a river.

373
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,820
And so it'll actually get cleaner.

374
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:56,860
So it's understanding what climate change and specifically the amount of rain and temperature changes may actually have.

375
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:00,370
When does it spread? In relation to diarrheal disease.

376
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:08,220
But anyway, coming back slightly. So climate change, as I'm sure you know, I've done it's maybe like preaching to the choir, but.

377
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,570
This time it's changing.

378
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:22,400
Different predictions of how where we're headed is, you know, to a degree, change in temperature to say the five degree climate models seem to be.

379
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:29,780
It's a very it's at this point, we're just starting to understand that climate models are changing year to year.

380
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:33,710
But just to show you that 10,000 years ago.

381
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:39,010
The apples. One degree Fahrenheit cooler. And this is what we're in.

382
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,240
So 10,000 years ago, one degree Fahrenheit cooler, we'd be under one mile of life.

383
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:48,660
So that's why, you know, one degree change in temperature is actually such a big deal.

384
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:59,620
It has dramatic effects. Now, those climate change hotspots, you name it all over the world, you know, you're looking at different predictions.

385
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:06,790
One thing that people do seem to agree, though, is we're probably going to get a lot worse along the equator.

386
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:14,280
So we're probably looking at about a 20, 25% increase in rainfall around the equator,

387
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:21,310
which in some ways so the net the biggest net positive for that will be better air quality around the equator.

388
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:28,240
So lots of rain coming out. That's one that benefit around the equator.

389
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:34,959
But what do actually what will have 25% interest in rain actually hard to tell everything

390
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,540
farther from a specter to the south there think is we're looking at really drier temperatures.

391
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:46,690
So higher fire, higher dangers of, you know, elevated fire, hazard risk and the like.

392
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:55,590
And then the big, also unpredictable nature of climate change is what it will do to rain.

393
00:40:56,010 --> 00:41:03,570
So we're pretty sure there'll be an increase in rainfall amounts, but what exactly do we mean by an increase?

394
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:09,809
So if you get lots of rain spread through the whole year or do you get a couple of typhoons and hurricanes hitting,

395
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:15,630
you know, two or three times a year and dumping the equivalent of. You know, a year's worth of rain in one week.

396
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,040
And so that's the big question is how will these changes actually manifest?

397
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:23,249
And that's coming back to some of the stuff that I'm interested in,

398
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:29,670
is how will an increase in rainfall and precipitation actually impact your exposure to pathogens?

399
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,550
Are you going to be is it going to flush pathogens out of your environment?

400
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:42,130
Is it going to concentrate pathogens and also. What real differences in temperature on rainfall amounts actually improve?

401
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:47,200
How would actually improve pathogen duration in the environment? So one thing to think about is.

402
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:56,979
You can only count up. You can only your pathogens on infectious pathogens, so to speak, has only done its job if it's hung around long enough.

403
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,210
An environment to get you sick.

404
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:06,540
So if it said today but you let's say, you know, someone's news is going to stable you're talking to today, you're probably going to get sick.

405
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,840
Two weeks from now, you're probably not going to get sick.

406
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:17,780
But how will climate change impacts of climate change allow you know, allow pathogens actually persist for two weeks, soil really humid.

407
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:25,379
You stays on that table. It's a human room. Two weeks later, you come in, you can still get sick as well to deal with climate change.

408
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,610
We don't know yet. So.

409
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,530
Want to talk about climate change again.

410
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:39,610
I would say most people tend to think about climate change, on its impacts, on environmental health from the point of view of vector diseases.

411
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:50,120
Now, the reason I think there's been a couple of maybe why it is historically I would actually say where there's been a.

412
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:56,650
More emphasis on the fact that the disease is in some ways easier to study.

413
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:03,160
So a lot of this predictions and a lot of this the theory behind climate change

414
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:09,250
and infectious disease comes from modern medical models of disease transmission.

415
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:15,730
And so those are the kind of models that, you know, that I use to, for example, predict how many people will die of COVID.

416
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,330
What's the likelihood that you're getting COVID like?

417
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:25,590
And so this models. The first one of the first models actually was for malaria spray.

418
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:33,090
And so vector is actually really easy to vector that very easy to model.

419
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:40,590
And so a lot of theory tends to be developed around infectious disease because it's just easier to know what's happening with the vector.

420
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:50,260
So we mosquitoes tricks on the like. But anyway, what do we think may be happening with climate change and infectious disease?

421
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:57,270
And again, as I say, you can't talk about one health or an environmental health business without going into climate change.

422
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,830
So warmer temperatures will probably impact immune enzyme activity,

423
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:08,340
resulting in a complex interplay between increased pathogen and growth across the community.

424
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:18,120
So enzymes are basically one of the guys that do a lot of stuff in our bodies that will be impacted by changes in climate,

425
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:21,640
you know, changes in climate and the like.

426
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:30,810
And this is especially true for animals like reptiles and amphibians, animals whose body function is dependent on environmental temperature.

427
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:39,990
Now. Climate change results in new.

428
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:44,300
Climate change will cause big changes in ecosystems. So.

429
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:50,810
As places dry up, as glaciers become warmer, wetter animals and people start to move around.

430
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:57,590
So what will happen most likely is there'll be either a loss or a game of new host pathogen interruptions.

431
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:06,500
So think of it, for example, what we had in the case of COVID or what happens in case of Zika danger.

432
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:13,680
So all of us, we have foster us. We force animals to come into contact with us, whether it's for, you know,

433
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:21,740
to cut down more land for farming or because we're trying to get away from places with flooded coastal zones,

434
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,240
will that create a new host of interruptions if we're not around before?

435
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,560
So we we're coming into contact with new pathogens, pathogens from that point of view, also coming into contact with your host.

436
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:37,590
And they're like, hey, maybe this is in a bat. Then there'll be changes in all this.

437
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:43,950
New hot spots and interruptions will result in new types of physiology and movements in new disease dynamics.

438
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:51,319
A big one of course is changes in migratory routes because of shift and climate change.

439
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:56,600
And here we're talking about like avian species or species that migrate long distances.

440
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:03,670
And at this point, because of. My migration just would be pretty common.

441
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:12,849
But at this point I think mostly it's mostly bots with more and a lot of news on the line, but you name it, they all tend to come from bots.

442
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:20,350
It's actually a big concern about how pod migratory routes may change and what this may actually do for disease spread and climate change.

443
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:26,510
And number five actually comes back to, for example, life cycle.

444
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:32,350
So for example, like I say, Zika are the mosquito vector for.

445
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,710
Zika. Dengue has a lifecycle of about three weeks. In warmer temperatures, we don't know what may happen.

446
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,610
Maybe it will shut it down to two weeks. Maybe it will be. We don't know.

447
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:52,350
So for a lot of this affected. We're looking at shot a live shot, a transmission shot of life cycles or accelerated life cycles.

448
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:56,540
So you're looking at probably a higher or higher force of infection.

449
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:59,459
So more mosquitoes in a shorter duration of time.

450
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:04,230
So you're more likely to get bitten and it's going to be easier to spread somewhat as vector borne diseases.

451
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:11,749
Now, there's obviously been already quite a lot of work, not by the law,

452
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:20,090
but it's already what that's being done to show that climate change is already impacting the spread of disease.

453
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:26,360
So one of the textbook cases is that the malarial zone is actually going up in Africa.

454
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:34,909
So malaria, malaria, mosquitoes cannot live above or something else because temperature as everything gets warmer, gets warmer,

455
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:42,680
high up the mountain, high up, sorry, the elevation gradient on you may actually have malaria appearing in places that previously did not.

456
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:48,530
It wasn't the case. So this is especially so in Ethiopia and parts of East Africa like Kenya.

457
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,680
It's also been shown really well for what happened in Hawaii.

458
00:47:51,680 --> 00:48:05,930
So Hawaii, a lot of endemic species and one of the biggest causes of species loss in Hawaii is actually avian malaria endemic.

459
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:12,000
But. And as Hawaii gets warmer, the malarial zone keeps climbing up the islands.

460
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,650
So high up the mountains, you're starting to get malaria, avian malaria.

461
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:22,350
And there's more. And those are the places with the highest density of endemic bugs under normal setting malaria.

462
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:28,260
And since they did not evolve in the face of avian malaria, they're more likely to get sick.

463
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:41,239
Then again, I would say danger is a climate, is a poster child for a lot of diseases, disease and a lot of environment.

464
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:48,770
Climate change related diseases, research and some of the models that now show a correlation between climatic variation and dengue cases.

465
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:53,060
And that, again, this only models a lot of it.

466
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,110
In a lot of cases, it's a lot easier to do this in a model.

467
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,760
It's a lot harder to do this, actually. How this done empirically.

468
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:08,110
Now our story and answer stands for El Nino Southern Oscillation.

469
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:13,780
So this is the El Nino effect. And this is one of the biggest drivers of global climate,

470
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:20,230
the movement of warm and cold water between Australia and South America and basically drives climate around the entire.

471
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,610
Around the entire planet and on a large scale,

472
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:35,980
it's already been implicated with disease outbreaks in West Africa with about Rift Valley fever which is not a disease and malaria in South America.

473
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:41,530
So some diseases are very easy to link to climate change such as malaria,

474
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:46,150
because mosquitoes we know mosquitoes respond to different changes in temperature.

475
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:55,330
I'm trying to have it on, but I was also found to be a significant determinant of dengue outbreaks in Thailand.

476
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:00,990
But again, as I said, it's hard sometimes the devil is in the detail,

477
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:08,469
but there's definitely no doubt that anger transmission increases with changes in temperature changes.

478
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:13,380
And what I should say. And not a lot of work.

479
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:20,630
But there's also been a diarrheal disease have been linked to diarrheal disease and caught in Peru and Bangladesh.

480
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:28,400
So Bangladesh in many ways is a case study in a lot of these things because it's low lying.

481
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:44,580
The cholera is endemic and the Bay of Bengal says cholera is actually naturally found and seawater and it makes the jump to people on occasion.

482
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:49,680
It's become very common. But cholera is not actually actually one pathogen.

483
00:50:51,200 --> 00:51:01,580
But as climate change, sea levels rise, the dynamics of water seepage, groundwater on the lake, change in Bangladesh.

484
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:03,470
We'll look at an increase in cholera.

485
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:11,930
And so one of the, so to speak, sentinels or one of the big things that everyone is watching out for is what's going to happen in Bangladesh.

486
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:22,220
Now, as I alluded to before, it's not so easy to link a disease to climate change.

487
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:25,650
It's. That's quite a high body.

488
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:29,100
It adjusted clear. So again, a couple of things have been proposed.

489
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:37,350
The first is, and I think we talk about this a lot in AP and is that there has to be a correct temporal order.

490
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:43,490
So the changes in disease have to follow, for example, in immunology.

491
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:52,470
So you can not have, let's say, changes in disease occurring and then densities changing and densities in mosquito populations occurring from order.

492
00:51:54,080 --> 00:52:00,800
And so that's the better part of a sequence of events. And number three.

493
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,580
Number two, I was actually saying is probably the hardest one to clear, which is.

494
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:11,960
The right geographical region. Climatic changes have to occur in the right climatic region.

495
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:15,390
Eliminating this cycle, that's a confounders.

496
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:22,290
So various correlations. This is tricky because what exactly is a geographical region?

497
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:26,489
And they seem pretty simple. When you're looking at a map,

498
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:35,330
but actually defining it on the ground is actually pretty hard because very rarely they actually get very clear cut delineations between,

499
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:39,319
let's say, environmental zones. Lots of time.

500
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:47,810
It's a gradation. So like, for example, you start in a forest or savanna into decibel, for example, and you go up a mountain.

501
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:55,000
It's usually quite could be quite gradual. So delineating where the change, of course is actually quite tricky.

502
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:59,850
I'm parents. What exactly is your geographical region for?

503
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:04,470
And finally, the change that you think is causing the disease should be in the right direction.

504
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:08,160
So let's say it gets colder. Understanding, present danger.

505
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:14,580
Well, something's not right, because based on what we know about danger, biology and epidemiology,

506
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:19,530
this should decrease with a decrease in crime, with a decrease in temperature.

507
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:24,210
So your climate, the climatic driver, should go in the right direction.

508
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:37,160
Now. Then different diseases respond differently to changes in temperature and precipitation.

509
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:43,910
One of the reasons I think everyone talks about dengue and malaria is that those are really clear, clearcut examples.

510
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:49,069
Again, because you have a vector and infections are a lot quite easy to understand.

511
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:55,549
Vaccines are easier time, it's a lot easier to understand what a mosquito does and then say what the dengue virus does.

512
00:53:55,550 --> 00:54:03,380
It's harder to study the virus lineages to study the vector. And so that's also why it has been such a focus on vector borne diseases.

513
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:12,960
It's just easier to study them. And so climate change need not automatically result in etymological changes.

514
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:21,570
For example, we are pretty sure it will. But what does this just shift without expanding, especially what happens if.

515
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:27,030
I mean, everyone has a fitness range. What happens if it lands past the fitness range would affect the agent or the host.

516
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:31,290
Let's say it gets so warm that mosquitoes can't use anymore.

517
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:35,129
Then kind of climate change just kind of eliminated dengue for you.

518
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:39,000
Right? That and so. In best case.

519
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:44,060
That's a climate change is not actually causing any change in this.

520
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:51,040
The other big thing is maybe they more important mainframe market factors in driving disease

521
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:56,920
spread them out then that's actually not actually more important than climatic factors.

522
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:00,580
For example, my drainage and the use of insecticide treated bed nets,

523
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:04,750
they may be more important in dominating disease spread than actual climate change.

524
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:15,790
But that, again, is open to debate because that's a fuel if your big on marsh drainage.

525
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:20,830
What about it? Is it really what about it is a really high interest in precipitation.

526
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:29,140
You might be looking at expansion of marshes. So in many ways, you could argue that climate climatic factors may be the dominant driver of change,

527
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,840
may be or may become the dominant drivers of environmental changes.

528
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:38,920
You know well. And so nothing can be looked at without actually considering climate.

529
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:48,990
And then a big criticism that everyone comes back to, is that a big criticism of a lot of this things is always climate models.

530
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:52,520
Climate models change a lot. On.

531
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:59,810
Like anything, the people who build climate models build them according to what they're most comfortable with.

532
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:06,000
Some other climatologists. I don't know how to be in a climate, but someone I'm sorry about, for example.

533
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,250
But if I did and I wanted to build a climate model, maybe I'd be more focused on, you know,

534
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:16,200
understanding what exactly goes back to biology, how those times this models are not built.

535
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:20,020
To make the kind of predictions that they're trying to make from them.

536
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:25,480
And then the other thing is, what kind of metrics are you trying to get out of your model?

537
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:32,589
So you guys know what our models. And so that's a very common metric.

538
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:40,410
Everyone loves that. It's easy to quantify. It's easier to take to policymakers, you know, if you make everyone wear masks,

539
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:43,570
you know, it goes below one and everyone's, you know, everything's good.

540
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:50,290
And so a lot of these models are designed for metrics designed to give out,

541
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:57,070
designed to serve as metrics that actually may not be as handelsbanken's now.

542
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:03,640
And so parameterization actually better understanding the metrics you use may actually be a big challenge in the future.

543
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:13,629
And I will just end with this. You know, I know maybe it wasn't very one health focus, but I tried to be environmentally focused.

544
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:20,530
And what I just talked about, because we are all interconnected as we urbanize the world's urbanizing very quickly.

545
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:26,800
I think by 2050, 68% or 70% of the world's population will be living in urban areas.

546
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:33,580
We live closer together. We're changing the world around the world around us where we are currently.

547
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:38,500
The dominant driver of selfish changes on the planet right now are humans.

548
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:45,770
So, you know, anything from digging coal mines to taking down forests, which I think the stuff of the.

549
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:51,000
That's a big thing is we're moving about more and more.

550
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:57,000
And now a disease can get from, let's say, Asia to the states in 12 hours before or take three months.

551
00:57:57,970 --> 00:57:59,480
And so things are changing.

552
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:08,620
More and more people are moving the trading up have a larger volumes of people trade and goods carrying new vectors of disease around the planet.

553
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:15,460
And then a lot of people would say we actually have to think about animals and everyone else around us more than just food.

554
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,270
So in many ways, we have to change our relationship with our food systems.

555
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:24,670
You know, maybe fewer industrial farms, more local farms and the like.

556
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:31,530
And essentially the key takeaway is we're all linked animal health, human health,

557
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:36,030
environmental health and plant health, all linked under the concept of one health.

558
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:45,440
All right, that's all I had any questions? All right.

559
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:51,230
I will stick around jail for another 20, 20 or so minutes if anyone has any questions.

560
00:58:51,930 --> 00:59:00,200
But otherwise, if anyone has any questions, I think got my email from Jonathan and I hope this is kind of informative.

561
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:33,530
I'm sure it's never going to be.

562
00:59:43,540 --> 01:00:06,620
Okay. Hi, my name is Rachel, and I said this kind of stuff in my undergrad, in college, and the transition of the contract is over and I'll join.

563
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:12,610
Yeah. Yeah. So I've done. I did that.

564
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:17,480
You know what I see?

565
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:30,770
You know what you did? You did undergrad here. No, I did not. I will look on on people in evolutionary biology, couple people of malaria,

566
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,220
because I'm like, I want to build something that I really like that I wouldn't want to do.

567
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:46,379
I knew what I was doing about that. So you've got to have a way to visualize what the global health is.

568
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:59,100
I think people are doing like a summer internship, unlike accounting and then like the design changes are changing new stuff.

569
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:03,420
All right. But I'm not like 100% on anything.

570
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:08,500
And like, I would like to work on Southeast Asia, primarily America.

571
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:15,330
South America. Yeah.

572
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:20,240
What else? So you have to do some internship and.

573
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:24,390
Okay, so it's coming up. Yeah. All right.

574
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:29,100
So that was one of the easiest things to do nowadays.

575
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:36,059
It's one of the best ways to do is look look up a couple of papers by people who are very interested.

576
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:43,300
Then make sure they understand. Even better, even better than Michigan.

577
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:49,130
I'm sure that many, many people, most more likely than not, will respond.

578
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:56,630
And the other thing is also to join idea on Southeast Asia.

579
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:00,670
I don't know anyone who does. I don't know.

580
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:05,790
I don't know. Don't get people. There's there's a lot of I'm going to be bold, but like in South America.

581
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:09,920
Yeah. Yeah. That's why I joke in South America. From wrong part of the world.

582
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:19,599
But. American Studies. That's a pretty quick study itself because it's easier and easier to if you do it in South America,

583
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:23,860
it's easier to transition on, especially if you're beginning to South America a job.

584
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:28,990
And so I would keep talking, which are maybe I don't have a good project.

585
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:32,710
I don't know how to get to Ecuador.

586
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:36,220
That's another pursuit of another indigenous research and another email.

587
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:41,180
I'll go. Yeah. And if you. Now.

588
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:47,740
Joy is really good. So you probably keep talking with Joe. But.

589
01:02:56,030 --> 01:03:04,069
70% said. I do have a question.

590
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:10,700
I'm not sure. Sure, go ahead. I'm not sure where I'm coming in from since I'm on Zoom so I can see you.

591
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:17,809
Can you? Yeah, I can see it now too. Okay. Um, so my one of my interests, I have several interests,

592
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:27,620
but one of my interests is looking at the effect of climate change on the distribution of waterborne diseases like the geographical distribution.

593
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:34,760
Yeah. So I found your time very interesting and I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on,

594
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:43,890
like you had mentioned, that implementing wash interventions are not necessarily successful elements.

595
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:49,340
That was like could you repeat that was because so general uptake.

596
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:53,510
Yeah. So are you familiar with what the benefits.

597
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:59,920
The boy spending more or less on those on site in Zimbabwe.

598
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:07,330
And so. Basically what they found in Bangladesh would get a wash hard.

599
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:15,700
Back to shore, unable to wash clean water and sanitation, reduce your risk of various diseases, and Zimbabwe and Kenya.

600
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:21,310
So there's a lot of debate about why that may have been happening. We know wash works.

601
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:27,640
Mm hmm. So this whole cluster randomized trials, so they're going on randomly select households.

602
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:31,770
Then you're like, you know, you got you got an intervention. You don't.

603
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:35,700
And what kind of intervention to got? But Wash.

604
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:46,610
Most of these diseases are spread by the environment. And so, as I mentioned, maybe you're only as safe as you're only as safe as your neighbor is.

605
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:52,180
So if your neighbor doesn't have a good latrine, doesn't drink clean water,

606
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:56,150
they'll continue being sick and keep shutting into the surrounding environment.

607
01:04:56,450 --> 01:05:01,850
And you'll still be coming into contact with pathogens because you're not an island. And so one of the theories is.

608
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:08,420
That in order for wash interventions to walk, you need to have a really high uptake.

609
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:14,329
Exactly. So maybe they calculated, I think based on how they do the studies,

610
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:19,640
only about 10% of the populations in the geographical areas will actually receive an intervention.

611
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:29,750
Most people would say that you need at least 70 to 80% of our population to get to uptake, a wash intervention for you to see an effect.

612
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:36,710
Definitely something weird. How many people actually take up an intervention?

613
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:41,510
The other question also is that maybe you're just measuring the wrong thing.

614
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:49,440
Wash. The outcome tends to be diarrheal prevalence on child growth.

615
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:55,190
Now there is a very complex. It's a symptom.

616
01:05:55,580 --> 01:06:03,890
It's a very complex symptom. And you're basically asking people to recall if your child's had there, maybe that's not the right metric.

617
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:07,940
And the other thing is, maybe we should not be under the right metric.

618
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:11,180
I mean, membership in measuring pathogen level to the environment, which is what I do.

619
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:16,250
So I don't I prefer not to ask,

620
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:24,379
do you have diarrhea or one of the underlying expenditure actually look at the environment and see do you actually have the pathogens?

621
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:30,250
Of course, diarrhea. I'm sorry if you have a lot of material loss of vital raw knowledge and the like.

622
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:36,220
Following an intervention, you may actually be getting more accurate than just asking for their real prevalence.

623
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:43,720
Sure. And that actually gets to the other point, which is what pathogens should remain.

624
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:50,370
So I'd be happy to know.

625
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,970
I mean, this is a whole you can't give a whole class on this.

626
01:06:55,590 --> 01:07:02,130
And one of the big things like what John Eisenberg and I was starting to think about is.

627
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:09,590
How climate change will affect the effectiveness of different sanitation interventions.

628
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:15,589
Right. And so so water sanitation interventions, I should say.

629
01:07:15,590 --> 01:07:18,950
So, for example, where climate change results in poor quality water,

630
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:23,150
it may increase the amount of water available to make the water more contaminated.

631
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:30,530
Or will climate change, depending on the area, you may have more flooding support, poor quality of water and others who might help less water.

632
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:43,330
And then the other one is. How will climate change, when we specifically think about precipitation here, impacts the effectiveness of sanitation?

633
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:53,500
So if, for example, they're in a low lying area, your sanitation facilities getting flooded, you might actually be not getting anything for them.

634
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:58,170
Or you may need to have really good sanitation facilities like central sewerage systems.

635
01:07:58,170 --> 01:08:02,050
So you actually see any improvement. So it's things like.

636
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:05,800
So there's a lot there's a whole slew of ways to think about it.

637
01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:11,099
Yeah, definitely. I've I've had lots of circulating questions.

638
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:18,150
When I was listening to your talk, I thought it was very interesting to know that like three cover mediated.

639
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:30,590
Like bacterial load I recall that directly correlate with like tree cover density or just the presence of what about

640
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:37,860
things like tree cover do is a lot of these things I think you should think about in light of pathogen persistence.

641
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:45,480
So your this you're more likely to get sick from a pathogen that has it on in the environment for a long time.

642
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:49,450
And you're less likely to get sick from a pathogen.

643
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:55,750
Doesn't hang around in the environment for a long time, but seem to be more likely to encounter pathogens that hangs around a long time.

644
01:08:57,030 --> 01:09:04,050
And so this is what things like Academy do. They may not only mediate how long the pathogens hang around in the environment.

645
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:10,530
Now, if that's in a purely environmental posture, but if you're dealing with a vector borne pathogen, it's kind of straightforward.

646
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:15,090
Different mosquitoes, ticks and the like have different ecologic zones.

647
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:20,550
And so depending on how the ecology is challenging, you might have different factors,

648
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:24,030
reactions of different iterations of inviting and pathogen transmission.

649
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:29,130
Or from my perspective, tree cover simply may change pathogen persistence.

650
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:36,550
Sure. So there's lots of ways to approach it, and it's very positive, independent and very system dependent.

651
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:41,500
Unfortunately, there's no it's very hard to come up with one role fits all.

652
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:44,350
You know, like three cowboy is good.

653
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:53,700
It's always good in some cases, you know, tree cover, maybe having maybe driving up vector borne diseases to prevent, let's say, diarrheal disease.

654
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:57,470
So it's there's always gray areas. Sure.

655
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:05,569
Okay. So in terms of I know I know like your talk was talking about one health and what we read about prior to this was

656
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:12,410
like what the students read about prior to this class was one house focusing more on the environmental interaction.

657
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:19,069
With humans. But I have to imagine that like with the project that you're working with Dr. Eisenberg on,

658
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:25,700
that there has to be some consideration of the socioeconomic factors that are influencing uptake, too.

659
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:34,010
Yeah. So that's a that's a big question is how do you actually measure social socioeconomic factors?

660
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:40,820
Yeah, that comes down to. How do you measure this?

661
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:47,240
How do you measure connectivity? So is connectivity between families and family members.

662
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:53,000
And so I approach it more from I can't speak a lot to the connectivity aspect of things.

663
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:59,420
That's not my wheelhouse. But I can say a lot about when you're looking at business risk, you always have to control for success.

664
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:05,930
That's common sense. And what I did of clean water and the like.

665
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:11,780
But when you're looking at these metrics, there's also a couple of ways you have to you have to understand what you're measuring,

666
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:17,260
how you're measuring consumption or you're measuring assets. And there's always a big.

667
01:11:18,230 --> 01:11:27,049
Most DHS surveys, for example, are asset based. You're simply asking people, do you want to buy be on a 3G on a cell phone, like but maybe what?

668
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:35,360
We actually have to be better, what we actually need to be better measuring disposable income or focusing more on consumption indices,

669
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:42,139
those may be better being able to tell us about how people actually are adopting to, let's say, disease change.

670
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:49,950
So. You may have a farmland, but it's hard to monetize it so you can go out and buy foreign.

671
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:55,440
But let's say you have a steady job and a life you can actually go out and buy.

672
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:59,040
So this is very simplistic. I'm not saying this is what's happening,

673
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:08,310
but it's also understanding how X has to be measured and what the impact of ISIS has on the real defense budget and on defense in general.

674
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:17,310
Is it like does education is more like making you more likely to buy medicine, is making you more likely to interrupt the health care system?

675
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:22,080
Is it making you're more likely to be informed and take preventative measures?

676
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:27,610
And how would you actually smash? Right.

677
01:12:28,230 --> 01:12:33,290
Oh, excellent. Oh, thank you.

678
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:39,040
Sorry, I've lots of that's going on, but I won't. I won't keep you any longer.

679
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:46,390
No, I mean, I still. I'm. I'm going to try to take another ten, 15 minutes, if you have an e-mail question.

680
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:54,250
Well, I'm wondering if potentially I don't know if Jonathan has your email and he could share that with me.

681
01:12:55,190 --> 01:13:00,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

682
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:00,670
So.
