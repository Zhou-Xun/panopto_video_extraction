1
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,703
After watching this video,

2
00:00:11,703 --> 00:00:15,970
you will be able to use PROC CORR
to get correlation coefficient.

3
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:22,700
And you will learn how to use PROC SGPLOT
to get boxplots and scatter plots.

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,257
You can use PROC CORR to calculate
correlation coefficients between any

5
00:00:27,257 --> 00:00:28,682
number of variables.

6
00:00:28,682 --> 00:00:33,174
Here, we're listing the variables protein,
calories and vitamin A,

7
00:00:33,174 --> 00:00:35,677
on the right you can see the main output,

8
00:00:35,677 --> 00:00:39,447
which is a correlation matrix
between the three variables.

9
00:00:39,447 --> 00:00:44,428
The diagonal is 1 because clearly each
variable is perfectly correlated with

10
00:00:44,428 --> 00:00:46,775
itself and the matrix is symmetric.

11
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:51,259
Each cell shows the Pearson correlation
coefficient, the p value for

12
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:55,895
the null hypothesis, which is that
the correlation coefficient is 0,

13
00:00:55,895 --> 00:00:59,478
that is no correlation and
the number of observations.

14
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:04,243
Please note that Pearson correlation
coefficients are the default option in

15
00:01:04,243 --> 00:01:09,660
PROC CORR and they are only valid if
both variables are normally distributed.

16
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,249
If this is not the case,

17
00:01:11,249 --> 00:01:16,860
you can use the Spearman option
as we will do in the next line.

18
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,992
Here, we are adding the Spearman
option to the PROC CORR statement and

19
00:01:20,992 --> 00:01:23,312
thus what we are getting in the output.

20
00:01:23,312 --> 00:01:27,716
Note that Spearman correlation should
be used when variables are not normally

21
00:01:27,716 --> 00:01:30,460
distributed.

22
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,646
Now, let's move into a SGPLOT,

23
00:01:32,646 --> 00:01:37,570
this is a procedure that allows
you to plot the data in many ways.

24
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:42,143
If you use the VBOX statement,
you will get a vertical boxplot,

25
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:46,750
the HBOX statement will give
you a horizontal boxplot.

26
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,472
Here, we are plotting the variable protein
by day, there are many interesting

27
00:01:51,472 --> 00:01:55,770
options for a SGPLOT, but for now we
will keep it to the minimum, like for

28
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,340
example adding a title
with the title statement.

29
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,368
If you want to get a scatter plot,
then you can also SGPLOT, but

30
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:07,980
then you have to use
this scatter statement.

31
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,663
Note that you have to specify in
the scatter statement where is your x and

32
00:02:12,663 --> 00:02:16,109
y variables, in this case,
calories and protein.

33
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:21,007
But you also need to include a regression
statement in which again you have

34
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:24,090
to specify your x and y variables.

35
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,631
In this statement,
we're also adding the option cli and clm,

36
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:33,517
the clm will create confidence limits for
the entire regression and

37
00:02:33,517 --> 00:02:39,310
cli will plot confidence limits for
the individual predicted values.

38
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,800
Same as before, you can also add
a title using the title statement.

39
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,428
So we are done with the basic procedures,
before moving on,

40
00:02:48,428 --> 00:02:52,800
I would like to share some
excellent SAS learning resources.

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,837
There are some textbooks that are plotted
here, you can see The Little SAS Book,

42
00:02:57,837 --> 00:03:02,283
Learning SAS by Example, and
the Statistical Programming in SAS, but

43
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:05,047
there are also many interesting websites.

44
00:03:05,047 --> 00:03:10,282
These are really useful sites to check on
any questions that you may have so far.

45
00:03:10,282 --> 00:03:14,632
And actually, you can also just Google,
I mean this is also useful,

46
00:03:14,632 --> 00:03:18,270
you will find many many websites.

47
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:22,679
Finally, don't feel frustrated if
you cannot remember all the codes,

48
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:28,560
it's okay, with time, you will start
learning them and feel more comfortable.

49
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,658
For now, all the code will be provided
as a template that you can use for

50
00:03:32,658 --> 00:03:36,230
your exercises, so don't worry.

51
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,998
So in summary, in this video, we learned
how to use PROC CORR to get correlation

52
00:03:40,998 --> 00:03:47,320
coefficients and we learn how to use PROC
SGPLOT to get boxplots and scatter plots.

53
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,140
Now, you're ready to move to
the next level, in the next video,

54
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:56,693
we will start using some of the code
we just learned to clean our database.
