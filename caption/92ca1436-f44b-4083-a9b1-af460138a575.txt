1
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:05,640
And then another. Yeah.

2
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:25,350
So early and early for.

3
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:42,040
I know he's out here wanting to people out with second or two people out with themselves or significant others being searched for.

4
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,540
He also who was, like socially acceptable to stand in the back of the room?

5
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,450
Well, you know, they used to put the cheap seats in the back.

6
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:13,319
Oh, and I mean, in Vienna, Austria, they have, you know, beautiful office right in the last row.

7
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:19,860
Seats at the very back, I've been told, was four soldiers with their swords because they can sit there.

8
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:29,000
And those are the cheap seats for real world.

9
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:41,580
Trump.

10
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:04,170
What I realized today was really special to do this period on ground where we moved here from here, boy, that's like a breakneck pace, you know.

11
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:16,450
So I think we may stretch a little bit into next week to do some more ground level stuff because it's so important for for you to improve on anyway.

12
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,540
You know, we're down to about 50%. This is just the quiz statistics from last time.

13
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:31,710
And things looked pretty good. But I did want to emphasize a couple of things.

14
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,950
The main concern is that you guys understand about aquifers.

15
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:48,840
And this question here, the groundwater elevation typically measured is feet or meters below ground surface.

16
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,230
That's correct. Or above mean sea level? That's correct.

17
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,790
Or decrease in both unconfined and confined aquifers with pumping.

18
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,260
This is true for the unconfined aquifer because it's kind of like a bathtub.

19
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:07,830
You pump it out, level goes down, but in a confined aquifer, it's compressed and the levels don't change.

20
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,130
Okay. So that's a big distinction between those two types of aquifers.

21
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,240
Is that clear? Okay. Um.

22
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,809
Yeah, focal point is also much deeper. Typically, much deeper.

23
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:27,110
But it all depends. Yeah, but it would be overlaid with a layer of impervious material.

24
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,660
Okay. And below that, it's saturated.

25
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:45,740
And then a recharge areas where water is going in to the surface and then percolating down and particularly hitting a aquifer.

26
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:50,389
Okay. And then if it's going down, it can't be coming up at the same time.

27
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:56,300
So you can't have an artesian well in that area. It's just not likely or possible.

28
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,550
But the rest footprint. Okay.

29
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:15,320
I wanted to talk today about, uh, groundwater flows, and there's a lot of models and some of the concepts with the models and.

30
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:26,470
I started off the unit showing you a cross section and I want to go back to that cross section if I can find it.

31
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:43,360
And this takes me back to this Metamora landfill, which is a very long story.

32
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:48,430
But this was the a Superfund site in Michigan and this is what it looked like.

33
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,330
Aerial photo. Big landfill. And looking down from the top.

34
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:03,760
This was a contaminated area. This was another contaminated area where there were a lot of drums that were just tossed in a pit in the ground.

35
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,340
And just to give you a sense of the relief. It's an old quarry.

36
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:15,160
So they dug out. And so there's a fair bit of topography to this.

37
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:23,529
And the dots are all showing you locations where wells or boreholes were drilled to

38
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,600
be able to understand the groundwater elevation at that location in the stratigraphy.

39
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:34,960
Okay. So this is a graph water flow moving largely to the north.

40
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:42,309
So we only have a few operating wells because most of the action is down gradient and then down gradient.

41
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:48,220
We try to do sort of profiles to get a sense of how far and how fast the contamination is spread.

42
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,440
So the stratigraphy is kind of depicted here.

43
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,250
You know, just go through these little videos and those are how deep the boreholes went.

44
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:10,090
And then you can see who's at the towards here, including, of course, as it turns out,

45
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:15,820
or we believe it turns out, and sort of bedrock below just to get a 3D sense.

46
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,400
Of course, you don't see that you infer that from these borehole locations.

47
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:37,070
And this is just, again, giving you a picture of how some of these areas start to thin out parts of town like this one from out.

48
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,720
And the point of that and out.

49
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:53,080
And then we can look at some of the different contaminants that are present because they did what they call profile sampling.

50
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,520
Every five meters you collect the water sample and then you analyze it.

51
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:03,370
So let me show you that for a couple of different contaminants, biotechs we talked about.

52
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:11,530
So again, the water sampling wells and then the locations that are sampled are shown as these little blue spheres.

53
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:20,620
And this is going to show you concentrations at different levels, starting off with 20 micrograms per liter.

54
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:29,560
The plume is only really here as we decrease or increase the concentration.

55
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,570
The contaminated area shrinks.

56
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:41,050
So the B text contamination basically occurred directly underneath where some of the drums were dumped and it didn't get very far.

57
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,540
Okay. One group, B techs, very volatile.

58
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:53,470
It evaporates. It degrades. Let's look at chloride.

59
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,570
The chloride trips to the north.

60
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:08,320
He's gone off site in the top back before.

61
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,810
Certainly not good for the third act. Okay.

62
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:17,110
So those are confined aquifers as the concentration goes up.

63
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,130
The area that's most contaminated shrinks. Okay.

64
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:30,370
So the hot spot, again, is heard below, but the plume has reached up north and then also penetrated into aquifers below.

65
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:39,610
Oh, I guess we don't really care about chloride as contaminant for the most part,

66
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:44,740
except that it's a marker of a landfill because every landfill will have chloride salts.

67
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,410
Okay, so there's a couple of other chemicals here.

68
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:58,660
Ketones, for example. But this is just giving you a picture of how detailed an investigation is at one of these Superfund sites.

69
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:04,030
Many boreholes, many samples taken at different locations in the different aquifers.

70
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:11,920
And this allows us to see the extent of the plume. And there basically isn't very much for talking to us in this case.

71
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:22,200
Okay. Questions on this presentation. Why was this done?

72
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,980
Somebody went to the trouble of making this video. All these different videos.

73
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:43,780
Can you think why folks would do that? You're going to visualize that so that you know where where to clean it up in that area and traveling through.

74
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:49,920
Yeah, we do that typically with maps, not these kinds of videos, but that's absolutely correct.

75
00:10:51,600 --> 00:11:03,850
Okay. Others. You know, this is an interesting case because this is a very expensive site to clean up.

76
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:11,660
Who pays for the cleanup in a Superfund case? Well, sir, yes.

77
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:18,170
But then EPA will turn around through quarters, try to get reimbursed from the parties.

78
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:21,559
Potentially responsible parties are called. Okay.

79
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,980
So industry in theory, should be paying for this.

80
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:34,460
Okay. And in this particular case, the PR piece, which were, you know, massive companies,

81
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:46,190
hired a firm to put this stuff together to convince you very that the strategy to clean this site off was going to be monitored.

82
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:57,830
Natural attenuation, which is, of course, I mean, workers, as usual, M&A and monitored natural attenuation.

83
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:08,660
So in other words, we didn't see those containers drift off because they were either be fired up or degraded or otherwise not measured in sense.

84
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,710
Okay. So today I want to continue with these concepts of of flow.

85
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:24,200
And I already talked about this slide last week. There's an error on the slide in the unsaturated form.

86
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:32,670
Just go straight. Okay. There's no gradient pushing it. We talked about recharge areas.

87
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:39,840
But now we're starting to get into a situation where the recharge in one zone,

88
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:47,070
there's lateral movement in the direction which has a discharge area in a different area.

89
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:58,560
And if we come to a recharge area over here and here's the water table, recharge right here comes out into the stream or recharge in this area.

90
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,750
It takes you into a potentially different aquifer or out over here.

91
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:10,430
So we're starting to see some complexity with respect to migration flows here.

92
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,360
I ask you to look at the Excel pipeline? Yes.

93
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:24,920
At the beginning of this class, if you got into some of the appendices, you would have seen description of the different aquifers.

94
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:30,340
This is actually a massive picture.

95
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,970
It's going from the Canadian border all the way down a thousand miles.

96
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:43,670
This is a thousand mile section stretched out vertically, as we typically do a number of different aquifers at different levels here,

97
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:50,330
because that would be potentially impacted if this pipeline leaked,

98
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:59,360
including the Ogallala formation, which is a Near-surface aquifer, usually within a couple of hundred feet of the surface,

99
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:06,290
which is very extensively utilized in northern Texas and other areas for agricultural purposes.

100
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:11,300
The groundwater flow about a foot per day.

101
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:16,130
Okay. So it's pretty modest. Massive, massive aquifer.

102
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:29,950
All right. We already talked about groundwater flows where we have the heads or these lines of potentials.

103
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:38,390
It can be the groundwater height for an unsaturated aquifer or the p symmetric or potentially

104
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:45,490
symmetric metric surface if a confined aquifer that reflects both water pressure plus the elevation.

105
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,900
And I want to show you a number of different situations with us. Okay.

106
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:59,080
The first one is what we call. Well, draw down here is an unsaturated aquifer.

107
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,750
Put a well in here. Portions here we start pumping.

108
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,260
What happens? The water will rush in. It will cause a draw down.

109
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:16,690
And this is an area that previously was saturated and now it's dry.

110
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:23,610
This will form in 3D, kind of a cone around this.

111
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:28,330
The more you pump, the more the drawdown increase. Okay.

112
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,770
Unsaturated aquifer only. Water table.

113
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:40,500
Aquifer only. If we visualize this from above.

114
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:50,219
These are those potential lines where you could think of these as contour lines, where the depth to the groundwater is increasing.

115
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,120
The closer you get to the well, water flows downhill.

116
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:59,880
So this is a higher level than this. This this water flows in to the water.

117
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,350
Okay. So you kind of have like this hole in the ground that you're walking towards.

118
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,090
Everybody good with that? And this is connected to aquifer.

119
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:14,580
This is a water table aquifer. Think of it as your sandbox.

120
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,920
Okay. And you put a big pipe or a straw or something, you suck up.

121
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,729
Water is going to decrease closest to that pipe to that.

122
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:29,040
Well. This is an interesting picture because it also has a barrier.

123
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:36,030
Think of this as a fence or could be a natural or a manmade barrier.

124
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:46,680
Water can't flow through that barrier. So these lines, by definition, have to be perpendicular to that barrier.

125
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:55,770
If they're not, then water would flow through. And so what this does is kind of a long gate out on the side to draw down,

126
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:00,630
because as it sucks in water from here, no water flow here to replenish that.

127
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:04,710
So this leads to even deeper drawdown just going to the north.

128
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,900
So we're starting to see some of the three dimensional aspects.

129
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,670
On the bottom side, we have what we call a perennial stream.

130
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,750
In other words, the stream is always flowing. There's enough water in the stream.

131
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:33,270
It's going to essentially donate water to that well. And so we could see relatively constant height here decreasing as we go down to the well.

132
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,610
Let's add a little more complexity to this.

133
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:49,060
One of the standard things that we do to clean up groundwater is pump it out of the ground treated and then re-injected.

134
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:57,370
Here's my pump. Well, I have my own depression.

135
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:02,530
We call it okay or draw down. I take that water and treat it.

136
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:10,840
Put it back in here. We have a recharge well, and now we have a cone of impression.

137
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:17,640
So the water's kind of piling up at that location. In this picture.

138
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:28,170
I have these two interacting and my interaction is basically this result in the cold, somewhere in between those two lines.

139
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,340
Everybody good? Now this pump and treat strategy.

140
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:44,790
If my contamination is in this area here. The groundwater flow will be towards this direction.

141
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:52,450
So I pick up contaminated groundwater here or will treat it, discharge it, clean water.

142
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:56,280
It comes back in a sweep, even more contamination.

143
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,770
So this can look like a nice system to treat groundwater that's been contaminated.

144
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:12,570
Assuming that I put my extraction well on one side of the contamination in my injection well or recharge well on the other side.

145
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,110
Everybody with me. What's the problem with this?

146
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:32,790
The problem is it's not very selective. When I pump water out of fuel, I'm drawing in water over here, which is perfectly good.

147
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:39,060
I don't want to treat that. So at least half of the water I'm pumping waste.

148
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:48,690
Similarly with the discharge throwing half of that food order somewhere else, it doesn't help me sweep those contaminants out.

149
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:56,340
So it is not very efficient. What can I do to improve the efficiency here?

150
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:18,250
Then you thought an idea. Oh, I'm sure we just saw that impervious boundary before.

151
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,440
If I put a wall right here. Good. Okay.

152
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:30,309
Yeah. Put a slurry wall. Basically, take a trench down to the groundwater floor.

153
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:34,510
Here, fill it with something impervious. Expanding.

154
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:38,420
Bentonite. Clay is the method of. Of a material choice.

155
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,900
It's just the clay. Then it will pop any water in here instead of just pull it from this direction.

156
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:50,520
So that's one strategy that might be used. Everybody get that.

157
00:20:51,760 --> 00:21:00,280
Just like we saw with this picture here. Okay.

158
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:07,540
Back to groundwater flows, increasing the scale a bit. You guys should be pretty comfortable now looking at this.

159
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:16,270
We have the water table up here. We have a actuator or confining layer here.

160
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:22,110
This defines the water table aquifer. We have another good finding bed where I put to our.

161
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,320
Here we have another aquifer which holds the intermediate.

162
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,930
We have another aquifer below called the Deep Aquifer.

163
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:40,960
What's interesting and what I like about this is it shows you how the water flows from saying recharge of the surface comes out well,

164
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,630
may take a couple of days, might take a year.

165
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:56,920
Relatively short time for water that gets into the deeper aquifer can be centuries old and then in the deepest aquifer millennium.

166
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:02,530
And this is in part why we really prefer these deeper aquifers.

167
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,550
I mean, this is pre-industrial age. There's no contamination here.

168
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:17,800
Okay. Same sort of picture here except a different cross section.

169
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:24,550
What's interesting here is wherever recharge occurs, it all comes out at the same location.

170
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,450
In this particular picture, it doesn't in this picture, though.

171
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:33,580
So, you know, it depends on the scientists, the artists, whoever is drawing the picture.

172
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,810
By the way, we have a small corner of depression around that for.

173
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,900
I learned a lot.

174
00:22:51,450 --> 00:23:12,670
Here's a picture from Florida where I know the fee, at least at the surface, tends to be mostly coastal sand, pretty hetero homogeneous aquifer.

175
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:19,800
It's really not showing you too much. That's new. We've already talked about evapotranspiration, precipitation and so forth.

176
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:35,930
In Michigan, it's a bit more complex from the prior ice ages, all the ice sitting on top, it really pressed the stratum.

177
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:40,610
So we had this arc here, which forms a number of different aquifers.

178
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:49,950
The one that we often draw water from is this one shown here as the partial formation.

179
00:23:50,600 --> 00:24:01,070
Point is the aquifer and it's extensive and yields a lot of water for the state.

180
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,180
The Saginaw formation a little smaller, often used as well.

181
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:25,170
So these are bedrock in glacial aquifers. It's quite complex because of the formation of the different types of soils and rocks.

182
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,260
So there's a little description of it here.

183
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:40,290
And again, the martial art for being sandstone is one of the most important for us in the Saginaw for a portion of Michigan as well.

184
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,640
It's also a sandstone aquifer, but then it's got other stuff in this desert.

185
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:02,610
This is a picture from another year of the different aquifers that might be affected by water extractions and petroleum development.

186
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,850
It's complex and super complex.

187
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:16,920
This is an artist's conception, again, because we basically are looking at the cross-section in this case from the south, a north.

188
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:21,090
And so that's this profile in Alberta.

189
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,740
And we do have a number of boreholes.

190
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:35,820
The bore is extracted, analyzed for grain size and potentially other things.

191
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,690
And then they're kind of linked together in this picture.

192
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:44,070
But recognize, you have no data between these boreholes.

193
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:49,260
Okay. So if there is a gap or window or something like that, you won't see it.

194
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:55,010
And so, you know, something like this may continue.

195
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:59,340
We might just kind of kina, something like this may not extend very far.

196
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:15,480
Skip this one. All right. So we already talked about groundwater pollution in urban areas, in rural areas.

197
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:20,820
We talked a little bit about the density of materials, apples to apples.

198
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:31,410
I'm going to come back to that. We also need to recognize the source of contamination in one area can lead to migration.

199
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,150
That affects you completely different.

200
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:40,320
We're okay with intermediate zones potentially not being affected because the team is traveling in a 3D pattern.

201
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:55,770
So to talk about how contaminants move, we need to have the right language.

202
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,250
We've already talked about non-reactive or conservative contaminants.

203
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:06,330
In the Metamora case, I showed you chlorine. The chlorine plume, essentially conservative.

204
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:10,680
It's just an I am Btecs would be an example of a reactive contaminant.

205
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:18,090
Both of them will move by advection the bulk flow of the groundwater and then by dispersion as well.

206
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:27,540
Dispersion and groundwater enforced media occurs via several different mechanisms.

207
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,450
We're going to look at those within a poor channel between different four channels.

208
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:42,180
But the overarching kind of concept is this notion of torch velocity and branching and interfering.

209
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:48,810
And we'll talk about this. Molecular diffusion is also one of the processes.

210
00:27:48,810 --> 00:28:00,100
But again, that's a very small scale. Okay. So in this kind of textbook example, you might have containment here.

211
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:08,200
You're trying to zero the location of here as it moves the containment center to spread in different directions.

212
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:13,510
So the size of the area increases that's contaminated, although the concentrations will decrease.

213
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:21,400
Why does that happen? Well, it happens because it's being dispersed in all directions.

214
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:26,320
This little picture, again, shows contaminated area, the plume.

215
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:36,430
The water has to travel between soil grains or lenses or areas which may be clay or scramble or sand or so.

216
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:40,150
And it will preferentially travel through the path of least resistance.

217
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:41,650
Okay.

218
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:49,660
So the path of least resistance, the plume will speed up where it hits into pockets of resistance, it will slow down and it'll try to get around it.

219
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:55,930
So it will spread. We also have drag imposed by the borders,

220
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:05,110
so the velocity is slower at the perimeter of a channel and this can lead to some degree of dispersion as well.

221
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:14,290
Essentially the same processes in the longitudinal or flow direction as in the transverse direction or perpendicular to the flow.

222
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:26,660
We're going to model some of this to. The amount of spurting.

223
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:33,380
We call this passivity. You could think of it as dispersion rates, if you like.

224
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:42,230
Here are two different pictures. Here I have a I prefer a waste site.

225
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:57,380
And then I have lines showing the concentrations, the concentrations in the first place or essentially uniform throughout the depth of the aquifer.

226
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:03,050
That's because it spreads quite rapidly in this particular picture.

227
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,390
In the second case,

228
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:14,750
we have a more well-defined plume with the highest concentration of the central line and then decreasing as I move away from the center.

229
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:21,410
And this is because there's very limited spreading in the vertical direction that this passivity is small.

230
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,530
Otherwise the same amount of contamination, same flow, but the pattern is very different.

231
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,270
And of course, the more experienced, the lower the concentration.

232
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:50,890
To make sense. This notion of this passivity. Here's another picture because there's so many different ways to get to the same endpoint.

233
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,580
In this case, I have a bloom at the scene. It's spreading.

234
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:05,270
It's moving towards the bright yellow flow. We have a certain amount of dilution and we end up with concentrations increasing.

235
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:10,390
So I get ahead of the front and basically it's clear.

236
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:16,930
All right. This might be something that applies in an aquifer like a uniform sand.

237
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:22,840
Okay, so there's a homogeneous characteristic to the aquifer.

238
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:30,520
It's all the same wherever I go. Second panel has stratigraphy or it's heterogeneous.

239
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:39,730
And in this case, we have these fingers or layers or lenses of high conductivity material.

240
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:51,130
So we might have, for example, ancient stream bed here or here, and then layers of clay or something else in between.

241
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:57,430
So the water is kind of squeezed through these areas of high conductivity first.

242
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,560
And that's where the plume goes as well.

243
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:10,480
So one thing that's really weird is that if you think of this and you sort of do a spatial average, you get this.

244
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:23,990
But the process that drives this is really due to what's happening at a smaller scale because it's just averaged out in this particular case.

245
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:31,620
This is sort of the same as we're going to model this.

246
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:44,960
Here's the same sort of concept. For now, we have a layered aquifer sand, sandy, clay, gravel, clay and so forth.

247
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:53,780
In the gravel, for example, we have high velocity and that's because there's lots of open passages.

248
00:32:53,780 --> 00:33:01,670
Water will move through. We'll talk about the hydraulic conductivity is very high in contrast in clay.

249
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:08,090
Very fine grained structured material with plates that block the flow.

250
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:16,130
The velocity is very well. The major mechanism that moves material through clay, in fact, is diffusion.

251
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:21,050
Well, in the gravel layer, it's advection. We're called convection in this flood.

252
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:31,610
So we have different drivers depending on the structure of the media make sense.

253
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:46,400
So this is an animation, if it works, a fingering in a layer of porous media, just like I showed you and.

254
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:55,540
It's not that dramatic, actually, and it doesn't fly in the media.

255
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:07,670
Nothing ever works. So in addition to simple advection diffusion, we also have for reactive contaminants,

256
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:15,200
absorption of resorption or desorption and basically picking up the contaminant

257
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:24,380
into the coarse media by surface reactions or properties or other mechanisms.

258
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:29,750
Of course we can have chemical reactions and we can have biological transformations as well.

259
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:47,750
You will see in many models the comparison between conservative and reactive contaminants, because we'd like to know where the water is flowing.

260
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:55,010
And to do that, we disregard the chemistry and physics and the biology.

261
00:34:55,910 --> 00:35:01,069
So we make what we know is a reactive contaminant into non reactive and that

262
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:05,360
just allows water to flow because we use something called particle tracing.

263
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:12,970
And I'll show you that in a second. Okay.

264
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,680
Back to draw down again. Here's our website.

265
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:22,549
Here is our water table. We put it in a extraction.

266
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:29,230
Will we have a draw down? Here's where the old screen we have in previous avatar below it.

267
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:35,370
Again, the groundwater symbol. Which way is the water flowing?

268
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:43,660
To the right. Which way is the water flowing here? It's going to slow down, right?

269
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,630
Because this is an unsaturated aquifer. All right.

270
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:58,090
So here we have contamination coming in. We don't want to use this water.

271
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:02,920
We think it's contaminated. So what we want to do is put a monitoring well in upstream.

272
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,790
And as soon as we detect contamination here, we turn off that water.

273
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:12,250
And so we ensure we only pump clean water.

274
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:19,330
Over time that this contamination may spread to the supply.

275
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:29,500
Well. This is kind of depicted in this plot here, where I have no contamination up to a point, and then I start to see an increase.

276
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:37,210
We have typically some action limit imposed, whether it's dioxin or PE, false or whatever.

277
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:44,980
And when we get to the action level, we turn over essentially what's happened in Ann Arbor with dioxane.

278
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:51,040
Okay. And false for will be false for that.

279
00:36:52,210 --> 00:37:01,120
So this is what we call a breakthrough curve. Classic picture, idealized sigmoid l curve.

280
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,510
Okay. The only subtlety on this is why does it look like that?

281
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,190
If I had no dispersion,

282
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:27,920
then I would just have a throat of contamination moving through behind my my fingers and dirty furnace clean and we get this well flow line.

283
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:35,130
But because we have that dispersion. Some parts of the plume squeeze through faster than others.

284
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:40,310
We kind of get the sigmoid. Some of it reaches out before the boom.

285
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:51,080
The bulk of the plume. So because of that, we really do have sort of a margin of error built into us.

286
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:55,310
We'll start to see contamination before most of it's there.

287
00:37:56,030 --> 00:38:00,290
Some of it will get through on the tail. So it makes sense.

288
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:15,890
And one of the parameters that we are often very interested in calculating is the travel time or the mean velocity,

289
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,080
and that would apply to essentially the center of the plume.

290
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:25,930
And so I can calculate the travel time if I want to.

291
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:36,770
Well, faster or this line steeper, because for the increased pumping velocity will increase, the travel time will be reduced.

292
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,620
Look, we go down breakthrough curves.

293
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:58,860
Typically in environmental health, we talk about breakthrough for things like respirators or chemical controls or other things.

294
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:11,670
But it applies to groundwater to. Similar sort of picture here again, contaminated site.

295
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,000
We have a plume coming across. We have three different wells.

296
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:20,040
We have the groundwater elevation sloping a little bit to the right of a plume, moves to the right.

297
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:24,060
But in this case, I am showing you the effect of retardation.

298
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:32,040
If the water is flowing at a velocity, say, I don't know, a meter per day.

299
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:39,690
If the contaminant front is flowing at the same velocity, then there's no retardation.

300
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:47,010
And we call the retardation coefficient the ratio of those two and retardation coefficient is one.

301
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:54,239
On the other hand, if we have a contaminant that likes to partition into the soil, for example,

302
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:03,680
an organic compound that's happier sticking to an organic, rich or mineral surface, then that will be retarded.

303
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:04,920
It won't flow as quickly.

304
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:17,340
And we have a number of contaminants where the retardation coefficient can be anything from, you know, from one or 2000s, they will move slowly.

305
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:25,650
And this retardation coefficient is just a simple way to get a handle on the relative speed or for that particular contaminant.

306
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:30,180
So if I give you a solvent like benzene or something,

307
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:37,770
its retardation coefficient is depending on a variety of things, like how much organic carbon there is in the soil.

308
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,720
Its retardation coefficient could be two to 10 to 20 or something like that.

309
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:50,550
So that means that the water moves at a certain rate, but the benzene moves 2 to 20 times slower.

310
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,950
I showed you to start off today. Metamora.

311
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:06,240
Chlorine chloride plume moved with a retardation coefficient of one, but to be tax had a high retardation coefficient hardly moved at all.

312
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:13,200
Same sort of thing. Sometimes I ask you to calculate retardation coefficients.

313
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,550
I don't think I will, but it's kind of a good exercise.

314
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:30,840
Okay. There are lots of parameters influencing the transport and feed for organics and metals in groundwater and soils.

315
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:42,860
Some of those are listed here. Okay.

316
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:54,000
When we go back to the entry of contaminants into groundwater systems through the unsaturated zone, we're dealing with a very complex matrix.

317
00:41:54,600 --> 00:42:01,979
We consider this to be a multiphase system, and this applies to both the saturated unsaturated zone and,

318
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,880
of course, the water table and confined aquifers as well.

319
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:12,329
Here's a picture of soil grains. We have spaces between the soil.

320
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:18,390
Grains can be filled with vapor air water.

321
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:27,659
When we're dealing with non aqueous phase systems or contaminants like solvents

322
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:33,810
of water will have typically some of the mineral grains coated with water,

323
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:39,840
some of them coated with the oily, organic or whatever it happens to be,

324
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:49,680
will have vapor pressure producing some pockets potentially of vapor in there or of air that might be in there.

325
00:42:51,330 --> 00:43:01,320
So we have here a very complex system of air vapor, mineral, oil, water, a lot of stuff going on.

326
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:11,610
It's a big mess. And then, of course, you know, my characterization is quite simple, but the water can be different types of water.

327
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:15,510
It can have humid materials. It can have bacteria and other things in there.

328
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:23,400
The solvent itself, it can be very diverse as well. So this is a complex multiphase system.

329
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:34,410
A key distinguishing factor, though, is what kind of solvent do we have as the density like neutral or dense?

330
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,120
And so we need to come back to understanding on Apple's Indianapolis.

331
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:46,110
So that's where I'm going to go next. Got to take a sip before.

332
00:43:50,200 --> 00:44:07,870
Okay. This is an important slide. This is showing you pictures of El Napoles giving the example of an El Temple.

333
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:19,570
Yeah. Petroleum products. Most petroleum products like solvents, oils and gasoline.

334
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:28,270
Okay, we have a leak at the surface in the unsaturated zone above the triangle goes straight down work.

335
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:34,940
Okay. It'll go through the little openings and the soil hits the top of the groundwater.

336
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:42,340
The capillary fringe starts to spread out horizontally because it's an l an apple.

337
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:50,260
It's lighter than water. The density, it will stay above the groundwater but depress the groundwater table.

338
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:54,740
It will move down a gradient.

339
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,360
The groundwater flows to the right. So we have a longer table on this slide.

340
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:06,120
When the spill is halted, the tank ran out or maybe remediated it.

341
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,470
There will be a certain amount of rebound.

342
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:19,750
The groundwater table will push back up a little bit, will have in his own here material that we call that residual saturation.

343
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:26,200
In other words, most of those interstitial spaces will be full of oil.

344
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:35,710
And then we'll have a dissolve team as well as motivate people to not show very well on here.

345
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:44,110
Okay. This is the classic picture for the spill of an Elmo, in a sense.

346
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:52,330
Most of the contamination stays above the groundwater level, just right at the groundwater table.

347
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:57,520
And what's really nice is we could essentially put a pump right here to collect most of it.

348
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:10,960
But we have this messy area of foam, which is where the oil penetrated through the soil and below, which is where the rebound occurred.

349
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:19,870
And all of this material stays with residual contamination in the groundwater, in the ground, in the aquifer.

350
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:25,750
And this is very hard to get out in that can provide a source of contamination for many years to come.

351
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:33,040
Okay. Depends on, you know, what, the chemical weapon.

352
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:42,130
Now, this picture is exactly the same three panels, but now we're dealing with a dense non acquiesce phase liquid.

353
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:49,320
Give me an example of one of those. Who got to for.

354
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:58,340
Otis solvent benzene? No, benzene is just milled now.

355
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:11,700
Most of chlorinated solvents, trichloroethylene, dry cleaning fluid, for example, per core ethylene tetrachloride.

356
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:17,820
These are denser river density, about 1.3 here at the top.

357
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,900
We have the source. Again, it's moving vertically.

358
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:27,870
It tends to form these kind of fingers because it presses pushes the water away

359
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,040
because it's denser and that allows more of it to flow through that channel.

360
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:44,760
Hits the water table, can have a dissolved plume, but the bulk of the materials, it's the water table and it's still denser than the water.

361
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:56,160
So it continues to move downward. Here there's a picture of a low permeability strata, maybe a clay lens or something like that.

362
00:47:56,580 --> 00:48:00,420
It actually starts to pile up here, finds the other end,

363
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:10,530
and then further and time continues to flow downward and it will basically fill up the bottom of the aquifer with this dinner.

364
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:22,310
Completely different behavior. Okay. This will allow this plume to reach the full vertical extent through the aquifer.

365
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:29,390
And then as it dissolves slightly, it'll contaminate the groundwater, the whole depth of the aquifer.

366
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:38,510
Moreover, the bulk of the DiNapoli will end up pooling at the bottom of the aquifer.

367
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,660
It's not going to float at the top. It's going to pull at the bottom.

368
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:50,720
But there have been cases where we've actually been able to pump out thousands of gallons of DiNapoli.

369
00:48:50,870 --> 00:49:01,490
If you find that right spot because it's still all there, but you won't typically get it all because of the problem of residual contamination.

370
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:11,260
So did apples are definitely a mess to clean up because they can potentially contaminate the full extent of the aquifer.

371
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:16,120
While in contrast, only Apple's going to remain at the surface.

372
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:21,220
Superfund sites have both typically on apples and apples.

373
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:25,050
So you've got a very complex situation on there.

374
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:37,070
Let me pose questions. You're quiet today.

375
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:44,100
I got to bring you sugar or caffeine or something.

376
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,670
Lots of arrows. Definitely.

377
00:49:54,350 --> 00:50:00,750
But you understand them, all right? Sure. So I have a question just on the last comment.

378
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,810
Do they prioritize splitting up these over? Yeah.

379
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:11,390
Well, it's hard to answer that blanket in a blanket manner.

380
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:16,040
I mean, some of the apples are pretty toxic, so we're concerned about that.

381
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:21,950
On the other hand, they're really hard to clean up. Right. And the apples float on top.

382
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:27,710
And I can get them with skimmers and other things that basically float on the well and just pull them out.

383
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:37,370
So I would say in recent years. Oh, and the other big difference is apples are typically aromatics or electronics,

384
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:44,120
which degrade pretty rapidly so that they're going to sort of go away by themselves fairly quickly.

385
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48,350
But the the apples will remain problems for many, many years.

386
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:58,760
And so, you know, it would make more sense to go after the old apples, pineapples, sorry, the ones that are persistent and very toxic.

387
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:10,600
So. Okay.

388
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:21,490
Too many errors. Sorry about that. But you guys should understand everything on here.

389
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:30,160
Okay. You get the capillary fringe, right? And the water table upper and lower portions of that aquifer and so forth.

390
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:34,480
Okay, good. So, again, I showed you this picture before.

391
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:40,870
Typical petroleum tank gasoline spill on apple or apple gold.

392
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:48,650
Apple floats on top. And I talked about these bills before.

393
00:51:53,700 --> 00:52:06,110
One of the things that has happened with the recognition of the importance of these groundwater sources is to have wellhead protection variants.

394
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:13,410
In the old days, we just would say, if you've got a water supply or there's not a community water supply,

395
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:22,560
just be a certain distance from potential contamination sources like a gas station or industry or something like that.

396
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:26,910
It doesn't make any sense because if you're in a recharge area, it's going to get there.

397
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:32,760
So now we try to do is to develop a wellhead for television program,

398
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:41,070
which shows which areas are likely to affect that well for that specific well and protect that area.

399
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:48,990
And to do this, we use groundwater models typically to define the wellhead protection area.

400
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:54,210
And it's based on, you know, all the factors that influence the water movement.

401
00:52:55,410 --> 00:53:03,540
So I have a picture here with from our friends at Michigan Environmental Quality.

402
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:13,170
This is showing what an 800 foot isolation area around a well near the Kalamazoo River would look like.

403
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:22,680
On the other hand, when they did the groundwater modeling, this is the area in blue that in fact, would lead to contamination at that well.

404
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,040
And so this area is what really needs to be protected.

405
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:32,280
Okay. So there's a need for analysis to come up with this.

406
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:43,610
So that gets us a little bit into models and how we use models for wellhead protection as well as lots of other purposes.

407
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:54,440
So I want to sort of shift gears to do that, and it's a good place to take a short break and then we'll come back and talk about models.

408
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:13,620
And I'm the one who needs future. So from, you know, resume my life, work through lunch.

409
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:26,050
Right. And just keep going. Let's turn. You guys have classes scheduled at 12 to 1 and 1 to 2 and 2 to 3 and so forth.

410
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:35,710
And how about an eight hour block of classes?

411
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:39,910
And we're at four of those hours with like a lab.

412
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:43,900
So you definitely get either that right?

413
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:49,990
Well, the problem I mean, I was just on a zoom and I said, I'm going to turn off my camera because I'm eating.

414
00:54:49,990 --> 00:55:01,990
And everybody says, we're all eating too. So it's okay. I should see if some of my models work here.

415
00:55:21,610 --> 00:58:36,050
Okay. Mm hmm.

416
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:06,890
Okay, everybody. Well, not everybody back, but let's. Let's keep going, I guess.

417
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:11,950
So otherwise I get distracted in my emails or whatever.

418
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:24,530
So I want to talk about groundwater modeling and have enough time hopefully to to demo a few intuition building models.

419
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:28,820
So a model, of course, is a mathematical description of the processes.

420
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:40,310
And for groundwater, we're trying to simulate typically a certain domain which we define within some boundary conditions and so forth.

421
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:50,180
Groundwater models can be really complex, so they typically utilize numerical solution techniques, and so they're iterative in nature.

422
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:57,950
They often almost all form, almost always, but always simulate heterogeneous systems.

423
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:02,990
So in other words, the soil properties differ from one location to another.

424
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:13,670
They need to represent the groundwater flows or hydrology, the chemical transport, the chemistry and biochemistry occurring in the subsurface.

425
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:18,970
These can be neglected, simplified or modeled in great detail.

426
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:23,240
It all depends. The general modeling approach is laid out here.

427
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:28,070
First, you want to define your area as a conceptual model typically,

428
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:33,350
but then when you get to filling in your model, you need to get the field information.

429
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:36,530
You determine the water flows, where's the water going?

430
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:46,190
Then you add the contaminants and the contaminants move along with the water, and you add the relevant chemical, physical or biological processes.

431
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:50,570
So basically you develop a flow field first and then you put in the contaminants.

432
01:03:53,840 --> 01:04:01,370
See how your predictions match your field observations. If your agreements is pretty good, then you can use that model.

433
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:05,060
If it's not good, you need more data. You need to revise your model.

434
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:08,810
So there's kind of a systems evaluation built into this framework.

435
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:17,319
This is a model in a spreadsheet. Okay. Because I have a lot to go through.

436
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:23,230
I'm not going to demo it for you. But I was using it this morning just to verify that everything is still good.

437
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,790
This is a very simple implementation.

438
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:32,200
But you have basically a 2D model here.

439
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:36,970
You have a source. You define source parameters in models approved.

440
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:41,380
These are the inputs that you need. Ultimately, this if we have time.

441
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:46,120
And it predicts when you hit the run center line or the run the plume.

442
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:52,000
What's happening in here is the plume shown in different concentrations as it moves downstream.

443
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:56,350
You can show it with or without decay.

444
01:04:56,380 --> 01:05:01,240
In other words, you can turn off the biological and chemical processes.

445
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:05,890
And then you're just showing how it moves as a conservative contaminant.

446
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:11,980
Okay. So this is very easy using this model G flow.

447
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:21,400
I'll also try to demo. It's a much more complex model, but it in fact has some simplifications built into it.

448
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:27,970
And here we have an extraction. Well, here is our wellhead protection area.

449
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:35,020
And then with essentially a click of a button, I can define the recharge area for that.

450
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:39,040
Well, this should be part of the area that's protected.

451
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:51,280
Okay. For that, will, each dot here represents, I think, a year of motion or movement for those contaminants.

452
01:05:51,520 --> 01:06:04,000
Okay. If I increase the extraction away from that, well, I'm pumping water faster and it's going to draw it in from a wider area as well.

453
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:09,430
So that protection area depends on the rate of pumping.

454
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:17,650
Right now we're in a very interesting situation because we have a drought in a lot of portions of the world.

455
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:21,610
And this would also affect these zones.

456
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:31,060
Sort of the top of the range model is called Mod Flow or Mod 3D.

457
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:37,660
And this is a model that's received a tremendous amount of development and support and is very complex to use.

458
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:40,690
I'm not going to download it for you, but again,

459
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:50,650
here is the case where we have a plume and it's spreading into Lake Michigan in this direction and into this tributary in the other direction.

460
01:06:51,310 --> 01:07:04,180
Interestingly, if I account for the rise and fall of the water table in a transient mode, more of it shifts over to the stream,

461
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:12,280
over to the right, so you can get different results if you assume steady state or non steady state or transient conditions.

462
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:21,850
Okay. How do these models work? To understand how they work, we need to understand these parameters.

463
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:25,059
So this is what I want to go through. Porosity.

464
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:28,330
We've already talked about hydraulic conductivity and the rest of this is new.

465
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:35,020
So let me get into this. Porosity is just the void space.

466
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:40,330
And we looked at this before for gravels and other things.

467
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:45,130
Basically, those parameters range up to 40 or 50% depending on the pores media.

468
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:53,980
This basically just defines the poor space filled with water where water can flow as well.

469
01:07:55,750 --> 01:08:04,420
Hydraulic conductivity. This is a new one. This is a measure of friction loss as water moves through in transit.

470
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:12,040
We have ranges of hydraulic activity for different soil types.

471
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:18,310
Basically, this number is expressed as K is a meters per second of velocity.

472
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:24,880
It's highest and of course gravel where water can flow through in a relatively unimpeded manner.

473
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:30,620
It's very low in a place where the water is bound up and is not going to move.

474
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:35,650
The range of this span, something like ten or more orders of magnitude.

475
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:39,100
This is an enormous shift. Okay.

476
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:40,720
Really, really a big change.

477
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:57,860
So if you take a well sorted sand with big particles, little particles will have a high porosity and a high hydraulic conductivity.

478
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:08,480
If you take something like basalt or something like that, obviously there's not much porosity there or not which way for the water to move.

479
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:20,330
So it'll have a low hydraulic conductivity as well. We talked about isotropic and anisotropic processes before and this order flow through

480
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:25,850
this direction or this direction through the sand will have the same characteristics.

481
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:33,590
What if I take fractured raw wood or limestone with channels etched in?

482
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:41,120
It will differ by direction. So this is a case of and I saw Trump and I saw tribute for the properties.

483
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:48,390
Okay. This is all put together what we call Darcy's Law.

484
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:53,700
Darcy was a French hydrologist, I guess.

485
01:09:54,630 --> 01:10:05,640
His breakthrough was this understanding that the hydraulic conductivity and the pressure gradient determines the water flow.

486
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:12,390
Basically, what you can do is think of of cross-section or profile.

487
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:18,810
Here is the water table. If I drill a well, it will rise to the height in the water table.

488
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:24,149
Darcy conceived, of course, media. Well, not really, Darcy.

489
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:29,660
But hydrologists is sort of a tool in the forest media.

490
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:34,290
Water pressure at the top of the tube is this height.

491
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:37,890
The water pressure at the exit of the tube is lower.

492
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:45,300
This imparts a hydraulic gradient. We can pull this out, put it into the water.

493
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:50,520
Here we have again a water pressure at the end with the water pressure at the outlet.

494
01:10:51,730 --> 01:11:00,300
That differential pressure, the change from here to here divided by the gradient is the height difference.

495
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:06,420
Divided by the way, it's a water pressure change with distance.

496
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:17,840
Think of it this way. If from here to here is a thousand meters and the water drops one meter.

497
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:29,120
I have a hydraulic gradient of 0.001, so I'm walking running kilometer length goes down, the water table goes down just to me.

498
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:36,770
Okay. On the other hand, imagine it goes down ten times more.

499
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:41,570
So I'm going again a kilometer. The slope is increased.

500
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:54,050
Now the hydraulic reading is 0.01, which endorses law that will result in a tenfold increase in H1 minus H2,

501
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:57,140
which means the flow will be ten times higher.

502
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:09,310
And then Darcy also figured out that well it's a cross sectional area A and in the media properties expresses the hydraulic conductivity

503
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:19,750
in L over two terms which we put in here is a normalizing constant in this gives us the total flow that's all tertiary bars.

504
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:29,500
Okay it's going to tell us that all things being the same, doubling the head differential or the pressure gradient doubles the flow,

505
01:12:30,670 --> 01:12:34,570
doubling the hydraulic conductivity, we'll double the flow.

506
01:12:35,530 --> 01:12:42,850
Okay. And again, that hydraulic conductivity is a critical parameter with more than ten orders of magnitude depending on the media.

507
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:54,290
Reports. You guys get this. This is complex because we're dealing here with a gradient.

508
01:12:54,590 --> 01:13:00,530
Each one minus H two over L, which is essentially the slope of the groundwater table or the pressure.

509
01:13:03,090 --> 01:13:13,340
Typical hydraulic kind of hydraulic gradients are pretty small 0.01.01 and smaller, but they can be higher times.

510
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:20,340
So velocity is the flow divided by the area.

511
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:26,790
So I can take D'Arcy's law, simplify it, take out that e term and I get the ground water velocity.

512
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:32,430
It's just a function of the hydraulic conductivity and the gradient.

513
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:39,450
Okay, that's all it is. A couple of things.

514
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:42,819
This is an empirical law. Okay.

515
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:53,550
It was used in all of these laboratory tests, but it works pretty well, except that really high velocities where you get turbulence breaks down.

516
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:57,450
But that's not that's not typical in a natural setting.

517
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:08,570
I have to say also that this view is of bulk for.

518
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:17,420
In reality, however, if you look at the porous media, the flow is only occurring through the channels.

519
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:26,840
And so to have an overall velocity of velocity, given that most of the channels are blocked off,

520
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:30,350
we have to have much far faster flow in those channels.

521
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:35,390
And we get that if we divide the book velocity B by the porosity.

522
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:43,970
So in other words, if half of its blocked off, then the water flow has to be twice as high to get the same amount of velocity as in the bulk flow.

523
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:53,150
Another way to think about it is here is the water moving through those interstitial spaces.

524
01:14:53,630 --> 01:15:03,410
It follows what we call a very tortuous path. The total extent of the poor space compared to the total space is the porosity.

525
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:08,370
We already define that as a. Okay.

526
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:20,570
So. We can take doses longer and divide by buy, get the velocity and of course the VPI,

527
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:26,220
the velocity may be a better predictor of the travel time than the bulk velocity.

528
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:32,500
It depends. Let's try and do it here.

529
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:38,620
Good. All right. I want to bring these concepts to a real problem.

530
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,540
This is that's an interesting twist.

531
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:53,020
But if any of you have been south of town, Elsworth and I, 23, right over here is our old landfill.

532
01:15:53,620 --> 01:16:01,810
Look where all the solid waste used to go. There's still a materials recovery center there, but the landfill is shut down.

533
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:15,700
This is the reason why it's shut down. We have in a modern landfill way down here, which is protecting the underlying groundwater.

534
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:22,060
Order doesn't want to go through clay. There's also other engineered surfaces in here.

535
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:30,010
But this clay liner is the primary barrier in in our worst case, the groundwater elevation, in fact, is pretty high.

536
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:36,730
And the landfill was dug out of all the groundwater to the misty.

537
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:49,680
It's old and we could put in a sturdy wall here to keep the groundwater from moving into us.

538
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:57,800
So this wall is basically a barrier for the surface water aquifer and it goes down into the claymore.

539
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:06,580
So we're essentially protecting our landfill by building a little trench, filling it with bentonite play again,

540
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:14,080
and keeping the groundwater because any water that comes into the landfill is

541
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:17,710
going to leak out and it will have to be collected or treated or whatever.

542
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:31,480
So the parameters here for the Ann Arbor landfill or that we would have three footed wall right here.

543
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:38,770
It's going to be 36 feet high from almost the ground level surface into the clay.

544
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:47,650
And it's going to have to go around the landfill, about 8000 foot perimeter, which is a couple of acres, roughly half the size.

545
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:54,010
So my question is, will any water penetrate this wall?

546
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:00,850
If so, what pumping rate do we need to keep the aquifer dry?

547
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:07,030
And you'll notice here, a drainage system has been built in between the landfill, the wall.

548
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:14,430
We can pump the water out. And then how long does it take for water to pass through that three foot wall?

549
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:24,070
It's not as complex as you think. Clay has a hydraulic properties.

550
01:18:24,730 --> 01:18:31,330
We can take it off the table. I gave you before I draw a conductivity of about ten to the minus nine meters per second.

551
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:41,800
Pretty small ferocity of about 0.4. The only tough question here is what's the hydraulic gradient?

552
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:51,250
Again, remember, this is defined as the distance in the ground water height divided by the.

553
01:18:53,780 --> 01:19:01,730
Like going back to my picture. I'm looking for the water to pass through this barrier.

554
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:07,940
Three feet wide. The groundwater at this end is 36 feet.

555
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:13,160
Full height at this end. Or assuming it's dry with zero.

556
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:23,720
So the average between the two is 18 and that would be 18 feet over a three foot reach.

557
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:34,930
So that's a hydraulic gradient of six. That's the average gradient across that wall.

558
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:38,350
It's smaller at the top, higher at the bottom.

559
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:46,300
So let's just the average. Can you explain again why you're carrying the 36 and how.

560
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:50,820
Mm hmm. You agree with me?

561
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:57,660
The water table at this end is 18 or I'm sorry, 36 feet above this point.

562
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:02,520
Okay. And in Darcy's lines, linear with gradient.

563
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:09,000
So if I take the average, it will give me the right answer. That's really the bottom line.

564
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:27,420
Then taking the area and every thousand perimeter feet, 36 feet high overall do a conversion because I need to get things in two meters square.

565
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:31,650
I have about 27,000 meters squared of wall.

566
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:40,100
So now it's just a plug in showing the bulk velocity I can solve the poor velocity,

567
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:43,650
the flow, the travel time with the equations that I gave you before.

568
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:48,190
Let's look at the flow. We have the area of 27,000 meters.

569
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:59,550
We're withdrawing from activity here of 10 to -9 gradients of 6.35 thousand cubic meters per year.

570
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:13,310
That's a fair amount of water coming through. Considering a tanker truck to export that water might hold a couple dozen cubic meters.

571
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:23,500
That's a lot of trucks. Include the travel time of distance, three feet divided by the poor velocity, which I got up here.

572
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:27,430
It's going to take about six years for water to move through that wall.

573
01:21:28,270 --> 01:21:33,190
But there's a lot of wall, 27,000 square meters.

574
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:40,879
So this is not a very good solution to maintaining Ann Arbor's Lane.

575
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:44,300
So to have a barrier wall to deep water.

576
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:48,470
So this proposal was nixed. Just too expensive.

577
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:55,250
Not really sustainable. Not a good option. But it demonstrates 34 questions on.

578
01:22:03,070 --> 01:22:09,670
The key things that I really want you to get is this kind of concept here where you have

579
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:14,680
water being forced through forced media as a function of the difference in pressures.

580
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:20,650
Okay. Higher pressure here will increase the flow there linearly.

581
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:26,830
And the controls include the k the hydraulic conductivity and of course, the higher.

582
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:41,740
Skip this. We've already talked about interceptor drains,

583
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:52,870
but this is a picture that is showing a sort of distributed wealth instead of just a single point to try to pick it up,

584
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:55,150
pick up the plume, essentially, it's the same.

585
01:22:55,960 --> 01:23:06,460
So the idea is you have the germinated site trying to bring up the groundwater plume before it moves further down to do damage.

586
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:08,049
We call that interceptor.

587
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:21,220
Well, and again, like I showed you with the cone of depression, where I pull water around the corner of impression or I put the word back in.

588
01:23:22,450 --> 01:23:29,110
If I design this and look at the groundwater flows, they have to be perpendicular to the lines of here.

589
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:39,220
And so it forms this kind of zone. So anything in this zone will be intercepted and we can use groundwater models to determine this.

590
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:56,600
So I want to demonstrate this first model called Total Drive, which is useful in building your intuition.

591
01:23:56,810 --> 01:24:05,150
If this isn't on the canvas, so it'll help that on there. Let me just go right into a demo instead of using this.

592
01:24:12,350 --> 01:24:23,660
So Topo drive. You can just download this directory and these files and basically you.

593
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:30,370
Start by the finding a domain length concern.

594
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:35,920
And let's say we're interested in a thousand meters zone.

595
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:43,630
And then typically to look at it, we expand the vertical and let's do it by, I don't know, ten times.

596
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:52,810
So here is our zone that we're going to look at and I'm going to define a water table.

597
01:24:53,560 --> 01:25:04,750
So I just click outside the box and I can define a valley system, for example, or whatever I want to define.

598
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:13,660
And so this is actually a water table across this regime of a thousand meters length.

599
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:31,930
I am using a numerical approach here and I set up a mesh with, I don't know, 50, I don't know how fast this computer is, let's say 40 by 24 rows.

600
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:44,390
And so basically each one of these cells is going to solve D'Arcy's law, plus a lot of other stuff three, then four.

601
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:47,920
And, you know, we're looking at a cross-section here, okay.

602
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:52,240
And we have a hill. Another hill. And things just end at these boundaries.

603
01:25:52,720 --> 01:26:04,770
Okay. I have to give my foil some properties and I can choose or come up with whatever hydraulic properties I want.

604
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:11,070
Let's say it's a sand. What's the typical hydraulic conductivity for sand?

605
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:14,310
It's pretty high, so I don't know.

606
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:18,390
Let's choose the blue area and I'll just define all of this.

607
01:26:19,630 --> 01:26:25,570
I can make it in isotropic with a difference in vertical or horizontal, but sand has to be isotropic.

608
01:26:26,830 --> 01:26:30,700
So I'm going to try to find everything as sand.

609
01:26:30,970 --> 01:26:35,650
To start off with if I can. Oops.

610
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:43,750
I didn't quite get the field right. Okay.

611
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:49,620
And then I'm going to solve for the heads and how many contours?

612
01:26:49,720 --> 01:26:54,570
I don't know. It doesn't really matter. And so this is what the heads look like.

613
01:26:55,390 --> 01:27:04,120
So in other words, at this point might represent this elevation and this point represents that elevation.

614
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:10,120
The heads are very simple here. Basically, the heads are going to decrease as I move in this direction.

615
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:17,770
Order is going to want to flow to the right. And then I can add some flows.

616
01:27:18,370 --> 01:27:26,770
And I can do this with flow path tracing. For example, if I'm at this location, the flow is going to be like that.

617
01:27:26,890 --> 01:27:31,510
If I have this location, the flow is like that, like this.

618
01:27:32,410 --> 01:27:39,630
And this starts to look just like the pictures in the text of water moving from a recharge

619
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:48,100
location and it was downward and then horizontally and would discharge at this location.

620
01:27:49,420 --> 01:28:05,170
Okay. The other option for me to look at flows would be to look at particles, and I need to specify particle spacing.

621
01:28:06,970 --> 01:28:15,850
And for example, if I have a wayside at this location and those are my particles, think of those as contaminants.

622
01:28:16,510 --> 01:28:24,880
And then I can animate this. One second of animation time on a one day and then click on this somewhere.

623
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:29,320
And that's just the way they move if they follow those flow lines.

624
01:28:29,770 --> 01:28:39,430
Okay. So. You know, whatever you find is helpful.

625
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:45,130
Look at forward only. So again, you know, any place you start, this is where you end up.

626
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:54,730
And that's when we get in the flow of the flow of the water or the flow of contaminants.

627
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:59,320
Okay. Now, this is a simplest case, isotropic properties.

628
01:28:59,950 --> 01:29:07,450
Okay. Let's say that there is a stream rate over here, and I have a contamination source right over here.

629
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:11,020
I want to protect this. How could I do that?

630
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:19,990
Well, in the Ann Arbor case, we were going to define some low permeability material.

631
01:29:20,710 --> 01:29:27,520
And so let's build a trench in here, and I'm going to build it pretty deep.

632
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:34,460
And that trench is that expanding clay, the bentonite clay.

633
01:29:35,210 --> 01:29:40,850
And now that I've altered the field here, I need to recalculate my hands.

634
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:45,080
And here they are. They don't look all that different, but they're a little bit different.

635
01:29:45,710 --> 01:29:56,510
And now if I look at the flow and again, do flow path tracing, if I have contaminants enter here, it's essentially unchanged.

636
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:00,080
But what if they happen to come in at this location?

637
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:06,080
It's a little bit different. Quite interesting, actually,

638
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:16,370
because there still is a region which can bypass my barrier and go underneath and shoot

639
01:30:16,370 --> 01:30:21,110
out the other side and then still come into my stream that I want to protect her.

640
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:27,530
Okay. I didn't go all the way down to the bottom of the water table, so let's do that.

641
01:30:29,990 --> 01:30:34,850
So I need to go back to properties. I'm still using this pinkish color thing.

642
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:39,500
I'm going to define the entire length.

643
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:47,240
And now let's recalculate the head. And something has changed.

644
01:30:48,990 --> 01:31:02,270
What's changed? Lines of orphans stopped here.

645
01:31:04,150 --> 01:31:10,719
Okay. We're essentially done is I've put in an almost like a theme here and I need to sort of step

646
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:16,300
across the dam and then I go down the lot because this is a barrier that's presenting it,

647
01:31:17,170 --> 01:31:22,300
preventing water flow. And to get on the other side of it, I have to change quite a lot in height.

648
01:31:22,330 --> 01:31:27,760
There's a lot less pressure on the other side. We'll give you some more examples.

649
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:38,050
It's a little tough if I look at the flow and again and I look at all let's look at particle motion here and I better do slope tracing first.

650
01:31:39,610 --> 01:31:43,570
So again, stuff that comes in looks the same. Where is this going to go?

651
01:31:48,990 --> 01:31:52,200
It doesn't get through that barrier. All right.

652
01:31:52,210 --> 01:31:57,090
Well, that's a little bit of surprise. How about if I have a part right here? Nothing is getting through that part.

653
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:01,530
So what I've done is successfully separate this really into two watersheds.

654
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:07,170
I'm a little surprised myself with that result because some water will flow through that.

655
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:12,330
But I made that barrier so good that it won't. All right,

656
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:18,810
so then let's have a barrier with that look like it will look like a trench

657
01:32:19,230 --> 01:32:23,760
that has been filled with concrete or bentonite clay or something like that,

658
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:29,100
compressed. And it's very impermeable, but it's really hard to construct one that's that good.

659
01:32:29,850 --> 01:32:40,260
So if we have, in fact, some leaks in that system, for example, at this location, there is a gap.

660
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:45,150
Okay. And these things deteriorate over time as well.

661
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:51,230
Do the heads again? Do the flows path.

662
01:32:52,560 --> 01:33:01,860
And again, now I have an area where I do get this preferential flow right through that system.

663
01:33:04,490 --> 01:33:08,240
It's also flowing through at the top. That's right.

664
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:13,340
So actually, there is some water getting through this, but it would be very, very slow.

665
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:19,790
And in fact, if I do the animation with particles, which is not quite here,

666
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:24,599
with particles here, you have to be a little bit careful because I have too many particles.

667
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:29,480
The numerical crunching is just incredible. Even with this simple model.

668
01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:39,560
So if I'm going to say up here, I have a bunch of particles and I animate this and click on this somewhere.

669
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:45,140
Some of them go off in the other direction, leave the system.

670
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:53,390
None of them go through that gap. I think I can actually put in a lot more particles.

671
01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:00,720
Again. When I do this, I have to be a little bit careful.

672
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:05,520
There's particles we animators work on there.

673
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:09,420
That's where most of the plume is going. Some of it gets through.

674
01:34:11,310 --> 01:34:18,210
You can see nothing that actually went through that wall at all, found the bypass instead.

675
01:34:33,610 --> 01:34:46,300
This particular model doesn't represent this passivity is it's instead of continuous here but a couple of other things are worth noting on here.

676
01:34:47,050 --> 01:34:51,250
It's relatively easy to look at, okay, it's using D'Arcy's law.

677
01:34:52,360 --> 01:35:00,580
It's dynamic because it's tracking the particles over time and they're shifting position and the new position that they end up in, whatever.

678
01:35:00,590 --> 01:35:04,210
So looks at the gradients and the particle basically just moves down gradient.

679
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:19,040
I like this model because it builds your tuition about the way groundwater gradients are developed in the unsaturated.

680
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:29,540
So if we go back and set this up one more time, we use properties that are random.

681
01:35:29,570 --> 01:35:33,360
I guess this doesn't allow me to do that. I thought it.

682
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:45,490
Also this with the next model and stuff. Okay.

683
01:35:45,910 --> 01:35:49,240
Can I move on to another model? I want you guys to try this one.

684
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:52,540
I'm not sure if I'm going to do homework with this or not.

685
01:35:55,360 --> 01:36:09,100
This p flow is quite similar, but instead of looking at a profile, we're just going to be looking down on a source on a site.

686
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:22,750
So again, if I make my matrix each meter, each element, one meter, make this 100, it's going to be too many, probably.

687
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:30,790
Let's make it 60 by 30. Here, I have to give an overall hydraulic gradient.

688
01:36:31,150 --> 01:36:35,590
So think of yourself on the coast of Florida or somewhere.

689
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:40,510
And we have a nice uniform gradient sloping down to the sea.

690
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:44,190
Okay. And maybe that gradient is point over.

691
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:58,740
Let's zoom in. So at this end, the elevation, let's say, is one meter higher than at this end.

692
01:36:58,780 --> 01:37:05,720
This is 100 meters long. That's what it means. Okay, let's put some properties in there.

693
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:12,940
Let's randomize it. It's say mostly sand, but a little silt and clay.

694
01:37:13,390 --> 01:37:18,910
And so those are the media properties. Again, calculate the headlines.

695
01:37:20,410 --> 01:37:29,920
Let's put in the max 30 and it shouldn't surprise you, but it's essentially uniform decrease as I move to the lower elevations.

696
01:37:31,270 --> 01:37:39,370
Okay. Because the soil is just sort of randomly configured with respect to its hydraulic conductivity and porosity and so forth.

697
01:37:41,410 --> 01:37:46,980
So it shouldn't surprise you if I put in a particle, it starts here,

698
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:53,139
it basically migrates directly down gradient with a little bit twists and turns

699
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:58,240
wherever there's a higher hydraulic conductivity place and the flow skirts.

700
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:03,970
Okay. So basically the contamination at this site is just going to move down gradient.

701
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:15,010
Everybody with me. All right. Now let's go back and change the properties because I don't know,

702
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:20,620
maybe I have a well down here I want to protect, so I'm going to build a barrier here.

703
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:25,480
So, again, let's choose a low hydraulic conductivity.

704
01:38:25,990 --> 01:38:29,350
Let's make it very low. Excuse me.

705
01:38:30,910 --> 01:38:37,900
Let's put that barrier right in the middle. So that's a high hydrogel conductivity area.

706
01:38:38,710 --> 01:38:42,490
Okay, million dollar question. What are the heads going to look like?

707
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:51,420
Before they were more or less uniform. So it's a nice, gradual decrease as I move across.

708
01:38:52,050 --> 01:39:03,390
What are they going to look like now? They're much more compact in a way for differences like a water flow.

709
01:39:04,050 --> 01:39:10,350
What have I just done right here? I put a dam here, so the water is going to be home.

710
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:13,860
Very low on this side of the table. So let's see.

711
01:39:14,430 --> 01:39:19,850
Do the headlines already here? Exactly.

712
01:39:20,150 --> 01:39:25,130
The water tables all the same height here. The decrease is very rapidly here.

713
01:39:25,430 --> 01:39:28,730
It's all the same height. So the water's flowing.

714
01:39:28,940 --> 01:39:35,180
It's this hard to get through point drops very quickly after that, and then it's easy once again.

715
01:39:35,210 --> 01:39:38,540
So it's a level that makes sense.

716
01:39:38,870 --> 01:39:50,050
It's just like a dam. So this is kind of a oversimplify case, particle flow tracking again.

717
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:57,610
What's going to happen here basically gets up to the dam and then goes over.

718
01:39:59,350 --> 01:40:06,610
Okay. It may be more instructive to think about the animation here because there is a sense of travel time.

719
01:40:07,150 --> 01:40:23,630
And so if I have this you. Two particles here.

720
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:30,280
Initial spacing. Five particles are here.

721
01:40:33,290 --> 01:40:42,640
Right I to. It's moving, but not very fast.

722
01:40:44,020 --> 01:40:48,610
That's the problem. Okay, let's quit animate again.

723
01:40:49,330 --> 01:40:52,659
Maybe my hydraulic gradient is not that fast.

724
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:55,660
So let's move. Speed it up 20 times.

725
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:01,960
Okay, now you can start to see the move, but I don't think we have enough time to wait.

726
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:07,000
So let's speed it up again.

727
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,810
Let's make it 60 times 60 days.

728
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:21,400
And got to be very patient to be patient enough here or do I need to speed it up?

729
01:41:25,820 --> 01:41:38,340
I need to speed it up. What do you think's going to happen?

730
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:48,400
It's going to hit that dam. And then what? Slow down.

731
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:54,780
To slow down. And then what? And then once you get past it.

732
01:41:57,330 --> 01:42:02,700
I guess the girl is coming, too. Yeah, that's it.

733
01:42:02,870 --> 01:42:07,440
So I'm in the water, goes over the dam. The velocity may change a little bit, but not that much.

734
01:42:08,130 --> 01:42:16,770
Okay. And then it moves onward. Okay.

735
01:42:16,890 --> 01:42:26,970
So we've got this structure here. But as I mentioned, you know, constructing these that are foolproof, that lasts for decades is really, really hard.

736
01:42:27,330 --> 01:42:30,840
So let's simulate a crack in the wall.

737
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:36,360
And so we'll have a high hydraulic period. Oops, I just lost everything.

738
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:46,170
Let's go back and put in my barrier again. I'll make it more uniform than I had it last time.

739
01:42:46,710 --> 01:42:50,760
And then let's put in a crack in the wall.

740
01:42:51,350 --> 01:42:54,690
Hydraulic conductivity. I'll just put it in the center.

741
01:42:56,250 --> 01:42:59,390
Okay. And now again, we calculate the heads.

742
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:04,440
What's this going to look like? Very different.

743
01:43:05,910 --> 01:43:09,570
What is going on? Again, we have the dam right here.

744
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:14,730
You step over the dam. We drop down a foot or a meter in this case here.

745
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:18,540
However, there's a more gradual flip. A shoot. Okay.

746
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:24,360
The water flowing through that. So you can imagine what this is going to do for particles.

747
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:30,150
Again, flow, path tracking, particle coming in here.

748
01:43:33,270 --> 01:43:42,150
It finds a preferential channel. And so essentially, you know, this dam with a fracture or break didn't work.

749
01:43:42,810 --> 01:43:46,080
Okay. It allowed all the water to rush through that point.

750
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:49,420
Again, what is going to want to find the point of least resistance?

751
01:43:50,820 --> 01:44:02,530
Okay. The other thing that can be interesting with these is the animations because it gives you a sense of the travel time.

752
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:15,490
And, you know, I do kind of like to use the particle piece and you know,

753
01:44:15,490 --> 01:44:23,139
if I put in patches of particles more or less uniformly, they're, I don't know, an animate.

754
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:26,740
There's nothing happened.

755
01:44:32,210 --> 01:44:36,230
Oh, they went through so fast. I don't know.

756
01:44:36,230 --> 01:44:40,540
They seem like they're disappearing. That's kind of weird.

757
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:54,650
The other thing that is sometimes quite useful to do, and you'll see this as well, is that there are.

758
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:04,640
I lost it. I'll just put the particles here.

759
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:14,720
I'll try it. And then you can also get the center of mass as well in another plot.

760
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:18,530
So here's the little distribution with the center of mass here.

761
01:45:19,130 --> 01:45:30,730
And then to animate this. I don't think it's running fast enough to do it, but you'd see that spread and you could track where the plume was.

762
01:45:31,270 --> 01:45:37,060
With this approach and I should know better than to do this because I can't get out of it now.

763
01:45:37,870 --> 01:45:45,380
So. Control does anything with this.

764
01:45:49,490 --> 01:45:55,240
Hmm. So that's one of the issues with numerical models.

765
01:45:55,450 --> 01:46:00,550
They're very easy to overlook. Okay. The number of calculations that this is doing is pretty immense.

766
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:06,220
Right. Because it's essentially in each one of those little grid cells or mesh nodes.

767
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:10,240
It's solving a bunch of different equations and tracking them as well.

768
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:19,770
So these two models are useful for developing.

769
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:27,180
And here's some other simulations that I've done, sort of this notion of like a preferential channel in this case.

770
01:46:27,630 --> 01:46:36,570
And what I was modeling in this picture was, let's say you had a utility trench with power lines or water supply or sewage,

771
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:42,480
and that's typically backfilled with sand and gravel. It's a preferential path.

772
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:48,480
So if you do have contamination, it's going to find that seek it out and flow very rapidly through that.

773
01:46:49,230 --> 01:46:53,280
Okay. And so that is sometimes really important to understand.

774
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:57,240
And you can simulate that with these types of models very easily.

775
01:47:01,110 --> 01:47:06,000
Okay. This is the simplest two groundwater models I can give you.

776
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:15,270
Okay, but they're still not even that simple because the soil is potentially heterogeneous.

777
01:47:15,750 --> 01:47:19,980
Properties vary from place to place. It can be an isotropic.

778
01:47:20,010 --> 01:47:31,740
I can demonstrate that for you. We looked at one scale only, but clearly we have to think multi-scale and the geometry can be really complicated.

779
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:41,070
These models were only saturated flow, but we also have to deal with unsaturated flow and times as well.

780
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:50,009
They didn't account for a couple learning or the wedding process or phase change in these models to look at physical,

781
01:47:50,010 --> 01:47:56,670
chemical or biological processes. That EPA model for landfills and other things does do that.

782
01:47:57,420 --> 01:48:04,110
Okay. And it's worth trying. And if I have time, I'll go over these models for 2D.

783
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:09,870
We need 3D models in reality. They were not steady state.

784
01:48:09,870 --> 01:48:13,710
They were time dependent, although the heads were steady state.

785
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:23,490
Okay. So the particles moved around, the system changed locations changed over time, but the groundwater flows were constant.

786
01:48:23,910 --> 01:48:28,870
So it's like we're looking at one season, same amount of precipitation through the season.

787
01:48:29,190 --> 01:48:36,970
Things like that. Reality is more complex. They were numerical and you know, there's no validation in these at all.

788
01:48:36,990 --> 01:48:40,530
It's just a demo. All right.

789
01:48:40,530 --> 01:48:52,530
We talked about many more before. Some of the material here really goes beyond what is necessary to understand the impacts.

790
01:48:52,530 --> 01:49:00,250
But, you know, if you're building a well, you want to make sure that it's representative of what you want to sample.

791
01:49:00,630 --> 01:49:06,180
So you have to put the screen location where the water enters in the right place.

792
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:13,230
You want to make sure you don't allow contaminants from other areas to get into it.

793
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:19,620
And so you have to have a good seal between the well and the soil around it.

794
01:49:20,130 --> 01:49:25,650
So there are a variety of different steps that are used to do that for all of this work.

795
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:30,560
You sample just one location, okay?

796
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:32,430
And so this is kind of an issue.

797
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:44,130
So we get into these well clusters where we can have screens at different locations and then do this profiling, vertical profiling.

798
01:49:44,670 --> 01:49:50,130
And so this is sometimes done to save money and to increase the amount of information.

799
01:49:50,550 --> 01:49:58,350
And many of these wells can be used for groundwater extraction as part of a proper treatment process as well.

800
01:49:58,680 --> 01:50:06,600
And so this allows you to fine tune your extraction so that, you know, the plume is down here from this well, not these other.

801
01:50:10,550 --> 01:50:13,600
But still, these wells cost many thousands to put into place.

802
01:50:13,610 --> 01:50:17,390
So they're expensive as wells are drilled.

803
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:26,629
There's a drillers log and this will capture the different soil horizons, the grain size and observations,

804
01:50:26,630 --> 01:50:32,690
whether it smells its color or there's oily material or whatever that's in there.

805
01:50:39,340 --> 01:50:51,520
Contaminated sites may have dozens of wells that are used to define the soil properties, the groundwater flows and so forth to optimize the strategy.

806
01:50:52,370 --> 01:50:59,860
And then what I have here is here in Ann Arbor, what the Gelman dioxane plume looks like.

807
01:51:00,820 --> 01:51:05,020
And the area is just west of town.

808
01:51:05,030 --> 01:51:07,580
Here's I-94, here's 14.

809
01:51:07,990 --> 01:51:16,900
We are sitting somewhere over here, and everything in this area is potentially at risk to having that plume move underneath us.

810
01:51:17,380 --> 01:51:26,980
And you can see where it is here, these little red and white symbols or boreholes or wells that have been used to detect the contamination.

811
01:51:27,490 --> 01:51:32,200
Most of the plume is sort of going straight through the middle of town.

812
01:51:32,590 --> 01:51:40,090
Part of it, the sources over here moved to the north and entered the Honey Creek tributary,

813
01:51:40,090 --> 01:51:44,980
which leads into the third river up here, which is what we use for drinking water.

814
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:56,530
This is just a picture of the facility, the line lagoon, where this junk was disposed of.

815
01:51:57,130 --> 01:52:01,300
I'm sorry to say, line on line lagoon. Okay.

816
01:52:02,260 --> 01:52:11,800
And, you know, there are some extraction wells shown in the bigger circles here to try to slow down the movement of this front.

817
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:16,989
But it's too little too late for hydraulic gradients.

818
01:52:16,990 --> 01:52:22,570
And then sort of what the plume looks like like ten, 20 years ago, ten years ago,

819
01:52:23,290 --> 01:52:36,580
and the concentrations that are seen at the extraction of the close up in this area here, folks are prohibited from using wells for drinking water.

820
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:42,910
I mean, pretty much everybody's on city water anyway. But there have been folks on, well, water.

821
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:52,600
Okay, good. We're not through it. I may pick up a few loose ends, but we're going to shift gears and start talking about air quality.
