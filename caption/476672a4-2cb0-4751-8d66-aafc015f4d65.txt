1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,660
How is public health different from health care? How do governments play a role in public health decisions?

2
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,620
Who's involved in the financial management in health organizations?

3
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,160
And what's the best way to advocate for public health policy?

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,420
I'm Michael Rubin from the Department of Health Management and Policy at the School of Public Health.

5
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,020
And I'm excited for you to join us for Pub Health 513.

6
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:39,650
This course is all about providing you with the opportunity to think about our public health system,

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,970
public health policy development, and the fundamental concepts you'll need to manage public health organizations.

8
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:56,180
By the end of this course, you'll be able to compare the structure and function of health care, public health and regulatory systems.

9
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:05,570
You're also going to learn about how each of these is organized and financed, as well as how they operate in national and international contexts.

10
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,440
We're going to explore the history and core functions of public health,

11
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:14,870
how the public health policymaking process works, and the rules of ethics and evidence.

12
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:21,169
You'll also have a chance to think about the importance of human resources in health care organizations and

13
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:28,340
apply negotiation and mediation skills to address both interpersonal and inter organizational challenges.

14
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:36,200
We're going to look at strategies to identify stakeholders, how you build coalitions that help influence public health outcomes,

15
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,229
and how you can develop the skills you'll need to advocate for political, social,

16
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:48,320
or economic policies that you'll be working to improve health in diverse populations.

17
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,590
As future public health professionals, you're going to be interfacing all the time with administrators,

18
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,660
managers, policymakers and stakeholders all throughout your career.

19
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:09,120
And each of you joins us from a different department. But health policy, it connects in a significant way to all of your work.

20
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:17,080
In epidemiology, you may want to know about the key features of the populations and sub populations that you're monitoring.

21
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:22,900
This will provide you with a better understanding of the context of disease and treatment.

22
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,730
For those of you who specialize in bio statistics,

23
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:35,489
big data is essential to health care delivery and understanding how our health care and public health systems are structured is going to

24
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:44,580
help you to contextualize the nature of your statistical analysis for health behavior and health education as well as nutritional sciences.

25
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,350
You might be interested in understanding what the structural components of our health care

26
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:56,220
system and public health system are and how they influence a population's health status.

27
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,360
Now, these systems affect the values of providing care,

28
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,950
and you'll need to have an important understanding of how care coordination works inside of communities.

29
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,020
And for those of you who are pursuing a career in environmental health sciences,

30
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:21,780
understanding health policy will help you to frame the implementation of risk based and environmental interventions.

31
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,200
In this way, you're going to gain a deeper knowledge of the role of organizational management and health

32
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,990
care system dynamics that impact how the environment affects a population's health status.

33
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:41,760
So as you move through this course over the coming months, we're excited to help bring our health care and public health systems alive.

34
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:47,459
We're looking forward to helping you uncover the wide range of opportunities you'll

35
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,410
have to influence the public health system and the public health landscape.

36
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,090
So let's get started.
