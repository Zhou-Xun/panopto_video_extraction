1
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:44,450
Turn on live transcript for those that are attending remotely.

2
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:55,450
I'm going to hide the subtitle for us on this side because I don't want to showcase an option that won't be available, while you're teaching in your classroom.

3
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:11,450
So for those that are participating online for your questions I'm going to ask you to use the chat box only and not to unmute, and I'm going to ask you not to use the raise hand as those are cues that are really easy to miss.

4
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:22,450
And you can use the chat, I have my colleague, Frederique, online with you so that she can make sure we get those questions answered for you.

5
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:31,450
My name is Joanna Kovacevich, and I work on the instructional services team. We're located on the third floor of SPH to.

6
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:49,450
And so our one of our main purposes, is to assist faculty, staff to size with the tools you need for teaching. This includes canvas. But this also includes pinata.

7
00:01:49,450 --> 00:02:00,450
For those of you in the room please feel free to get my attention and and ask whatever questions you have.

8
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:12,450
So our brief agenda is just talk briefly about what is Conoco, we're going to look at how to enable panopticon in your canvas sites, if it's not there yet.

9
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:27,450
And then we're going to actually talk about what the experience is and what it looks like to record in your classrooms. Now today we're using this room, a lot of orientation activities are using many of the classrooms you all might be teaching in.

10
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:41,450
But I would suggest that you try to sneak in those rooms next week, check the schedule I'll show you how you can check the schedule so that you can look at the setup in the individual room you're scheduled in.

11
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,450
And then at the end.

12
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:54,450
I'm going to back away, and let you do some hands on training, looking at what we have up here.

13
00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:08,450
So panopticon is a tool licensed protect specifically at SPH, it is not a university wide tool, which is way why if you attend any of the IPS Canvas trainings.

14
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,450
They show another video tool.

15
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,450
But as pH, we suggest using pen updo.

16
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,450
It's an incredibly flexible video recorder.

17
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:24,450
It has a desktop recorder tool, a mobile recording app.

18
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:32,450
And now it has a web recorder, where you can record straight using your browser without having to install anything.

19
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:43,450
You can upload a video that you already have maybe you recorded it with your phone when you were visiting maybe a site, and now you want to share this with your students.

20
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:56,450
It has an option to allow student uploads so if students have a presentation of a voice narrated PowerPoint for instance or maybe they have to record themselves doing something, it has that option.

21
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:09,450
The videos have an in video timestamp discussion tool where you could ask questions and talk about, Oh, you did a good job demonstrating such and such.

22
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:18,450
It has a live stream option which is sort of a one way broadcast on like zoom which is more interactive back and forth.

23
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:31,450
When you're finished with your video either recording it or uploading it pinata has a tool to attach some auto generated captions, which is a really great benefit.

24
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:49,450
And then it's also integrated with Canvas can be added right into your course. One thing I didn't list here was you can actually add sort of knowledge check questions in a pinata video that can integrate with your canvas gradebook.

25
00:04:49,450 --> 00:05:03,450
So if you, you know, many of us, particularly during the fully remote time may have created a nice set of pre recorded video lectures for students to view, almost like a flipped classroom.

26
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:08,450
And you could incorporate some interactive features like that.

27
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:14,450
But mainly we're focusing today on recording in the classroom.

28
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:23,450
If you're logged into the computer in front of you. You might check that you have Conoco enabled in your canvas sites.

29
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:38,450
You can do this by going to the settings menu, which is always the last item in each of the canvas sites you teach.

30
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:48,450
Once you're in the settings area across the top. You should see a navigation tab, click on that.

31
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:57,450
The set of tools at the top, mirrors what menu items are available for your students.

32
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:07,450
So this is projecting very poorly in the room, let me. Maybe I can put it in present to get a better look at it.

33
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,450
Not much better.

34
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:21,450
The first block of tools shows you what's available to your students and then below that is an extremely long list of tools that are not turned on for your course.

35
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:28,450
One of those is going to say pen octo recordings

36
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:49,450
to the right of the title pinata recordings are three dots three vertical dots. And that three vertical dots typically means more options, and when you click on that, you have the option to enable the tool.

37
00:06:49,450 --> 00:07:00,450
And so before you leave this page you'll want to scroll all the way down to the bottom, past all that all those tools and click Save.

38
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:11,450
And then you should see pinata recordings in your menu list to your left.

39
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:21,450
Go ahead and click on that pinata recordings that sort of clicking on it and it's going to say it's going to spin for a moment.

40
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:44,450
And that's what's going to sort of generate the folder for your Canvas site on panoptic those back end, and it's going to be ready for you to start uploading videos, or recording.

41
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:55,450
So you can enable it and other courses, but go ahead and we're going to come back to that Canvas page where we're on the pinata recordings button.

42
00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:20,450
I want to talk briefly about using Conoco in SPH classrooms, the classrooms at SPH have a Windows computer that you can log into, you can log into this computer with your university login credentials, or there is a guest user name available.

43
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:33,450
The thing about the guest username is that whoever may have used that before, may still be logged in two different systems may have their files on the desktop.

44
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,450
So just a word of warning for you.

45
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:43,450
The Windows computers have the pinata desktop recorder installed already.

46
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:52,450
They are connected for microphone picked up the options of microphones are going to be different depending on the classroom.

47
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,450
In this room.

48
00:08:54,450 --> 00:09:04,450
One of the microphone options I have is called is just a USB microphone, that's sitting here on the podium.

49
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:11,450
For the purposes of demonstration, I also brought a meeting out in

50
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:22,450
the meeting alcohol is a 360 degree camera that's picking up a full range of this room, focusing on who is speaking.

51
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:26,450
It's also has a 360 degree microphone.

52
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:37,450
If there are any classrooms that don't have any other built in items, you may see this in your the meeting in your classroom.

53
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:43,450
We're not using it right now so I will hold it up so you can see.

54
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:49,450
I'm going to use that for our clinical practice recording.

55
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,450
So in addition to a microphone there's going to be some sort of video option.

56
00:09:53,450 --> 00:10:07,450
Again, if you have a meeting owl in your classroom, that's going to be your microphone in your video and then kind of dough is also going to allow you to capture your screen.

57
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:23,450
It's going to give you options of whether you just want to capture the PowerPoint slides, or if you want to capture everything you do on the screen. So maybe I need to go to Canvas, or maybe I'm teaching something in our four different specialized software,

58
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,450
and I need to change applications.

59
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:32,450
It's similar to the zoom screen share, it's going to report, everything you do.

60
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:38,450
And this is where you want to think about how you present your course materials.

61
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,450
So for my students in the room.

62
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,450
I can show anything.

63
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:57,450
If I show you this, and pass it around, or five paper handouts for you, your set. But what am i online students going to do.

64
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:09,450
If I go right on this whiteboard, take some notes here. This may work for all of you in class but what are your students who have to watch and review this after the fact going to do.

65
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:28,450
So I kind of want to focus on give you some ideas and options, but also get you thinking about how to work in this working with two separate audiences, what's going to work for my in person class, but it's also going to be captured for my students who

66
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:34,450
need to watch this after class,

67
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:53,450
some reference materials that I provided, are there is a web page on the SBA website called available classrooms and conference rooms, and they kind of give you a list of what's available by classroom number.

68
00:11:53,450 --> 00:12:02,450
This is one other way that you can sort of familiarize and get some information in advance about the classroom, you'll be teaching in.

69
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,450
One of the things I'll touch on.

70
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,450
For those of you in the room.

71
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,450
You may notice that I'm using a lapel microphone.

72
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:18,450
I'm using this to amplify my voice in the room, even though this isn't that big of a room with my mask.

73
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:28,450
I'm kind of muffling a little bit what I'm saying, I want to make sure everyone who's in the room is hearing me as best as possible.

74
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:48,450
That available classrooms and conference rooms web page is going to identify for you whether the class, you're teaching in has in room, amplification, it's listed as voice amplification.

75
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:52,450
And then another resource for you as you're in your classroom.

76
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:58,450
Each of the podiums it's going to have some sort of reference of how to use the projector.

77
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,450
And some of the equipment that's up here.

78
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:11,450
So again, giving yourself a little bit of a time or maybe going into the room when it's open so that you can

79
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:20,450
practice a little bit see what's available. Yes, question, your room doesn't have

80
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,450
to get.

81
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:33,450
Yeah, the microphones are set based on sort of size, but I would recommend you send an email to SPH dot help.

82
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:44,450
That will reach the sky IT department, and they have classroom support under that area,

83
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:51,450
something really exciting that's coming, is that over fall break.

84
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:56,450
There's going to be some additional.

85
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:05,450
Some of our larger classrooms are going to get ceiling mounted microphones for better pick up all the way across.

86
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:20,450
So we're hoping that that works really well, and so that we can continue to maybe expand that to other classrooms, so that's something we are looking forward to getting and trying up.

87
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:27,450
Alright so I'm just going to start my demo of opening logging in.

88
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:43,450
In, to Fernando, in the calendar invitation. I sent an update, and it has a link to the classroom, recording with pen octo

89
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,450
handout.

90
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:50,450
And so this is basically these are basically the steps, I'm going to follow.

91
00:14:50,450 --> 00:15:00,450
And so if you have the ability to print this out, you might consider using it as a reference. The first couple of times you're going recording.

92
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:04,450
It'll help you sort of get into that routine of setting these things up.

93
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,450
Yes.

94
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:14,450
Yes,

95
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:24,450
that's right. So, like most of them don't seem to have a program so that if we just have the voice is that still able to use the mic and everything.

96
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:39,450
Yes, amplification voice means on microphone amplification program means big speakers to play, if I'm playing a video that will get broadcast.

97
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:47,450
And it could be that some rooms are just small enough, I don't actually know.

98
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:51,450
So I'm gonna go through these

99
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,450
instructions that I've shared with you.

100
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:14,450
And I have these instructions, starting you from your Canvas site. The main reason for this is setting you up so that you record your class meeting to the correct Canvas site, you're teaching multiple classes, or maybe someone else left themselves logged

101
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,450
into the panopticon application.

102
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:26,450
It's a little too easy to accidentally record to the wrong place. If it's still in your account, it's very easy to move.

103
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:30,450
But if we can just sort of avoid that altogether.

104
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:50,450
It'll help you. So I'm going to start in Canvas.

105
00:16:50,450 --> 00:17:09,450
No work in my chemist basics practice site pinata recordings is already a menu in my course menu, so I will need to walk through those settings to add it to my course menu.

106
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:15,450
So when you're in the pinata recordings area of your Canvas site.

107
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:20,450
Here's a look at what it looks like when there are videos ready to view.

108
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:23,450
There's a little thumbnail.

109
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:27,450
There's a title. So naming them.

110
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,450
He is helpful.

111
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,450
This title is a link so that it opens the video.

112
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:45,450
And because I'm the instructor of this course and sort of I own these videos, when I hover over each video, I get a set of menus that appears.

113
00:17:45,450 --> 00:18:01,450
I can modify some settings. I could share this with additional people, I can edit make edits to it. So maybe if I need to go trim the end off or trim the beginning off, I do have the ability to do that.

114
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,450
This next button says stats.

115
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,450
Maybe students had a lot of questions about one topic.

116
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:18,450
And maybe I'll look at the stats to see, you know, did anybody review this video that I thought covered it really well.

117
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:30,450
And then delete. If you're practicing and getting the hang of using panoptic, you can always come in and delete your videos.

118
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:38,450
In the top center of the pinata recordings area is a green button that says Create.

119
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:50,450
If you click on that, here's where you see the options you have in your site. The first option is panopticon for Windows.

120
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:57,450
And this is going to launch the desktop recording app that will use to record your classes.

121
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:15,450
Justin as a side as an aside, the putting up to capture, is that web browser recorder that I briefly mentioned that will launch sort of a new tab, and let me record audio video in my browser or upload media, so I could come here, if I have a video that

122
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:18,450
I wanted to share.

123
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:24,450
And then some other management options playlist and folders.

124
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:32,450
Before your class, or as your class starts you're going to come to create an panopticon for Windows.

125
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,450
It gives you the option to download panoptic go.

126
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:42,450
But I know it's already on this computer so I'm going to click open and Octo.

127
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:53,450
Chrome is going to say Are you sure you want this website to open up an application on your computer and the answer is yes. And let's see if I can just say always do that.

128
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,450
Open Conoco.

129
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:10,450
I'm going to get up in a moment to launch the program.

130
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:26,450
Alright so I'm getting an error message because I I'm doing double duty with media devices for zoom and for pen octo so you shouldn't see this but I will get these fixed.

131
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:30,450
The first thing I want to direct your attention to.

132
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:39,450
So unfortunately, to my knowledge connected was not installed in the computers in front of you and I apologize for that.

133
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:45,450
So we'll have to look up here and then that's why I want you to have a turn to come and look at this.

134
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,450
At the very top.

135
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:58,450
It's telling me what folder, this is going to save to and I want to make sure that says the name of the Canvas site that I'm teaching right now.

136
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:04,450
I can name this session.

137
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:12,450
defaults to the time and date that the recording is going to start.

138
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:22,450
But you can add more details to that and you can add details to that here, or even after it's posted

139
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:37,450
this block in the top on the left is going to let me pick what panoptic calls my primary sources. This means, what's my video source what's my microphone source.

140
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,450
And so I'm going to choose.

141
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:48,450
And again the options that appear in this list are going to be different, but for this class, I'm going to choose the meeting our Pro.

142
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:56,450
And I'm going to do the same, my audio needs to be my meeting lol Pro.

143
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:11,450
So, one thing I'm going to do. I don't know if you can see just to the right of my video is a little audio level meter, and it has green bars bouncing, that's a quick q that panopticon is hearing me when I talk.

144
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:19,450
So, just sort of glancing and checking that is helpful.

145
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:24,450
Yes, question selected.

146
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:39,450
But if we're in a room is there any indication you would have what we should use, like if you don't know, it is a meeting I'll pro or screenings or anything like that she showed earlier, that will probably tend to us.

147
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:45,450
that's what we should select, I don't believe so.

148
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:53,450
But one thing you can do is click on each of the devices to see that preview.

149
00:22:53,450 --> 00:23:00,450
It's, it's less likely that there's going to be multiple video sources.

150
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:05,450
I have a bunch of today because I plugged in a lot of things.

151
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:18,450
But feel free to take a moment and just click through them to see what they all show because you will get that preview for the audio.

152
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:21,450
You want to make sure.

153
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:29,450
So the meeting Allah says echo canceling speaker phone and after that it says meeting our Pro.

154
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:35,450
So you'll want to kind of read what it says after microphone USB audio.

155
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:47,450
That's a little device here on my podium, that's got real good pickup and this is also an option and a lot of rooms.

156
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:55,450
I think if your room has a meeting, I will, I would suggest going with that.

157
00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:12,450
And then there's also an option to capture computer audio if what you're teaching, maybe you have audio clips you're showing today or video clips you're showing, go and capture that so that it gets included in the recording.

158
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:20,450
Yeah, question, is there a way to preset the settings so every time you open it up, you know, chat, or switch them.

159
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,450
I don't think so.

160
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:45,450
Um, before I added a new device, it did default to the devices that were plugged in, but I added a new device and kind of changed it up a little bit.

161
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:53,450
Below the audio video options. Now we're going to pick what what are we capturing in terms of for our course content.

162
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:58,450
The first checkbox says capture PowerPoint.

163
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:12,450
This is where if I'm using PowerPoint, it's going to, it's not going to screen record my PowerPoint, it's going to actually grab all of my slides in a JPEG form format.

164
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:18,450
So if you have a video clip in your PowerPoint, it's not going to grab that.

165
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:26,450
If you have an animation, it may not grab that the way it displayed in class.

166
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:31,450
The option below capture PowerPoint says capture main screen.

167
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:37,450
That's all that's sort of like the zoom full screen recording.

168
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:50,450
And so those are your two main options.

169
00:25:50,450 --> 00:26:03,450
And then up in the very top left, we kind of breezed past it. But that's the big red record button.

170
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:15,450
Another quick note appear in the top right.

171
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:31,450
It doesn't hurt to just pick it that to make sure you're the one actually logged in on our normal own computers. That's not an issue but we're we're using a shared computer like a classroom machine that could be an issue.

172
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:46,450
But you'll know whether you're signed in, if you recognize this Canvas course name up here at the top so if you're checking that if you don't recognize that course name, chances are you're not the one logged in, and you can do the sign out option.

173
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:53,450
Yes, question.

174
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:56,450
That's correct, and they'll show up here right.

175
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:12,450
That's correct. Yep. And so, just to make sure we don't have that question, if you're doing any annotation on your PowerPoints, drawing, you'll want to make sure you use them, capture main screen option so that that gets recorded and knocked up, I mean

176
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:28,450
sorry PowerPoint will allow you to save those annotations you made before you close, but you would be sharing those sort of after the fact, what you did, they wouldn't be seeing it live, if they're watching the recording.

177
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:34,450
All right, and so we're ready to hit record.

178
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:38,450
So the first question is what is being recorded.

179
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:43,450
So we know my video, audio is being recorded.

180
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:50,450
And it's recording, what's happening on my screen right now which right now, it's recording the pinata recorder.

181
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:57,450
So what you'll want to do is go ahead and move that minimize that.

182
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,450
And go ahead and do your presentation.

183
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:05,450
It could be full screen.

184
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:09,450
You could be going to Canvas.

185
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:13,450
Let's check our document.

186
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,450
Speaking of annotation.

187
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:21,450
One of the tools that we have in our classroom.

188
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:34,450
Are these pens. The screen at each of these podium computers, is it's not a touch screen but I can write on it with the pen that's right here next to it.

189
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,450
It's currently plugged in.

190
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:42,450
But I can disconnect the power cord.

191
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:53,450
And so any program that has an annotation feature, such as Phnom Joe, such as jam board.

192
00:28:53,450 --> 00:29:06,450
I can now work on the screen, so that my students can see it on the projector those who are in class. And then my remote students are going to see this in the recording.

193
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:10,450
So like we said, I need to do some things on the board.

194
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:16,450
That's not gonna work for your remote students.

195
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:23,450
So my presentation is actually in Google Slides, which does not have an annotation feature.

196
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:31,450
But if you're using PowerPoint locally on the computer.

197
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:42,450
It will.

198
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:45,450
Additionally,

199
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:58,450
have a jam board example.

200
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:04,450
because you can set up the problem is you want to work by hand in advance.

201
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:11,450
So this is an example where I went ahead and use the text tool in jam board.

202
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:24,450
And one reason why I use jam board is because my presentation was in Google Slides. And so I was able to create a name this jam board and keep it with my Google Slides set.

203
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:41,450
So typically, when we talk about Google jam or we're talking about it in a collaborative way, you know, everyone, use this link at a sticky note, but this is another way we might utilize it to help us bridge this gap of in person and remote along the

204
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:50,450
left I have some tools to use, But using the pen. That's at the podium.

205
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:56,450
I can utilize these

206
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,450
to work on my problem.

207
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:09,450
So.

208
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:20,450
jam board so lets me oh you can't see this and those of you in the room can't see this at all but this is actually graph, a graph background, let me see if I can.

209
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,450
comes through slightly better but not much better.

210
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:30,450
So say I need to.

211
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:33,450
I need to grab some things.

212
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:40,450
So

213
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:45,450
sorry I don't do but I just want to demonstrate some options.

214
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:52,450
I'm a tech person not a math person.

215
00:31:52,450 --> 00:32:02,450
So yeah, any program I opened this is all going to be captured on screen.

216
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:12,450
So my instructions for when I am done.

217
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:16,450
I'm going to stop the recording.

218
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:23,450
And I have a note here to be aware if students approach you for a private conversation after class.

219
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:30,450
That will get recorded captured and saved if you're still recording.

220
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:42,450
So this is one way why I want you to know how to access that Edit button, and then part of the resources I share are after this I can send you the video of how to trim

221
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:48,450
your to wait a moment for the video to say it's uploaded.

222
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,450
When it finishes it's going to upload.

223
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:54,450
And then it's going to switch to processing.

224
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:58,450
Once it's processing, you're good to go.

225
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:08,450
you're ready to sign out a pinata lovely log off the computer, and if you use the lapel or handheld mic, you can turn that off and leave the room.

226
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:16,450
So let me go ahead and do that I'm going to stop the recording.

227
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:26,450
This sign says recording complete. I get another chance to rename the session in case I want to add a particular topic.

228
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:39,450
And we have the option to enter a description if I'd like, but I'm going to say done, because I gotta go there's a class coming in here right after us say.

229
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:44,450
And here's the upload progress.

230
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:58,450
And so that went really fast, and then it's going to switch to processing, a little hard to see on the screen but it's easier to see. And the computer in front of you.

231
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:03,450
And then you're ready to sign out.

232
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:08,450
Close all of your documents and log out of the computer question or off.

233
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:21,450
Please don't just say we have a longer class that's right deep little physical birth during it. Yes, keep reporting the pinata during that time because if we stop it, or whatever, it'll split into two videos right.

234
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:24,450
That's correct, but there is a pause button.

235
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:29,450
If you wanted to pause, but you do have to sort of Remember to unpause.

236
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:35,450
And in fact, maybe leaving the application open while you pause will be a good cue.

237
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:44,450
Yep So similar to how you can sort of pause a zoom recording and restart it so that it remains one video.

238
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:49,450
Any other questions,

239
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,450
like in the summer.

240
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,450
It sure.

241
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,450
Yeah.

242
00:34:55,450 --> 00:35:03,450
Let me relaunch it.

243
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:09,450
So once I hit record, I now get a pause button,

244
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:19,450
one other option is say maybe the first part of the course is I'm sharing PowerPoints I'm doing demonstration but the rest is I'm not doing anything on screen.

245
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,450
we're just discussing.

246
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,450
Or maybe vice versa.

247
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:32,450
Notice I can check or uncheck these check boxes, even while it's running.

248
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:40,450
So now, what's on my screen is not getting captured but the audio and video continues to be.

249
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:53,450
So this is one thing that came up with an instructor who was preparing and said, I don't, I don't use slides up all like this is a discussion based course, what do I need to know.

250
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:56,450
And so yeah, if something does come up.

251
00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:04,450
I can now check that main capture screen the facts again Oh yeah, there's this video that that reminds me of Let me pull it up.

252
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:11,450
And I can check that box.

253
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:18,450
All right. Any questions before we move to hands on mode.

254
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,450
Sorry, I will go ahead and demonstrate the pause button.

255
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:28,450
When I click pause that button changes to save resume.

256
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:39,450
Or I can just simply stop.

257
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:45,450
Yes.

258
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:58,450
Is there a notification, or set up a notification to go out so let students know that the recording is available for doesn't pop up, it automatically pops up.

259
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:02,450
In fact, the one that I just did is here already.

260
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:12,450
The one that we did to, we started again to demonstrate the pause button. It's here and it's processing.

261
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:18,450
So it doesn't work pretty quickly I mean granted this was a short recording.

262
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:29,450
But it does show up, relatively quickly. So what you might say is, students that are watching remotely, it will be available in the pinata recording menu in the course.

263
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:35,450
Approximately. Check 30 minutes after the class ends.

264
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:46,450
And then on our user and we'll see it's processing but the students wouldn't be here. That's right. That's correct.

265
00:37:46,450 --> 00:38:04,450
You also kind of keeping in mind, this is a little advanced but keeping in mind the possibility of accidentally capturing a private conversation with a student after class, you could set these to not post to the class, until you say so.

266
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:18,450
Until you publish it, that would allow you to like screen and sort of mentally review if there's anything that needs to be trimmed out before it's published to the class.

267
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,450
But that is an option.

268
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:25,450
In your pen Octo.

269
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:29,450
Fold folder in your Canvas site.

270
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:35,450
In the upper right corner. There are some folder level settings.

271
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:43,450
That will be applied to all of the recordings that go into this Canvas site.

272
00:38:43,450 --> 00:39:06,450
And it's shaped like a gear icon, and so I can modify settings on each individual Recording by clicking the Settings button on the video, or I can come to the upper right and click the Settings gear icon at the folder level.

273
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:13,450
And there are some menu items along the left when you're looking at it in folder level.

274
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:18,450
And I believe it's under settings.

275
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:23,450
So in the Settings menu.

276
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:28,450
If you scroll down there is an availability section.

277
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:32,450
And these default to become available immediately.

278
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:37,450
But you can change that, for your courses.

279
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:41,450
And then also how long will sessions remain available.

280
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:53,450
Would you like those to just remain viewable till the end of the semester, or is it a two year program or its default to forever.

281
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:56,450
So something to consider.

282
00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:07,450
Now granted, only the students enrolled in this Canvas site, have access to view it.

283
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:17,450
But this may be a detail that your students ask you is, how, how long are these going to be available.

284
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:28,450
I don't know that everything I say in a class discussion I want everyone to be able to go and see again and again.

285
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:38,450
Right.

286
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:45,450
Oh, I guess the teaching, watch a sample of one.

287
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:48,450
Just so you get an idea of what it looks like.

288
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:54,450
students. Yeah, that's a great question.

289
00:40:54,450 --> 00:41:01,450
Yeah, if you've seen any of our

290
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:09,450
training, so.

291
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:27,450
So first let's see what the one we just did looks like.

292
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:30,450
video, audio.

293
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,450
Okay.

294
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:45,450
So when students watch this video portion is going to be in the upper left any screen capture is going to be here in the center

295
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:53,450
as a viewer I have options. I could actually swap those if I want.

296
00:41:53,450 --> 00:42:02,450
And let me go to the one where we turned off the video core.

297
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:13,450
And now the video swaps into the main viewer.

298
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:19,450
And then it's back it shifts it, because now I turned the screen recording back on.

299
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:23,450
They have the ability to jump back 10 seconds.

300
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:29,450
10 seconds, adjust the speed at which they're listening.

301
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:36,450
Over on the left or details but here's that discussion tab I was talking about.

302
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:47,450
You would want to be intentional if you decided to use that because it's not going to notify you if somebody leaves you a question in this viewer.

303
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:51,450
Because I know the instructor of this course.

304
00:42:51,450 --> 00:43:03,450
I have shortcut icons to download this your students will not have download ability by default, but again that's something that you can do in that folder settings.

305
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:09,450
I can adjust the settings for this individual recording, I could share this out with someone else.

306
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:14,450
And I have a pencil icon to edit.

307
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:22,450
This is going to open that editor work in trim.

308
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:27,450
And this, this gray area here.

309
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:34,450
Makes it look like this videos already been edited that's when I used to the pause button.

310
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:43,450
So, technically panoptic captured that, but it knows to not use it to just edit it out.

311
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:48,450
So that's a good reminder if you forget to restart pause.

312
00:43:48,450 --> 00:44:03,450
You could actually come into the editor and say, oops, let me just drag that back in, because I did intend to record that

313
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:14,450
they call this a non destructive editor, it's not deleting anything you capture, it's just not making it available to your viewers.

314
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:29,450
If I need to trim the beginning this is a little hard to see, but when I move my mouse to the edge of the beginning, I get a real thick gray bar that I can click to grab.

315
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:33,450
And then I can drag it.

316
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:48,450
And so again, that shaded out area is going to be a portion that's not shared with viewers.

317
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:55,450
Me editor is also how we add automated captions.

318
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:59,450
So I have some additional menus on the left here.

319
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:07,450
As the editor, as the owner of this video, and one of them is captions.

320
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:13,450
And there's a drop down menu that says import captions and it gives me two options.

321
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:18,450
import automatic captions, which is what we want.

322
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:25,450
Or if this is a video that I had captions created for already I could upload them.

323
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:32,450
So I'm going to say, import automatic captions.

324
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:43,450
And I could click in here and make edits, if I see anything glaring. As I scroll through, you can choose to do that or not but you do have the ability,

325
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:55,450
any edits I make you want to come up to the very top left, and there's a green button that says, apply.

326
00:45:55,450 --> 00:46:06,450
It says changes have been applied to the video close to the editor, and I'll say, okay, and I'm ready to just close that tab.

327
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:29,450
And now I'm back in my Canvas site tab, And it's showing you that it's reprocessing this video because it's going to take my edits it's going to add those captions in.

328
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:31,450
True.

329
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:35,450
That's right, it's not automatic.

330
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:39,450
That's that's how you would attach them.

331
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:48,450
Yes, questions from the audience. Just to make sure I understand we're recording on a school computer.

332
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:55,450
Not the browser window that browser version, because only the desktop app can capture the microphone.

333
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:58,450
That is not the case.

334
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:00,450
The.

335
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:04,450
If you decide to use the web editor if you've used that before.

336
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:09,450
And like that tool, those same devices will be available.

337
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:17,450
I will say that the desktop recorder is doing a hard drive backup of your recording.

338
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:25,450
And so for as sort of a fail safe measure. I would lean towards using the desktop recorder.

339
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:33,450
But it is completely up to you.

340
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:50,450
And we have about nine minutes left, so I'm going to step away from the podium and allow anyone who might like to try and click around on what's up here do so.

341
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:56,450
I'm noticing we don't have hand sanitizer in this room.

342
00:47:56,450 --> 00:48:16,450
Apologize.

343
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:19,450
Anyone want

344
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:29,450
you.

345
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:43,450
don't want to try please feel free to log off if you're online, or, or enjoy the rest of your day questions

346
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:47,450
around the session.

347
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:57,450
If you want to see a chat function. You did not have the same time

348
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:03,450
it for the visual, is it finished recording.

349
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:10,450
Those three screens, is there a way for it to just be focused on like a PowerPoint for example.

350
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:14,450
He didn't want the picture in the lecture, or is it like everything.

351
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:17,450
You can say no video.

352
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:22,450
If you didn't want to capture video, I didn't tell you that.

353
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:34,450
But that drop down list where I chose my webcam. Yeah, there is an option to say none of you just audio and my screen.

354
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:36,450
Yeah.

355
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:48,450
If you probably saw this before but can you do it right if you accidentally make a video that you don't want if you delete it, you absolutely can. Like if you're in there, you know, kind of screwing around the first day is trying to figure things out.

356
00:49:48,450 --> 00:50:00,450
That's right. Okay. Yes, there is when you see your list of videos in your Canvas site and you hover your mouse is not visible until you hover your mouse over, there's a roll of menus.

357
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:08,450
And the last one says delete. So yes practice as much as you'd like. Because you can wipe it all out.

358
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:10,450
Yes.

359
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:34,450
So, every classroom might not always have an hour was that correct. That's correct. Okay. So, and then, and then for lapel mic. Yes, yes university or that thing we're like that like old school battery power, or that same thing.

360
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:50,450
That's a great question, our classroom support person leaves an extra battery, and you know it's a fresh battery because it has a black cap on it that you need to pull off the microphones use these nine volts.

361
00:50:50,450 --> 00:51:02,450
And so, they may be on a lower shelf, or if there's a cabinet that opens look around each of the questions also has a phone number.

362
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:08,450
So if you are you just need help, call them.

363
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:16,450
There are some things they can remote into your computer to help with, or they can send someone over.

364
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:42,490
And so you'll see a little card like this in every classroom.
