1
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,549
What's at stake if we in public health don't train people in a way that is anti-racist?

2
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:38,190
And I and I think at the very, very blunt response to that is more death.

3
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:46,720
So, public health is a field designed to prevent illness, disease and death.

4
00:00:47,690 --> 00:01:00,110
Racism as a system has been designed to deny black people and other marginalized racial groups to deny the ability to have good health.

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,490
To deny the ability for individuals and communities to thrive.

6
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:14,990
And so when we don't take seriously and we don't train practitioners and researchers and those who are embedded within our public health field,

7
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,359
we don't train them properly, then we're doing a disservice to the field.

8
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,520
We're doing a disservice to those students.

9
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:31,910
And we're not giving them the critical tools that they need to understand the racial inequities that we see in our country,

10
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:39,880
and also think about what are the actions necessary to take in order to make sure that those inequities are eliminated.

11
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:50,000
Right. One fundamental way it has done that is by the exclusion of voices who have kind of challenged the status quo,

12
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:57,979
and specifically those who have explicitly talked about racism and health for many, many decades.

13
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:05,000
Right. But those perspectives and those, the research even, the knowledge, you know,

14
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:16,400
from both scholars and from communities was seen as marginal to mainstream kind of concerns of public health.

15
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:26,300
And so for a long time, voices have been excluded from the kind of mainstream public health discourse.

16
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,600
And that exclusion has happened by the exclusion of these ideas within published research.

17
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,950
The exclusion of these ideas and this work within funded research.

18
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:44,770
The exclusion of these ideas within the curricula of of schools, of public health.

19
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,040
These are courses on racism or courses on racial health i

20
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,629
historically have been kind of seen as elective courses,

21
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:59,690
but not woven in and core and central to the full curriculum for for for public health.

22
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:13,069
Right. And so we have systematically excluded real rigorous, both research and training in the field,

23
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,000
which has been to the detriment of our field as a field as a whole.

24
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:28,790
Right. And so I think that's one way, literally the exclusion, the silencing or the muting of these ideas from really brilliant scholars,

25
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:35,719
from powerful community folks who have been on the ground doing this work in their communities.

26
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,190
They know the deadly consequences of racism.

27
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,850
They see it. We live it.

28
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:51,560
But those voices and perspectives have really been systematically excluded from training and from and from mainstream public health.

29
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,630
You know, what's at stake when we don't do this is that students are ill prepared.

30
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,880
And then those students enter our public health departments.

31
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,510
They go on to do research or other are embedded within other agencies.

32
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,330
And they don't have the critical lens, the critical frameworks.

33
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:19,489
They don't have the the the the skillset and the knowledge base to be able to

34
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:25,640
apply that in settings that would again be necessary for the public's health.

35
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:32,319
To me, public health is all about looking at population health and the systems that cause certain

36
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,840
communities shorter lives and higher rates of morbidity and mortality than other communities.

37
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:43,360
In order to understand these systems, we have to take on one hand a historical perspective.

38
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,590
In the US,

39
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:54,400
that certainly means considering how race plays into the systems that to US, systems that distribute resources and opportunity to different people.

40
00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:01,179
In short, I don't think it's possible to teach about health disparities in the US without thinking about the role that race

41
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,690
has played in structuring the systems that distribute opportunity and resources inequitably to people in the US.

42
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,429
In health behavior,

43
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:17,829
we've really focused on individuals and what we need to change about individuals in order to motivate them to change their health behavior.

44
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,700
And I think now we really understand that we need to look much more upstream.

45
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:29,200
We need to look at the social and cultural factors that might be contributing to those health behaviors, and that includes racism.

46
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:37,510
And so we need to teach theories about how racism is operating so that students are able to understand that and unpack that.

47
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:46,180
And they're not designing interventions that ultimately will fail if they don't address the true underlying causes of the health problem.

48
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,960
What does that look like when it's being done with an anti-racist perspective?

49
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:57,040
It really means truly partnering collaboratively, sharing power with communities.

50
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,630
So we need to teach community engagement principles.

51
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:07,330
We need to teach community based participatory research as an explicitly anti-racist way

52
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,000
of involving communities in addressing the public health problems that they're facing.

53
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:21,730
Something that's really important to teach students in our field of health behavior is how to work with communities to plan,

54
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:27,820
implement and evaluate public health intervention and community engagement and how to work

55
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:33,580
collaboratively with communities as equal partners is an explicitly anti-racist practice,

56
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:38,110
and we really need to be teaching those strategies and teaching things like community

57
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,370
based participatory research as part of anti-racist teaching in our field.

58
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:50,820
You have to be able to train students in a way that they have a critical, politically aware lens in everything they do.

59
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,090
I don't care if they spend their entire day cleaning data in SAS,

60
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,310
you need to understand what's behind that data because you're talking about people's lives.

61
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:05,490
You're talking about generations of inequality showing up in your model, and if you don't understand that you have no business running the model.

62
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,020
So I think that one of the, again,

63
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:19,860
ways that racism has impacted public health is that it's left certain people out of the stories and the knowledge base that we have.

64
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,379
And the implications of that are that if we are, you know,

65
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:33,570
sort of devising interventions and solutions and as a result of racism and public health, we haven't learned about groups,

66
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:43,680
then the solutions that we come up with may not be relevant or applicable to the groups with which we're trying to address.
