1
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:51,300
Hmm. More than just a week, doesn't it?

2
00:00:53,190 --> 00:01:01,650
We have everybody doing good, very healthy and good, whatever you do on Thanksgiving.

3
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,200
Some people who travel and Virginia.

4
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,600
Chicago, I hardly to get their drive.

5
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:23,220
Yeah. Okay, here's an idea. Okay, so today I want to finish up the lectures on air quality.

6
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,040
I will in the second half, download some of the programs for you.

7
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,600
As I mentioned last week. We do need to get permission to use these.

8
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,980
So you have to register on the site. We'll take your email.

9
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,520
They don't understand. You get to see your screen. Okay.

10
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:54,850
Site. So it's pretty reasonable. It's all done, all those homework and then take any questions on the assignments.

11
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,950
And if you don't have the assignments, see me.

12
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,400
I still have a couple of copies. I think they're new.

13
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,600
I hope you've met your needs, remember? I hope you're compatible.

14
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:12,060
At least work together. Let me know how it goes with the presentation.

15
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:21,510
Questions from last week, a question that has served for most of your thinking.

16
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:32,500
An optional exam. Yeah. So the way the course was set up is that if you felt that your performance was not where you wanted it to be.

17
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,970
In terms of the other indicators, we do have an option for an engineer.

18
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:46,240
We're going to take you there. And so with so the exams were replaced with the lowest assignment to those quizzes or something.

19
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:54,190
Um, you know, I think it would replace the quizzes, I'm sorry, and the assignment, the assignments after quizzes.

20
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:59,320
Okay. And I put that out there as an option.

21
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,100
I don't recommend it. It would be a cumulative exam.

22
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:09,230
I mean, if you're paying for it, we could do it. I'll think about it.

23
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:19,340
Okay. And the other question actually, you know, I learn from people thinking, what's a big thing?

24
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:28,560
Maybe I would like it as a student. But, you know, I mean, it's a good indication of what you actually learn.

25
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,930
I think we think we have a different kind of paradigm.

26
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:41,290
That information is around us all the time and you can Google it right away and try to get the right answer.

27
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,650
But in any context, that doesn't really represent the time we'd like to see.

28
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:55,330
And yeah, I don't know. I mean, it's a really interesting discussion point in pedagogy because, you know,

29
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:05,920
what we've been instructed more and more to do is to develop lessons in bite size sort of modules or, you know, that fit in to our attention span.

30
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,719
And our attention span is compressed.

31
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,290
I think we have so many competing demands and you guys are so lucky being here in front.

32
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,200
You know, we can have a discussion, we can talk for an hour or 2 hours.

33
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:30,220
You know, we have the time. But most people are not getting their education from one three minute YouTube clips.

34
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:37,660
Right. You know, and for me, 10 minutes I've watched them and sometimes, you know, but and it's completely different.

35
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,080
And this also applies to continuing in.

36
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:49,540
So like when you're out there working in the field and public health or environmental health or sustainability or whatever,

37
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,440
and you want to solve a problem, what are you going to do?

38
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,880
You're going to Google it, of course, and you're going to get a snippet of what's out there.

39
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,070
And I don't know. I mean, maybe I'm old school or judgmental or something like that,

40
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,500
but you don't necessarily have quite the theoretical understanding anymore and you can't

41
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,760
sort of dig down to brass tacks or first principles to understand what's going on.

42
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,160
So, you know, graduate school at Michigan here is an incredible luxury.

43
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,610
You're very privileged. Well, I'm very privileged to be here.

44
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:34,810
But the school escape, this change, you know, and it's really hard to know where it's going to go before I get to be distracted here.

45
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:44,320
I think, like you said, like the landscape has changed and the whole academic culture feeling a lot of that had to do with the pandemic.

46
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:51,570
And it really shifted. You know, academia and the life that surrounds it.

47
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,850
So it's interesting.

48
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,900
Yeah. So yeah, I mean, I think it accelerated the shift.

49
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,899
Yeah, I think it was happening. But like, you know,

50
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:10,780
this was like an additional ten or 20 years of a shift in practice because I think Higher Ed has already been in crisis mode for some time.

51
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:18,070
I mean, we have fewer students birthrate and children is not going out and going to college and university.

52
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,150
Lots of other issues well beyond the scope of the past, you know.

53
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:35,170
But, um. Yeah. So for you guys though, you can flip it around and say, well, how are you going to use this to your advantage when you train people?

54
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:36,730
All right.

55
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:43,990
I mean, you know, we're not going to sit down with people for 2 hours typically and walk through through a mass balance conservation equation.

56
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,740
Right. And. Yet you need them to operate at a high level.

57
00:06:52,210 --> 00:07:01,000
So, you know, you can learn on your own, obviously. But the whole point of school is to accelerate them, provide a framework, provide dialog as well.

58
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:08,150
Yes. I mean, it's hard to because like, we're lucky they get this time to try and learn this stuff.

59
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,470
But like also attention spans have been going down,

60
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:19,040
at least my attention span going down since high school where I was forced to focus for like 8 hours a day.

61
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:24,850
Right. Um, which I'm sure the pandemic also exacerbated that.

62
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:33,380
But, um, but I think it is hard. And where do you find that balance of learning and also passing this knowledge on for the future?

63
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,640
I don't know. I would.

64
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:48,009
Well, yeah, I think there's like the traditional approach to education and I think you kind of see it like in grad school especially.

65
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:54,460
It's like you make your own experience or nonstate in the way the world is shaped now and the resources that we have,

66
00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:03,390
it's on you to make it what you want and you can take a more traditional approach and just do the academics

67
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:11,970
or try to branch out and take it upon yourself and grow and resources everywhere at your fingertips.

68
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:21,850
Yeah, those are both interesting views. I'm not sure I agree 100% because you're not completely on your own, depending on a lot of things.

69
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,089
And there are I mean, you know,

70
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:31,690
when I talk to young people and they find a way to make a living doing something creative and totally new, that's fantastic.

71
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:35,050
And that happens. But I don't think that's the majority of cases.

72
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:45,010
And so, um, you know, I think most people are working in some establishment may not be a huge company but it's it's the small or medium company.

73
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,820
But yeah, I mean, the attention span issue is, is a symptom.

74
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:58,600
It's not the cause. I mean, you know, there's reasons why you have an assignment, but you have five other assignments, right?

75
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,650
And the dog is barking and whatever, you know. So there's always things to do.

76
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,910
Right. So I like that. It's like a change, though.

77
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:15,140
I feel like we've done this traditional schooling and even with working in how corporate America is changing and the,

78
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,190
you know, the the man is like fighting back on that system.

79
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,600
And like when people get back into work, when do we need to go to work?

80
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,600
Five. I need to find it. Like maybe working from home is conducive.

81
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:35,120
There's studies saying there's not, but just there's just a way to make work and school accessible for everyone and all of the duration.

82
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,700
That makes it difficult to sit in a classroom or learn or go to work every day like.

83
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,420
Yeah, now that's a really cool thing. I mean, I have interactions across the globe, all right.

84
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:51,920
Because of Zoom or whatever. With all different ages, races, that is everything.

85
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:57,020
Almost everything. I wouldn't say I'm involved in certain things, but, um.

86
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:04,220
And so that's really neat. Yeah. Of course, this little digression.

87
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,910
Yeah, I think the potential for them is very little about what we were talking about.

88
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,330
Well, I don't know exactly what we were talking about. I was asking you,

89
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:23,210
how can you turn sort of this pedagogy to your advantage in your upcoming careers because you're going to have workers you need to work in teams.

90
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,500
I mean, that's the neat thing about the exercise here. Hopefully you figure out a good teaching arrangement.

91
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:34,070
Um, and then, you know, previously you're talking about attention span things.

92
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,070
What was your question or comment? The. No.

93
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,160
Oh. Okay. Okay. No. Interesting.

94
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:51,649
So, yeah, I mean, I have participated in a number of different styles of teaching.

95
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:58,300
And the weirdest one these days is like doing continuing it completely online.

96
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:03,950
And then you just have prerecorded less lectures as well.

97
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:10,010
And then students are supposed to watch those and then have a sort of flip classroom where they get back to you and have a discussion.

98
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,600
Okay. And I'm sure you guys have done some of that. How has that worked out for you?

99
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,650
I like it a lot, actually. Really depends on the class.

100
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:23,580
Yeah. So I'm not here personally.

101
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:32,100
I just don't find classrooms useful. I take up a lot of time on my own studying to be in the classroom, too.

102
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,230
So that's. Yeah. Okay.

103
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,690
Yeah, I think it's highly, highly variable doesn't always work.

104
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:46,920
And the worst thing is like, you know, you get nobody showing up or whatever, so you have no idea what they've actually learned.

105
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:59,200
If anyone's interested in this kind of stuff, in educational pedagogy type techniques and wants like a summer job or, you know,

106
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:11,170
even a term position, let me know because we're trying to do some stuff with VAX virtual reality as well as some other things.

107
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,510
I have no idea how it's going to go, so I'm learning about it. Yeah.

108
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,950
What in particular about virtual reality? I have no idea.

109
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:26,240
We're going to have our first meeting on Friday about it. So, like, is that like relating to gas or.

110
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,830
No, not GISS. It would relate to environmental occupational topics.

111
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:39,410
And then, I mean, it could be something like a simulation of doing an inspection or an analysis or something like that.

112
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:50,300
I have no idea really. We're looking for good ideas, actually. Oh, well, some things are hard to do, you know, in the occupational world, you know,

113
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,800
confined spaces or, you know, like going into tanks, you don't want to go into a tank.

114
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:04,219
You know, you could die from hydrogen sulfide or something, but maybe doing the goggles thing and being in a room or something is neat.

115
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:12,010
I don't know. Yeah, I think for a situation for inspections, I think the difference estimation is very standard.

116
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,890
It gives you like the probability of death you should you could inspect.

117
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:24,290
Yeah. But then when you do an actual inspections, it usually means that you, you interact with very random things happening.

118
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:32,720
For example, like, uh, you have, you find a bicycle in the camp and the chemistry lab right on top of you.

119
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:38,720
Yeah. Or you found a gas canister that's leaking carbon dioxide.

120
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,290
Yeah.

121
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:52,040
Um, or the fact that I feel like, uh, the fuel, but is actually missing, like, two glass panels and you can have, like, little cloud strings attached.

122
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,829
Yeah, no, it's absolutely right.

123
00:13:54,830 --> 00:14:01,010
And the way to make these things, not just tabletop exercises, but actually something meaningful is to build in surprises.

124
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,460
The problem is a few people are resorts to do this.

125
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:14,180
So for example, we used to conduct, uh, what's it called, hazard assessment and emergency response planning exercises.

126
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:20,300
And this might involve well, actually, you know, it was a big football weekend, right?

127
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:26,210
And one of the biggest exercises for Ann Arbor would be an evacuation of the stadium.

128
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:32,600
Okay. Due to terrorist things. I mean, okay, that's so unrealistic in some ways.

129
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:42,230
But the small the other types of simulations that would go on would, in fact, have actors that were hired to interfere with things.

130
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:48,800
Okay. And, you know, and to actually cause issues to ensure that people have ways to solve that.

131
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:58,700
Yeah, I think that solutions would be a very good recommendation for a drill bit because they would be

132
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:05,680
able to fire drills or inspections or school physical hazard inspections or even just school.

133
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,300
Sanitary inspections, I think would be very interesting.

134
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:19,770
It could be very similar. Yeah, those are good ideas to come up with me and talk to me about it.

135
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,300
Okay. Because I mean, we want to do something with this and we're not quite sure what to do.

136
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,320
And to make it useful and real has to be.

137
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:33,570
I mean, it's a bit of work, but it could be quite interesting. All right.

138
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,770
Should I get to the topic at hand? Otherwise, we'll never move on.

139
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:46,020
All right. So we had talked about wind roses and we're going to construct some later today using one of the programs,

140
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,700
this one from the Midwestern Regional Climate Center at Purdue now.

141
00:15:52,140 --> 00:16:00,810
So I want to talk more about air pollution meteorology and get you set up to be able to do air pollution modeling at the end of the class today.

142
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:06,310
Okay. And, you know, we all think about winds and today is not particularly windy.

143
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:11,340
Why is that? Well, that's one question. And when it is windy, where is it windy?

144
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:18,360
Well, that's another question. And so we need to think about sort of scales of motion for meteorological phenomenon.

145
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,770
And it's convenient to break them down into macro meso and micro scale.

146
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:28,200
We live in the micro scale, but winter influenced at a higher scale.

147
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:35,310
Macroscale We're typically dealing with sort of thousand kilometers scale, dealing with regional highs and lows.

148
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:43,170
These things exist for days. Typically at the measured scale we have a number of interactions between topography,

149
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,420
the sea cities, cores and things like sea breeze or heat island effects.

150
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,890
We'll talk about those.

151
00:16:50,280 --> 00:17:02,550
And then at the level of meters or so we have and this can be kilometers down to a kilometer here or even a few meters to hundreds of meters.

152
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:08,910
We have things that change minute to minute. And this includes things like building down the snow to meandering.

153
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,210
So I want to take you through some of the examples at these different scales.

154
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,559
At the large scale, I think we talked a little bit about this.

155
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:29,280
Highs and lows, highs are represented by ISO bars or lines of equal pressure, 101,115 normal bars, for example, would be above the normal.

156
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,100
And so air is descending on the surface, compressing and causing a downward flow.

157
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,610
And as the flow is downward, it's going to occur to the right as well.

158
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:51,660
Sorry, in the clockwise direction. Conversely, we can have a low pressure system because air is ascending, sucking air into that.

159
00:17:52,110 --> 00:18:02,730
And again, that upward flow will move up and then again twist to the right and cause a counterclockwise flow.

160
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:12,930
This also has implications for precipitation because as air ascends, it expands, it cools may get below the vapor pressure, the condensation point.

161
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,240
And then we have rainfall, precipitation.

162
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:30,360
This is also depicted here with this picture of cyclonic and anti cyclonic flows with the high pressure on the left here descending,

163
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,770
causing this intense cyclonic flow, the clockwise flow.

164
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:42,300
And this causes some of the upper airstreams to kind of converge in this and potentially bring things down from higher level,

165
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:47,969
typically not from the stratosphere, but occasionally we have a stratospheric intrusion this way.

166
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:56,820
But this is quite rare. If you did get a stratospheric intrusion, the stratosphere has a lot of ozone that can in fact produce ozone.

167
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,890
Okay, but that's very rare at the mesoscale.

168
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,470
It's quite interesting and quite complex.

169
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:11,610
Typically, this is associated with terrain and so-called orographic features like ridges, valleys, mountains and so forth.

170
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,270
One well-known phenomenon is the heat island effect,

171
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:24,150
because a city has lots of concrete and other surfaces that absorb sunlight energy, they stay warm at night.

172
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:30,030
Typical temperatures in cities are lower than the surrounding countryside, particularly at nightfall.

173
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:35,070
This is one of the big issues with climate change is that it just doesn't cool down, especially at night.

174
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:40,200
And of course a warm area will have areas of sand.

175
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:52,500
And if the prevailing winds are light, you can get convective so on both sides of the city, causing air to recirculate over the city.

176
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,210
And this is bad because it causes a lot of recirculation of polluted air.

177
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:06,410
I'm sorry. Why does it recirculate? If there is very light winds, there is going to ascend.

178
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,400
There's always a ceiling somewhere. You're not going to go on.

179
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,940
It's going to go right. And so it's going to reach that barrier, go parallel,

180
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:22,969
and then at some point descend and you may be sucked back up by the rising air in the convective.

181
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:30,920
So okay, as winds pick up, this kind of system is destroyed and you may have a prevailing wind,

182
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:41,660
but you still may have a convective cell like the downward or downwind or on side of the city here with a recirculation system.

183
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:46,460
Interestingly here, the prevailing direction is to the right.

184
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:55,020
But if I measure the wind right here, you would be too left. But this kind of phenomena will only happen with light winds.

185
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,640
Okay, but you will see it.

186
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:07,720
Again, this is most likely to happen at night when the differences in the temperatures between the city core and the surrounding area are the highest.

187
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:13,510
Okay. An example of a mesoscale. Lots of very interesting mesoscale effects.

188
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,720
You've all been to the beach. Okay.

189
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:26,890
You go there and cool off during the daytime because you get this nice breeze from the sea or the lake coming in to your sunbathing area or whatever.

190
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:36,550
Why do we consistently have that breeze? Well, a major contributing factor is that the land is heated during the daytime.

191
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:44,050
The sea or the ocean lake doesn't really change much in temperature because of higher capacity of heat.

192
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:51,220
So the air will rise over land, causing the wind to come in from a cooler to a warmer and into a sun.

193
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,410
So that's the sea breeze. At nighttime that's reversed.

194
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:04,600
Often the wind may cool off faster than the ocean or lake, which hardly changes in temperature at all.

195
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:11,710
And if, in fact, the temperature drops here so that the land temperature is cooler than the lake, you'll have the reverse flows.

196
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:17,980
So you'll have the winds coming out from your back that are still watching the water sunset or whatever.

197
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,410
Okay. That's the land or shorebirds. Okay.

198
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:32,360
Important in coastal areas. But there's many other very interesting mesoscale flows.

199
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:36,780
We don't see them so much in southern Michigan because it's so flat.

200
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:48,180
But we do have valley winds and mountain winds. And if you guys go hiking, for example, you're climbing over a slope on the south side.

201
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,480
The sun is coming down. This has been heated.

202
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:54,870
Air will ascend this way at nighttime.

203
00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:06,120
If the land cools somewhat rapidly, then cooler air will slide down and you have a mountain again.

204
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,700
And you guys know if you're in a valley or something like that and you're hiking down in the middle of the valley,

205
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,720
it'll be either really hot or really cool. Okay.

206
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:21,780
Because of these winds, this is very much affected by the orientation and the slope in the sun where it happens to be.

207
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:32,520
And some interesting observations are depicted in this classic textbook scene of different types of mesoscale flow patterns.

208
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,240
So, for example, if you have a valley, the sun is hitting this side, the wind is blowing down the valley.

209
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:46,890
You may actually see a corkscrew as the air moves down the valley heated on the heated side of the slope.

210
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:53,040
If the sun is more or less directly overhead of the valley, you may have a double helix structure.

211
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:58,080
Okay, somewhat, you know, speculative, somewhat idealized here.

212
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:04,500
But in fact, these things help promote mixing and can be seen in certain cases.

213
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:13,379
One of the situations that I've been involved in is the valley, which may be below the mixing layer.

214
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,380
This is maybe the base of the top layer within the family.

215
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:24,990
You have a lot of recirculation, okay? If you did have a polluting source, for example, a power plant or something, if you're releasing emissions,

216
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:30,420
this is bad news because it's going to recirculate within that convective soil.

217
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:36,270
Solution to reduce the pollution in this case would be what?

218
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:54,760
Reduce emissions. Okay, but what else could you do? Anybody from Pennsylvania.

219
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,460
Whereabouts? Pittsburgh. Okay. Yeah, outside of Pittsburgh and Chestnut Creek.

220
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,890
Do you know that there's a lot of small towns, pretty hilly area like us.

221
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:13,210
We were studying the school located in the Basin Valley and there was a great big my mouth power plant.

222
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:18,770
So you had the mine right there and burning coal, the stack was 300 feet high.

223
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,190
The valley was about a thousand feet high.

224
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:28,960
We saw some phenomenally high levels of that to particulate matter and so forth associated with this power plant.

225
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,610
So at that point, I was working with folks at Harvard and MIT.

226
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:43,900
We decide to do a health study there. By the time we got our act together, the power plant had decided to put on a 1200 foot stack of them.

227
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:49,560
So in fact, they released the pollutants at above the ridge top right.

228
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:54,790
And we didn't make much of a health study at that point because the exposure was largely gone.

229
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,830
Okay. So that's a physical stack change. Remember, you talked about effective clean air.

230
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:16,540
What influence is that? Source characteristics include temperature because that affects buoyancy of the plume number and then

231
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:23,170
the exhaust velocity of how fast it's going up because that affects the velocity and the inertia.

232
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,770
I did talk about this, right? I know it was a long weekend.

233
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:38,920
So, you know. So another strategy that facilities uses to boost the temperature or the velocity of their plume and punched through that ceiling.

234
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,740
Okay. That's frowned upon these days because that requires additional energy.

235
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,660
And so everybody is completely energy crazy. Energy conscious.

236
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:53,020
You know, so in a good way. So they won't do that anymore.

237
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:58,360
Okay. But that used to be another option. Okay.

238
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,580
So mesoscale flow path questions.

239
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:09,910
There are other patterns which are interesting, too, that often affect the representativeness of some of the meteorological measurements.

240
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,220
This is an example of train steering.

241
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:24,520
It's a, again, a plume going to a mountain somewhere because the atmosphere is layer strata or tumbleweed plumes don't want to go over.

242
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:33,010
Instead, they want to go around. So here you have a picture of the plume diverted a little bit to the south to move around that obstacle.

243
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:38,620
This is what we call terrain steering, the effect of terrain steering the winds.

244
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:50,800
Okay. Again, not so important in flatter areas, but when you get into what we call complex terrain where obstacles features are higher than the plume,

245
00:27:51,340 --> 00:28:02,700
this becomes really an important driver for. When you look out in the world after this, how do you look at a site like, hey, no,

246
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:08,940
you actually can't build here because the winds are going to the wind patterns aren't going to work?

247
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,640
Yeah, that's a great question.

248
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:21,810
Typically for a facility, you want to get local meteorological data and your meteorologists at the regulatory agencies or your consultant will say,

249
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,220
yeah, we can use the nearest weather station or No, we need to establish one.

250
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,440
Also, there's a thing called Worth the World.

251
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:38,820
I forget the acronym, which is a meteorological simulator that provides estimates of meteorology pretty much anywhere on the globe,

252
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:44,400
and it incorporates models that account for these kinds of mesoscale features.

253
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:53,220
But typically what'll happen is you'll establish a weather station and use that in your assessment.

254
00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:03,450
I mean, weather stations are cheap, right? So the only downside is to get a representative amount of meteorological data.

255
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:15,240
And what do I mean by representative? That it's not unduly influenced by outliers.

256
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:24,720
Okay. So I mean, if you had like a drought or if you had a huge storm or something like that, that's probably not typical.

257
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:30,000
So the prevailing wisdom is that you want five years of meteorological data.

258
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:35,250
Okay. And no proponent of a new site is going to wait for five years.

259
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:43,770
Okay. So what they might do is establish a weather station, see how it correlates to existing weather data.

260
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:46,650
That's a long term record. And then interpolate.

261
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:59,090
But good questions and that influences both where you should put sources as well as as well as where you should put monitors,

262
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:05,510
because they can be really very much influenced by these mesoscale flows.

263
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:11,200
Actually, the most interesting flows for me are what happens right around us.

264
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:19,520
This is what we call microscale. And in general, this is a very short time, short distance process.

265
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,720
Rather than being influenced by big scale features.

266
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:28,730
It's smaller features, including mechanical turbulence and thermal turbulence.

267
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,569
And I think the best way is to give you some examples.

268
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,180
So I'll come back to this slide for these definitions.

269
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:43,370
But if you imagine upstream of some obstacle, we have winds and we typically have a power law of dependance.

270
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:48,140
Remember I gave you the power law extrapolation for wind speeds.

271
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:54,110
Good. I'm getting some shaking here, so that's good. So there's something coming through the storm, okay.

272
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:58,520
And it increases with height. It hits an obstacle like a building.

273
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:03,020
The winds need to curve up and then go beyond it.

274
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,210
If we do have a separation surface shown as this green line,

275
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:12,830
we may have winds being essentially forced to the ground and then coming back in a

276
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:18,290
cavity in this recirculation pattern that I showed within that isolation surface.

277
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,400
Okay. This is also called a down wash or a weak effect.

278
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:28,190
Okay. And if you guys are floaters or whatever, you know what? We saw a very turbulent area behind the ball.

279
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,320
Well, from the air pollution standpoint, a number of things happened.

280
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:39,709
But let me just finish describing. So right behind the building, we actually have winds going.

281
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:44,600
The opposite direction would be followed with the heat island effect and then at some distance down,

282
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:52,370
stream down, when the parabolic profiles return, it will eventually resemble what was obstacle course.

283
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,270
All right, so I've got a building like this, and maybe, I don't know, it's a pottery factory or whatever.

284
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,780
Okay, clean factory. I have a short stack.

285
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:07,040
I release pollutants right here. What happens in terms of dispersion?

286
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:12,470
Those pollutants brought right down to ground level bad news.

287
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:26,390
So again, the solution is to provide more dilution unless year or have a taller stack.

288
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,990
Okay, get it up here and we'll just move downstream.

289
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:36,620
All right. Well, of course, you know, the era of tall stacks is done.

290
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:45,440
The world's tallest type was in Sudbury, I believe, Ontario, a copper smelter.

291
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:49,110
I think it was 1400 feet tall.

292
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,150
The Russians had some very tall stacks, too. They may have had the world's tallest.

293
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,000
It was a toss up between these.

294
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:08,360
The Sudbury smelter was processing copper ore and copper or has lots of sulfur, and it produced all these vegetative burns.

295
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:15,050
And so they decided to raise the stack to eliminate local ecological impacts.

296
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:24,530
Much cheaper for them, I guess at the time, and this was in the sixties and seventies and eighties then to put scrubbers and things like that on.

297
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:40,249
These Microscale flows also cause like here this is building down wash and even the screen view program that

298
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:48,090
will demo today has options to do that wash like this on the down wash can also happen at a higher scale.

299
00:33:48,610 --> 00:34:01,610
Here's a cliff. Winds coming down on the cliff will produce this downward motion of convective cells here, causing this plume to touch the ground.

300
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,220
And this is not so often seen in Michigan, but building down losses there.

301
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,749
Here's an example of a plume building from is high enough.

302
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:17,240
It's not really much affected. Lower plume building brings those plumes to the ground.

303
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:29,350
The UVM power plant just a couple of blocks from here, uh, undergoes dispersion.

304
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,870
There is a number of buildings that are quite nearby.

305
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:40,240
There have been these plume downwind studies around it to ensure that we don't fumigate or dose everybody.

306
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:52,800
The re the way to avoid down wash problems is to typically have a stack that's two and a half times the building height.

307
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:57,060
Okay. But EPA doesn't like that.

308
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,740
And so they typically limit it to one and a half times the building height.

309
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,180
Okay. Obviously, they want you to eliminate the pollution rather than just disperse.

310
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,020
But this is important because they want you to eliminate that pollution.

311
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:22,830
I mean, you know, two and a half times just means you're pushing the problem further afield, even though the concentration can be considerably lower.

312
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:36,640
I'm going to come back to this. But one of the interesting things as depicted here, we might have a plume coming from the sky.

313
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:44,830
This one is showing no plume rise. Okay. It's maybe just released at ambient temperature without much velocity, sort of curveball.

314
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:51,850
But the point I want to make is that the plume doesn't actually touch the ground until several multiples of the stack plate.

315
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:57,670
Okay. So a lot of people will think that the highest concentration is produced right at the start.

316
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,420
But in fact, that's only the case if there is a down wash from.

317
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:11,090
And there can be a down watch around stacks even. Most of us live in cities.

318
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:17,750
Some of the micro-scale flows that are interesting and problematic in cities have to do with street canyons.

319
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,690
Essentially, it looks like a valley tall building.

320
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:31,550
We have a witness, maybe in this case passing over, causing a convective cell here or a vortex again, just building up levels in that valley system.

321
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:42,979
It's interesting, in recent years there have been a lot of interest in having bike lanes and cycle paths

322
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:48,620
and pedestrian barriers on both sides for pushing the traffic more in the middle.

323
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:52,790
And people have analyzed the effect of this kind of system.

324
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,770
When you do have those smaller barriers and in fact, they can improve things quite a bit.

325
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:09,340
I've already talked about the Valley Effect, but this one is an inversion, perhaps.

326
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:14,469
But still we have what we call kind of Barrick winds, which are really cool.

327
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:17,950
They're just great anyway inside that system.

328
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:25,830
But it's pretty much the same as I showed before. I have talked about inversions here.

329
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,020
I'm defining them for you in a little more detail.

330
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:34,560
This is a very important air pollution problem because when we started off this unit, we talked about air pollution episodes.

331
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:39,570
And the common feature in air pollution episodes was a persistent inversion.

332
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:48,010
Okay, so I have to talk about a little bit more. Basically, it's a situation where we have temperature increasing with height.

333
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:53,850
This produces what we call a very stable atmosphere where vertical motion is suppressed,

334
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,410
air doesn't want to rise or fall, wants just to stay where it is or move horizontal.

335
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:09,060
This can form a lid or a ceiling on the extent of mixing and can increase the pollutant levels due to local sources.

336
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:15,120
There are four types of air pollution inversions that I want to go over.

337
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:20,820
We talked about sea breeze where we have cool air from the ocean coming over land.

338
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:27,240
This will produce a decrease in temperature with high with warmer air of Boulder.

339
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,700
So this is an example of an inversion.

340
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:36,479
This is a very ephemeral version of the sea breeze, only lost during the daytime with certain directions of wind.

341
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,500
So it's gone at night. Doesn't cause air pollution episodes.

342
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:48,090
Similarly, what we call a frontal inversion where we have, for example,

343
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:53,640
a cooler air system moving underneath the warm air system again produces an inversion.

344
00:38:54,180 --> 00:39:09,820
But this is also a family. It doesn't last very long. On, I don't know, ten, 20, 30% of nights we have what we call a nocturnal inversion,

345
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:21,940
where we exercise energy from the earth's surface is radiate out to space, cooling gradually the surface of the earth in the air.

346
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:25,450
And so we'll have cooler air with warmer air above it.

347
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:32,590
This reaches a maximum early in the morning if we have low winds and clear skies.

348
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:41,200
Okay. And in fact, this produces some of the biggest air pollution peaks from traffic in the morning rush hour.

349
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:46,180
If this occurs, you know, to seven, eight or 9:00.

350
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:55,899
Okay. That's what we call nocturnal inversion. If you're in a place like Tucson, Arizona, it's clear skies all the time.

351
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,230
Just about this will be a really common phenomenon.

352
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:03,070
But here, even in the Midwest, it occurs roughly 20% of the time.

353
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:11,650
But the biggie of inversions is what we call subsidence inversion.

354
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:20,110
Okay. This is a high pressure system sinking as it sinks here, compresses as the air compresses, the temperature moves.

355
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:26,680
So this line will start to curve up a little bit, and that produces an inversion at some point.

356
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:34,540
And this high system that is stable can exist for several days.

357
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:40,840
In this inversion height, typically about a thousand or a couple thousand feet.

358
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,910
And again, it produces a lead on the air pollution dispersion.

359
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:54,910
Interestingly, if you're on the West Coast and you have mountains, then you'll have a subsidence inversion.

360
00:40:55,540 --> 00:41:01,840
We'll have the mountains a little bit to the east. And so you have a wall even on the horizontal movement.

361
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:07,480
And so this produces some of the highest air pollution problems. So in the L.A. area.

362
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,150
Okay. Or.

363
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,960
Same thing in Denver and some other places too.

364
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:26,790
This is the kind of inversion that's associated with both the wintertime or the classic air pollution episode that the north of Pennsylvania,

365
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:36,930
the London, England, great smog events, as well as the summertime accident episodes that are more recent, the East Coast and so forth.

366
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:48,990
Okay. Are we good on inversions? All right.

367
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:54,390
So all of these things influence, plume behavior. And that's what I want to talk about next.

368
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:59,400
These pictures depicting them depict a number of different types of behaviors.

369
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:10,530
All of the plume behavior is dictated by thermal motion or thermally induced motion.

370
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,500
Hot air rises, cold air strength. Okay.

371
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:20,570
So if you're looking at a plume undergoing some looping like this, you know, maybe there's a cloud right here, maybe that's clear right here.

372
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,180
And so cool rises and temperature ascends.

373
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:30,690
And so this is causing these eddies which produce this erratic, random like behavior.

374
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:35,610
In a lot of ways. This is very good because this leads to rapid dilution.

375
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:46,720
Okay. Which decreases concentrations. But to understand this, in this far in this picture, the building just a single parcel there,

376
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:56,019
which is acted on by several different forces with buoyancy primarily and then settling where the

377
00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:02,650
gravitational density differences that might exist between the parcel and the surrounding area.

378
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:09,520
And so we need to understand those two model and to explain dilution.

379
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:21,829
At night time. We don't have that looping behavior because there's no energy from the sun directly hitting the planet.

380
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:24,980
Instead, we have a more traditional type of cooling behavior,

381
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:34,670
which is more representing the very small, much smaller eddies and less rapid rate of dispersion.

382
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:43,920
So one question is if you have a system like this, a lot of randomness,

383
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:50,430
a lot of big eddies in your observer or neighbor or community at this location,

384
00:43:52,740 --> 00:44:01,320
are you being exposed to high concentration compared to, say, at nighttime?

385
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:07,200
Again, you're living at this location. When do you get most of your exposure?

386
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:16,840
Time, right? One. It would seem like a boundary layer.

387
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:23,400
So. Well, unfortunately, it's a good thought.

388
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:28,050
But in air pollution, most of the time, the answer is it depends.

389
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:39,660
And so at nighttime, if the plume is being dispersed above this boundary later, then your concentrations down here are going to be very low.

390
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:48,960
However, if you have a short stay, then they'll be quite concentrated because they're not dispersing horizontally very much.

391
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:58,470
And in the prior picture here, if you're getting one of these larger eddies and maybe it does bring it down to the ground,

392
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:05,550
it can be very high in concentration. But at the same time, there's a lot of vertical mixing in this picture.

393
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:12,750
So even if it does touch down once in a second or once in a minute or whatever the time frame is, most of the time it's not there.

394
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:20,390
So the concentration is quite low overall on average. So there's no simple answer.

395
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:26,880
You need to use something that accounts for these and other factors that influence the concentration.

396
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:33,780
That's why we need these models. So that boundary layer like you showed in the next slide.

397
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:45,089
How does that sound? Yeah. So that is an inversion where that could be the base of the clouds or you might not see it.

398
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:48,300
It might just be invisible. There might not be clouds at that point.

399
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:57,610
So plumes really behave in a continuum of patterns.

400
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:09,760
And these next couple of pictures show this cloning behavior was very small, little eddies moving into larger looping behavior.

401
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:20,530
And these days are increasing in size. And so typically at nighttime, we have the top picture of very small eddies.

402
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:30,370
And during the daytime, especially with a lot of insulation or sunshine, we have much larger eddies.

403
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:46,750
You can use the pine and these. Yeah, an eddy is a coming back to here are the wind forces that can get a parcel to move a parcel around.

404
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:51,400
Okay. Separate from the overall flow.

405
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,480
Okay. Now to put all this together, because we have a lot of stuff going on.

406
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:06,000
I need to bring us back to the lapse rate. Remember, the lapse rate was a decrease in temperature with height.

407
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:14,910
Okay. Most of the time, on average, we have what we call a neutral lapse rate.

408
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:19,740
And that's shown with both those lines on the neutral slide here.

409
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:34,300
When we have a lot of sunshine, we may push the.

410
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:48,130
You know what? I'm up here. It's better for me to do it here. We may end up with what we call a super adiabatic lapse rate.

411
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:56,650
So, in other words, the surface temperature is warmer, cools off more rapidly with temperature.

412
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,000
Okay. So, again, we're heating the sun. The sun is hitting the ground.

413
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,370
The air is heating as a result. And the lapse rate is what we call super easy about it.

414
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:15,219
In other words, it cools off faster. There can be times when we have ISO thermal conditions.

415
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:19,330
In other words, the air temperature stays the same as you ascend.

416
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:26,710
And if we have an inversion, we've already defined that as a case where the temperatures increase with height.

417
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,870
Okay. So we have a continuum here from inversion types of thermal.

418
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:37,930
I skip the sub idiomatic. It's near iso thermal to neutral to super idiomatic.

419
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:48,040
Okay. This influences behavior as depicted on these next set of slides.

420
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:56,770
So when we have, for example, that super idiomatic condition, we're going to get the looping as shown here.

421
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:09,670
When we have neutral, we typically get cooling. When we get an inversion, we don't have much vertical mixing at all.

422
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:13,149
So we have feeling in the framing plume.

423
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:18,850
It's hard to depict from the slide, but it comes out and it may spread horizontally, but it doesn't want to go up or down.

424
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:30,670
And then we have some intermediate cases where, depending on where the break is in the temperatures, we can have lofting or we have fumigation.

425
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:40,300
The key is that the super adiabatic part of the plume wants to produce rapid.

426
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:53,070
Smooth motion. Well, anything that looks isothermal or inversion like reduces the amount of dispersion shown in fanning.

427
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,110
Okay to understand this in a little more detail,

428
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:07,260
we defined a lapse rate as gamma as the change in temperature with height, because we like to have positive numbers.

429
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:11,670
And normally temperature decreases with height. We stick a negative in front of it.

430
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:24,090
Okay. This relates to stability, which is the tendency, the atmosphere, to resist vertical motion and suppress turbulence.

431
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:27,810
And one way to think about this is we have a parcel of air.

432
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:32,340
We have the density of the air pulling it down.

433
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:36,630
If this is denser surrounding air or buoyant,

434
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:47,970
the effect and essentially we have a force balance such that if this partial there is a different density surrounding air,

435
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:50,180
it will either be the same or descending.

436
00:50:53,700 --> 00:51:03,960
So I'm going to walk you through this a couple of times to understand how this lapse rate of flight affects stability.

437
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:10,470
We're going to make the assumption that's very idealized that this is a adiabatic process.

438
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:17,070
In other words, defining this portion of air and I'm putting around it an envelope, which is a perfect insulator.

439
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:23,670
Okay. And I allow it to expand or contract and without any energy.

440
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:35,210
Okay. So.

441
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:51,690
If I do that and I disregard moisture in the air and I take that person over and lift it up, it's going to expand and cool off that rate,

442
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:59,970
which is cool at which it cools is called the dry idiomatic lapse rate because I'm assuming there's no moisture in the air whatsoever.

443
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:09,930
Okay. And across the globe or theoretically, we get about one degree per hundred meters or 5.4 degrees per thousand feet.

444
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:16,370
Okay. Now air is wet.

445
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:25,340
Typically it's got moisture in it. And we have to worry about that because as the air lifts up, the temperature drops, water vapor may condense.

446
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:33,750
That releases the heat of envelope, which boosts the temperature up a little bit, leading to a smaller change in temperature.

447
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,570
Okay. And that's going to depend on the amount of water.

448
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:46,340
But if we assume the water, the air is saturated, then we can solve it either by measurements or theoretically.

449
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:57,590
And we get the saturated lamp's rate, which is 0.6 C 400 meters or 3.4 Fahrenheit degrees per thousand feet.

450
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:02,000
So it's about 60% of the dry.

451
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:09,260
Okay. These are two extreme cases, completely wet or completely dry.

452
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:17,300
Okay. And if we take sort of the average across the globe, we call this the standard lapse rate.

453
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:25,340
And this is based on lots of measurements, typically at the middle, at altitudes, latitudes, rather.

454
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:33,320
And we get about 0.6, six degrees per 100 meters or three and a half or so degrees Fahrenheit.

455
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:39,230
Okay. So you go out west and you feel like climbing the Tetons or something like that.

456
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:49,210
And let's say you go up 10,000 feet. How much cooler should it be at the peak of the mountains?

457
00:53:51,570 --> 00:54:05,790
At the 10,000 foot point. Well, if it's following the standard lapse rate, it should be 10,000 feet times this rate or 36 degrees cooler.

458
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:11,590
Okay. And on average, that's about right. Okay.

459
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:24,270
All right, everybody with me elaborates, because this is just still necessary to understand the next thing.

460
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:31,020
How did you get the 36 233.574 thousand?

461
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:34,050
I'm going to go up 10,000. So multiply that by ten.

462
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:41,310
Oh, okay. Good.

463
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:45,300
All right. All right. I'm going to try to do this.

464
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:51,240
So now you understand. A parcel of air will expand and cool.

465
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:56,490
Typically, the atmosphere is cooling at the standard lapse rate.

466
00:54:57,330 --> 00:55:02,220
Okay, let me use the metric units. Point six, six degrees, four, 100 meters.

467
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:10,829
Okay. If I have a parcel of air from a tube and again, let's make the simplification.

468
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:17,310
It's an 80 abiotic processes in a perfectly insulated, perfectly expandable container.

469
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:21,300
Okay. It's going to ascend. It's going to expand.

470
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:33,690
And it's going to cool. So if I'm here at, I don't know, ten degrees at the temperature of the surface and I lift my personal.

471
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:39,970
Well, this is unfortunately a millibars. It's not elevation.

472
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:44,740
I lift it up, it cools, it expands.

473
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:56,530
And if my atmosphere is cooling at the same rate, that means this partial inside this 80 bed container.

474
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:02,710
Is that the exact same temperature as the air around it? That means its density is the same.

475
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:11,680
That means there's no tendency for it to drop or rise because it has no effect of different density difference.

476
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:19,480
So the densities in the two circles are the same. No, these circles are just representing the partial here and the passing up here.

477
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:25,930
Okay. The density is completely dependent on the temperature in this example.

478
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:36,310
So what that means is if I take a partial polluted air, somehow kick it up in the atmosphere a couple of hundred meters, it cools, it expands.

479
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:41,160
The temperature of the air around it is the same. It means it's perfectly happy there.

480
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:49,450
Okay. Next case, what we call stable atmosphere, kind of like an inversion.

481
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:56,530
In this case, the red line is the environmental lapse rate.

482
00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:00,310
It's an inversion. So it's more vertical. Okay.

483
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:04,720
It's not quite an inversion. It's a stable atmosphere to somebody about it.

484
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,610
But take my personal there. Kick it up a couple hundred meters.

485
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:15,580
It goes up, expands, cools. It cools at the lapse rate.

486
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:25,960
So it follows the green line. However, the air around it is not cooling as fast, so it's warmer.

487
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:31,130
So that means I keep my personal life equal.

488
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,930
It's this much cooler than the air around it.

489
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:39,160
You can't have that as a stable condition. It's denser.

490
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,440
It's going to want to descend.

491
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:49,000
It's going to want to descend very thin to the point where its temperature matches the environment, the buoyancy matches.

492
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:53,980
This is an example of suppression of turbulence.

493
00:57:54,850 --> 00:58:01,320
Kick that particle up with that person up cools too fast compared to the surrounding area it's going to want to drop back to.

494
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:18,960
One more case. Unstable atmospheres. Here we have the environmental lapse rate and super idiot of attitude who's very fast.

495
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:23,790
The parcel again. Pick it up. It's going to follow the standard glass route.

496
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:28,350
When it gets up here, it's warmer here around it.

497
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:34,020
This means it's buoyancy. It's got a lot of buoyancy. It's going to want to keep going.

498
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:42,750
Okay. So in this case, kicking up that castle sort of accelerates the amount of turbulence or enhances mixing.

499
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:55,150
Okay. This is why the lapse rate is such a governing feature for us in thinking about how rapidly plumes disperse.

500
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:59,440
Now, this argument I've been making for you is really simplified.

501
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:04,420
We've assumed adiabatic conditions. We've neglected moisture content.

502
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:09,280
We've assumed these parts will stay intact. They obviously don't.

503
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:21,550
But it's still generally true that these lapse rates are the major drivers on the amount of dispersion from plumes.

504
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,950
So I summarize that for you here.

505
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:39,700
Let's take a break from the stuff to go through, and I have to see if I can configure this other computer to work here.

506
01:01:52,130 --> 01:02:07,930
Did you try to swim in? When you go to download screen, you have to register before you can get there.

507
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:14,380
Okay. So I hit download both on my laptop and on a actual PC.

508
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:18,850
Yeah. I had that problem too. Yeah.

509
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:26,530
So go to software products freeware and then over to screen view.

510
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:37,240
And if you hit this, it doesn't work. But if you slide over to here, it does work and you probably didn't get this great this this for before.

511
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:54,850
So that's what you need to do. So software products, we were screwed.

512
01:02:55,280 --> 01:03:00,320
Yeah. Yeah. I just noticed that this morning when I was installing it on this machine.

513
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,160
Okay. That's all I gather.

514
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:13,040
Yeah. It's open source to the extent that you just have to register at a site.

515
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:22,190
But in fact, the this company, these guys I've known for a long time, they're in Texas.

516
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:35,300
They took all of these different EPA models and just put a nice UI around it and, you know, so that as well as their consulting services.

517
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:47,390
So it wasn't and then it is this is separate one person's freedom to different things, to different areas.

518
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:52,900
And I have to say. I think.

519
01:03:55,110 --> 01:04:04,630
You can download one or the other. There's a meteorological thing which I suggest that what you use is the web app, which is great.

520
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:11,190
Yeah. Uh, climate. I think it's easier and more flexible.

521
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:15,600
Yeah, I was looking for the. The w r plot.

522
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:24,120
Yeah, don't use that. I would say use the climate screen view and then the W or the screen view and the economy climate.

523
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:37,429
Yeah. Did I say something other, you know. You know, the climate saves you a step because you don't have to find the file that you want.

524
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:42,500
They've already got the files written on the site. Plus, it has a lot of other features which are kind of fun.

525
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:47,360
But if we use the other one, that's okay. That's. What did you do?

526
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:57,230
Yeah. In.

527
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:13,610
Yeah. Let's talk on the weekends. So it's good to see that issue.

528
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:20,350
I like that question because. Okay.

529
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:31,630
So you. I time.

530
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:47,989
Okay. So we were talking about the lapse rates and the stabilities and there's some other meteorological features to go over first.

531
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:53,180
Then we'll come back to some of the software. So this is off and the other one goes on.

532
01:05:56,430 --> 01:06:01,649
All right. Systems are getting smarter than they were. Okay.

533
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:08,550
So this page just summarizes some of the issues related or some of the effects of lapse rates and what we call stability.

534
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:19,410
And the key idea here is that stable atmospheres are resistant to vertical motion and can produce higher concentrations from ground level sources.

535
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:26,180
For elevated sources. It's not so easy to see, okay, neutral and unstable atmospheres are defined.

536
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:33,670
A couple of other definitions to go for.

537
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:37,480
Mixing high is where the base of that version layer is.

538
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:45,610
It defines the extent of the vertical mixing. Kind of like a lid on the an air pollution.

539
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:53,380
If that lead is above the height of the sources, including plume rise, then this can trap the pupils.

540
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:57,520
Below that mixing heights are very dynamic.

541
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:06,190
They change our to our location. To location typically are higher during the daytime, typically are higher during the night.

542
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:12,420
I'm sorry, during the daytime to higher during the summer. Some silly pictures here.

543
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:19,030
We define these using what's called radio songs.

544
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:23,380
These are balloons that are released with temperature recording instruments.

545
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:29,170
That's still being done twice a day at about 60 locations.

546
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:34,930
And from that, we can get a picture like this of the morning mixing height.

547
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:43,510
In our area here, it's typically what is at the 500 meter height or so.

548
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:48,160
Okay. And that's an annual average in the afternoon.

549
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:52,750
It's about 1200 meters. So it's well above most folks.

550
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:59,330
Okay. So radio songs are used.

551
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:07,490
We also have vertical acoustic Sounders and CDs for most airports because there can be turbulence associated with the mixing height.

552
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:14,450
And so we have those. And then there's some of the research types of instrumentation that are used.

553
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:23,900
And that brings us to air quality modeling now. Okay. And before we do that, then let's talk about neurological data.

554
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:37,820
Okay. I'm going to put this back in. I hit the power button on her.

555
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:54,790
I think you. No.

556
01:08:58,010 --> 01:09:11,610
Not so much in. Okay.

557
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:27,150
All right. So for the homework groups, I recommend that you use the climate option rather than the w r plot option.

558
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,159
It saves you a couple of steps.

559
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:38,850
Plus this access is meteorological data from throughout the country, and it's easier to use, I think, and more flexible.

560
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:49,770
This is actually part of a suite of applications that are available to you at this site,

561
01:09:50,310 --> 01:10:00,990
which is sponsored by Noah and implemented in the Midwest by folks at Purdue University.

562
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:05,550
And they will do various things that you can see here.

563
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:13,860
What I want you to use is the main application and just do some wind roses here to get a sense of meteorological data.

564
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:20,280
So to walk you through this, the first thing you need to do is to select the daily station of interest.

565
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:28,470
I had to log in. I thought I had just done that.

566
01:10:31,470 --> 01:10:41,700
Let's go to The Daily. All the charts and graphs and see if I need to log in again.

567
01:10:49,770 --> 01:11:02,270
Nothing's happened to. Great. My guess is I'm not connected.

568
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:30,060
Looks like I am. Okay.

569
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:37,300
Church groups. We do the windows very good.

570
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:46,840
You need to select an hourly station. We're using hourly data to generate a wind rose.

571
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:56,020
You can select the hourly station either using their map selector, or you can highlight stations that are available in the region of interest.

572
01:11:56,500 --> 01:12:03,320
Or if you know. Texas is working with.

573
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:14,860
You know, if you're just going to say Detroit Metro, this works.

574
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:34,879
I don't know. I think it's just really slow. Okay so it's got Detroit Metro all choose that, say guru and then for your win.

575
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,940
GROSS I'm asking you to do something that's representative.

576
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:41,390
So typically you want how many years of data for a representative?

577
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:49,510
Five years, typically as a minimum. The record actually goes back at some airports 50 or more years.

578
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:56,810
So you can do a lot. Let's do the current year, except that doesn't take us to the end.

579
01:12:57,170 --> 01:13:04,220
So let's do the custom and let's just go back and do 2021,

580
01:13:05,390 --> 01:13:16,400
the full year and I'll just take a shortcut here or there and then we'll do no sub window within that.

581
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:24,740
So in other words, this allows us to do a portion of that or certain hours within the year we'll just do it for 24 hours for the full year.

582
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:31,010
Typically I use meters per second.

583
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:34,760
You can choose different scales here as you like.

584
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:43,250
Calm threshold are winds that are below this threshold will not be reported as having a direction.

585
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:50,360
Okay. Even though you might get a direction from the airport, that is not likely to be very reliable.

586
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:59,750
So this program allows you to set that calm, leave it to be 1.3, and then you can choose 16 or 18 or 30,

587
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:05,810
30 to encompass points and get the wind rose and this is about it.

588
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:10,670
Okay. Question. Mm hmm.

589
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:14,820
Question itself for two. It's using 2018.

590
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:20,600
Mm hmm. Do you not want us to do, like, the when roses for 2018, then?

591
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:24,680
Do you want it to be 2021? I like it to be consistent.

592
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:35,190
So that might be a typo. Okay.

593
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:38,530
So here's my wind rose for Detroit Metro for that period of time.

594
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:41,770
And that's about all that's involved in this piece of software.

595
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:51,190
And I have to come back to there's a lot of other things that this will do rather than just the wind.

596
01:14:51,190 --> 01:15:01,450
ROSE And incidentally, it does present the data used in the windows down here, and this is the meter per second range.

597
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:10,450
And then this is the percent of time in those 16 sectors, and that percent of time should add up to 100%.

598
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:16,060
We have 90.6 explained and then 9.4% of columns.

599
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:23,530
So this is kind of interesting because in Michigan you think of it as normally pretty windy, okay?

600
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:29,860
But still, there's 10% of the time and this is a Detroit metro open area, ten meter height,

601
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:35,020
where the winds are quite like, okay, when would that be likely to occur?

602
01:15:42,150 --> 01:15:43,240
That's another good question.

603
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:54,540
You can actually answer all those questions from here, too, because, for example, I could choose, say, the midday period, say from 9 to 15.

604
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:59,280
So do you expect winds to be higher or lower during this time?

605
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:07,230
Right. I appreciate the gifts.

606
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:16,190
It's a good one. Something to do with the land being warmed.

607
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:27,740
Yeah, maybe. But the more important thing is, at nighttime, you may have a lower inversion, right, where you have decoupling of the winds above.

608
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:35,150
And in fact, we are going to have higher winds during the daytime, slightly higher.

609
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:42,140
And so here is the midday profile again, averaged over last year.

610
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:52,930
And I didn't know in particular, but it told me that the average wind speed was 5.0.

611
01:16:53,330 --> 01:16:58,430
And I believe. But the full day was 4.6 or something like that.

612
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:06,250
Okay. There's a lot of other things that can be done here with this program in particular.

613
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:11,840
I like the some of the charts here for the thermal graph.

614
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:18,740
And you can do all kinds of climate data here as well.

615
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:26,330
And you can actually download most of the data as well. And it's quite slow right now.

616
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:56,950
Too slow for me. I didn't ask it to do very much.

617
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:06,540
Okay. There we go. So we have here just a lot of temperatures over the year,

618
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:14,849
as well as highs and lows and as well as climate norms shown in green and all the

619
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:20,220
statistics which we could probably ever walk in terms of looking at the records of data.

620
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:24,300
So lots of possibilities with this piece of software. Okay.

621
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:30,180
Can I leave us? Can you show us how to actually redo a windows?

622
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:39,740
Yeah, sure. Let's go back to that. And get the wind rose, which unfortunately it doesn't keep.

623
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:47,030
So there's two ways to do it. You can read it off the wind or you can look at the table of data right below this.

624
01:18:48,620 --> 01:19:04,340
I think the EPA, those are the same as well. So this wind rose is for a calendar year last year, but it's only for the 9 to 3 midday period.

625
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:11,120
Okay. And so the plot here is showing me the winds from this sector.

626
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:17,570
For example, the west southwest with the southwest sector, this is the 10% line.

627
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:21,950
So this is five, ten, 15 would be out here.

628
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:27,530
So this is probably about 12% of the time the winds are in that sector.

629
01:19:29,290 --> 01:19:35,020
Okay. Bye. In that sector. We know that winds are blowing towards the southwest.

630
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:42,880
From the southwest, wind roses and wind directions in the meteorological world are always where the wind is coming from.

631
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:48,610
Right. And then the colors represent the wind speeds and you see them on the top.

632
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:56,920
Right. And most of the time, the winds are probably in this orange, an area which is 68 meters per second.

633
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:01,090
Okay. Occasionally you get really high winds.

634
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:08,020
Okay. But not very often. Yeah, but time isn't like a part of this.

635
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:11,270
It's just saying from this time that there was no way to read that it's.

636
01:20:12,190 --> 01:20:16,510
No, this is not. This is averaged over the period.

637
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:26,740
So the same data is right below. So, for example, I was looking at the Southwest and this poem is the Southwest with the different winds.

638
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:30,220
And so, for example, I said most of the time it's 6 to 8.

639
01:20:30,730 --> 01:20:40,150
And so from the Southwest, 3.6% of the time it's 6 to 8 in that sector, and that sector swings to 12%.

640
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:44,110
It's about what I said, 11.7. Okay.

641
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:51,550
So the winter is just a way to depict tabular data. Good.

642
01:20:51,970 --> 01:20:56,390
Yes. I have a question from the Alps that we'll get to when we get to you.

643
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:05,200
Any other questions on this? Good. Let's go back to our PowerPoint.

644
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:18,490
Okay. So this is actually an air pollution model that was set up with a huge expansion of the vertical context.

645
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:22,140
And so these are different power plants across the US.

646
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:25,890
In the plumes you can see them drifting in different directions.

647
01:21:27,690 --> 01:21:32,040
Air quality models are used for a number of different applications.

648
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:42,750
Some of them are listed here. A key idea for regulatory applications is to ensure the national air quality standards are maintained.

649
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:55,710
Sometimes we use polluting models to find new sources or find new sites for sources to evaluate different control options for contingency planning.

650
01:21:55,740 --> 01:22:00,990
For example, what happens if we have an emergency or chemical release or something like that?

651
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:07,740
They have been very successfully used for emergency response situations, for example.

652
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:23,120
For those of you who are from Michigan may remember BASF had some leaks of mercaptan and hydrogen sulfide at their plant on the Detroit River,

653
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:28,860
and models were used to understand what the impacts were and so forth.

654
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:38,280
They're used for emergency response to define the toxic footprints, for example, areas that could be dangerous or lethal to get into.

655
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:44,430
They're also used for source apportionment to see who's responsible or culpable,

656
01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:48,740
and then their use for exposure and health and risk impact and so forth.

657
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:56,930
Types of models. Epidemiological models. Really three types of models.

658
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:01,970
One is a physical scale model, typically done in wind tunnels.

659
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:06,420
A second is the mathematical simulation models.

660
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:16,310
That's what we're going to look on. A third is a class of statistical models, which I'm not going to get into called receptacle models,

661
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:25,730
which are used to define contributions from different sources based on chemical signatures.

662
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:30,980
So in other words, I measure the composition of particulate matter.

663
01:23:31,550 --> 01:23:45,830
And as an example, if it includes, I don't know, potassium or carbon or sulfate, I can tell you which source is likely to be responsible.

664
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:52,800
Anyway, the simulation models will use. You need an emission inventory.

665
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:56,840
We talked about that, the national emission inventory, for example, and II,

666
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:02,190
we need metrological data and we need to understand the physical chemical processes.

667
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:12,480
I am sure after Thanksgiving you want to look at a partial couple differential equations, right?

668
01:24:13,290 --> 01:24:17,790
And so some of these models actually solve all of these things.

669
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:26,400
Most don't. Okay. Most consider only the first equation, the effective diffusion equation for conservation of mass.

670
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:32,250
Okay. However, if you're going to be using climate change models or global models,

671
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:38,430
you're going to have to deal with the navier-stokes and heat equations as well.

672
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:43,890
And and it becomes obviously pretty complex.

673
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:50,610
Don't worry. We're not going to make you do any of that. We're going to use what we call approximate approach.

674
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:54,780
And in this case is that we're going to focus on mass balance.

675
01:24:56,250 --> 01:25:03,540
We're going to take the flow field from meteorological data so we're not deriving the flow field like we did for groundwater.

676
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:06,230
We actually saw where the water went. Okay.

677
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:14,580
In this case, we're going to take meter logical observations at a station and use that to drive the pollutants around the space.

678
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:25,650
We are going to account for a number of other types of processes, though, that affect the plume dispersion, and you'll see that in screen view.

679
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:32,790
Essentially we're using what we call statistical theory, and it's the starting.

680
01:25:32,910 --> 01:25:36,900
The starting point is the effective diffusion conservation of mass equation.

681
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:41,670
And yes, this is a complicated equation, but you understand all the terms here.

682
01:25:42,330 --> 01:25:51,120
We have a change in concentration at a specific location X with respect to time as a function of velocity,

683
01:25:51,540 --> 01:26:00,360
winds blowing around, as a function of dispersion, being influenced by eddies and so forth.

684
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:11,400
We have an emissions turn, we have a decay because the pollutants can react, forming new moves or losing the primary fluid.

685
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:18,870
And then we have a settling term. Particles can settle down or gases can settle out and be deposited on surfaces.

686
01:26:19,170 --> 01:26:22,170
So you understand the processes that go in.

687
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:29,430
The difference here is that it's a three dimensional problem and it changes in time and it's very dynamic.

688
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:36,120
So the statistical model makes some simplifications.

689
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:43,800
Let's assume that you have a pollution source and the winds are blowing sort of up on the screen or to the back.

690
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:55,890
And we have an instrument that measures the concentration at these different locations as we traverse down in France or we get this jagged line.

691
01:26:57,250 --> 01:27:01,260
Okay. This is what we call one realization of the plume.

692
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:06,200
Let's do that another time. You're not going to get the same pattern.

693
01:27:06,210 --> 01:27:11,010
You're going to get a different pattern. But it's still likely to peak in the middle, directly downwind.

694
01:27:12,330 --> 01:27:22,680
If you did this lots of times, then you're going to end up with sort of this gridded distribution and it's going to look like a Gaussian.

695
01:27:24,150 --> 01:27:26,010
So it's going to look like a bell shaped curve.

696
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:35,040
This is what we call an ensemble of measurements that approach like the second, the central limit theorem, a Gaussian distribution.

697
01:27:35,670 --> 01:27:44,700
Okay. If you look at this in terms of a downwind, here's the source we're going to have.

698
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:49,590
Again, those realizations. This plume is going to spread out as you go further downwind.

699
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:55,710
Again, each of these profiles in the cross wind direction is going to look kind of calcium.

700
01:27:57,090 --> 01:28:00,570
If we assume it's Gaussian, then that's a statistical theory.

701
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:06,569
And you guys have studied the Gaussian, right?

702
01:28:06,570 --> 01:28:12,240
You know? You know, each standard deviation contains 34% of it.

703
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:20,430
So I'm not going to go over this. But what you probably haven't done is study double Gaussian distributions.

704
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:24,660
Okay. Okay. So as an example here.

705
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:25,870
Oh, I don't know.

706
01:28:25,890 --> 01:28:36,750
You might have a Gaussian distribution for, I don't know, an animal's weight, and you might have another Gaussian distribution for its height.

707
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:44,790
And then if I wanted the probability that it was a certain height and a certain weight,

708
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:51,150
I go to the intersection and figure out what that is by multiplying those two probabilities together.

709
01:28:52,710 --> 01:29:01,730
That can work if. We make the assumption that those distributions are independent.

710
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:07,490
Okay. So in other words, being tall doesn't mean that you're heavier.

711
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:12,020
Okay. Clearly, we violate that assumption. Okay.

712
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:17,520
But in the air pollution world, we can have mixing in vertical and horizontal.

713
01:29:17,540 --> 01:29:22,430
And we do make the assumption. Well, actually, we don't that they're independent, but that's the way we figure it out.

714
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:30,260
All right. So anyway, I don't think based on some people's reactions you want to see, we talk about these equations.

715
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:38,420
But essentially, this is just the Gaussian distribution applied to two variables.

716
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:45,890
All right. So what we do is very simple. Here at the Origin, we release a puff.

717
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:56,570
It moves downwind along the X direction. It spreads transverse and vertically, and it forms this puff that kind of grows with time.

718
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:02,930
Okay. And it grows because of the dispersion that occurs.

719
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:17,280
And if I take that model and here's the equations for that and I assume a single cup then that this represents that model.

720
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:24,210
And later in time, this path moves down further, continues to grow and expand.

721
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:30,420
Okay. Most of the time in the air pollution world, we're not interested in puffs.

722
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:44,550
We're interested in continuous releases. So the interesting thing that we can do here is to assume that these puffs are occurring very rapidly,

723
01:30:44,670 --> 01:30:49,110
one after another, and then we get a continuous plume.

724
01:30:52,500 --> 01:31:01,740
And that's basically what is the next example here where I have the first performance down when another pope comes out and so forth.

725
01:31:04,190 --> 01:31:17,300
And the nice thing about the continuous calcium pool is it allows very simple integration and solution and you can easily obtain solutions.

726
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:21,740
So here is our source. Visible step h height.

727
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:29,810
A plume rises to a final height begins because of the plume rise moves downwind.

728
01:31:31,010 --> 01:31:33,710
The center line is defined again by peak h.

729
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:42,980
You can see the Gaussian distribution in the transverse or cross wind direction and you can see the in the vertical direction again,

730
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:54,080
the calcium shaker with the understanding of the center line, the distribution both vertical and horizontal.

731
01:31:54,410 --> 01:32:01,250
I can calculate the concentration in an arbitrary point using the equations that you didn't want me to go over.

732
01:32:02,570 --> 01:32:10,670
Okay. But it's clear that the highest concentration will occur right along the center line where the peak occurs.

733
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:17,120
The further I move away from the plume, vertical or horizontal, the lower the concentration becomes.

734
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:21,830
Yeah. Where's the variable for error?

735
01:32:24,150 --> 01:32:27,850
There is not this deterministic model. Okay.

736
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:32,990
You're thinking about calcium type errors. That's that's not the case here.

737
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:38,380
We're just looking at somewhere out along a distribution order question.

738
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:45,160
So this is the general equation right here.

739
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:58,420
The concentration is equal to at point X, Y and Z, the emission rate divided by two pi times the standard deviation in the transverse direction.

740
01:32:58,660 --> 01:33:01,630
That's the standard deviation of the two right here,

741
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:09,730
divided by the standard deviation of the plume in the vertical direction, divided by the wind speed.

742
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:22,210
Times this mass over here, delta y squared or y squared represents how far away you are from the plume center line in the vertical I'm sorry,

743
01:33:22,210 --> 01:33:30,610
in the horizontal dimension because my y scales here and z minus h is how far I am away from the center line height.

744
01:33:32,410 --> 01:33:36,760
So if I'm right along the center line, this goes to zero.

745
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:40,480
This goes to zero. This B term drops out.

746
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:49,600
Okay. At that point, I have just this in my model, and this is a very simple equation.

747
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:54,970
It's almost like a box model where I have the box defined by the standard deviations,

748
01:33:55,210 --> 01:34:02,500
how much the plume is spreading vertically and horizontally and divided by the wind speed, plus the normalizing factors to PI.

749
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:08,800
So this kind of breaks down to a box model along the center line.

750
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:21,040
Okay. It's still complicated, though, but I go through the math here and the key in this model are the dispersion coefficients.

751
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:29,230
And I'm going to go over that and then we'll have the application of the software, which I'm still running a little late on this here.

752
01:34:31,090 --> 01:34:39,700
So in this model, I have the standard deviation showing up in the equation, which represents the standard deviations of this profile.

753
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:44,110
If you look at this, this is growing over time.

754
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:48,340
The standard deviations are increasing as I move further downwind.

755
01:34:49,190 --> 01:34:57,010
Okay. The problem continues to expand. So we need to get these terms.

756
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:00,210
And there's a bit of texture.

757
01:35:00,910 --> 01:35:09,040
They depend on meteorological conditions, the structure, the atmosphere, the land surface, the heat flux, the sun angles and things like this.

758
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:19,510
But the most common way to get these things is a system that was developed by these folks, Pascal, Gifford and Turner.

759
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:25,330
Based on measurements that they took originally in England and then later in the U.S.

760
01:35:26,830 --> 01:35:34,540
And they took these measurements and typed or classified the atmosphere into these six categories.

761
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:43,240
ABCD Earth where A is very unstable daytime conditions, those big eddies.

762
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:52,690
D is the neutral. This is the standard lapse three and F is stable or like an inversion or near inversion conditions.

763
01:35:54,130 --> 01:35:58,240
And then they had a typing system, which is very simple.

764
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:08,410
They said, for example, if the wind speed is less than two meters per second, we have lots of sunshine during the daytime.

765
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:21,250
That's stability and unstable. Conversely, if we have a pretty slow wind, nighttime, no cloud cover, limited cloud cover.

766
01:36:21,670 --> 01:36:26,770
We have E this is very stable, representing nocturnal inversion.

767
01:36:28,390 --> 01:36:34,370
And then we have everything in between. All right.

768
01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:38,310
They weren't done. The key thing that they did were these measurements.

769
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:48,480
And basically this showed, for example, for the vertical dispersion as a function of distance, how the dispersion coefficient changes.

770
01:36:49,890 --> 01:36:56,790
So a condition, unstable, daytime, low wind, lots of sunshine.

771
01:36:57,540 --> 01:37:03,900
Let's look at what happens at one kilometer downwind. The vertical dispersion coefficient is 500 meters.

772
01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:13,210
This means that if I release a plume right here, travel downwind one kilometer, it's going to mix to half a kilometer in height.

773
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:23,750
There's a lot of mixing going on. Conversely, if I took that same condition but changed it to F and this is nighttime low winds,

774
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:30,690
clear skies like an inversion, it disperses only 15 meters at one kilometer.

775
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:37,080
That's a huge change representing how important the atmosphere is and mixing conditions.

776
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:41,760
Similarly, for horizontal, they did the experiments.

777
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:51,750
They came up with mixing conditions from, say, 200 meters to about 25 meters or 30 meters.

778
01:37:52,290 --> 01:37:56,090
So plumes don't spread quite as far horizontally.

779
01:37:56,100 --> 01:38:00,240
But again, there's a strong dependance on this stability category.

780
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:07,770
Now, how does this all work? I jumped over an example, but I had that puff model.

781
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:12,360
My scenario for the puff model was described here.

782
01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:17,880
Let's say an incinerator is releasing 750 grams of particulate matter.

783
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:23,040
Let's look at downwind conditions, one kilometer instabilities.

784
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:35,670
And if I plug in those parameters for stability, A, I have dispersion in the X direction of about 500 meters in the Y direction.

785
01:38:35,670 --> 01:38:39,479
I'm talking to Z direction of vertical 200. Plug it in.

786
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:45,390
I get a concentration of less than one micrograms per cubic meter, pretty low concentration for particulate matter.

787
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:59,910
On the other hand, if this release occurred at nighttime under stability, if dispersion in the horizontal is 30 meters in the vertical 14 meters.

788
01:39:00,390 --> 01:39:08,670
I'm just reading off these curves. Okay, plug that in and I get a concentration of nearly 4000 micrograms per cubic meter.

789
01:39:09,690 --> 01:39:18,150
Okay. So we have here about 4000 change due to meteorological conditions.

790
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:22,320
This is a standard, okay, because it's just a couple of hours apart.

791
01:39:23,190 --> 01:39:26,910
But the meteorological conditions really drive the results that you get.

792
01:39:27,390 --> 01:39:37,230
That's the key lesson here. And I can do the same thing with the plume model as well.

793
01:39:38,490 --> 01:39:41,850
Okay. I think we'd better go and demo some of the software for you.

794
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:48,870
Okay. At least start the questions about and start this.

795
01:39:50,640 --> 01:40:01,620
This to build a category thing is complicated. It's important, though, and it is a key driver for local scale air pollution problems and.

796
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:10,700
I'm going to demo this screen view application for.

797
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:21,330
Okay. We got 10 minutes.

798
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:30,179
All right, good. Okay, so when you start this up, it gives you a warning, tells you when you can use this, when you shouldn't use this.

799
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:31,290
I'm going to skip all that.

800
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:40,079
Typically, you need to go from left to right so we can start a new project and we would just call it whatever you want to call it.

801
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:45,000
I'll call DHS 570 to run more.

802
01:40:49,130 --> 01:40:54,950
This program is quite nice in the sense that it has a number of different types of sources and options for you.

803
01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:58,640
Let's model the simplest thing that we can't look at. Point Source.

804
01:40:59,690 --> 01:41:03,260
I can also choose flare area or volumetric sources.

805
01:41:04,970 --> 01:41:08,420
Let's assume that this is in urban conditions,

806
01:41:09,050 --> 01:41:16,790
and the reason that I do that is because those dispersion parameters are going to change, whether it's urban or rural.

807
01:41:17,390 --> 01:41:26,570
You could imagine those experiments that they did on a grassy field compared to, say, mountainous or forested or a city.

808
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:30,050
It's going to lead to much more rapid dispersion. Okay.

809
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:39,270
Typically the receptor hi that we are carried caring about is where we are breathing the air.

810
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:43,350
So that's typically about two meters, right. Okay.

811
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:49,350
Four point source. I need an emission rate.

812
01:41:50,550 --> 01:41:57,930
One of the tricks that I usually do is to realize that the concentration is proportional to the emission rate.

813
01:41:58,530 --> 01:42:05,520
So often I will just make this one gram per second and then adjust the results proportionately.

814
01:42:05,850 --> 01:42:11,340
But you can put in whatever you like. Stack Right.

815
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:20,800
Is a physical parameter, obviously. Let's assume we're modeling the power plant at U of M.

816
01:42:21,310 --> 01:42:25,510
Okay. And I think I really don't know the height anymore.

817
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:38,590
I'm going to say 80 meters. I think it's lower the inside diameter, the start velocity in terms of meters per second, something like 15 is reasonable.

818
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:50,710
The gas temperature in Kelvin, you remember Kelvin to 73 plus ambient last year, it was like, whatever.

819
01:42:51,340 --> 01:43:04,870
Uh, I don't know, let's say it's about 100 degrees over ambient, so 394 and then we should be done with this.

820
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:11,260
Then we can go down in the bottom right to next and then we get into the tree.

821
01:43:12,010 --> 01:43:16,300
Another nice thing about this program is it has options for different types of terrain.

822
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:25,120
Simple is what I suggest that you use and elevated gives you a number of different choices.

823
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:30,820
But let's just keep it simple complexes where the train is actually above the stack height.

824
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:44,140
Okay. This model calculates concentrations downwind and its purpose is to calculate the worst case concentration.

825
01:43:45,430 --> 01:43:48,490
Okay. And I'm going to show you that.

826
01:43:48,670 --> 01:43:51,970
But I'm going to do it in a different way.

827
01:43:52,420 --> 01:43:56,649
So I'm going to use automated distances. I'm not going to have building down wash.

828
01:43:56,650 --> 01:43:58,060
We talked about that before.

829
01:44:00,220 --> 01:44:12,310
I'm going to have my anemometer at ten meters height, the typical one, and I'm not going to run a single stability class in a single wind speed.

830
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:20,140
And let's make it the newer, the neutral stability which occurs more than half the time at most locations.

831
01:44:21,010 --> 01:44:26,320
And I'm going to give a wind speed of typical for Michigan of five meters per second.

832
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:32,510
Okay. Any questions on my inputs here?

833
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:41,570
Question for like one or doing this is this underneath underneath these live links here for the wind farm facility?

834
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:45,530
Is that where we're going to get information from? Yeah.

835
01:44:45,590 --> 01:44:48,770
Most of the information you're going to have is already in the problem assignment.

836
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:55,280
Okay. You need the stack parameters and you need the machinery.

837
01:44:55,490 --> 01:45:03,930
That's right. You can assume fluctuating. Okay.

838
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:08,459
Flat screen for automated distances.

839
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:19,380
I need to specify the range. I'm going to go from ten meters to, oh, let's go to 30,000 meters, 30 kilometers downwind.

840
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:22,440
This model will only you go to 60 kilometers, I believe.

841
01:45:27,150 --> 01:45:34,010
Where am I now? I should be good to go.

842
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:39,140
I can choose some specific points of interest. I'm not going to do that.

843
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:49,459
And then I can choose for building down the building dimensions.

844
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:53,840
I'm not going to do that. And then I should be.

845
01:45:53,870 --> 01:45:58,210
I can choose fumigation. I'm not going to do that. And then I should be ready to go.

846
01:45:58,220 --> 01:46:05,150
It says My project is complete. You can run it. So let's run it as if by let's look at the graph.

847
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:15,650
Here is the key results for the building D at all these different distances and P is

848
01:46:15,650 --> 01:46:23,299
produced of the concentration of 1.2 micrograms per cubic meter at a very short distance,

849
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:27,860
maybe a kilometer from the sun, and it decays downwind from there.

850
01:46:29,180 --> 01:46:45,860
Okay, I can get this output in terms of a graph or I can get it in terms of a floor or a table down here and is a text form of the same thing.

851
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:50,930
Let's go back to the graph. Is this worst case?

852
01:46:56,850 --> 01:47:00,450
This is worst case for that stability in wind speed.

853
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:06,360
But I can have any stability ABCD or F or any wind speed.

854
01:47:07,290 --> 01:47:14,190
And the nice thing about this model is that I can go back to the meteorology.

855
01:47:20,490 --> 01:47:27,030
And run what we call full meteorology, all stability classes and all wind speeds.

856
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:31,740
And then I can just go to run without changing anything else.

857
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:38,570
Okay. And then let's look at the graph.

858
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:45,830
And now this is calculated kind of stuff for each distance.

859
01:47:46,580 --> 01:47:54,380
It's actually gone through 90 some combinations of wind speeds and stability categories and picked the worst case.

860
01:47:55,430 --> 01:48:00,350
And now the worst case is about two micrograms per cubic meter.

861
01:48:00,410 --> 01:48:06,140
Not all that much higher. But remember again, my mission was only one because I would need to scale that up.

862
01:48:06,470 --> 01:48:12,200
And typically, emission rates for sources that we're interested in are hundreds of grams per second or whatever.

863
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:17,750
And this is produced at a distance of about 4000 meters.

864
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:23,450
Now we have to look at the output to understand what's going on.

865
01:48:25,750 --> 01:48:39,440
And what I unfortunately dislike here is in this output, it doesn't do the work properly for you.

866
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:45,860
So I think you need to change the text size so you can actually see what's going on.

867
01:48:48,010 --> 01:48:53,330
But I'm sorry. It's small. Here are the different distances.

868
01:48:54,350 --> 01:48:59,640
We found a maximum at about four kilometers.

869
01:49:02,060 --> 01:49:06,250
So. No, I don't see it.

870
01:49:07,870 --> 01:49:19,200
That's weird. Well, I just choose a location here is relative max about 1.15.

871
01:49:19,620 --> 01:49:24,730
1100 meters to building for ABC stability.

872
01:49:25,650 --> 01:49:30,000
This is the wind speed that it measures for per users to predict.

873
01:49:30,510 --> 01:49:40,570
This is the extrapolated wind speed, the assumed maximum height and team height because of rise and then the standard deviation sigma y and Sigma Z.

874
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:42,240
These are dispersion coefficients.

875
01:49:43,770 --> 01:49:59,740
So this simulation is showing me that the maximum concentration, if you scroll down a little bit here of all these is occurring at 814 meters.

876
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:04,010
The maximum concentration is this stability.

877
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:07,740
And this particular example never changed stability class.

878
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:13,020
So it's kind of an unusual example. Normally it does the way it does.

879
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:17,040
This is brute force calculating all those.

880
01:50:17,430 --> 01:50:25,440
And then finally, the gradient search, when it hones down into about the approximate region where the is expected,

881
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:29,040
then it numerically searches for the maximum concentration.

882
01:50:30,420 --> 01:50:33,570
This makes sense. Questions on this.

883
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:39,480
Can you talk about what you do afterwards about like one square foot?

884
01:50:40,110 --> 01:50:51,870
Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, normally when I run a dispersion model, I'm interested in understanding, for example,

885
01:50:52,530 --> 01:50:58,680
what is the maximum emission rate that will just meet the standard or something like that.

886
01:50:59,250 --> 01:51:05,520
And so I often use just a emission rate of one and then just scale the results after that.

887
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:11,400
What do you what do you mean to scale up? Oh, so for example, if in the from assignment,

888
01:51:12,210 --> 01:51:33,690
the homework says the emission rates for these facilities is tons of CO2 emissions per year and a total of 290.6 grams per second.

889
01:51:34,470 --> 01:51:44,100
Okay. I would either just put in 290.6 grams per second, if that's the right one to put in or take the results I just got and take the concentration.

890
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:54,310
Multiply it by 290. Okay. We have approached the witching hour.

891
01:51:58,150 --> 01:52:08,230
Okay. Next week, we'll have some time to work on specifics on our homework and also do a wrap up of other assessment techniques.

892
01:52:08,260 --> 01:52:11,980
There's little more material in reserve for the unit I didn't get to.

893
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:15,230
But hopefully this will allow you to do most of them.

894
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:20,980
Okay. Have a good week. She does this.

895
01:52:34,590 --> 01:52:43,100
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
