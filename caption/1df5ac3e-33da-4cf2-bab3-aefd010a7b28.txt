1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:08,850
I no longer want to be happy, but I might still get there.

2
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:18,570
Are you sure? Oh, my God.

3
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:26,240
I'm so know.

4
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:43,590
You know, I have no favorite things when you start taking them.

5
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,880
All the reasons they're already there.

6
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:59,160
And then I'll take a long time.

7
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:10,020
I'm sorry. Oh, that's not why I sleep.

8
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:29,380
I, you know, I don't know that you can take my heart.

9
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,000
So if I'm not telling you.

10
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:52,260
Yeah. Every so the same way, thinking about seeking a better result of the Supreme Court justices.

11
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:06,900
And you're like, yes, she's like, my sister really was different.

12
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:25,550
Yeah. Yeah. I voted against Doctor Strange when I was like, Oh, do you want to go home, Director?

13
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,240
Yeah. So we're having our first mass meeting of some states of public health.

14
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,720
We're like at New York, so it's going to be six or seven in the community room.

15
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:41,100
So it's like a networking and professional development work. So we'll have undergrads, grad students all coming and meeting for the first time.

16
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,960
So you don't have to be Muslim to call them or join. You all have to be a public health.

17
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,000
You just have to care about Muslims and health. So now please join of support.

18
00:02:53,540 --> 00:03:14,880
I mean question for moment because we have food what kind of leaders you know and here's what's ahead

19
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:23,580
you guys have your intervention to do with Friday and then I'll get you feedback as quickly as we can.

20
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:29,690
And then over the next few weeks, you do have a little more time to think about.

21
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:38,250
So I'm very much encourage you to use that time to meet with your friends, work on your presentations, work on iterating your projects.

22
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:45,659
And so hopefully that sort of minimizes out of class time you have to do to sort of coordinate.

23
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:55,200
I know this is a busy time of the semester and any questions about what's coming up ahead or any questions about presentations?

24
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:04,450
Yeah, you talked just a little bit more about how would you like to see the the okay.

25
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,430
That's a good question.

26
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:15,870
So how a formal or informal the presentation should be so you don't have to show up like in a business suit and, you know, dress comfortably,

27
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:26,969
you know, whatever that works for you in terms of formality in that sense, in terms of formal, it's nice to have an organized presentation.

28
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,860
I think that's important to do. I, like we talked about last time,

29
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:39,570
paying attention to your slides and how they're what's being communicated and then people can actually digest what you're showing them.

30
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:46,709
And then in terms of formality, you know, we're always interested in your process.

31
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:54,270
You guys obviously went through a process this semester, so I'm sure other groups would love to hear about how it worked for you.

32
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,790
Were there parts of this project that were a little more challenging than others or more?

33
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,079
Exciting for you and your members than others.

34
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,850
So feel free to sort of build in your personal reflections as well,

35
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:14,150
but also sort of communicate to the class like what is the issue that you chose to focus on?

36
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,890
Population, your model and the intervention you came up with and how you apply theory too.

37
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:26,750
So to answer your question, I think sort of striking that balance between formal and informal.

38
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,120
Any other questions? Okay.

39
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:41,700
We'll reach out as you continue to work on your projects and we progress through the semester.

40
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:51,300
Today I want to talk about behavioral economics and what we're going to do is sort of run through the basics.

41
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:57,479
And I'm going to sort of give you an overview and a preview of why behavioral economics is.

42
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:03,700
It's not going to be a total deep dive because you can have an entire class on behavioral economics.

43
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,169
So we just we're not going to do that.

44
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,600
But you're going to get the basic idea.

45
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:18,929
And if this is an area of health behavior that's interesting to you, I very much encourage you to think about other opportunities,

46
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,560
other classes where you can have more of a deep dive around this context.

47
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,220
So there is a lot of overlap with a lot of the concepts we've already covered.

48
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:37,110
So when I go through some things today, you're going to be like, Oh, that's actually this other thing she talked about a few weeks ago.

49
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,610
So it might be called something different in the behavioral economics discipline,

50
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,860
but I sort of see a lot of the concepts overlapping with some of the things we've already covered.

51
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:55,020
Behavioral economics is a buzz word that's used a lot in public health now and behavior change,

52
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:06,120
I think it's important enough to talk about in its own so that you sort of know what it is, because people throw that phrase around a lot.

53
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:12,389
And I also just want to make a disclaimer upfront around terminology I'm using,

54
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:16,590
which is straight out of the field of economics when I'm talking about some of the differences.

55
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:23,729
For example, in economics they use words like irrational and their definitions of theories at topics.

56
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:28,350
And you may or may not like that word in general to describe people,

57
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:34,030
but I'm just going to be consistent with using the terms and their definitions instead of making up.

58
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:43,650
So whether or not it's C to refer to individuals as irrational, you know, we can debate that another time.

59
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:51,180
I'm just talking about definitions from economics here as part of illustrating the differences.

60
00:07:52,920 --> 00:08:05,969
So traditional economics in their explanation of how people what it is, is really traditional explanations of how people make decisions.

61
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:14,670
And these are their assumptions. You know, what we sort of think about people in their decision making in the traditional field of economics.

62
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:20,040
So does this make any sense when we think about how behavior of some of the things they refer to?

63
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:27,809
So, you know, people always make decisions that are most likely to improve their welfare preferences are already formed

64
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:34,980
before people actually enter any sort of market and people maximize completely and don't settle for just okay.

65
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:41,580
And people make decisions in a purely self-interested opinion on either neither and nor altruism.

66
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,909
There's really no place for intrinsic rewards when it comes to traditional economics.

67
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:54,180
So does this does any of this resonate or make any sense when we think about behavior?

68
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:06,759
I feel like it's only making sense if I think in like a bear like 1800s mindset with

69
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,070
little understood like without like all the now with all all of the race we have today.

70
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,360
But like, unfortunately, I think like business people are at least in business,

71
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:29,090
they do like how they allowed the store is based on these types of things and it makes like it does work like it doesn't help with their profit line.

72
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:37,300
It's I don't think it's true for public health services and you sort of see some of this stuff play out

73
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:53,470
comes to health not necessarily plus you he could be any other thoughts or reactions to these assumptions.

74
00:09:53,950 --> 00:10:08,859
Is this how you see reality? Yeah, I think this assumes that there's like transparency and information,

75
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,730
but like a decision maker would have all the information and and health care.

76
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:20,589
Is that great transparency of information always? Or even like good understanding of the information that does exist.

77
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,590
So that's where I see a conflict between the two.

78
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:28,510
Okay. So there's an assumption that there's good information here.

79
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,809
But in in health care and especially health care economics,

80
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:38,920
which is just its own category of economics, there's this concept called information symmetry,

81
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:49,360
where maybe in health care, people have a lot of knowledge around things related to health care and the business of health care.

82
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:56,709
But then the recipients don't necessarily have access to that information or have a way of really

83
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:01,720
comprehending it or understanding of so many similarly for an informed decision subjects.

84
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:07,899
I saw a couple other yeah, it's like self centered,

85
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:14,580
so it doesn't really take into account how people make decisions about their health in terms of like how a certain decision might into impact,

86
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,979
like your ability, like their relationships with family, things like that,

87
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,940
or like their religious function in a certain unit or their career and things like that.

88
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:29,730
So personal beliefs and like family connections or connections to community also impact that person's options.

89
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:36,520
So it sort of assumes people are maybe self-interested, but in reality,

90
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,580
we often see that people make decisions in relation to their social environment,

91
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:47,590
their social networks, and it doesn't seem like these assumptions really take that into account.

92
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:55,020
Who's in hand over here? You know, I was just going to say, this is all true in a perfect world, us.

93
00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:01,190
I feel like all the things we've talked about in past classes and all the like, health inequities and things like that,

94
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:12,070
who we talk about in our curriculum, these things that's you know, I'm just saying to people, I'm not necessarily following these principles always.

95
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:20,739
So this sort of seems like the opposite of maybe some of the things we've been talking about, especially intrinsic cause.

96
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:29,080
I recall we had a whole lecture on self-determination theory of motivation and talking about intrinsic motivation.

97
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,620
And, you know, in that lecture there seemed to be a place for that.

98
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:39,640
But according to this line, there is no place for that. So there seems to be some contradictions here.

99
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:45,849
So why is behavioral economics?

100
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:54,579
It's basically an infusion of psychological realism with theories of economic behavior.

101
00:12:54,580 --> 00:13:04,210
So it's sort of pushing those two things together, psychological realism and traditional theories of economic behavior.

102
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:12,700
It combines the economics of incentives with insights from psychology about how people actually behave under real world circumstances.

103
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:20,980
So core to behavioral economics is expected utility theory, expected utility theory.

104
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,900
What that is, is how people make decisions and how such decisions should be made.

105
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:36,700
Um, behavioral economics. Behavioral economists also consider a more asymmetric paternalism approach to public policy.

106
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:42,640
And what that means is it helps people who are prone to making irrational

107
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:48,519
decisions while not restricting the freedom of choice from those making informed,

108
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:57,490
deliberate decisions. Public policy efforts typically focus on bans, regulations, taxes and so.

109
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:03,790
Cities and behavioral economics, like what's stated in the readings you had today.

110
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:10,000
It really takes the can approach in making choices convenient, attractive and novel.

111
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:18,700
But you can make that decision without having some sort of regulation or tax or subsidy when it comes to public policy.

112
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:28,030
And they believe it's important to help people achieve their own goals versus forms of regulation preventing people from serving others.

113
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:32,290
For example, secondhand smoke regulations.

114
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:44,340
There are obviously regulations around that, but behavioral economists believe that we can help people achieve their own goals in their own way,

115
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,880
make those decisions without having to have some sort of regulation guiding them.

116
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:57,210
So there are three broad concepts in behavioral economics that you should know.

117
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,990
There are many concepts, but I want to talk about three really broad ones.

118
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:07,800
So judgment, this refers to our subjective assessment of the probability of outcomes or events.

119
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,420
Decades of psychological and behavioral economics research has shown that judgments,

120
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:26,280
particularly those in which people have limited experience or information, can be greatly influenced by a lot of irrelevant things.

121
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:32,340
And, you know, when I think about more relevant factors, I think about peripheral processing,

122
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:39,420
which we talked about last week based on really non-issue characteristics and various things that we have sort of created in a.

123
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:52,640
Then we have decision making, and that's really the choice that people make when they're faced with multiple options.

124
00:15:52,660 --> 00:16:03,450
So that's how we define decision making. The choices people make with multiple options and multiple options is really important in this definition.

125
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:13,149
That's really key here. There are a whole host of factors that impact the way we make decisions influenced by context and how a message is framed,

126
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,210
but also through behavioral factors and how people tend to be.

127
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:22,180
So decades of research has revealed that people are not always rational and don't

128
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:27,580
always act in their own best interest or make decisions based on emotion or affect.

129
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:33,010
And they're more receptive to anecdotes and stories than just statistics.

130
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:46,330
Research has also shown that we tend to adopt rules and rules of thumb to deal with limited information processing capacity.

131
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:53,890
So heuristics, we are also overly confident and optimistic in certain situations,

132
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:04,330
and we also tend to pay more attention to information that seems relevant and salient to us at a particular moment in time.

133
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:11,850
We also tend to followed through with promises that are made publicly.

134
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:20,550
We tend towards inertia of actions and willingly accept preset options or defaults.

135
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:31,590
We're also loss averse and sense that losing something causes more mental anguish than gaining something of the same value.

136
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,420
People typically have a stronger preference for avoiding loss than acquiring gains,

137
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,920
and that really becomes important when reframing outcome expectation.

138
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:51,019
We tend to respond to incentives and we have present bias preferences,

139
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:56,030
which means that present benefits and costs are valued more than future benefits in cost.

140
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:03,650
So in layman's terms, people tend to focus on really immediate gratification and tend to discount future ones.

141
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:12,500
For example, an immediate reward of $10 is valued more than a future reward of the same amount at an immediate cost of $10.

142
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,890
Feels larger than a future cost of $10.

143
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:27,660
And we also respond to social pressure, and we're heavily influenced by the perceived actions of those of us.

144
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,260
So the third foreign concept is choice architecture.

145
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,970
And this is really a method used to counter flaws in judgment and decision making.

146
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:52,700
It's really about organizing the context in which people make decisions to really increase the quality of the decisions made.

147
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,980
And it also emphasizes feedback on performance, such as incentives.

148
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:19,499
So the idea of, you know, paying people to engage in health behaviors has become very popular based on principles of behavioral economics.

149
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:27,090
And the premise is that it gets people into habit and even get it getting into getting them into some sort of habit.

150
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,480
So it's there even after the reward is removed.

151
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:39,720
I'm sort of like shaping behavior when we go back to operant conditioning and thinking about rewards and shaping some sort of behavior.

152
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:48,450
But the verdict is across the literature evaluations have shown only short term improvements in health behaviors,

153
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:55,710
a different sort of health promotion activities, but it doesn't sustain behavioral change over the long term.

154
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:05,940
Sometimes it's also not feasible to continue monetary incentives over the long term

155
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:12,090
and said we often want to use patient identified rewards for reaching a goal.

156
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:24,049
So when you talk a little bit about medical donations that illustrate some of these examples,

157
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:32,420
that medical donation is an important area of health research, since these donations can have a substantial impact on health outcomes.

158
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:37,370
And there's often a very significant need. Registered organ.

159
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:43,790
Organ donors make the organs available for transplant upon dozens and once deceased.

160
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:52,100
Once, once one and one deceased donor, for example, can provide up to eight life saving organs.

161
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:58,730
We know that about organ donation, and most organ donations come from people who have died,

162
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:09,320
who had either registered as a donor of commonly through your Department of Motor Vehicles or through a decision made by your next of kin.

163
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:18,560
In the United States, over 115,000 individuals in the U.S. have been on a waiting list for an organ transplant.

164
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,280
And this waitlist kills 20 people each day.

165
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:33,830
95% of U.S. adults support organ donation, but only 54% of Americans over the age of 18 have actually registered as income.

166
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:42,570
So, you know, why is this why? Why is this the situation in the US?

167
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:48,540
So when we think about incentives, monetary incentives are not allowed in medical information.

168
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:59,310
And that's so wrong. Historically, the current system of organ donation has been based on altruism, which evolved during the 1960s and 1970s,

169
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:08,280
when issues such as the definition of brain death, a use of donor cards and really public attitudes towards donation were only just evolving.

170
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:21,750
1960s and 1970s that was very new and just evolving based on the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act of the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984.

171
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:26,610
The buying and selling of organs has been specifically prohibited,

172
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:34,530
so you cannot do that in the U.S. It is against the law so often in donor situations

173
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:38,940
because you can't pay people to sign up for a donor or donate their organs.

174
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:45,840
You know, there are non-monetary sometimes used, like when you give blood.

175
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:49,560
T-shirts, coupons, blankets, mugs, swag.

176
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,000
And the focus is on the economic value of that incentive.

177
00:22:54,070 --> 00:23:03,480
If it's larger, the more donors they get. That's why studies have seen when they use sort of swag to get people to sign up as a donor.

178
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:09,179
Some countries have also employed priority on organ donation reading list,

179
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:16,050
so if you register by end of meeting the organs yourself, it changes the way organs are allocated.

180
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:26,370
But we don't do this in the US in terms of bumping you up on the waitlist if you signed up to be a donor, if you take a look at some other countries,

181
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:36,690
do that in Israel and Singapore example, for example, they do a valuation of their policy shows that it does increase donations.

182
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:44,040
Lab experiments of this have also shown substantial increases in the donation.

183
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:54,870
In Choice architecture, there's these concepts called opt in, opt out and active choice in opt in.

184
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:59,790
You have to actively check the box to say that you will donate your organs.

185
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,080
This is what we commonly do in the US.

186
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:11,880
Opt in countries in the in opt in countries like the U.S. where you have to actively check the box saying I will donate my organs.

187
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:21,270
Fewer than 50% of people donate their organs and then saying that they will donate their organs and does opt out.

188
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:25,499
You have to actively check the box to opt out. Not our countries.

189
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,530
More than 90% of people donate their organs.

190
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,990
So often it's 15% of Dow 90%.

191
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:43,680
This yields decisions through inaction. So drawbacks of this are that we wrote we don't really show.

192
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:46,860
We don't really know people's true preferences or motivations.

193
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:53,399
They just opting out means you have to do something to not donate your organs.

194
00:24:53,400 --> 00:25:00,280
But people don't do that. So I tried to opt out with my husband if I signed up.

195
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:05,470
So both of us for a flu shot and the latest COVID booster at the same time.

196
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,900
He was not interested in getting all these shots and was over.

197
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:15,270
He's like, I've got it, Mike. COVID vaccines and boosters.

198
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,660
I don't want another one. He agreed to do the flu shot, though.

199
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:24,160
So when we showed up at our appointment, he was left with an opt out option.

200
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,240
He could opt out of the COVID booster, but he chose not to take the action steps, opting out.

201
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:37,690
So he ended up getting both shots for the plan.

202
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:49,540
So that's an opt out after choice, and alternative to opt out is both yes and no.

203
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,500
Both of those are presented to the person and you have to make a choice.

204
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:59,210
And this performs better than Ogden, because typically you have to make a choice.

205
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,340
You get both yes and no. But you do have a choice to make.

206
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:17,480
So these are European countries when it comes to consent rates around organ donation.

207
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:25,250
So as you can see, opt in is the yellow bars and opt out is blue.

208
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:35,660
So when it comes to consenting for organ donations, there's a very clear difference there in terms of consenting.

209
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:53,290
So. In terms of when decisions are really complex and we don't really know much about their choice options.

210
00:26:53,290 --> 00:27:00,189
We tend to select whichever is the default option, especially, you know, organ donation, for example.

211
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:03,219
There's a lot of information there and it's quite complex.

212
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,970
So it's an opt out situation.

213
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:14,980
We we just had a selecting the default option. If we're just automatically selecting the default and it's the case of like donating

214
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,100
your organs and you're just kind of defaulting because you don't understand.

215
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,180
Is that bringing about some kind of ethical issue with informed consent?

216
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:27,310
It does. So in this particular case, I actually know the history behind this.

217
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:34,900
They give presumed consent. But when you actually get to the hospital, they still like they still have to go through the process.

218
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:38,500
It's just without that, they can go through the process at all.

219
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:47,650
So like this is like obviously there's a lot of ethical issues around this, but it's not like, oh, you've given consent, they just do it.

220
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:52,600
It's like they they're able to go through the process of donating your organs in this case.

221
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,969
Yeah. So it's not that there is no you're absolutely right.

222
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:06,060
There is no it's not that there is no consent, but it makes it a little easier in terms of the process than that other option.

223
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:17,550
But it still raises ethical issues. Like I just signed my husband up for two shots that I ignored.

224
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:28,940
So it does bring up ethical issues. So we have to assume that the default option is the one that most people would have picked.

225
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:40,140
So if we choose it, if we end up choosing it, it's likely in response and into some sort of perceived social norm.

226
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:46,829
So if I, you know, in an opt out option, if I just ended up going with a default,

227
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:51,659
it's there's this assumption that that's what everyone else is doing.

228
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:59,549
So it should be fine. Everyone else is donating their organs, so it should be up to do they have made that the default option.

229
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:02,880
So it's putting a lot of trust into the choice architects.

230
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:12,419
And again, we might believe whoever designed that question there, choice architect has some sort of expert knowledge.

231
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,170
And again, that default is sort of the best option for you.

232
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,770
And some others might still simply be saving their mental energy or cognitive resources.

233
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:31,590
And it's easier to not change something than it is to change it in terms of making that decision around opting.

234
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:38,300
So October has never gone too far with state legislatures.

235
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:44,389
We know that the average participation rate by individuals under the opt out condition is

236
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:49,310
significantly higher than that of individuals under opt in when it comes to medical donation.

237
00:29:50,420 --> 00:30:00,559
Studies have shown that active choice, when you present both yes and no, is not significantly different from opt out and actually increases donations,

238
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:08,360
suggesting that asking individuals to make an active choice might be more effective in generating organ donor registrations

239
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:17,360
than the active policy because it does allow people to really state their true preferences and in their case,

240
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,320
is perceived as a more ethical option.

241
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:29,809
Enhancing active choice with outcome expectations embedded into the response choice can do much better than just sort of a generic

242
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:43,010
active choice and may be a good alternative in situations where it is unethical to do some sort of active choice or for organ donation,

243
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:57,640
it still doesn't do. Active choice people tend to still default to no, it does do better, but there's still that default to no.

244
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:08,000
So it's not as simple of a choice for everyone in terms of making that decision.

245
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:14,760
It's a very complex decision. But again, opt out.

246
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,910
There are a lot of legal issues with that.

247
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:27,260
So when we you know, our options are really an opt in or active choice and really trying to enhance those with getting people to donate.

248
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:36,510
So in terms of solutions, if you go to the canvas site today and I'm going to have you actually look at this if you want to pull it up,

249
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:49,290
there's a handful of different sort of principles in behavioral economics are examples of approaches to interventions.

250
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:57,060
So there it's under activities and handouts under today's section.

251
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:01,660
So what I in that handout, I really like it. It's split up into judgment,

252
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:09,839
decision making and choice architecture and it has different concepts under each the definition

253
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,190
and explanation of the concept and how you would actually apply it in an intervention.

254
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:20,160
And the example they used throughout is cancer screening thing I like.

255
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,450
I want to share this with you because I want you to think about ways you could potentially apply it.

256
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:33,750
If you're thinking about using behavioral economic principles in your interventions, how might that sort of approach sort of translate to that?

257
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:38,670
And I'll have you refer to this handout when we go through a few more things.

258
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:53,640
So keep that handy. And so because of pricing biased preferences, we tend to prefer the present versus the, you know, think about the future.

259
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:59,370
Individuals are more willing to commit to a future action than they are to a present action.

260
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:07,380
So researchers and practitioners can take advantage of this behavioral part by offering patient choices

261
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:13,920
or participant choices about future behavior before the time that they have to take an action.

262
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:25,890
In terms of framing, using either loss frame or gain frame messaging, taking decision making is better than providing no frame at all.

263
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:37,200
So most messages to patients in a clinical context or participants regarding their health should be framed.

264
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:44,880
Whether it was framed messages or gained free messages will have more of an impact really depends upon the situation.

265
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:51,809
So there's a lot of evidence suggesting that lost framed messages were better to promote

266
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:57,000
detection procedures such as mammograms or sexually transmitted disease screenings.

267
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:05,280
So, for example, the offspring message might be avoiding sexually transmitted disease screening

268
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,440
can cause you to reduce or lose your fertility due to undetected infections.

269
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:18,540
We argue that lost frame messages will also likely be more effective to discourage unnecessary exams and treatment,

270
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:22,230
such as avoiding unnecessary X-rays to reduce radiation.

271
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,469
On the other hand, gain frame messages seem to be more effective in promoting certain preventative behaviors,

272
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:34,320
such as wearing sunscreen, carrying out proper foot care with diabetes or using condoms.

273
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:39,450
So best practices for framing your messages is to decide which framing approach

274
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,650
would work best for the people in the situation that you're working in.

275
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:52,170
Are you going to based on that or are you going to use lost frame or gain frames then trying to get your population to do something?

276
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:59,730
Consider the following. So what will people gain if they do this as a financial, as is social, emotional or physical?

277
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:03,720
Like what is the gain? What is the loss?

278
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,380
Thinking about it financially, socially, emotionally, or physically.

279
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:13,260
And will promoting the gains work better in this situation with these people?

280
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:22,260
Or when highlighting the losses firsthand? And how should I craft the message to actively suggest or promote either gains or losses?

281
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:31,480
I want to frame most of your messages, unless they're primarily in from information or legal, such as, you know,

282
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:39,000
if you're working in a clinical setting or, you know, the summary visit, that doesn't need to be like gain frame or lost frame.

283
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:45,030
If you're really trying to get someone to try to engage in a health promoting behavior,

284
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:50,700
again, some sort of gain frame for loss frame message framing is better than no framing,

285
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:56,120
just providing PR information and to proactively, you know,

286
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:04,350
you want to proactively frame your messages to spark some sort of motivational reaction in the client or population.

287
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,910
So we've talked a lot about social norms already.

288
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:21,459
So again, to me, this is a redundant concept from other sort of theories and principles we talked about in class,

289
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,520
but it also shows up in behavioral economics.

290
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:29,140
So people's actions are influenced by what they perceive others are doing around them.

291
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,870
The more we believe others people are taking a certain action, the more we think that action must be correct,

292
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:38,790
that we can avoid making a mistake by following the same action.

293
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:48,100
So adjusting perceptions of social norms can be a simple and effective way of changing behavior.

294
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:56,979
For example, practitioners can help people with below average physical activity levels,

295
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:02,410
do more exercise by communicating to them that the average levels in the population,

296
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:10,340
a practice could tell their patients how many other patients have signed up as part of an exercise manager.

297
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,160
Sort of post that on their websites.

298
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:20,470
Humans are very influenced by what other people are doing and we can use this fact to really educator assist other patients,

299
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:27,310
especially in a clinical context or trying to encourage help promoting behavior.

300
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:35,530
And it can also be as simple as sharing a story of similar patients who have successfully increased activity.

301
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:44,200
Levels such as in such as the same scenario may seem normative to the client in front of you.

302
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:52,209
So best practices for social norms you want to point out with the majority of people are

303
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:57,940
actually doing correctly or in line with the behavior that you're trying to promote.

304
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:08,650
The more similar you can make the norm comparison to the person or group in question, the more likely people are to copy that behavior.

305
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:25,570
And describing what sort of behaviors are not and not approved are most useful when the majority are not doing something already.

306
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:34,300
So you don't want to be preaching to the choir if that group is already doing a high level of physical activity, say saying to them that,

307
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:43,330
you know, trying to adjust social norms around that does not make a lot of sense or you won't see any sort of change go very far.

308
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:53,860
So you want to make sure that the norm use is really a focus goal of the group and is sort of achieving some sort of sort of meeting some sort of gap.

309
00:38:53,860 --> 00:39:06,380
That's what. So I want to talk about talk about an example of behavioral economics and savings.

310
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:10,179
So there's a handout posted on canvas.

311
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:16,280
So as I was making copies today, I'm the copy machine cost out on me.

312
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,310
So I have a few copies for you, but other things I've got to post.

313
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:29,360
So if you could pull up on today's session, there's a handout there on behavioral economics and savings.

314
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:38,690
So if you can pull that up and I want you to talk with your groups around this question that I posed to you in there.

315
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,560
So if you're like most Americans, you're paid between two and five times a month,

316
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:49,650
but you pay your mortgage payment only about once a month in order to make your on time payment.

317
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:54,170
You have to do careful budgeting of your income and expenses every month and even more

318
00:39:54,170 --> 00:40:00,110
careful budgeting if you plan to pay over the minimum amount that's due for one year.

319
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:08,630
So what would happen if someone budgeted for you by making smaller, more frequent micropayments any time money hits your bank account?

320
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:18,890
Imagine if this person could also instantly identify any discretionary income to allocate to actual loan payments.

321
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:28,550
So this is exactly what this fintech software, that app save is meant to do.

322
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:35,360
And this is a very appealing value proposition. However, everyone with a mortgage is not jumping to sign up.

323
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,500
So this software can save you thousands of dollars on interest.

324
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:45,260
Take over five years off your loan term and build home equity faster.

325
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,620
But not everyone is signing up to take advantage.

326
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,820
So how would you use behavioral economic principles to get market insight?

327
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:02,330
Sounds like a nice thing that's going to save you a lot of money, but not everyone is.

328
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:06,559
So talk in your small groups around this.

329
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,820
How would you use behavioral economic principles and feel free to refer to that.

330
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:23,150
Here note I posted on the different sort of behavioral economic interventions you can employ to support different decision making.

331
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:38,210
As to how this could actually save you money because it's like you need life savings.

332
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:43,570
You have to like taking extra money that you have in your view.

333
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:59,720
The classic example is to retire from the country automatically so you can decide between how you get because I'm not sure.

334
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,820
I think they say this address is built on the Pacific,

335
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:15,610
but this one is one of the ways that a good example of that is two things that I would say to myself.

336
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:21,850
But I was also taking account on that there are no taxes handling distribution taxes.

337
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,970
That's all. That's probably one thing.

338
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:36,370
I would also require doing something and try to download the software and set it up, which is time and people hate doing anything.

339
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:46,450
So it's very important. I wouldn't say would be opt out and you'll never get any government making money off spending more money.

340
00:42:46,950 --> 00:43:00,790
It's gonna be about what, what they get out of it and they probably actually take your credit report very straight.

341
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:08,100
You guys are like there is something our businesses have been just like you're you know,

342
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:18,669
you're concerned about the last part of it so so you can say, hey, hey, you, $2 now to save yourself this kind of future discount.

343
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:32,000
And I think money you guys have figured it out for people worse than the answer they would hire us is that

344
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:41,070
your payment direct deposit versus when I get my checks from the state could hit them with the social norm.

345
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:52,620
All your neighbors are saving money on things that we can't explain to you.

346
00:43:52,630 --> 00:44:01,840
Meet all of our questions.

347
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:10,720
So here's a sample explaining what the actual things.

348
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:25,780
I mean, like I say, actually, like you telling me.

349
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:41,160
So I use my paycheck and I think sometimes I wish it was like, I mean, I'm like I'm like, wow.

350
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:46,260
I'm like trying to figure out how you could count living here.

351
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:54,640
So it doesn't matter. It just doesn't sound like you're doing that.

352
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:59,950
It's kind of like I'm going through it.

353
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:05,720
Yeah, I don't.

354
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:10,449
I don't know what I'm going to get. I'd see that.

355
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:36,310
You know, I was just thinking that at times over the last five or of years.

356
00:45:45,490 --> 00:46:02,889
So I would imagine, like, I'm trying to remember it now.

357
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:16,360
So I'll be sitting here every time, something on somebody else.

358
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:26,020
I say to myself, what percent of the total retirement homes in my city has somebody?

359
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:31,380
Yes. That's how they got around.

360
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:46,870
When they got to thinking, how do you get more people so they will have more money and then you need the software that you see.

361
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:55,770
I mean, the values of insurance over five years of policies for think a nice thing how do you get people to come.

362
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,700
It was never launched. It's. Yeah.

363
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:12,540
Well, in addition to like game framing for the future in terms of like how you can gain that five years and save the money to

364
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:21,869
address the like the present need for like an incentive or motivation to do something now instead of later offering.

365
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:27,269
Like if this program costs any money to waive that fee for the first month or however long,

366
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:34,950
or to match a certain percentage of what you put in to offer people that motivation to join now and then,

367
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:42,450
if they see the gains through the whole game, framing, marketing that we're doing that they'll stay involved.

368
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:52,710
Okay. So maybe try to shape their shape their behavior, but really shaping their thinking to stick with it by providing an incentive.

369
00:47:53,700 --> 00:48:00,899
Okay. We were talking about loss framing and how like like secure your home.

370
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:05,430
Now you don't know what could happen. Don't want to lose anything.

371
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:11,120
Okay. So a little bit of a scare tactic in there.

372
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:18,290
Like, what will you lose and making that sound pretty bad to get them to sign up.

373
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:27,740
So really emphasizing the loss here. What else did you come up?

374
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:42,230
Yeah. Just like making that choice architecture really easy for people when they work with their bank to, like, craft their mortgage or whatever.

375
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:49,040
Just having a baby be an opt in or opt out and have it explained to them might be a little more.

376
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:56,320
Like come from a more credible source than if they just, like discover this company on the Internet or something.

377
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:06,339
Okay, so I'm utilizing the bank as the choice architect might very much assist with that information

378
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:13,270
because that choice architect has presumably a lot of credibility in the bank giving the mortgage.

379
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:17,740
So you said I didn't opt out. And then there's also active choice.

380
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:21,870
What would you use here? All of those are viable options.

381
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:25,960
Actually don't know the difference. What is the difference? So. So opt in.

382
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:29,200
You have to say I am going to sign up for this.

383
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:32,950
Opt out is they've already been signed up.

384
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:40,600
This is going to be automatic for them. And you have to actually do the extra work to tell them, I don't want to do this.

385
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:44,290
And then active choice, do you want to do this or not?

386
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:47,830
So presenting both options, I would say opt in.

387
00:49:49,020 --> 00:50:00,509
Okay. So it just seems right because I think if the bank backs, it's like that kind of shows if they're backing it,

388
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:07,110
it kind of shows like obviously like the credibility thing again and you tend to trust like your mortgage lender.

389
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:12,690
So, you know, if they're kind of presenting it as an option, you know, just so you know,

390
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:17,550
you know, you can save money in the future on your interest payments. It's easier to just say yes or no, you know?

391
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,239
Yes, I, I don't know.

392
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:28,290
I don't know how it's different, Mac, of choice, though. So given that presumed credibility of the lender,

393
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:38,920
what about off down where people might assume in their mind this person knows what they're talking about, they're giving me the mortgage.

394
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:42,450
So I'm going on with this this choice.

395
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:49,200
Yeah. I feel like with opt out, I mean, I do think that's a better way to get more people to sign up.

396
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:54,600
But I think that especially here in America, people are very like, Why did you take my money?

397
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:59,140
So I don't think people I think it would backfire. Okay.

398
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:06,390
So, you know, maybe in a perfect world, maybe Gen Z will do it, but not in this capitalist structure we currently live in.

399
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,370
I think the people get really mad that money was being taken out of there, eventually going to save people.

400
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,249
It's still kind of like organ donation.

401
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:24,570
It's just too much, too complicated, maybe. Yeah, we get complicated with like financials being different, but everyone's like,

402
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:32,889
try to just cut your salary or you work like full time, same amount of hours or your paycheck is the same every two weeks.

403
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:37,140
And it's easy for you to know how come you're running from that.

404
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:45,639
But when you're like part time or you work your hours like change, and so therefore your change changes week to week that like, I don't know,

405
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,160
maybe this is like amazing algorithm,

406
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:56,610
but it gets a little bit more difficult and makes it more difficult for people to offer like paycheck to paycheck or that way.

407
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:02,680
Yeah. So there are quite a few people whose income just fluctuates.

408
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:12,290
And in those situations it's just. Perhaps these concepts don't work in getting that group engaged with this subject.

409
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,340
I would want to understand why why it works.

410
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:20,520
Because it sounds like a business, and so a business has to make money.

411
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:30,510
How are they making money from doing this? Because if they're investing in stocks, that feels way too uncomfortable given like, you know, like 2008.

412
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:36,060
Wasn't that it was it wasn't that long ago. But like it's just like how does it benefit them?

413
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:43,229
And like, I think that transparency with that, I think like breaking with banks would be better because banks have like a security thing,

414
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:46,290
like they have like federal government backing.

415
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,910
But an app with just a business I don't really know.

416
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:58,110
Feels more shaky. So it seems like it's still a little complicated.

417
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:04,480
Like what this is doing is basically. Doing something you couldn't do on your own.

418
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:13,030
Probably like making small payments towards your principal on your mortgage to make it go down,

419
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:19,730
versus just often when you get a mortgage for a house or a property, you're paying a lot.

420
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:25,840
Most of it is interest for much of the beginning part of the payments.

421
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:30,909
So this is something you could probably do on your own without the software,

422
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:37,930
but this is sort of you putting small like if you have five extra dollars of it on your bills,

423
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:43,390
it's just putting that $5 on your mortgage and your principal payment.

424
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:54,680
But I think the point you're raising is that seems complicated and perhaps it requires a little more information around how that works.

425
00:53:54,700 --> 00:54:03,190
Or is it just signing people up in terms of how you actually pay one piece on the mortgage over time and the balance of principal interest?

426
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:11,400
And we also talked about preventing how many people have already signed up for it.

427
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:19,320
But we all, I think, or I assumed that this is not something that's beneficial to a bank, because it means the bank will,

428
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:24,960
in the long term, take less money off of you because you're paying off your mortgage faster.

429
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:29,730
And so we were also like, oh, like thinking about like, well,

430
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:36,370
we don't really know how they're advertising in general and like who it would be coming through.

431
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:41,750
But like, assuming it's like you have to show up on Instagram or something and it's like save money,

432
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:49,320
then you can also talk about like, you know, thousands of people in your area have signed up for this and it's working for them.

433
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:53,940
Okay. So really trying to play off of social norms.

434
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:06,150
So let me post something and I want you to read it.

435
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,910
So I have a solution for this.

436
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:40,180
What can I do beforehand to figure it out?

437
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:14,540
First. Okay.

438
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:19,200
Go ahead. And it's a pretty sure read. Go ahead and read this.

439
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,260
One really weird trick can help people grow their savings.

440
00:57:12,300 --> 00:58:31,800
Yeah. Yeah. She?

441
00:59:23,400 --> 01:00:19,760
We were so right. Not.

442
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:32,220
She? Look.

443
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:59,170
So what are your reactions to this? You were very close.

444
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:08,570
You guys suggested a lost spring message behind the mentions of whether it's a.

445
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:35,110
Did you expect this? I mean, they just frame the message as earning and enrollment went up by almost 60%.

446
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:54,990
Reactions. I felt a little called out.

447
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:58,769
I definitely pick up more hours instead of cutting down on my spending.

448
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:02,020
So I was like, well. That's me.

449
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:18,180
Do you think most people think this way in terms of earning versus saving?

450
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:44,300
So I want to briefly talk about Nigerians,

451
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:55,180
over a dozen countries that have integrated all these sort of behavioral insights into their operations and governments.

452
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:04,430
So, again, this is a tool that behavioral economics and several the principles around that to help people make.

453
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:16,830
I guess optimal decisions in terms of what others want them to do is has a lot of relevance in public policy.

454
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:30,190
So the United Kingdom has a behavioral insights unit that thinks about different forms of nudging in policy and government efforts.

455
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:36,520
The United States established a social and behavioral science team a while back.

456
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:40,719
It's not it hasn't been active for like two presidential administrations.

457
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:47,530
But at one point they did think about a team to think about nudging within the US government.

458
01:03:50,010 --> 01:04:00,960
Their purpose is really to implement work with implementing agencies to really diagnose, test and evaluate behaviorally informed interventions.

459
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:07,260
There are there are concerns with not units, especially in the public policy sphere.

460
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:11,400
You know, there are concerns around is this manipulation?

461
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,530
Is this paternalism?

462
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:24,660
Does it really remove choice people making an active decision around what they want to do related to any sort of behavioral change?

463
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:29,910
Maybe people don't want to save money. Do we have to force people to do that?

464
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:36,930
Yes, in some. So I think it does like these sorts of interventions.

465
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:42,390
And in terms of health behavior or social behavior in general,

466
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:49,470
that does raise these very valid concerns around manipulation, paternalism, removal and choice emergency.

467
01:04:49,800 --> 01:05:00,930
So we have to really think about and I posted these slides and if you are interested in this more, feel free to take a look at these two links.

468
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:11,520
They includes a lot of examples around using behavioral economics globally and across different sort of policy sectors.

469
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:15,240
So if this is interesting to you. Feel free to take a look at this.

470
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:23,670
Nigerian policy has been used in so many different areas.

471
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:28,820
Obviously in health and wellbeing it's used quite a bit eating behavior.

472
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:35,010
So my first line of that cartoon choice architecture, grocery stores use this all the time.

473
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:40,590
If you walk into some grocery stores now.

474
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:51,830
Or even cafeterias in schools. Just take a look at how food is placed and what kind of food is placed where.

475
01:05:52,550 --> 01:06:01,670
That's all choice architecture. It's obviously from this example used in savings and financial decisions tax compliance,

476
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:10,490
education, energy, employment, voting behavior, charitable giving, and law abiding behavior.

477
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:17,719
Speaking of voting. Yesterday was a big day for voting.

478
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:21,170
And, you know, when we think about voting behavior and voter turnout,

479
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:30,050
how do we get people to show up to the polls and participate in it in our democracy?

480
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:39,410
That's that's a critical issue that affects not only homes, but in so many other spheres and our well-being.

481
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:48,000
And it's not an issue just solely to the U.S. It's something that is a global issue.

482
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:55,310
How do we get people to vote when voting is available to them and showing up to do that?

483
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:05,660
So, you know, if you think about behavioral economic principles in getting folks to show up at the polls to vote,

484
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:13,640
and you take a look at that handout, what are some of the types of things we might do to get people to show up?

485
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:24,500
We just brainstorm as a class like, are these principles even relevant to this issue and what might be important?

486
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:31,790
Yes, the handouts stickers that you can see like all everyone else is voting today.

487
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:40,130
Okay. So yeah, we show up to class HB 8600 and you see that everyone has that voting sticker.

488
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:45,950
So, you know, that's the whole ventilation problems sort of problems.

489
01:07:45,950 --> 01:07:53,930
People, whether that's your workplace or school, the voting system, my project, the social norm that everyone is voting.

490
01:07:54,470 --> 01:08:01,010
So there's a lot of research about if you basically ask people two questions, how are you going to go and when are you going to go?

491
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:06,440
It forces them to think about it and it essentially makes it into a like a commitment device.

492
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:10,430
And that's been statistically proven to be very, very effective.

493
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:19,790
So turning it into a commitment device, so you have the whole day to do it, how are you going to actually plan around that versus I need to vote?

494
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:23,360
And it seems like this random thing I need to do in my day.

495
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,050
I think it helps that with this election specifically.

496
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:36,160
Concerns about voting began way before the month of November.

497
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:42,200
And because I think that plays a big role is like how long you keep hearing about voting?

498
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:48,490
Granted, it can be like tiresome, but it's still like, oh, people are still talking about it, so it's still important.

499
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:57,930
Okay. So, um, repetitive messaging. So I guess going back to some of the stuff we talked about last week, you know,

500
01:08:57,970 --> 01:09:07,030
you keep saying the message over and over somehow gets into people's head and becomes this not like this is what everyone's talking about,

501
01:09:07,030 --> 01:09:11,590
this is what everyone is doing. So it must be something I need to do when Tuesday comes.

502
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:22,450
I think also in this election specifically, there was a lot of weight loss aversion that was employed specifically I think surrounding Proposal three,

503
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:29,110
which was about whether you can maintain your robes or if you're going to lose rights, which I mean, after Roe, it was lost anyway.

504
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:36,670
But I think that there's just a lot of framing now about like you vote for this person to avoid losing your right to do this.

505
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:44,600
So on that specific issue and many other things, there was a lot of loss aversion messaging.

506
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:56,180
Did we hear any game framed messages? Certainly. I think the game, which is a little sad, but it seems like we were really protecting our losses.

507
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:02,060
Can you think of a game message? Well, in Michigan, we gain the.

508
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:07,260
State constitutional amendment that wasn't there before.

509
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:18,250
Right. And I think proposal to this kind of game frame, but it was definitely less advertised.

510
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:23,390
That was one about like expanding access to voting and especially for like those in the military.

511
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:30,950
So that was a bit more of a game for message. But I didn't really I don't know, I didn't have as much exposure to that one.

512
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:34,640
Like Prop three, I kind of think overshadowed the other two.

513
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:45,190
Him. I was just going to say, even sometimes you have a framing with who you are voting for in terms of it's like if you take your right to vote,

514
01:10:45,190 --> 01:10:49,540
then the person that you want to be elected,

515
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:58,690
you're going to gain from that piece that's you're gaining from your action by voting for the person that you want to be representing you.

516
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:04,930
So really putting you have something to gain by.

517
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:17,330
Supporting a person to get elected. You know, these sorts of things might be employed to get people to the polls.

518
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,520
He's. Yes.

519
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:33,330
I want him to play monetary incentives to get through that experience and to pay for your gas to drive you there or.

520
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:41,760
I think that's a real I mean, people taking time out of their day. And for some folks, it's not a quick thing.

521
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:48,730
It can be quite a bit of time. So, you know, do incentives here.

522
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:52,099
Yeah. So she said,

523
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:59,059
my sister lives in Washington and she's been out there like they just nail everyone to like they don't even you don't like often to getting

524
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:06,000
email and they just give everyone wasn't really I don't know what w without calling her but it's computers making it easy for everyone to have.

525
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:11,570
Yeah. Yeah. So convenience making it easier shows up in your mailbox.

526
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:17,149
One thing I struggled with personally was many things, so to speak, like,

527
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:25,620
sounds like I don't know which part is real here, which is a sad thing we're sort of dealing with these days, right?

528
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:28,990
You're absolutely right. Making it very convenient to.

529
01:12:31,370 --> 01:12:37,760
So what I would do is I'm going to leave you guys with an article around.

530
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:42,380
This is sort of based in a European context.

531
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:52,970
They struggle with getting folks to the polls and it walks through several examples, um, several of which you name,

532
01:12:52,970 --> 01:13:00,200
but a couple others that were interesting but didn't come up like utilize behavioral economic principles.

533
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:11,329
So it's a very short article that I want you to take with you and sort of digest as you process

534
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:16,160
everything we talked about today and think about these context in terms of voting behavior.

535
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:24,379
So that's all I have. Do you guys have any questions or any sort of reactions to behavioral economics

536
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:29,240
and using it as an intervention using these principles as intervention tools?

537
01:13:30,230 --> 01:13:41,270
Is anything funny about it or so just these choices and any discomfort with it?

538
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:57,340
Yeah, I one of the cultural concepts of the American experience as a product of like the why a lot of people think, well,

539
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:06,950
getting another job, earning it like earning an opportunity as compared to like, say, that's not like a part of that propaganda.

540
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:11,990
It's like, Oh, you can do that. You can, you could work for me or not.

541
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:18,260
You might have to resist that. There are restrictions or whatever, you know.

542
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:30,770
So I think that definitely I think so when we define behavioral economics being defined as using, you know,

543
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:41,000
psychological realism and the traditional principles of economics, I think what you're bringing in is that's not necessary.

544
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:45,500
What you're bringing in is not necessarily psychological, really think it's a cultural phenomenon.

545
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:53,719
So how does that range of behavioral economics? And I think I think it would be interesting to see like in the article,

546
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:58,610
they said they saw this same effect in an African country that they used as an

547
01:14:58,610 --> 01:15:03,469
example for crowds of people that are converging across different countries

548
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:08,180
and just looked at the magnitude of what does that cultural phenomenon play

549
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:12,079
into and you sort of have differences in magnitude going to be interesting.

550
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:21,150
So again. Numerous the observe reactions.

551
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:27,940
Yes. This is a little bit of a side but about voting.

552
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:34,630
Do you know if the university has ever considered, like Constance for the entire school on Election Day?

553
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:41,170
Because like the law school advisor and like who knows how much of an impact that has on like voter turnout.

554
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:44,950
But yeah, like, you know, that's one thing that the school never considered.

555
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:55,700
It's a great question. I think what the school does is encourage boating and encourage instructors to be flexible around that.

556
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:59,390
But then you also tell instructors to pull your classes.

557
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:08,870
So it's a weird dance. It's something we've grappled with with snow days, the history of the university as well.

558
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:13,070
Some of us. Some people wanted classes canceled.

559
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:20,240
Others don't. So I think what ends up playing in there is flexibility.

560
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:29,400
But that doesn't necessarily I think what you may be getting at is it doesn't send the message that you're we want you to go and,

561
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:34,160
you know, exercise your significant enjoyment.

562
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:42,880
But it's something I can continue to bring up. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

563
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:47,510
Yeah. Oh, excuse.

564
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:53,790
Okay. So I'll leave you with that.

565
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:58,200
Have a great weekend. Do you have a theory assessment on Friday?

566
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:03,690
Again, I'll see you next weekend.

567
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:12,550
Yeah, I know.

568
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:36,060
But I don't know. I don't think I would want to play aluminum.

569
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:41,860
Yeah, we know about this with their. Yes.

570
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:47,900
Yeah. Every 30 seconds, which it hasn't.

571
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:58,170
But she doesn't like to get out there.

572
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:04,110
We have fun on your trip so many times.

573
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:15,110
You know, I do it when things can go wrong.

574
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:25,550
Just like a sweep. That one. I think it was just announced that.

575
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:34,390
I'd like to hear you.

576
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:48,620
So just like when you're asking those questions, the way you run lecture in high school,

577
01:18:49,370 --> 01:19:02,580
which is an interesting way to do it because somebody had to say it's not right.

578
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:12,860
But I think the project job, because there were some things I was like, Oh, I need to talk about these people.

579
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:29,270
Oh, I see. I was like 20 minutes to start and then.

580
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:41,210
Yeah, I know, I know.

581
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:53,760
I think it's. I didn't like it down by the.

582
01:19:55,220 --> 01:20:07,540
Oh, but you also just do what I wanted to borrow so you know, my boyfriend or something.

583
01:20:09,650 --> 01:20:16,180
I don't because I have to.

584
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:32,270
Because I don't think you have to each other because it sounds strange for these projects,

585
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:37,950
you know, it's just like so it hasn't really come out and he can't come.

586
01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:47,990
I don't think it's just like we're going to we're going to need evidence if you want to just be another time, you know?

587
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:57,620
Okay. Yeah, I that now or I guess that's all sides.

588
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:04,909
Most definitely. That's how, you know, I just wanted to like to follow.

589
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:14,590
I do like I have found someone else to happen here, but it's not, you know,

590
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:22,370
like that's I think the core difference is like I'm I would argue that it's not going to be like, okay, because it's like it's a it's a sphere.

591
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:28,240
Okay. So everything I know.

592
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:33,260
But it definitely is. Obviously, it's definitely a lot simpler than it was before.

593
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:34,840
It's actually.

594
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:48,140
Yeah, but like hearing it from everything there, I can give you research like every area that has a research backing and I think that's stuff you got.

595
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:58,219
It's so complicated of an issue that it would be it would be like literally morally wrong to take more stuff out at the back end.

596
01:21:58,220 --> 01:22:04,310
And I think that's like just at least in my opinion, because I'm also taking the class right now.

597
01:22:04,490 --> 01:22:09,770
I'm like really immersed in the literature. Like I see it as like we don't want to.

598
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:16,340
We definitely you are definitely right. And it was awful. I think it was too complicated when it started.

599
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:21,930
So I think. Not as strong as it could have been.

600
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:29,640
It was very confusing to have everything over, and I believe that that was like a big step forward.

601
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,920
The question is, like, Mike, as you're saying, where do you where do we go from here?

602
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:37,710
Yeah, yeah. Right, right. Because it's like. No, we appreciate your expertise.

603
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:41,069
Yes. Look, I'm sorry. You know, it's really that late.

604
01:22:41,070 --> 01:22:44,430
Cassie has a class after this and she had worked it.

605
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:47,910
So I think it's hard to get all four of us together.

606
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:51,390
Yeah. So, yeah, it's just. Yeah, we don't want to do it ever again.

607
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:55,320
I get you. Okay. All right. Well, thank you. Thank you.

608
01:22:55,380 --> 01:23:05,250
I take it that you think that is possible, that, you know, think because I mean,

609
01:23:05,610 --> 01:23:15,390
I think someone just decides not to say, okay, we were just struggling.

610
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:19,769
Um, we had a couple questions with our even one, okay.

611
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:28,440
One about our model and one about our interpretation. So with our general psychological, you know, sexual crash of an HIV aids, trans woman of color.

612
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:37,020
So we know this is very busy and we don't know how to incorporate like not systemic issues like racism and transphobia,

613
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:39,390
because that permeates like every single box.

614
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:47,220
So we just don't really know how to because one of the feedback was like and like this feels separate and things that are just like went on,

615
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:52,920
but we weren't sure how little training or and it feels like it's been really on that.

616
01:23:52,980 --> 01:24:02,310
I feel really uncomfortable like so like on that. Like, I don't think I say this with the caveat that I have not only got no worries,

617
01:24:02,850 --> 01:24:09,030
but something are you could bring that I've been able to help you get busy say like for example,

618
01:24:09,030 --> 01:24:16,110
like this is like this is and I'm never going to be at work on it, but I wouldn't do anything.

619
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:20,670
I wasn't really around to help with this right now.

620
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:25,110
So really. So a lot of what can we do for like organize it?

621
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:28,910
It may not be. And we all agree that, oh, what's next?

622
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:35,579
Or worse, right? But like they may have overlapping here, like if they're, you know,

623
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:40,800
it's not that we want to have someone like feeling like the subject of their writing.

624
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:44,219
So it may be once like what?

625
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:48,180
How can we be organized in a way like, okay, you're societal.

626
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:53,280
I think that's helpful because the listen, I don't want to be.

627
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:59,290
Yeah, but like your mind, like the backdrop is kind of like it's just those colors, I think.
