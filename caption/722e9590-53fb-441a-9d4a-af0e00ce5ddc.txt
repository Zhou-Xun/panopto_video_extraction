1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:07,890
I'm in high school. Just so you guys know, in case anybody interacts with high schoolers, they're like,

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:14,510
had to cancel some, you know, events and stuff evidently over the weekend.

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,050
So evidently not COVID just like random.

4
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,530
The flu is going to be fun this year.

5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:28,740
Oh, they can. Like, we don't need it. It's your flu shot.

6
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,620
I don't know if it's advisable to get flu shots and boosters at the same time.

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,860
I'm kind of feeling like a little bit since I had COVID sort of recently, I'm like, okay, I can push the booster, can't push the flu shot.

8
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:49,709
It's like a lot of a little too much calculus. All right.

9
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,980
Let me just get in for 1/2 here.

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,740
A lot of things going. All right.

11
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:03,450
So I'm I'm like midway and more than midway through the papers, through your guys papers.

12
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,919
And then I was trying to get a quick peek through like the read in response this morning,

13
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,749
just so I can get a sense of kind of what people are thinking about that I kind of I

14
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,860
really liked this report because I felt like it just sort of like laid out again,

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,780
really clearly. Here are some, you know, concrete things to consider.

16
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,680
And as with all things, child trends,

17
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:34,680
I'll just say like it's a it's a helpful thing to have in your back pocket in case you want to know something about,

18
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,820
you know, child needs, parenting, family stuff in this space.

19
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,139
So I think this is a really good report like thinking through, you know,

20
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,330
if you guys are in a public health setting of some type and there's like a decision

21
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:55,139
to be made about programing or whatnot around coordinating of services of early

22
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,500
childhood care and education like these are some things to think through that could

23
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,770
be really helpful in decision making and in terms of justifying decision making,

24
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,870
because I know we have to do that all the time. Right. And public health, we have limited resources, limited resources everywhere.

25
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:13,469
But public health gets called out a lot for having limited resources.

26
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:21,810
And so this type of piece can sort of say like, actually, these things are really important and without considering like linking services, etc.,

27
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:31,320
kids are really going to fall through the cracks just about in early intervention and also kind of different

28
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,100
like I want to get you guys a little bit in the mindset of thinking about intervention like levels,

29
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,220
modalities for just musing on paper.

30
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:46,650
I also do a little bit of follow up from our last class about environmental health stuff,

31
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,440
and then we'll talk more about intervention settings and access.

32
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,870
And again, this is kind of like feel like it's like super practical because you can think about ways

33
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,220
to just sort of make intervention settings better or more child and family friendly.

34
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,710
And it may not take that much, but sort of thinking through some of the ways you can tweak it a little bit.

35
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,370
And then I gave the readings that I gave it really about this sort of like teamwork, what that can look like.

36
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:21,420
And then what happened in COVID. And an example, this mom power intervention is one that I've mentioned before.

37
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,309
And what I like about this article, again, it's like pretty straightforward.

38
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,240
And also for those of you who are in the business of writing up interventions,

39
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,489
this kind of goes through all kind of the key elements one would need to sort of cover.

40
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:40,590
And I think it's nice, it's a nice brief article that sort of is a good go to of like, Oh,

41
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,479
here's something to add some information to take away about how this intervention works.

42
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:54,719
And that's nuts and bolts. Okay. So flipping back a little bit to last time and thinking about environmental studies,

43
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,740
I know I said like, it'll keep you up at night and like these are all these kinds of things.

44
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:07,559
So like if you look at these sources of exposure to toxicants, there's a lot of them.

45
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,220
We're exposed to all of them. Some of them are very hard to avoid.

46
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:19,920
And so I think that this can be kind of a challenging message for us as like public health educators and people who are working

47
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:28,229
with the public and saying avoid everything is just really not super appealing or helpful or practical or like to happen.

48
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:32,969
So I think another way to think about it is both from that same paper.

49
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:39,210
But you know, here's some ideas again, like this is still very, you know,

50
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:45,959
public health professionals are often accused of being like the, you know, the nanny state and that kind of thing.

51
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,900
Right. So like we're telling people what to do, right, with people like that.

52
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:58,469
But these are some ideas around either bigger picture, things like improving labeling, figuring out where you can spray these things.

53
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,459
Like it's not that you can't do it because we know that in order to like feed the planet,

54
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:11,130
we need to do some alteration to how things grow typically, for example, but we can think about where we do those things.

55
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:21,690
That's where they're most harmful. So I think that I'd like her kind of reframing of some of these messages because really we can't avoid everything.

56
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:27,149
Like we would be really, really sort of nonfunctional as people.

57
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,280
I think we really avoided everything.

58
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:40,230
But so you can see there's a lot of room for sort of public health expertize and messaging around those prevention strategies versus only avoid.

59
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,710
And just in general, thinking about in this kind of goes from lots of all these messages for a lot of.

60
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,670
Things, but the public health implications again of environmental health, following up from last time,

61
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,069
thinking about kids, is that like really we can't control their environments.

62
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:01,149
We have to rely on policy regulations for environmental health.

63
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:08,139
Like there's just no way around that we can do interventions with, you know, individuals, with families, and I do do a lot of that.

64
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,920
But we really have to think, well, let's see regulations.

65
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,659
But in order to do that effectively,

66
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:21,010
we have to understand how they kind of trickle down and can impact all those different contexts and children that children families exist in.

67
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,780
And the other thing, and of course,

68
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:28,540
this comes up also in the reading response and the COVID and just sort of all the different systems that children and families are in.

69
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,210
Not all of these systems and settings talk to each other.

70
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:41,049
And I like to use the example of I mentioned this the other day, but sometimes these policies can conflict for thinking about child health and safety.

71
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:49,270
So things like using toxic cleaning products that are really effective in daycares where children are like,

72
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:53,709
do you do it at night when children are there or do you do it in the morning just before they come in?

73
00:06:53,710 --> 00:07:00,940
So there are these sort of like small policy decisions that can be made, that can be made in the direction of benefiting children.

74
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,649
And I think generally also we just need to think about a harm reduction approach.

75
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:10,660
And so we can't do everything that will forever protect children against any environmental exposures.

76
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:17,139
Like that's not practical. But we also need to think about who is most impacted.

77
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:23,740
And of course, there's disproportionality by race, by income in terms of who's impacted by these pieces.

78
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:33,399
And these are just some examples. So like the house cleaning product that mentioned seeing if there's a way we can cut down on disposable plastics,

79
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,900
that daycare or at other events, you know, lots of different events.

80
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,520
But at the same time, like what are our alternatives and how are we going to organize that?

81
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:51,760
Disposable diapers, clearly daycare. You know, some daycares require parents to bring in their own diapers.

82
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:59,950
Some daycares provide diapers, but they're all using disposable diapers for the most part.

83
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:06,910
I'm sure there are some that are not, but I think that's like we'll get to sort of the pay and the labor and the burden on daycare providers later.

84
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:13,960
And I think disposable diapers kind of lessen that burden. And flame retardant beaches is another thing I have to note just because, again, like,

85
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:21,100
we don't want PJs that kids are sleeping in to be, you know, bursting into flames.

86
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:26,320
But we also want to think about what we're putting on those materials so that they don't burst into flames.

87
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,440
So it's all that sort of balance just to finish up the environmental health.

88
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:38,560
We'll talk about it more. But one person is doing an environmental health oriented.

89
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:51,040
Talk about early intervention from the mini lecture, from the readings.

90
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:59,680
Did people have questions around assessments? Certainly dovetail with dovetails with like who sort of is assessed,

91
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:09,580
who is receiving services with that reading around building systems or any questions around the components of early intervention?

92
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:16,120
I'll talk more about it, but it had questions or observations about that that we like.

93
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:28,830
Odd different. New unfamiliar. Kind of a regulatory.

94
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:39,360
Because there's a lot of detail in the assessment and then there's a lot of sort of deep

95
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,850
understanding of development that's needed in order to kind of best serve families.

96
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:59,430
I think in the in lecture, yeah, I talked about assessment in sort of more detail than you guys in all likelihood would be doing.

97
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:05,770
But I think the takeaway around all of those like assessment details is like, it's complicated, right?

98
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,060
Like, remember the babies movie? Everybody got these different exposures.

99
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:17,910
Some people in their comments were really reflecting on like how these different child rearing practices could impact over the long term.

100
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,340
And that's really relevant for these types of things.

101
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:26,190
Assessment and deciding like what kind of services work for a family, because it's very nuanced, right?

102
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,690
These developmental assessments are very nuanced. We're thinking about all these different domains of child development,

103
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,670
and then we have to apply them to a family context that may have different you know,

104
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,270
that will have different varied cultural child rearing expectations and practices.

105
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,780
So I think those two things are important to think about together.

106
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:53,159
The other thing I just want to always call out is Washtenaw County has success by six,

107
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,710
which is sort of a group of linked programs that deal with the in a six year old timeframe.

108
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:12,690
And then early on is that's that's the thing that yeah the name that it goes by in most states and their logo,

109
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,870
their tagline is don't worry but don't wait. Right.

110
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,250
So it's always better to kind of reach out and see if you can get an assessment,

111
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:25,560
if you have a concern in a given area, as I think I noted in the mini lecture.

112
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:31,810
Most of these things are around communication. Some developmental delay like motor dinette.

113
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:36,479
Motor delay can be really a clear space where parents notice like, oh, you know,

114
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:43,410
or more likely often someone in the parent's environment says, Oh, your child's not walking, and it might be the parent's first child.

115
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,760
And they haven't hung out with that many babies.

116
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:51,000
And they don't really notice that that child isn't walking when the child should be expected to be walking.

117
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:56,549
And so I think that's why, again, thinking about that connection of systems, it's really critical.

118
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:02,700
And kids who didn't, who are connected across systems can fall through the cracks and not get services.

119
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,070
And we know that early services are better.

120
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:12,720
So rapidly. Um.

121
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,820
Anything else on the developmental delay lecture piece?

122
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,860
Um. What do people think about the state differences?

123
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:29,370
Differences by state in terms of receiving services or eligibility for services?

124
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:35,540
Or people surprised by differences across state? Yeah. Think one of the things I was just thinking about.

125
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:43,610
I'm from Michigan to a different state that had less restrictive care.

126
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:49,590
So it's like more that child than like originate from having a lot of supportive care for early intervention into

127
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:55,189
another state where they're like don't qualify for it and how like that impacts their their development as well.

128
00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:06,970
So I think like. But that's what happens actually a lot.

129
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:07,290
Right.

130
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:14,680
So when people move their service eligibility changes and so I don't know if people have had the experience of like are hearing about people or having

131
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:23,919
their own experience that like living in one county versus another county can really make a difference for the services you kind of qualify statewide,

132
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:31,990
but what services are available in people, it's really kind of helps to see that child outcomes, right?

133
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,080
Those early outcomes. And what we're talking here about in early on, it's like really the core skills, motor development,

134
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:46,450
communication skills, all of those things that set you up for success in those early preschool environments and on.

135
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,740
Oh yeah. I think that's a that's an important issue.

136
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,980
That's kind of why I present the state differences, because they're pretty stark.

137
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:03,399
And then when we kind of layer on access and like training, this kind of assessment, I mean,

138
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,500
like you can see they're trying to get them to like grab the bell, ring the bell, follow commands.

139
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:14,229
We know all those things are merging at this time. And so we see a lot of variability.

140
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:19,809
That's normal developmental variability and figuring out those sort of, you know, your past,

141
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:27,760
the gray area where something might just be like extreme developmental variability, understanding what sort of signaling or message is really.

142
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:35,360
That takes a lot of years and training, and not every state or county has those people who know how to do that.

143
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:42,350
Again, Michigan is a place where we have a lot of people, but they're equally distributed across the state.

144
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,230
Okay. So let me talk a little bit about the transition.

145
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:56,479
So in the mini lecture, I was talking a lot about this, you know, early on and family based care.

146
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:10,640
So when you're little, when you're 0 to 3, it's appropriate and it is mandated that you receive care like in your family context.

147
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,259
Totally makes sense to everybody in here. That's where our little kids are hanging out.

148
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:20,930
You know, even if they're in daycare, where they're receiving any kind of intervention services is in the family setting.

149
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,200
But then what happens? And last time we talked about preschool transition or a few times ago,

150
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:33,379
you move from this individualized family service plan to the individualized education plan.

151
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:42,260
And that's like a big signal to say, like it's becoming a school based plan versus a family based plan and not versus in a negative way.

152
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,500
But that's an important distinction because it's a really different context.

153
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:55,700
And we can all imagine some differences across settings, from family based to school based.

154
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:03,320
Even if it's like the most loved school in the world. There's still more kids in a preschool, right, than in a family setting, typically.

155
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,540
What other what what kinds of things do you think that that might kind of.

156
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:16,540
But, you know, experience in the transition to this.

157
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:36,140
Yes. And you know, some families like. And so also like in this context,

158
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:43,129
if the child is supposed to be receiving services and they maybe aren't at their best because of those things, it's sort of again,

159
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:50,300
like layering on like the preschool separation process is on to whatever other

160
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,990
things the child may be working on in their individualized education plan.

161
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:04,610
So speech therapy, motor development type things, social communication type therapies that might be delivered in a home and in a school setting.

162
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,750
Anything else? Other thoughts that might be different? Yeah.

163
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,880
It's like they're probably getting that one on one attention.

164
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,040
Like maybe those small changes, a one on one session you'd be able to notice and be like, Oh.

165
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:35,920
But it's not really a delay that this sort of well. I wonder like also thinking about access and like other.

166
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,240
Everybody has a one on one aid situation in a school setting.

167
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:53,590
So that is a big switch. The other thing I like to point out, too, is that like this child, like taking the social communication domain,

168
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,610
which is basically like, does this child have an autism spectrum diagnosis or not?

169
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,790
That's like the big question with going to take communication disorders.

170
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,110
That's often what that means.

171
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:11,270
But if a child is interacting with all these adults in the home and these adults are really trying to enunciate and like,

172
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,290
like you said, kind of follow the what the interventionists has maybe been recommending.

173
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:22,290
Then they go into this room full of kids who are varying in their, you know, communication styles, their, you know,

174
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:29,810
tolerance for like engaging with somebody who may have a, you know, is maybe slower to engage, is not as verbal.

175
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:37,640
So there's lots of different things about like the stimulus that the child is also receiving in a preschool classroom compared to a home setting.

176
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:46,129
And so if a child has, you know, hopefully the process is the child's receiving one on one, you know, services worth with the family,

177
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:55,220
with a therapist, with hopefully the same therapist, ideally over time, so that they're then ready to go to school with less support needed.

178
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:04,480
But that's not true for all kids. And some kids who kind of just start just prior to age three are kind of caught in this transition space.

179
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:12,319
So like, if they'd gotten in and been able to have some time when they were two, 2 to 3, that would have been really nice for those kids.

180
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,070
But sometimes they are sort of not picked up till closer to three.

181
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:23,470
And in that case, they're sort of just starting this, this, you know, any kind of services and also transitioning into preschool.

182
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,680
So those things can be kind of the some jarring transitions there.

183
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:39,200
I do think if people are in this space, this is a good website of resource for kind of reviewing the different legislation and policies that,

184
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:46,340
you know, can sort of kick a child or family into receiving services or not and transitions and those services and family resources.

185
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:54,979
So again, if people anticipate, you know, interfacing with families in this space, this is a good resource.

186
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,530
And like a michigan is just so has so many deep resources in this area.

187
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,890
So they're good to know about. But again, not everybody access is that equally.

188
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:13,720
Think. Just checking in on the mini lecture. Yeah, I think I covered a lot of, um.

189
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,020
I covered. Okay.

190
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:28,930
So thinking about this is just sort of like in a sample from the reading about these are all sorts of different, you know,

191
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:39,150
agencies, schools, organizations that work either directly with or on the on behalf of children and children of different ages.

192
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:45,209
And you can see and those of us who've worked with like nonprofits or in different policy arenas,

193
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:53,820
like we know these are big constraints sometimes for organizations because they have to follow the mission of who they're sort of funded to serve,

194
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,110
who their funding.

195
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:03,970
Their funding is coming from some other agency that says we will fund you to work here, for example, with kids who have a disability.

196
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,930
We don't care if it's infants and toddlers. We don't care if they're living in poverty.

197
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,530
And so this is just, again, like an example of these different early childhood type organizations.

198
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:19,509
And UIC is really an accrediting organization.

199
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,569
So we'll talk more about them when we talk about sort of child care quality,

200
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:27,610
because they're the ones who are responsible for like rating child cares and giving a,

201
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:36,549
you know, A-plus rating on certain child care and others not 0 to 3 is a big organization that does a lot of policy work,

202
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:40,860
and they're a really good place to look if you are again trying to find a sort of

203
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:48,160
information on what's available for kids who are in the sort of pre preschool age or,

204
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:52,630
you know, issues facing kids and families of that age and 003.

205
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,370
It's a good advocacy organization.

206
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:04,029
I always like to point out here that Head Start is the only one that's sort of serving across these three, and that includes Early Head Start.

207
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:09,580
So we'll talk more about Head Start and Early Head Start, but Head Start serves kids 0 to 5.

208
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:17,200
So Headstart serves kids 3 to 5 years of age, Early Head Start serves kids 0 to 3 years of age.

209
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,680
And pregnant moms. Pregnant people. Let's start.

210
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:29,890
The mandate of Head Start is to serve 10% of their population with who has a disability.

211
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:36,640
If we were able to serve all kids who are living in poverty in this country with Head Start,

212
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:42,310
they would still be mandated to serve 10% of kids with a disability even if they weren't living in poverty.

213
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:50,230
Okay, so Head Start is focused on kids in poverty, partly because we can't serve all the kids who meet that criterion.

214
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:56,380
And so they meet their 10% of kids who have a disability or who are being served for disability.

215
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:06,120
Among the sample. And then they work with again, kids really under five.

216
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,459
So those are just some examples.

217
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:16,680
But I highlight that table because I think it's really important to remember that like that's partly what leads to our fragmentation that was in the.

218
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,100
But he's sort of got, you know, different overlapping Venn diagrams.

219
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:28,180
And in part that's a good thing. But it does kind of increase this fragmentation.

220
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:35,930
I would say not everybody can do everything right. And so, again, those of us who work for different nonprofits are in different spaces.

221
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:39,610
But you have to really deeply understand the mission of whatever you are,

222
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:45,910
whoever you're working for, in order to kind of understand the decision making around funding at.

223
00:23:48,030 --> 00:24:01,010
Decisions to prioritize. I think that it's kind of related ultimately to who gets what and who is served.

224
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,200
The other thing is that, of course, and we'll talk about this more,

225
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:15,440
but like the training needed for these, working with these little kids and families,

226
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:21,649
knowing all the regulations, knowing the developmental stuff, knowing all the intervention stuff, that's a lot of training potentially.

227
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:28,070
And we want to, you know, basically have people do this work who we don't pay very much money.

228
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,260
So we'll talk more about this in child care.

229
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:37,489
But that's another important thing to keep in mind like this is really hard not to mention the sort of like emotional frustration,

230
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:41,300
tolerance level adults need to have to work with like little kids all day.

231
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:50,770
So that's just sort of another thing to note. Okay. This is where I'm kind of broadening out to talk about interventions by developmental phase.

232
00:24:50,770 --> 00:25:00,430
So for this, for your guys papers thinking about the issue or question, developmental issue that you are thinking about for papers,

233
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:05,950
this is kind of what I mean where I'm saying like where do you want to target your intervention?

234
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:14,400
Like what developmental phase and then what kind of. Focus what an intervention for your developmental issue.

235
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:20,360
Take and this is something you know this lecture these slides mean come back to this but

236
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:28,370
I like this table because it sort of lays out kind of like that other one that I love.

237
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:32,780
That's like the cycle of intervention, the life cycle.

238
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,030
This kind of goes into a little bit more detail and now these should sound familiar.

239
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,709
So like we've talked a little bit about home visiting interventions,

240
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:47,360
we're talking now early early intervention is like a can be a home visiting intervention that can also be a preschool based intervention.

241
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:55,700
So an early childhood intervention. We've talked a bit about parent skills training and that can really go across lots of phases of development.

242
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:03,320
We will talk more about these types of trainings in when we talk about older kids,

243
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:10,130
but those are really what kids directly less somewhat less around with parents.

244
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:29,439
And then we have some like prevention focused. But sort of this is we'll talk like adolescents in the school age time period around curricula to

245
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:36,620
prevent all those like what I call like bad teen behaviors and also promote positive mental health.

246
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:48,020
And that's really. So this is probably helpful to look back as you're reviewing your developmental context paper and then trying

247
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:53,720
to figure out which intervention space do I want to live in when I'm thinking about this developmental issue?

248
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:05,290
Okay. I know I say this a lot, but like the stages here are obviously not set and development can be a.

249
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:23,800
Okay. I'll talk more about early intervention and see this early intervention space is kind of here up till the end of early childhood.

250
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,980
Then it becomes more of a standard IEP.

251
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:33,970
In school age, it's no longer called early intervention, but it's more just interventions for lots of different things.

252
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:45,559
I'll pause any questions and kind of what I mean by different interventions that I think,

253
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:51,590
Danica, I guess I'm just like at least two things from like a physical standpoint.

254
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:56,739
Why like. It's easier to answer that.

255
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,030
So. I make new connections as adults, but.

256
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:11,560
I think. So it definitely takes more work, more effort,

257
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,059
more like energy input to change our brains as adults because we've got so many of

258
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,090
our connections that are like routinized and kind of know where they're running,

259
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:23,919
which is why we can do things like driving a car really automatically.

260
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:32,770
We have so many automated system behaviors as adults, so that's sort of one reason like we practice in practice and practiced,

261
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:40,510
you know, unbeknownst to us, but like our, our physiology has practiced laying down these pathways for younger kids.

262
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:49,390
They're growing a lot of pathways. And what we're trying to do is sort of steer those pathways in optimal directions.

263
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:53,680
And so before they have a lot of these behaviors like ingrained.

264
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:00,990
And loosely brain pathways talk about specific neural structures but.

265
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,830
Like their habit, their brain habits in a way haven't gotten formed yet.

266
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:14,220
And what we're trying to do is we're trying to form them in the directions that we think are developmentally adaptive because that.

267
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,639
Early on in development.

268
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:27,010
So that's why I like bringing in nutrition is really important for myelination and breast feeding and having fat, having adequate fat in the diet.

269
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:35,770
So myelin is Asian is what happens to the connections basically between different brain areas in order to make them work fast and smoothly.

270
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:43,480
So when we have myelination, it basically increases the speed at which brain signals are sent across the.

271
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:50,720
What we also know is that again.

272
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:56,730
I. But basically, like, you know,

273
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:09,099
our brains develop obviously over our lifetimes what the sort of centers of the brain to develop first are those that are very responsive to people.

274
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:14,190
And for that time, like the lizard brain, you know, it's like responsive to like fear threat.

275
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,450
And that's one of that brain structures called the amygdala.

276
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,860
If people have heard of that.

277
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:27,660
So that's like the section of the brain or the structure of the brain that really is very threat, fear and threat attuned.

278
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:34,530
And so I think back in some of those early videos, they talked about like, you know, if a parent are scary,

279
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:39,720
if a child feels fear, that's a really important thing for that child to be able to sense.

280
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,960
And that's really the amygdala activating. And I'm pointing back here, it's like roughly more back there than it is up here.

281
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:50,420
And speaking of up here, so this is our prefrontal cortex, right?

282
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:54,630
This is what develops really slowly. Like it's really not fully developed.

283
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,370
Now they're saying like until age 28. So it's possible that people here.

284
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:08,610
Prefrontal cortex, right? So we talk about in adolescence sort of jumping from like that infancy, you know,

285
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:16,730
fear, fear structures to adolescence when our prefrontal cortex is still developing.

286
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:20,690
But adolescents like lizard brains are still active.

287
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:26,299
Right. And like very responsive to fear and threatening and responsive to reward and risk taking.

288
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,580
And they're there are highly stimulate able,

289
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:35,480
but adolescents don't yet have that sort of break that is coming with the prefrontal cortex that says slow down,

290
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,500
you know, think twice, envision your future.

291
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,579
Is this really good decision in the moment? Is this good from your self?

292
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:51,830
That's all the prefrontal cortex saying that like it's a it's a mom right to our like impulsive desires.

293
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:57,739
And so that's another reason why this early intervention is really powerful,

294
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:02,540
because we can sort of structure those impulsive parts of our brain and really,

295
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:09,109
in the case of like the amygdala and take, for example, like child abuse,

296
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:17,780
there's been many studies that have shown a child can have like a bigger physically bigger amygdala if they've experienced lots of child,

297
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:23,959
lots of abuse as a child because they're overly responsive to things that could be fearful or threatening because

298
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,630
that was a really important signal for their brain to learn back in childhood when they were getting threatened.

299
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:37,250
A lot for survival. Right. So like our amygdala, if we had a lot of experiences of fear and threat as a child,

300
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:46,130
is like more responsive, larger and like more about PTSD is an extreme case.

301
00:32:46,460 --> 00:33:00,340
Just more alert to fear and threaten the environment. What we can give children is an environment that's more structured, consistent, you know.

302
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,430
Basically like the child's actions in the environment can be.

303
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,420
Positively responded to that, then it's like it puts this is such a weird way to think about it,

304
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,149
but it's like it kind of puts the amygdala like in its place and it's like,

305
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:23,350
yes, it's important that you respond to fear and threat, but like not every interaction should signal fear and threat.

306
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:29,050
But kids who have had a lot of experiences with fear and threat is like a little baby.

307
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:33,610
Their amygdala is are hyper responsive. And so even in a.

308
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:46,950
Jen an act that way preventatively like hit a classmate because they think the classmate is going to do something to them like a three year old.

309
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:55,970
So. Here. Ending intervention and serving return and all that stuff that like, no, actually this is just an interaction.

310
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:01,580
You know, I might be angry, but then I'm going to recover. You might be upset, but then I'm going to be here to be your attachment figure.

311
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:10,040
That sort of contains all of those big emotions that are very developmentally normal normative of that container,

312
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,850
which we want to kind of create through these things early childhood.

313
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:21,800
Without that container, the child can just kind of keep having these big reactions and not any kind of.

314
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:29,250
That's. Musing. That's a great question.

315
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:36,239
I know. And again, like, I would I would I would I share all of that with my neuroscientist friends.

316
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,640
Yeah, I probably would. I'd be like, here's a way to make the amygdala kind of make sense.

317
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,480
Accurate in terms of where the amygdala is in the brain. No, don't quote me on that.

318
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:53,769
It's not like push pull thing, right? So it's sort of all of these,

319
00:34:53,770 --> 00:35:03,819
if you think about all these kind of interventions are really starting or with the goal of like some level of managing behavior,

320
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:10,840
controlling behavior, you know, decision making, fostering positive decision making, hopefully in a positive relational support context.

321
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:19,389
If you look at, you know, a lot of those outcomes, especially the sort of substance abuse, aggressive behavior space, social behavior,

322
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:27,220
skills critical here, a lot of that is driven by just sort of like big behaviors that are not contained for the situation.

323
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,050
Yeah. So let's talk. Yeah.

324
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:42,670
Have a less interesting. Since I've been doing it, they've been kind of like lumping these stages together.

325
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:50,560
So like it would be like early childhood, which also includes like infancy and then like grouping, just adolescence all together.

326
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:57,290
And so, like, he was skipping, like the middle child's. The paper.

327
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:03,860
So we need to break down like each. No, that is a really good question too.

328
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:09,920
I think what I like harp on, like, if there is one thing you guys will take from this class is be like,

329
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,750
Oh yeah, you can always like split it more finely, right? And like we could maybe tailor our interventions to.

330
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:22,440
Not only tied, but thinking about the issues that you guys have selected.

331
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:27,780
Some of them are really fine grained like that and a lot of them aren't right.

332
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,889
And some of them talk about early childhood as like anywhere, you know,

333
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,490
under eight years old because kids are not like sort of reading and writing and

334
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:39,479
they can't really participate in an intervention in the same way as younger kids,

335
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,820
as you might have to do with younger kids, the others, you know.

336
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:50,490
So that's sort of like from the from the little kids up in terms of how to pass age.

337
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,970
The other thing I would say and we'll talk more about this in adolescence,

338
00:36:53,970 --> 00:37:00,300
but puberty is creeping down, you know, pretty rapidly in terms of pubertal onset.

339
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:05,129
And we also are learning more about what signals pubertal onset and or sort of changes

340
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:10,380
that we don't see happening but are happening in the brain before we see body changes.

341
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:17,250
And so that like childhood, early adolescence, adolescence, you'll notice there aren't years, there aren't like ages there.

342
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,370
Early adolescence can be, you know. The.

343
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:31,220
Certainly gender is like a big change there, right? For girls, it's really hard.

344
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:42,710
For boys, it's later. So I don't know if that addresses your question, but I think it's sort of if I'll say this, if you notice like, hey, my issue,

345
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:53,990
people have only talked about it as like early childhood, you know, 0 to 5 and adolescence and they don't think about like what could be which kids.

346
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,590
I would say that's a gap in kid like work to fill that gap.

347
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:05,030
If you say, gosh, you know, no matter when there's an intervention about this issue,

348
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:11,690
it's going to have the same impact then it's maybe less sort of develop needs to be less developmentally nuanced than I.

349
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:21,820
Personally, I can't think of that many of them that are like that. But just, you know, you can certainly split it up less finely than it is here.

350
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,290
In that sense. Yeah, that clear what I was doing. It breaks it out more in the early phases.

351
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:32,770
Uh huh. So. And even the terminology changes.

352
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:39,310
Yes, I'm doing. And then it changes to chronic stress.

353
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:43,500
Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah.

354
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:51,040
Yeah. And you can have, like, stress, you know, because, of course, stress can go across this whole thing, and we all have acute stress.

355
00:38:52,720 --> 00:39:00,100
And then just, ah, depending on how much chronic stress we've lived with and sort of by definition like you're an

356
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:05,860
adolescent who's lived with high levels of quote unquote toxic stress your whole life that's chronic,

357
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:11,740
whereas in infancy may or may not yet be chronic, but if you're only six months old.

358
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:17,090
So. We can talk. Yeah.

359
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:22,000
It's good. Uh, let's see. Yeah, there's so much of.

360
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:25,960
I do. I am conscious that I make a lot of statements like early development is better,

361
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:32,680
and then I try to give you guys those back up materials so that if somebody says, like, Well, why should I do this in early childhood?

362
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:40,059
Like that center for the developing child with all the videos and like little in brief readings, that's a really good site.

363
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:48,640
It's based on really awesome science and I think they do good messaging around like why we care about early childhood and relationships.

364
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:56,439
Um, I think, yeah. So this is another kind of example of ways to think about interventions.

365
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:05,770
Again, reflecting on your guy's papers, this is just sort of another way to kind of classify like what interventions look like in our heads.

366
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:19,870
Well, I'm going the wrong way. So this idea of like an intensive family intervention I services means early intervention services, you know,

367
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:26,500
an individual therapist coming to your home, working with you for hours with on your child's speech.

368
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:31,010
That's an intensive intervention, really important for some kids.

369
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:37,310
How do we figure out which kids it's really important for? That's that whole assessment piece that's really hard and nuanced.

370
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:42,470
But ultimately here, if you have like a single intervention that's coming to a family home,

371
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:47,209
could be awesome for that family and is really critically important.

372
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:51,740
And I don't mean to say it's not important, but it's ultimately going to help kind of that family, right?

373
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,629
Maybe that kid's children.

374
00:40:53,630 --> 00:41:02,820
So it could be intergenerational and awesome, but there's lots of other things we can do if we can't say, well, you know, we can have a.

375
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:14,040
Just to the other extreme, this text for baby. I'd like you have a pregnant mom and pops up in the database that you have a pregnant mom mom to be.

376
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:20,270
You send that person text. Venus is the size of an avocado.

377
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:23,470
You should be avoiding alcohol in all that kind of messaging stuff, right?

378
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:28,360
That's super broad. Little bit hard to evaluate how those work.

379
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,630
We're getting better at it, I would say, in our evaluations. Super important.

380
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:39,940
You know, also like a billboard is in the space. So that's sort of like the broad public health media messaging strategy is.

381
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:45,280
We still think really carefully about how we do that messaging and sort of offer,

382
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:52,660
you know, instead of just don't drink alcohol, but say that's a little more engaging.

383
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:56,049
And then in between here,

384
00:41:56,050 --> 00:42:05,440
there's so many different like levels of intervention and types of benefits that we might think about each of those depending,

385
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:12,429
you know, it's maybe sort of obvious, but also like depending on how intensive it is, the fewer people we can impact, right?

386
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,739
That's like sort of the width of the pyramid up at the top.

387
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:22,360
We don't impact that many people, but then that's a very intensive training of the interventionist high impact on the individual people.

388
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:28,780
And then as we get broader, we have less training needed, hopefully,

389
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:35,800
because we can get it to scale and we can impact more people, but on a more light touch way.

390
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:41,770
So that's again where that idea of like screening and assessment is really important because we want to figure out,

391
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,200
oh, who needs text for baby and who could maybe benefit from here.

392
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:55,029
So maybe hear from screen. The parent that has all these sort of social health concerns have had had a lot of aces in their background.

393
00:42:55,030 --> 00:43:02,469
They maybe have depression. They're endorsing on a questionnaire. Those parents maybe need a little more than text for baby.

394
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:07,780
But, you know, maybe they need this or maybe that like relationship app that I said is like right here.

395
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:11,140
So that's more focused on its content, but it's still very light touch.

396
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:18,129
So I think I can say like this is like the I would it's not even the million dollar question.

397
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:23,950
It's like the $4 billion question, like how can we figure this out?

398
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:28,270
And I think that that's just something that's always important to think about or thinking public health,

399
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,739
because in the way we always want to be here, right? And like having scalable broad interventions that are impacting a lot of people.

400
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,840
And this is also like policy here. Right?

401
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:46,209
But we sometimes need to be here and like figuring that out and figuring out like, oh, I'm in public health, I'm in a public health department.

402
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:49,300
We're not going to get here in terms of delivering services.

403
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:58,840
But I know like dual student social worker friends that I went to grad school and I can connect that, you know, to this family, to those people.

404
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,750
And I think that's the other thing I like to highlight.

405
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:11,350
Like that's how that's a way that we can connect services and systems better is to understand like early intervention services live in the sort of

406
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:21,370
early childhood social work really evaluation space and knowing about that space is really important even if you're not doing those interventions.

407
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:30,580
I. Uh, I think the next one is also around this, and this is just sort of what I was saying here,

408
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:38,440
but with the additional point that I would argue that public health is super important and public health skills and training and

409
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:47,139
all the stuff you guys are learning is it's critical in understanding how we need to scale up these kinds of intervention ideas.

410
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:53,470
So like knowing both kind of the content, like, you know, why do we do early childhood?

411
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,190
What the heck is the and make them mandatory? DILLON Why is it important?

412
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,950
What is important in a parenting intervention? What is relational health and why does it matter?

413
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,250
Like all that content information is really important.

414
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:13,750
And I think that where the public health frame is critical is that like what are the sort of public healthy

415
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:19,990
public health tools that we can use to inform our decision making about how to support children and families?

416
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:28,959
And I'm sure people can think of additional public health tools that we can use here.

417
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:35,620
But we've talked already about screening and I was just referencing like social determinants of health and aces screening for families.

418
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:43,990
Where do we do it? All of that fidelity of program implementation, we haven't talked that much about that, but that's basically the idea of,

419
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:49,930
okay, I have an awesome trained interventionist and now they're going to go and work with families.

420
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:56,080
Hopefully they do it, you know, appropriately in the same way and like in an evidence based manner each time.

421
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,350
But how do I check in on that and how do I determine that?

422
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:05,319
That's like where we talk about looking at the fidelity of how well your interventionist is implementing your program.

423
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:09,970
Right for baby has high fidelity, you send it out.

424
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:13,510
But then there's also the question like, did the did the person open the text?

425
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:16,990
You know, there's all these different ways to think about fidelity and dose.

426
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:22,000
So there's a lot around implementation. I think public health.

427
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:31,360
And public health also has a really great history of offering different models of staffing and ways to engage with families.

428
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:38,860
And somebody already mentioned the word paraprofessional. And so that's that idea of like, how do I get this sort of messaging out,

429
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:45,220
this intervention content and material out in a way that is going to reach a lot of people?

430
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:51,399
You can't have the most highly paid, skilled, you know,

431
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:57,850
clinical psychologist experts to come to the home or social work or social workers that can do it on a really broad scale.

432
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:05,469
So who can do it? When we talk about school age kids, one of the it's not really staffing,

433
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:11,650
but like one of the things that comes up a lot is like who is in the school context that can kind of support the messaging.

434
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:15,700
And that's like the people on the bus strap, you know, driving the bus, the people in the cafeteria.

435
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:19,750
So it's a lot of, for example, bullying interventions or anti-bullying interventions.

436
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:25,210
Talk about engaging all those individuals in the school in the school climate, even if they're not,

437
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:29,170
you know, the school nurse or the school psychologist, because, like, not all schools have those.

438
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:36,550
You know, another critical thing that we do a lot in is community stakeholder engagement.

439
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:42,549
So with any intervention that we're thinking about, we want to check in with the community,

440
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:47,530
do a needs assessment, figure out, hey, community that I'd have identified in some way.

441
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,050
What do you think is going to work? You know, what have you tried before, etc.?

442
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:56,860
We'll talk more about that. And then also outcome evaluations.

443
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:04,600
So like, how well is this working? We need to figure that out because everything costs money in resources and time.

444
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:13,420
And so figuring out exactly what things cost to do in terms of intervention and then what evaluation outcomes are important to consider.

445
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,120
So like if you're doing an infant intervention,

446
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:23,589
you're not going to be able to wait until that infant becomes 16 to see if there are substance, you know, if you're using substances.

447
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:28,930
But you can look at things that are closer in time, developmentally relevant for the age of your mention.

448
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:35,790
Any other thoughts that people have in terms of public health to.

449
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:47,710
Has as you've taken things that you've worked in with, worked with, worked on with communities like prepositions for that.

450
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:55,709
And the things that are occurring right now in public health.

451
00:48:55,710 --> 00:49:02,580
I can think of one. But in learning, people are really,

452
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:10,290
really hot on the idea of machine learning and like how to apply machine learning models to some of these questions.

453
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:17,610
Like if we did test for baby and if this many parents open the app, you know, how do we get more parents to open the app or the test?

454
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:24,690
So like all of the methods that we think about, how do we do outcome evaluations?

455
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:28,440
We can do some quantitative evaluations, we can also do qualitative evaluations.

456
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:34,750
Those are really important. What's on.

457
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,320
Contributions to this sort of child and family services question.

458
00:49:45,760 --> 00:50:01,280
How does it work? I don't know. If you need it.

459
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:05,940
The basis for it. Yeah,

460
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:12,690
I would say that is another public health thing we talk to our colleagues about in health insurance and

461
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:21,240
policy and how it works and how to basically get it for our kids and get it to be taken up by more systems.

462
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:34,740
So in terms of insurance, there's the child health insurance program that's an income qualification.

463
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:39,960
So kids who are low income are more eligible for that health policy.

464
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:50,220
But it's an excellent question that often sets the stage for access to any of these, like any intervention, right?

465
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:59,249
Not always. But usually if you're going to be not having parents in like a research study that's insurance not related to insurance,

466
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:07,889
but, you know, that's not the most common. So understanding insurance constraints is something we can, you know,

467
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:12,960
think about and reflect on in terms of how that shapes the options for kids and families.

468
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:21,410
There is another I would think of like a new point when I'm talking about this.

469
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:32,479
Another thing is that to like a data idea, but like complex systems and complex systems modeling of people have sort of delved into that space again,

470
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,020
like there's the statistical side of complex systems modeling,

471
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:41,329
and then there's kind of the conceptual side of like, here's how to think about a complex system,

472
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:52,159
which I would argue like these, like web of loosely connected services for children's and children and families is and so this idea of, again,

473
00:51:52,160 --> 00:52:01,190
like bringing in models of how to think about this and how to make it work better is another place where we can again,

474
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:04,430
this level of thinking about public health training.

475
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:10,490
Make it better. Okay.

476
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,800
Let me see where I am in my. Any questions so far?

477
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:21,409
Know I'm using on a lot of things and we can talk about this kind of getting down

478
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:26,420
into the interventions and some setting considerations for early intervention.

479
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:41,650
But this is like important stuff to think about as you're also moving through, especially those of you who might be second years.

480
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:47,850
How do I take all this stuff, all this classes of coursework and, you know,

481
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:55,239
writing and different classes that I've been doing and like take it forward and apply it because it's got so much utility.

482
00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:01,660
And sometimes we don't realize until we're like in the job space, but just a plug for that.

483
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:16,570
Okay. Let's talk more specifically about this this manpower intervention, just to do like a little bit of a compare and contrast, for example,

484
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:20,200
to the find intervention, if you remember, which was the one that was like,

485
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:25,810
you know, videotape the parent child interaction and kind of provide feedback.

486
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:32,920
What were their elements of manpower that seemed different from that?

487
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:42,780
And how do you think? To see the manpower differently from a find example.

488
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,780
Yeah. Um, I like the mom.

489
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:17,060
And if using a lot of that sort of content again from fines like certain returned interactions are important for early brain development,

490
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,890
like that's content.

491
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:30,800
But the intervention kind of modality and context in which that content is placed in addition to other content is a really important difference.

492
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,790
What are some other differences people might have noticed?

493
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:45,980
I'll say about manpower to it's been implemented, sort of developed through this university and research context,

494
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:51,910
but is now implemented in community settings and sort of settings that might provide early intervention.

495
00:54:51,920 --> 00:55:00,950
So that's actually an example of early intervention, an early intervention program that could be delivered to families.

496
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:12,400
Concrete other like content areas that manpower gets into that stuff but differ from find why those might be important.

497
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:24,160
Yeah. Now, if he's going to actually be able to really have supported separations and reunions,

498
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:35,140
like incorporating some of the challenges you might experience in a real public setting, but kind of like in a safe environment and.

499
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:41,930
Definitely. So, yeah. So they're practicing.

500
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:45,390
Remember that strange situation, attachment, assessment, paradigm.

501
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:47,100
That's basically what it is.

502
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:57,240
But they're kind of practicing it in this group of giving like support, live feedback for how that go, how to draw people in the group feel like it.

503
00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:05,459
So there's the group community of again with basic developmental kind of processes and then there's sort of as I'm,

504
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:09,960
I was saying like a little bit of more outreach to the broader community who are support people.

505
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:21,240
Here. And we haven't talked about this a lot, but given my like huge digression about the amygdala,

506
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:33,410
another thing that we know about PTSD, for example, and treatment of trauma is that you can do a lot with like sensory things.

507
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:36,659
And so one of the things that I can't remember if they talked about it in this article,

508
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:44,880
but self care and just sort of tuning in to the self and your self needs are really important

509
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:53,879
foundational kinds of therapy that also address trauma because for lots of different reasons,

510
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,270
I won't go on a huge digression and we'll talk more about trauma, but.

511
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:04,859
One of the things that we know about trauma is that when we can kind of tune into

512
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:11,339
our body sensations a bit more accurately and they're not kind of going wild,

513
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:18,900
like the amygdala is not going wild, but you can kind of notice a feeling and kind of keep it, you know, under control.

514
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:29,910
That's really helpful. And so one of the things that Montoya also does is help parents can manage those feelings.

515
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:34,050
And manpower has also been developed to work with women who experience trauma.

516
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:47,520
So that's a big reason why it has the sort of self-care and to do things like, you know, focus on a smell or focus on a visual image.

517
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:55,770
Like lots of different, very individual things are built into this program in parts of the world with a trauma sample.

518
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:04,339
What's one other thing that I'd feel like we have not been taught about attachment based parenting,

519
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:08,720
self-care, guided parent child interactions and social support.

520
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:14,569
One thing that I love about mom power is that the outcomes never.

521
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:20,600
I was just saying like outcome evaluation. You wouldn't assess like substance abuse as an outcome of your infant intervention unless you have

522
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:26,420
like big zillions of dollars because it's really expensive to track the families for that one.

523
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:32,570
One thing that Mom Power considers as an outcome is whether the family gets connected to care.

524
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:38,650
And so that's really important because thinking about like the reading responses and the, you know,

525
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:44,780
the fragmented care that we all kind of have to live with an important outcome of this intervention is,

526
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:52,550
hey, we're going to make sure that you are connected to services that you seem to you might benefit from you and your family might benefit from.

527
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:57,320
I think that's an important way to think about some of these interventions,

528
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:03,380
because we can't expect them to, like in six weeks, cure postpartum depression.

529
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:06,350
Like that's probably not going to happen.

530
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:14,870
And so we don't want to like lay so much on these interventions that if they don't do what we really hope they do over the long term,

531
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:18,680
that we throw the intervention out. Right. Yeah.

532
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:27,350
I would also say that, like, this program was less like hovering than the time program is and how much stuff of mine they have,

533
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:32,750
like this whole, like, group of, like, scientists. And that reminds me.

534
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:37,699
This one was more like giving them tips and like offering services and support.

535
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:48,620
And it was. It was like moving from that dyad to like outside your dyad.

536
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:53,510
Who are your supports? What care you can access after this like intervention part?

537
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:57,950
And you know, what are the different ways to connect you to your context?

538
00:59:57,950 --> 01:00:01,640
So all of those things are really important about power.

539
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:08,630
I think that this kind of came up also in the answers,

540
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:13,939
but this reading is all about those sort of different relationships, this collaborative relationship.

541
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:18,139
So that idea of your somebody here sitting in the Department of Public Health,

542
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:22,969
you don't have like control over the budget for, you know, child and family programing.

543
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:27,900
But this family comes across your desk and they're having, like, you know, a water crisis.

544
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:29,030
Well,

545
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:36,920
do you know of other professionals who you could hook that family up with and who you could reach out to and you could basically do like a little,

546
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:43,129
you know, like a mini one power intervention to say like, hey, here's a here's a resource for you family.

547
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:51,620
So I think this this article I like because they really I think illustrate well all these different roles that

548
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:57,320
all the different team members have and different expertize comes to the table because like you kind of said,

549
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:05,299
you know, lots of different times, you know, there's a child there in a family and there's like a whole child and family and they have,

550
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:11,180
you know, housing needs and medical needs and educational needs and all that kind of stuff.

551
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:18,649
And it can't all often, even though it does often, ideally it doesn't rest on one person, but there's a lot of different team members involved.

552
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:27,010
So that sort of I think that article does a good job at kind of highlighting the contributions of different people.

553
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:36,170
So if you guys again like it's very like public health, kind of practical skills point focus session.

554
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:41,040
But if you guys are like, Huh, this kid seems to have a need in this area.

555
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:43,760
Who are the professionals that deal with that space, right?

556
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:52,379
Like that's really important knowledge are to articulate, you know, what exactly that knowledge is.

557
01:01:52,380 --> 01:02:04,420
And so it's that sort of interest. He talked about the implications of the pandemic, these connections, which generally have not been good.

558
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:10,580
Okay. So. Taking a look at this space.

559
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:23,300
What do you guys notice about it? General, you know, input thinking about kids, little kids, families that might come into this space.

560
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:28,780
What do people what do people notice or think? Pros, cons, things will change.

561
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:35,970
All the money in the world. No money to make us real. What kinds of things would you put in it?

562
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,330
I thought that was softer.

563
01:02:53,010 --> 01:03:00,780
And if we're thinking about our, like, harm reduction environmental approach, a shiny hard floor is easier to clean than like a lovely carpet.

564
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:04,720
So that's a potential tradeoff for sure. Yeah.

565
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:14,070
Emily, I went there with. And then there's like.

566
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:25,560
In there for that early intervention for the two year old. But you have to bring the ten year old with you because like, that's their deal.

567
01:03:25,570 --> 01:03:31,000
It's after school and you're coming to the so to see and they could like maybe play a little with like sort of a.

568
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:42,060
I feel like I'm seeing a lot of stuff for, like, motor development and maybe not.

569
01:03:50,820 --> 01:04:01,810
Still building. Mm hmm. The things for cognitive potential, for potential use for cognitive development.

570
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:08,200
But yeah, there's and it's actually it's a nice big space like this is a lot bigger space than most.

571
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:16,450
Like, you know, if you have a room in a in a pediatric clinic, it's often not going to be that big in terms of individual families.

572
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:26,020
What other domains might people if you are a parent walking in this room, you could you could work with with.

573
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:39,210
And you, which means. Safety considerations.

574
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:51,610
It feels like they're right exactly at the height of like the temple of preschool.

575
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:58,170
And that preschool is going to be like. And not their head on the table potentially.

576
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:06,910
So like, I don't know. Right. But we talked about like bolstering that to the wall.

577
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:12,459
So if I were going to have a kind of an unsupervised like waiting room area or therapy area,

578
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:16,360
I might want to make sure that that's attached to the wall in some secure way.

579
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:33,300
Um, what about the decor? It's in the corner, like, I think, and it's nice and colorful, but I almost feel like it's just me.

580
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,640
I think I'm a parent. I really do.

581
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:40,900
Not as much as what's on the wall. Just colors, color, a certain number of things.

582
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:50,640
Friends like I like the ones I thought that the story and I kind of talked to.

583
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:57,870
That's a quad core that allows for more like.

584
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:17,089
I agree. Like the dots are like colorful. And yet, like you said, you can teach color, big, small letters or over here.

585
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:21,919
But yeah, they're sort of like you feel like something might just like puts them up on the wall, like, oh,

586
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:28,340
we should make it bright, you know, like, as opposed to, like, I agree that tree is sort of like inviting to tell story about it.

587
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:41,650
Yeah. Well, it's really some sort of stipulation that we create.

588
01:06:54,080 --> 01:07:00,900
Yeah, absolutely. And I know, like, these maps of people have like, you know, work with those maps like you can, you know,

589
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:05,150
make a little path with them or you could have them, you know, right now it's all put together.

590
01:07:05,810 --> 01:07:10,730
But like thinking about, okay, a family might be coming in and you want to maybe set up the room for the family.

591
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:18,230
Maybe you like put them put those, you know, little pads out separately to see if they can do like some spelling or something like that,

592
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:22,910
which, you know, depending on the kid, maybe they do. Maybe they don't. Yeah.

593
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:35,239
Are there other things I'm just thinking that have sometimes been commented on, like, well, we don't often have like oxygen,

594
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:40,700
but like the lights are pretty or, you know, they're just, you know, the lights next to the lighting.

595
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:45,889
And then they do have some soft like blankets and things in there, which is nice.

596
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:49,940
And especially kids have sort of sensory, you know.

597
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:56,940
And then that can be like a nice different textures can be helpful.

598
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:05,230
Yeah. Also like a couch for parents who may be tired of.

599
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:11,140
Also like a little right in the corner a little bit.

600
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:21,149
So this idea to you and I put implications for telehealth visits because it's the idea of like think about all of the what we say,

601
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:27,630
like affordances that has for a child and family in terms of what you can observe, like how they approach this space.

602
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:30,380
And you can really do that in any space, right?

603
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:36,610
You can just sort of observe a lot of like those parent child dynamics and sort of think about like how do they interact?

604
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:42,870
Does the parent naturally like gravitate over here and start telling a beautiful story or do they like sit on the couch like, I'm just so tired.

605
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:50,159
This is like my break time. And so how can you kind of think about setting up spaces and then observing what you see in

606
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:54,990
those spaces and maybe using that later as you talk to a family if you're in the position?

607
01:08:55,170 --> 01:09:04,960
Yeah. Although you gain maybe being able to see the child in their sort of natural environment and the parent.

608
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:14,620
I think that room, it's like it's like a mix and it's pretty good, but, you know, could be improved.

609
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:25,240
Okay. So I think the other thing to think through again, just very practically and also for your guys papers,

610
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:36,640
what types of setting considerations would there be for these different types of interventions?

611
01:09:37,150 --> 01:09:46,420
And again, like we're always making trade offs, you know, not you know, we've also could like walk into a place that's like we do this intervention,

612
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:54,340
like this is our thing and in the sense that's great, but like maybe it could be tweaked, maybe the improved.

613
01:09:56,110 --> 01:10:01,960
You might have those opportunities. So thinking about resources that you need to even set up any intervention.

614
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:06,280
Who are my interventionists? Do I have human interventionists?

615
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:17,170
Do I have app interventionists? You know? Do I have a collaborative team like who might be my team members in my organization that I'm working on?

616
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:21,670
And what are their areas of expertize and where can we connect?

617
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:26,950
And I will say also, those of us who have lived in interdisciplinary spaces,

618
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:31,599
which is probably all of us and to some degree everybody uses different terms.

619
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:38,919
I think you just said this, Jacki, like give a term for like what they call stress or aces or early life stress or,

620
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:43,239
you know, in that small space like but in all spaces, right?

621
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:50,790
Like different terms are used to refer to the same thing or to slightly different focal elements of think of the same thing.

622
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:56,440
So understanding that and just sort of getting to know how your different colleagues in

623
01:10:56,440 --> 01:11:00,850
different training spaces who have come from different like interprofessional spaces,

624
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:04,510
how they talk about the same things that you're considered concerned with.

625
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:07,989
We'll talk more about this too.

626
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:16,570
But I would say, like child care, transportation and food are necessary but not sufficient to engage parents and interventions.

627
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:23,050
And, you know, I say they're necessary, but they're not always possible to provide.

628
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:32,290
So often use the example of we did a big childhood obesity prevention intervention and there was like polar

629
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:38,769
vortex winter and people just couldn't travel and it was like presume like there was no virtual option.

630
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:43,780
And so we were just trying to problem solve, like, how do we get the families there?

631
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:52,150
It was kind of for Uber to really it was pretty easy Uber and it was rural, so it was like snowy roads limited, you know, gas money.

632
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:57,040
So like even a gas card was, you know, sort of access to the gas station was difficult.

633
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:01,029
So there were just lots of different, like really basic logistical things.

634
01:12:01,030 --> 01:12:05,290
What kind of food you offer, certainly in a childhood obesity prevention intervention,

635
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:11,710
you don't want to give pizza every time, but then, like anything else, is difficult to prepare.

636
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:19,840
What room? You're doing this and like, does it have a kitchen? Does it have any kind of food, you know, kind of preparation, capacity?

637
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:25,209
We'll talk more about that about that, too, in the child care time.

638
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:30,310
But that that whole like nexus of child care provision for other kids who are not in the intervention,

639
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:37,480
transportation and food are critical and they all kind of go away in the telemedicine space.

640
01:12:37,990 --> 01:12:42,850
The child care thing doesn't really go away because, of course, those kids can be,

641
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:46,360
as we've all had the experience, like people hopping in on your zoom call.

642
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:53,230
Right. But it goes away less. It goes away mostly because you don't have to transport additional kids to an in-person intervention.

643
01:12:54,930 --> 01:13:00,180
I'll say to life again, a lot of people have done this on like a research study or an intervention,

644
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:05,100
like you're expecting one family and one child and then like four kids come and you're like,

645
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:10,820
oh my gosh, I don't have the staff to, like, keep my ratio of child watchers in a safe way.

646
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:19,770
So that can be a whole thing here in terms of setting and interventions, thinking about the age of children,

647
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:25,590
which for your guys paper is like central in broader life and profession.

648
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:31,229
You don't really always have like control over the children that you're intervening with.

649
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:36,660
If you're in a school setting, you might. But this sort of this idea of like, how can my intervention be?

650
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:42,090
Like how broadly an age or developmental stage is this intervention applicable?

651
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:47,729
How much do I need to developmentally tailor this intervention? And sometimes maybe not that much.

652
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:53,490
And maybe you're running a group around, you know, prevention of depression for parents.

653
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:57,179
And they all are going to bring in different examples. And like, that's fine.

654
01:13:57,180 --> 01:14:05,340
It can be across lots of different ages. How does that group seem different from like a group of parents with all babies under one?

655
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:14,130
So those those kinds of considerations of age of children and sort of the flexibility and then here to display specific developmental concerns.

656
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:22,620
So like, does your population of children or families have specific considerations like developmental delay,

657
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:31,529
like hearing loss, like even super common speaking a language other than English as a, you know, native language that is.

658
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:34,860
Well, and that's not developmental concern, but that's just a tailoring question.

659
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:40,620
And then the outcomes of interest, what are you looking at? And I use our obesity prevention interventions.

660
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:44,969
Example, we didn't call it an obesity prevention intervention was just a parenting intervention.

661
01:14:44,970 --> 01:14:47,730
And we talked about eating and sleep and these other things,

662
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:53,250
but we didn't want to necessarily talk about obesity prevention because we talk to our community and they're like,

663
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:57,060
what is going to come to an obesity prevention, you know, intervention for preschoolers?

664
01:14:58,050 --> 01:15:01,080
So that was sort of some feedback that made sense.

665
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:09,959
Okay. And then and sort of practically thinking about these different kinds of interventions we've talked about like manpower a little

666
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:19,040
bit as do be clinics is that pediatric medical home idea swamp nurse with one of the sponsors and then find which is like the

667
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:26,310
all the scientists are under this description like this group of like people looking at your video but thinking about these are

668
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:36,360
all contexts that we could like reach kids and families in and that we know that interventions are developed and delivered in.

669
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:40,470
And so what are kind of the opportunities and constraints?

670
01:15:45,730 --> 01:15:49,810
Doing an intervention in that can benefit kids and families.

671
01:15:50,230 --> 01:15:54,250
And I'm saying intervention. I always use the term intervention as I feel it's a very broad,

672
01:15:54,700 --> 01:16:02,040
but it's anything from like a preventive informational session to like one on one therapy, right?

673
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:07,540
Like all that level of the triangle could be intervention or is intervention?

674
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:20,420
Papers. What is the context that like, you know, you may or may not do these interventions in actuality,

675
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:29,149
but like you could and you could think about what are some elements of a context that I could see working in eventually,

676
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:34,070
like, is it a school, is it a public health agency? Is it, you know, a hospital?

677
01:16:34,110 --> 01:16:37,580
You a lots of different settings. It's a community after school program.

678
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:41,630
Is it tech? Okay.

679
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:46,870
And I put global settings knowing that all of those can occur in all settings.

680
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:49,989
But I put that up there always to remind myself too,

681
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:58,030
that there are so many good models that we can look to from global work, and often, but not always.

682
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:07,770
There are just different models that we can look to that have developed in settings that have fewer resources than we do here in the US on Earth.

683
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:13,990
And we can get a lot of good intervention models from the meetings.

684
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:23,049
Okay. I think. We didn't totally get to that other reading that like Mason, Frank and Hurley won.

685
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:34,660
But I think it's another good one because thinking about like, what can we do for kids in these day care settings in terms of COVID like damage?

686
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:39,440
We'll talk more about this.

687
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:49,640
We have a whole section on homeless kids who are experiencing homelessness, but this is just a, you know, intense statistic.

688
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:58,940
Right. So before the pandemic, 16% of Detroit families with children under 18 were reported to experience homelessness.

689
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:05,930
And that's an underestimate for lots of reasons. We'll talk about when we talk about that population.

690
01:18:07,490 --> 01:18:14,960
But in the pandemic, only 2% were identified by schools because kids weren't in school.

691
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,840
That makes sense, but that is a huge drop.

692
01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:27,730
The other thing is that this is the McKinney Vento act is like providing kids who have experience homelessness with services.

693
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:29,180
So we'll talk more about that.

694
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:36,709
But the other thing is that the federal government gave money to basically provide additional services during the pandemic.

695
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:44,180
And so there were a lot of different choices that schools made to how to use that money to help these kids.

696
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:51,830
And that's the McKinney Vento Act that existed before, but it got basically flooded with pandemic money, but temporarily.

697
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:55,850
Right. So I'm talking about resources and decision making.

698
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:59,030
And, you know, interventions are what your spaces are.

699
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:05,270
So like this is an exact example of like here's a population of kids who have really high needs.

700
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:08,960
We got a bunch of money for a little while.

701
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:16,250
How should we invest that money to sort of make good decisions about how to use it and thinking ahead for when we don't have that money again?

702
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:19,880
So that's like a kind of policy intervention crashing together.

703
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:25,310
Okay. I believe we are just at time.

704
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:30,980
So next time we're going to do family separation.

705
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:34,820
There's like some sub topics, kind of heavy.

706
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:37,640
The resilience film is coming up.

707
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:50,030
So just to put that on your guys radar, it's about an hour long and that will be next week, the read and respond to that resilience film.

708
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:54,440
So I think that's all I have for you guys.

709
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:55,970
See you.
