1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,740
Yeah. Very integrated, you know that. I mean, you run the risk.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:15,870
Oh, I really do. Yeah, I ended up.

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,280
Yeah. Yeah. No, that's not.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:34,000
It is unfortunate that I had contact with them, and I really thought I was just trying to kind of like everything, you know, everything you.

5
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,720
Now, I thought that it's like, oh, and then.

6
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,060
Oh, yeah, I think I thought, you know, I was just there for you guys, you know.

7
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:59,910
But I would picture yeah, I would probably continue doing that every time I was like, it's not like I hadn't looked at like just color.

8
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:10,260
I think it was like, like, I'm not sure, but I never did see that because I saw that take.

9
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:20,750
They would come back to me for some work.

10
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:32,800
I mean, I think I've been observing different things like here's a role play.

11
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,659
Yeah, yeah. Well, you're right. I thought you might add.

12
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:51,240
So I don't think I'm actually getting more time for that any time I've been here before.

13
00:01:51,690 --> 00:02:07,920
It's also something that I really do that, you know, catch a chance like, hey, thanks ever for for coming today.

14
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,830
It's nice to have one of our faces here today.

15
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,549
We're saying on Wednesday we're having our final presentation so we'll have today are they Cronos group to

16
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:24,390
do is group the giant screen group and the end of life group and then once they will have the other groups.

17
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:33,120
And so we look forward to this. We'll have time for the presentations and then some question and answer after that.

18
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,980
With this, this is great, but hopefully it'll give you some feedback that you might use to put together your final report.

19
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:50,700
And as we do the Q&A, I'd like the other the next group to come up and start getting ready because oftentimes there is a few minutes of transition.

20
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,889
If I have to download the files and remember that you'll log in and then they wait.

21
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,010
Is this right version or the wrong version? And wait, did you have the version?

22
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,430
I had? So let's let's do that.

23
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,360
Have the next group come up while the first group is getting all set up and loaded.

24
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:24,370
Does anyone have any questions? So just wait a few minutes here for the scripture ready and then we'll get started.

25
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:34,180
Also, I think there was a question the the final paper is do I think I switched the time,

26
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,790
I think to be midnight instead of I originally had it is like 6 p.m. or 6:30

27
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:42,940
p.m. whatever our official final exam time was in the university calendar,

28
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:52,899
but that's the final paper. And then also I would like you to turn in your your feedback on your teammates that the bonus allocation,

29
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,809
so that's a fictitious $10,000 bonus that you allocate among your team members.

30
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:05,320
And like that's a that's helping me get a sense of how well people were contributing to the group.

31
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,979
And it's a chance for you to let me know if someone was not pulling their weight,

32
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,730
but also recognize people who might have gone above and beyond as well in your groups.

33
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:23,470
Thanks. Sure we go first.

34
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,810
You know, why don't you just go ahead and research institutions?

35
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,630
She was supposed to start all well, but that's the introduction, you guys know?

36
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,910
I mean, you know, they introduce themselves.

37
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:26,870
Yeah. And so our group is doing the cost effectiveness analysis of various treatments for moderate to severe disease in the patients.

38
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:35,250
So just to introduce we already had this in the first half of the presentation, the one that we did before.

39
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:42,600
So Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease. The causes are it causes inflammation of the GI tract,

40
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:49,260
which can further lead to complications such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss and malnutrition.

41
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,330
So just to introduce to our Crohn's disease cannot be really cured.

42
00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:01,190
But therapies can cause like reduced symptoms and remission over a long period of time and healing of the inflammation.

43
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:10,020
It is estimated on average, each person with Crohn's disease spends about 1300 dollars per year to manage to manage their conditions,

44
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,610
including the medications, missed work and loss of productivity that comes with the disease.

45
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,990
The questions that we're trying to answer over this analysis is what is the cost

46
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,650
effectiveness of currency as opposed to the drugs which are already in the market,

47
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,700
that are still arrangements for the treatment of moderate to severe disease?

48
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,840
As we all know, I'm not sure if you guys know, but it's guided.

49
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:40,620
You just got approved in June for Crohn's disease. So most of the analysis that we have on Sky to date is based on like hypothetically that

50
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,389
because a lot of real world leaderboards currency for Crohn's disease is not really available.

51
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:53,640
I mean, we don't have access to it. And then our analysis can highlight a comparison of the immunosuppressant biologics which

52
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,629
are used in the treatment of Crohn's disease and can be applied for further research.

53
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:04,590
In this particular segment of the use of methods are the methods of which of other

54
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:10,979
characteristics of the cases that we are considering for the analysis are up to 35 years of age.

55
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:16,410
That is, other patients who have a confirmed diagnosis of moderate to severe Crohn's disease.

56
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,870
Although we do not have any treatment history with biologic medications and patients who

57
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:27,509
are uninsured since Crohn's disease is chronic and incurable are analysis is operated

58
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:34,830
under time horizon of ten years and out of interest is the net monetary benefit benefit

59
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:45,570
and recommended willingness to pay off the base case go to a length of the end of it.

60
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,890
I think we didn't take long enough. Okay, sorry, I'm just one.

61
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:05,820
So we took on use the peer perspective because for Crohn's disease for people who are usually affected by the drug, are the people paying for it?

62
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:09,780
It's very expensive, which is why we took the payer perspective.

63
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,910
We also briefly considered the side of perspective, but mainly want to look at the power perspective.

64
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:24,930
So we use a hybrid structure, so we use the decision tree to represent the induction phase.

65
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:31,079
So when they get their first dose of the drugs and then for the rest of the time they're using the drug.

66
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,660
Throughout that time period that we're studying, we use a markov model to represent that maintenance phase.

67
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,860
So you can see our this is in tree up there.

68
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:47,639
And then there's the three drugs that we're considering or we're making seem if there's no response or a response within a response,

69
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:59,160
whether they're improving, staying the same, whatever it is. And then for the Markov model, all of the phases, these are most of the phases.

70
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,219
Those are all six five phases that we are considering.

71
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:10,560
So our mission would be if they don't experience any symptoms at all, mild is just very moderate, small to moderate effects than moderate.

72
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,940
So you can go from there. And then also an additional option that they have is surgery.

73
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:20,700
And then within any of the states with always the possibility of death and there's no returning from dark spots, you're done.

74
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:27,980
You're dead. This is just a recap of the induction fees and maintenance fees.

75
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:34,730
So induction, as I said, is the first dose and it's more frequent with like a higher like a straight stronger dose.

76
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,190
And then once they do the the rest of the doses,

77
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:42,020
they're a little bit weaker because they really just want to make sure that with that first dose, you're experiencing any difference.

78
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,110
From the get go. So the meeting date is after that.

79
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,860
And then you can see in the diagram those are for three starting doses.

80
00:09:49,860 --> 00:10:02,729
And then there's those doses every eight weeks. So I'll make a model incorporate five possible health status, including a mild,

81
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:07,920
moderate, severe remission and that you're just like, give us a freebie.

82
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:14,760
Obviously introduction and the House days are major for the cross disease activity in the US as

83
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:21,360
the nutritional and consequence outcomes measure using the incremental cost effectiveness ratio.

84
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,700
This our order imports in our model in clinic costs.

85
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:40,530
Cost included the drug causes and also the annual mean cost in the healthcare service and also the utilities and also the transaction rate.

86
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:46,500
The transaction varies. I come from different vector drugs and also their own clinical trial data.

87
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,570
This is our final results in our cost effectiveness rankings.

88
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:59,610
So we have to dominate a result, including sky receipt and stellar.

89
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:06,460
So okay, let's go straight for to include natural cost inflation.

90
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,090
This racial plan, as we can see from the picture here, this deal overall has the higher cost,

91
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,700
but it also has a higher effectiveness one for our target drivers.

92
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:24,240
It has a lower cost. But in fairness to Humera, it's moderate cause and moderate effectiveness.

93
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:33,200
All right. So this is a one way sensitivity analysis that we did that we just.

94
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:47,260
So in this analysis we are actually comparing all three drugs that is isolated z stand alone human based on the initial response rate.

95
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:56,510
But what we would like to do is we are just changing the initial response, first guided Z from four different words from 0 to 1.

96
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:01,580
And here you can see as the response rate increases to about 0.4 percent, it is.

97
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:07,100
So the line that you see here, this indicates that these two are not nominated.

98
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,640
But if I go back right here, all three of them are nominated.

99
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,420
But as we increase the response rate for this guy to Z, let's say as soon as this guy did Z,

100
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:22,280
just point read already dominates the human eye, which is right here and this is right on the top.

101
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:32,700
And then as we increase the response rate, 2.6, about .5.6, it already dominates or escalated in terms of the cost effectiveness of.

102
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:38,390
So next we have the sense duty analysis, which we do does form of a tornado chart.

103
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:47,569
This looks kind of fancy, but like this essentially explains the equivalent or the estimated expected value of the net monetary

104
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,340
benefit that we can have free up if you use guided RD for Crohn's disease instead of Stata.

105
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:01,480
And then this is a new sensitivity analysis that we did are comparing the response rates for guided Zen zero.

106
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,970
So this line that you see here,

107
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:11,170
this line indicates the equivalent value of cost effectiveness of using both interventions based on different response rates for the drugs.

108
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,420
And this was a similar analysis that we did of its structure and clarity.

109
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:22,810
And this section here, this line indicates the cost effectiveness of of both of being equal to each other.

110
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,750
So given the willingness to pay for diabetes as 158,

111
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:35,830
we take an analysis of kind of direct the fact that it could be more cost effective than other alternatives.

112
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,130
And then the limitations that we see to this excuse me,

113
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:45,400
the limitations we see for this analysis is this was an indirect comparison due to the lack of head to head branded.

114
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,030
And then, as I said, Alaska just got approved in June.

115
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,990
So we couldn't really find the transmission rates of various head states that are associated with Sky.

116
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:01,210
So what we did was because Chirurgie works on a similar mechanism of action as we used some of the other studies rates to,

117
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,620
you know, as guided Eastern insurance to calculate the numbers.

118
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:13,990
All right. Any questions? Thank you for for racing to get here, Mary.

119
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,250
I'm so sorry. There's an emergency landing and. Thanks for the presentation.

120
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:25,530
Anyone in the class? Any questions? Okay.

121
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:34,650
So I have some questions. If you go back to your your results or your kind of main result, if I understand correctly, is, um,

122
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:43,850
you know, STELARA looks expensive compared to Scott Rizzi and I mean, all of these are very expensive.

123
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:51,470
And then if you find your sensitivity analysis, it sounds like Guy Rizzi, I mean,

124
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:59,930
what's your conclusion about which one is better as you as you look at your sensitivity analysis, like like so this graph, for example, what is it?

125
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,190
What is it showing us?

126
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:12,590
So it's showing so the the red bars that you see that is where I think STELARA increases the numbers in from Scott it's like in the I mean in

127
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:21,319
terms of like the monetary numbers and like the line that you see here in the center like it talks about and it's like an equivalent value.

128
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:28,040
So like it says that if you use guided campaigns guide to do with steroids is that if if you use guided instead of

129
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:34,610
statistical we can have a like an expected on an equivalent value and which is in terms of the net monetary benefits,

130
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:41,420
which is what we're doing to kind of like associate the effect of the drug in terms of monitoring numbers.

131
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:48,530
So if you start over, Scott, I saw this guy videos that I know we can have a net monetary benefit of 150,000 is worth discussing.

132
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:54,080
Yeah. So this is and this is slightly different than what you might have seen with the incremental cost effectiveness ratio.

133
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,780
So this is that incremental net monetary benefit, it's putting a dollar value value in not only the cost,

134
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:06,710
but the quality is also putting high value to buy that certain amount and $150,000 a piece.

135
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:14,510
This if this of that monetary benefit is positive, that means Scott crazy is better than stellar, right?

136
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:21,920
Basically. And so as you vary those parameters, do any the parameters cause you to change your opinion about which one is better?

137
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:35,330
I mean, if you look at the response rate and if we are like willing to maybe extend the money that we are willing to spend for diabetes,

138
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:42,830
I think we should be looking at STELARA as a potential treatment because of the

139
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:48,350
response rate and the qualities that we get with getting treatment still at our word,

140
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:52,610
not significantly high, but like kind of high compared to Scott.

141
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:59,090
But given that we are at a threshold of 50,000, we think that this guidance is a better alternative.

142
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:07,640
And it I mean, as we look at this tornado, none of the bars go below zero, which would suggest that it's not so scary is the best.

143
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:14,410
And then on your next two graphs, you're also looking at crazy versus percentages.

144
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:21,320
Well, it's actually this is HUMIRA. You don't seem to want to wait.

145
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:28,549
Yes. So first we did this one and then we found out like the the number that we said we had.

146
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:33,290
Fortunately, the response that we had, which Deborah was was not exactly accurate.

147
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:41,420
So then we did it again with STELARA, but we decided to keep human out there so that, you know, and this is the in both these axes are.

148
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:45,200
How good is the response in the response rate? Yes.

149
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:57,100
Other questions. What was like the main limitations you found in your analysis?

150
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:05,080
This one. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. So like one of the main ones is that obviously we're supposed to do a brand new analysis that hasn't been conducted yet,

151
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,800
but we did have a little bit difficulty gathering data because there was no direct data on what we were going to use.

152
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:16,720
So a lot of our data was used in a study I think was 2008 by STELARA.

153
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:22,030
And so that was kind of what we used primarily for our analysis, but it was as accurate as we could be.

154
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:28,300
But obviously if there was more recent data and any data on Scott Rizzi, that would have made a big difference and made it even more convincing.

155
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:37,570
You would like to use some of the contacts at AbbVie, but as always like no one really responded with the datasets.

156
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:45,129
So yeah, we had to stick with still. Why don't we have the Doolittle Group?

157
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:54,520
Come on up and get ready. Any other questions? What's the law group is coming to see?

158
00:18:54,550 --> 00:19:15,120
Max is giving Kendra D class, so thank you very much. Seems like.

159
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,120
Yeah. Just while they're getting ready. Is that that incremental in that monitor?

160
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:38,790
We didn't really talk about that very much in this class, but it's typically when we compare one intervention to another,

161
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:44,549
we look at the incremental cost effectiveness ratio and we see how many more qualities are you getting,

162
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:50,940
what's the additional cost and looking at the ratio between those two. But sometimes it's particularly for sensitivity analysis.

163
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,620
It is useful to instead of looking at these two dimensions of costs and qualities,

164
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:04,290
try to convert both those things into a single metric, which would be a monetary value.

165
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,489
And where the costs are cost, that's pretty straightforward.

166
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:19,230
But the quality you take, the quality adjusted life years and then put a dollar value on those and in their case, they put $150,000 on that.

167
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:25,040
And then you then you put a dollar value on it on a policy instead of measuring two dimensions of costing points.

168
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,340
Okay. Sorry, you're not. Let's go ahead with the two so high, everyone.

169
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,559
Good morning. Today we're going to be talking about the cost effectiveness lens, just the table of contents.

170
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,560
I'm going to start off by giving an overview of what tools are their importance,

171
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,340
and then we're going to go into the methods and results of our analysis and then it's more discussion.

172
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:47,640
So kind of to start off, so what our do was first was are defined as someone trained and experienced in childbirth,

173
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:53,790
provides continuous physical, emotional and informational support to the mother before, during and just after birth.

174
00:20:54,300 --> 00:21:00,630
And this is a non-clinical aspect. So this type of care can include the creation of a personalized birth plan between the Dula and the mother,

175
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,810
education on breathing techniques, nutrition and breastfeeding,

176
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,360
provision of massages and other techniques that can help to reduce stress and trauma often experienced during childbirth,

177
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,300
as well as just support throughout the entire birth process.

178
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:19,860
So there's a lot of literature showcasing dual care to reduce caesarean and preterm births, as well as reduce postpartum depression.

179
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:28,620
Multiple other studies also found it can reduce assisted vaginal delivery as well as epidural rates and improve the overall experience of care.

180
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,920
Their ability to affect labor intervention rates positions them as part of a cost effective strategy for healthy births.

181
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:38,700
Childbirth is the most frequent reason for hospitalization in the United States,

182
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:45,120
and charges for maternity and newborn care exceed those for any other category of hospital expense for both public and private payers.

183
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:45,959
For example,

184
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:52,800
cesarean delivery is cost twice as much as vaginal deliveries and infants born preterm incur medical costs ten times higher than full comforts.

185
00:21:53,130 --> 00:22:00,580
Doula care alone is estimated to save almost $1,000 per birth and then kind of focusing in on our ACA.

186
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,379
So the goal of ours is to expand upon the literature previous analysis on doulas

187
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,710
to prove the value of insurance companies offering coverage for doula services.

188
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:14,130
A recent Congressional research report found that two thirds of Americans have either employer sponsored or individually elected coverage.

189
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,830
Since the majority of Americans currently have a private payer and they are most likely to fulfill the burden of dual coverage costs,

190
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,439
we hope to understand the costs of cost effectiveness.

191
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:29,880
From that perspective, the cost of birth dual services varies widely, but averages between 820 $500,

192
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,180
which is in addition to the already high expenses of pregnancy and childbirth.

193
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,809
As health insurance programs do not typically offer coverage for these services,

194
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:40,170
many women who would benefit from the care are then unable to access it.

195
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,600
And then, in addition, on the right side, you can see our population. A focus for the CIA is pregnant women of color.

196
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:51,030
Racial and ethnic minorities have higher rates of cesarean deliveries and worse birth outcomes than their white counterparts.

197
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:55,140
But not a lot of the studies kind of accounted for this disproportionate burden.

198
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,719
Our group finds it important to try to focus on those populations and patient centered care providers such as doulas advocate

199
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,660
for patients who are systemically discriminated against in health care settings and then know it will go on to our methods.

200
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:14,100
Yes. So for our methods, we really focused on increasing the cost effectiveness of the doula care.

201
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:20,819
So through our analysis, we really work to understand how the dual care impacts preterm birth and the rates of C-section by

202
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:27,610
comparing studies with data on the on these two topics that showed both rates with and without.

203
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,920
The time horizon that we looked at was the duration of pregnancy.

204
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:37,350
And this is based upon our research tool is that that shows that doing provide a minimum of two

205
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:45,959
prenatal visits and one visit during active labor and sometimes something after gives birth.

206
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:52,020
But we couldn't find any data on that, so we didn't include that. So estimating health outcomes and costs,

207
00:23:52,200 --> 00:24:00,690
the health outcomes that we are looking at are preterm births versus full term births and cesarean delivery versus a vaginal delivery.

208
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,589
And the costs included in this were the costs avoided from reducing need for

209
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:08,880
clinical procedures during labor or birth and reducing birth complications.

210
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:15,630
Prenatal or reduced prenatal and postpartum visits and costs and the cost of the doula themselves.

211
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:21,260
So our data data analysis really looked at and in.

212
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,849
Formal literature review of six different studies that we found that had data

213
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:28,840
on our desired health outcomes in regards to a care versus individual care.

214
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:35,770
And this was a mixture of data that had some had just the health outcomes of dual care,

215
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:40,150
and there was one that was a cost effective analysis that we used some of the costs from.

216
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:52,150
And only one of the studies that we looked at had the actual costs laid out for dual care and the costs and how much it reduced by.

217
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:59,290
So we really just use it from that one study for the cost and compare that in the generalization to the rest of our data that we found,

218
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,940
which I should go over in the results.

219
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:12,010
And so by using this data, we were able to estimate the costs of doulas, preterm births, term births, vaginal delivery, C-section said.

220
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:17,350
And then we also had one of our studies showed quality.

221
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,750
So we pulled the colleagues from that to estimate.

222
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:27,790
And then we used a decision tree and we ran a sensitivity analysis that allowed us to calculate the ICER household results.

223
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:28,750
Excellent work.

224
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,770
So this is a quick overview of our parameters and includes all of our possible outcomes or probabilities of each outcome and the costs.

225
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:41,140
And our policy decision is a dual care and we're comparing it to the status quo, which is now dual care,

226
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:48,160
and each one has four possible outcomes that include pre-term and C-section, preterm vaginal trauma C-section and term vaginal.

227
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:54,670
And as you can see, under the probabilities that we pull from our literature review with due to being present for the mother,

228
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,830
the probability of preterm and C-section births is lower as compared to no doula care.

229
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:08,050
Our median cost of care that we estimated was 70 $100 since I was kind of the middle of the range of 250, 120 $500,

230
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:16,480
the cost of C-sections averaged a little bit over $13,000, and the cost of the vaginal delivery average a little bit over $7,000.

231
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,020
And the cost of a preterm birth is around $76,000.

232
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,480
By adding those together, we got the total costs of each outcome for each of the two possible scenarios.

233
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:31,060
We also we're estimating our remaining maternal life expectancy, which we place at 55 years.

234
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:35,710
And we also had the utilities of the quality of life for the mother following a vaginal delivery at one,

235
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:43,270
and the utility of the quality of life for a mother following the C-section, which was 0.996, which help us calculate the lifetime maternal qualities.

236
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:47,680
So this is our decision tree. So obviously we started with our policy decision,

237
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,959
which is to let care being provided during the first trimester and for whether Tula was present or another low was present.

238
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:59,610
We looked at whether the pregnancy was full term or preterm with all the probabilities and the costs and then moving on to what not.

239
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,620
The delivery was used, whether it was a C-section or Aboriginal.

240
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:10,180
And while you're looking at this decision tree, at first it might seem that to care is more expensive,

241
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:17,620
since the most expensive outcome is a C-section delivery that is preterm to a present at over $91,000.

242
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,000
And the lowest cost is going to be about, you know, delivery times forward from a not to a present.

243
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,990
However, we weren't looking at just one outcome for each scenario.

244
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:30,760
We wanted to see how the policy impacts cost for any scenario,

245
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:36,130
any outcome that the mothers can experience, whether it is a C-section full term or a vaginal preterm.

246
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:43,510
So in order to do that, we multiplied the joint probabilities of each outcome with the total costs for each outcome,

247
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:48,100
and we got the total expected cost for our policy, which was a little bit over $40,000.

248
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,090
And the total expected cost for no due care is a little bit over $50,000.

249
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:58,569
We also did the same method for to calculate the total expected qualities which, as you can see, are higher for do I care than not?

250
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:03,430
Do I care? We don't use those numbers to calculate our incremental cost effectiveness ratio,

251
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:11,890
which is -$56,000 to 65 and $0.66, which shows that to care is more cost effective than to care.

252
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:17,139
In order to run our sensitivity analysis, we just chose five different cost of doing care,

253
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:24,340
since that is the parameter that we're changing, since that is a cost that varies widely across the United States.

254
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:29,950
Depending on where the mother lives, she will be experiencing different costs for having a present.

255
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:40,060
So we started off at $0 and then we went up to $5,000 in size, basically more than what the high average range that we have for dollar cost currently.

256
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:45,000
And on the right we have our cost affecting this plain and on the.

257
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,180
Exactly, exactly. You have to call these the y axis is the cost.

258
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,780
And as you can see, we decided on the $100,000 threshold and with the cost range from 0 to $3000,

259
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:02,890
that the incremental cost effectiveness ratio falls below our threshold and we recommend for the policy to be implemented.

260
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:08,380
But when it is over $5,000, the cost effectiveness is over $100,000.

261
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:16,390
So in those instances, it might not be as cost effective for the insurance companies to implement this situation, implementing this policy.

262
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,469
And that marker will go off with our discussion. All right. Thank you, Keisha.

263
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,720
So now we're going to move. Forward into our discussion.

264
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:30,190
So the results of our finding are useful to public health in general because like many of the Medicaid based studies that we looked at,

265
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:34,570
do the care is also cost effective as an intervention for private insurers as well.

266
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:42,309
And because employer sponsored and individually elected insurance programs are so prevalent in private, insurers take interest in do care.

267
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:49,270
It may ultimately help to mitigate social determinants of health that adversely affect us women who are most vulnerable to poor birth outcomes.

268
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:57,310
For example, research shows that black women more frequently desired but were less unable to access due to support versus white women.

269
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:03,460
So routine sizing and implementing professional do care through private insurer coverage

270
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,960
may be important for improving outcomes among these women and reducing health disparities.

271
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:15,130
Further, this information may prove to be an incentive because there are cost saving implications for both insurers and hospitals.

272
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:21,490
As our data shows and Cash explained, de la Care reduces the probability of C-sections at both term and preterm birth

273
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:26,110
and reduces the probability of preterm births overall and as an example,

274
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:31,809
for C-section specifically. Previous related studies have shown that there is a chance for a reduction in procedures,

275
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:37,120
costs and also associated costs that come from complications like maternal death,

276
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:44,530
uterine rupture, cesarean hysterectomy and other complications that can come as a result of a prior C-section birth.

277
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:52,250
So from our analysis, we found a few a few key limitations that we found important.

278
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:58,100
The first is that we know the disproportionate impact of birth complications on black women and other women of color.

279
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:02,870
And we posit that the information that we found in our study is applicable to these groups.

280
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,500
However,

281
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:11,630
we had difficulty generalizing our data to these groups because the current literature focuses on a mixture of minority and non minority populations.

282
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:18,590
In the same vein, a majority of the current literature on cost effectiveness Rule of care for insurers

283
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:24,950
mostly focuses on Medicaid rather than private insurers or employer elected insurance.

284
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:31,070
Third, we had difficulty collecting data that was stratified by when the dollar began.

285
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:44,100
Care information comparing results at which the trimester of care began may impact the level of cost effectiveness for adult care intervention.

286
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,840
And finally,

287
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:52,429
it's important to note that the cost of dual care that we utilize in our data is an average of the average range of costs that vary by state,

288
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:57,200
meaning that cost effectiveness may be higher in some states than others lead to different considerations.

289
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:05,900
So beyond our analysis, the most important next step is to conduct more research on minority or at risk populations as the sample.

290
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:12,260
Because, as stated, these are the groups that are most impacted and can have the most to gain from dual care.

291
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,380
Yet from the perspective of private insurers,

292
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:20,420
there is little data considering this group specifically and then further state or regional cost effective analysis

293
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:27,049
for Do LA Care may be useful to private insurers to allow them to make decisions on what level of dual care is cost,

294
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:32,750
at what level? Dual care is effective based on the state because as we know, this cost varies.

295
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:37,970
So with more literature to support the cost effectiveness Abdullah care related to our studies parameters,

296
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:44,600
there will be more evidence to incentivize private insurers to provide these much needed services to the people that need it most.

297
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,530
So with that, that concludes our presentation. Thank you so much.

298
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:55,340
And we will now open for questions. Questions from the.

299
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:01,230
Yes. A quiet, very thorough.

300
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:13,930
So actually, you know, one thing you mentioned here is the limitation is that there's not a lot of really great data,

301
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,150
particularly for for minority populations.

302
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:26,590
The the effectiveness, though, I would argue, is challenging to estimate because it's all from observational studies.

303
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:39,280
How about you try to determine, you know, really get a sense of what is the true efficacy of of do look care.

304
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:45,170
Yeah. I think if you were to design a study to yeah.

305
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:54,100
I mean like what resources obviously a like being able to assign like a control group and not control unnecessarily.

306
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,989
Surprising thing there is if you think that there is a benefit from having a tool.

307
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:03,610
So I think probably an observational study is probably the best way to go.

308
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:15,280
By allowing like giving to a care to, to women and seeing if the costs or rates of C-section or preterm births do drop.

309
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:19,059
There are other parameters that a lot of studies looked at that we didn't use just

310
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:24,280
because it wasn't like we couldn't find enough data on it and it wasn't very consistent.

311
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:29,979
So I think there's also a lot of other health outcomes that we didn't look at that were also very important to look at.

312
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:36,490
So yeah, some of the time and resource and money and I think doing an observational study

313
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:42,340
where you were assigned towards to pregnant individuals to allow them to link,

314
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:46,900
to allow us to find how much it actually impacts.

315
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:54,659
Great. Although I will say, you know, you mentioned it'd be considered unethical not to give people dollars,

316
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,629
but I mean, presumably if you had a research grant and you said,

317
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:05,180
I've got $1,000,000 and and I've got, you know, a population maybe where we need $2 million to give to us,

318
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,859
everyone would say, well, we we did the best we could with the money we had.

319
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,909
And we got the coin and these people got the dollars and these people didn't.

320
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:17,280
But then we study them all. Yeah, I'm just presume that might be better than just everyone.

321
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,020
No one getting too lazy at the beginning.

322
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:28,020
And oftentimes there are policies like that that do seem like flipping coins that that are maybe aren't totally fair or thought out where,

323
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:36,540
you know, some, you know, if we are rolling out a new program and people last names a through age get get first

324
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:43,470
dibs and then the people in the end of the alphabet get you get the intervention later.

325
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:49,770
I think it could be interesting to assign people who want them do want them because

326
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:56,160
you know we found that generally women of color ask for do list more often than not.

327
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,440
Yet most of us are upper middle class white women serving upper middle class white men.

328
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:06,029
So it could be interesting to. Anyway, sorry.

329
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:10,049
I think there are other questions from the right. Yeah, I was just curious.

330
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:15,020
Did you find that the cost effectiveness to do list for women of color was, I guess,

331
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,570
greater than the cost effectiveness for dealers or just the general population?

332
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:23,580
So we weren't able to find data that specifically only focused on women of color.

333
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,460
They were kind of just grouped in with like the general population.

334
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:34,979
But we like talking about we kind of think like since these women of color are like a global population that usually is discriminated against,

335
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:42,330
doesn't have the same access to resources, doesn't receive health care at the same level, it doesn't care is cost effective for a general population.

336
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:47,420
It will be more cost effective for a population that is already disadvantaged things.

337
00:36:52,540 --> 00:37:00,519
I'm just kind of curious, when you were researching and stuff, how often or how much do insurance companies kind of currently cover?

338
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:07,960
Do I care? I'm working on this right now at BCBS actually, so it's almost nonexistent in the private space because of policy.

339
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,940
Like in the state of Michigan,

340
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:16,960
at least like you have to be a licensed provider to be able to be covered by insurance and doulas are licensed currently.

341
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:20,660
However, Medicaid is starting to cover. It varies state by state.

342
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:27,489
Michigan is starting to do it January 2023. So our hope is that that'll start kind of increasing demand from the employer side.

343
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:33,910
Maybe employers will start asking more about it, and that can lead to possible licensure being available.

344
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:38,560
But right now in the private space, it really is nonexistent. But Medicaid, it's starting to slowly expand.

345
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:44,380
Yeah, there are about six states that cover it either completely or reimburse it through Medicaid.

346
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:56,870
You might not know this about Cleveland, but you mentioned that this could be cost saving for hospitals as well, too.

347
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:03,229
So is this a usually fully bundled hospital service complication like a C-section that

348
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:07,640
would end up being a cost for the hospital rather than the payment from insurance company?

349
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:11,959
Yeah, it would end up being more of a cost to the hospital as well as the insurance company.

350
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:20,720
But there is kind of that that tandem, I guess, just because there are additional treatment costs that come with a C-section.

351
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,850
Like I mentioned, there's a lot of complications that can come after. But also, there's the procedural cost as well.

352
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,750
You also know those metal cages.

353
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:38,410
But do you know if like for Medicaid, is it just like a state plan option that any state can just like choose to cover?

354
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,690
Or do they have to get like special approval from CMS to cover?

355
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:45,280
I'm not 100% sure on like if it needs CMS approval.

356
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:49,369
I know in Michigan it's been like a pending policy like in Congress for a couple

357
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:54,019
of months now and it just got approved in November or October very recently,

358
00:38:54,020 --> 00:39:00,829
and it's starting to begin in January 2023. And I know like New York is in the process currently of trying to like it's a they have a policy proposed.

359
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:04,850
So I think it just depends on the state and their personal like Congress.

360
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:09,530
But I mean I also CMS could be to say to I really don't know you.

361
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:23,040
All right. Well, thank you very much, because we like the questions.

362
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:29,519
Yeah, that was a really nice question about think about the payor and and the hospital system and bundled payments.

363
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,159
And if the hospital you just gets a single lump sum for your delivery,

364
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:40,440
then they have a lot of incentives to reduce C-sections and maybe would be interested

365
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,639
in having to do a lot and paying for the do to reduce the C-section rates,

366
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:52,799
for example. But on the other hand, if the hospitals just get paid more for a C-section, then they have no incentive to avoid C-sections.

367
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,660
Right. Then that's just extra revenue for them. That's an interesting question, too.

368
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:05,010
And then I think, you know, several things brought up the, um, how a lot of this is not just the economics of it,

369
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:09,180
but it's the legal structures about you have to be licensed or not.

370
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:17,190
And whether it's Medicaid or payers Medicaid rules, then then state, other state insurance plans.

371
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:23,549
And so there are a lot of sort of legal issues involved in some of these policies as well, outside of the kind of economics of it.

372
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:29,280
But presumably the better the economics are in terms of, you know, so like guess if it is really cost effective,

373
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:35,459
that does provide a lot of pressure or push to change those those laws to to allow in this case a

374
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:42,150
law would do was to make it easier and well allow but make it easier for people to get to rights.

375
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,720
Hi. Good morning, everyone. We're the genetic screening group.

376
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:59,970
And this is our final presentation on a prospective analysis of cell free and five screening at any point is in the second trimester.

377
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:07,350
So just for a bit of introduction and background. Aneuploidy are defined as extra or missing chromosomes.

378
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:13,170
The four most common antibodies are trisomy 13, 18 and 21 and then Nozomi X.

379
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:19,200
These are the four genetic inequalities that we were analyzing in our analysis.

380
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:27,780
So unfortunately, Trisomy 13 and 18, anyone first with those genetic conditions usually do die by the age of one.

381
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:33,560
And then also Mate X is the only deleterious chromosome disorder that results in a of birth.

382
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:42,410
All others are fatal. So fetal antibodies are responsible for around 50% of loss in early pregnancy and are present in 20 to 42 conceptions.

383
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:49,660
It's a very wide spread genetic issue and current screening tests are subject to varying levels of specificity and sensitivity.

384
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:55,350
So essentially all that means is that the different tests are better at indicating different genetic disorders.

385
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,020
So the two that we are comparing are the cell free DNA screening and the second trimester quadruple marker test,

386
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:05,610
which we refer to as the pod screening moving forward. They are both noninvasive blood screening tests.

387
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:10,440
The only difference is the cell free DNA screening is looking for free floating fetal DNA in mother's blood,

388
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:17,910
whereas the pod screen is looking for biomarkers of four different components in the mother's life that are indicative of these genetic disorders.

389
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:29,049
Current medical guidelines from providers only really push genetic screening for high risk groups, which are women of childbearing age.

390
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:36,440
I think it's like 35 and above your odds of having a child with a genetic disorder increase exponentially age factors,

391
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:38,520
appearance and a patient or family history.

392
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,860
And you know, the main question that our analysis is trying to answer is whether from the patient perspective,

393
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,220
whether the cfdna or the quads screening makes sense or no screening at all.

394
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:58,430
So the target population, population from our study design where the pregnant woman in the U.S. as well as their children.

395
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:05,260
So we want to know from both of those perspectives which of these screening options made more sense in order to pull this data?

396
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:10,159
We took it from the health statistics National Vital Statistics System for the time horizon.

397
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:15,469
We wanted to focus on the entire lifetime of the pregnant women as well as the children.

398
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:18,350
And the reason why we did this was because there are also aspects of miscarriage,

399
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:23,570
termination and all of those different decisions that might come up during the pregnancy process.

400
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:25,400
As I said earlier,

401
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:32,600
the study perspective is patients and the outcomes that we looked at were mainly the incremental incremental costs and quality adjusted life years.

402
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:36,560
In order to do our analysis, we started with a decision tree,

403
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:44,480
so we mapped out all of the possibilities from conception up until termination or birth afterwards and collected some data.

404
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,469
And then we were able to find some data on qualities and costs,

405
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:52,910
but we also had to estimate some of that based on our own knowledge about these diseases.

406
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:57,170
And then afterwards we did a one way sensitivity analysis and then interpretation.

407
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,680
And then to just briefly walk you through our decision tree.

408
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:07,830
Over here, we have our initial decision of whether or not to proceed with genetic screening into pregnancy.

409
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:14,070
So from moving out to screening, you can see that stops and continues over there or some the non screening.

410
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:21,209
We then divided it up five in the population of aneuploidy versus a genetically standard test your odds of having a

411
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:27,200
pregnancy with safely and then have divided it further into the prevalence of population of these unfortunately.

412
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:32,100
So that we are looking at and whether or not these probably result in live birth or miscarriage.

413
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:35,640
And then from here, this is the branch for each of our screening tests.

414
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:40,199
So either DNA and cloud screening that are structured the same way but have

415
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:45,030
different probabilities based on their sensitivity and specificity of the tests.

416
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:53,300
So this is our baseline data in our data are basically supported by literature reviews.

417
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,400
So really at papers or not found.

418
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:06,580
We'll just use data collected from online resources and a couple of I mean for example the blogs me explaining the causes of

419
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:16,220
and ask me X but basically use the mean of all three try to meet to calculate as numbers and some some of the data was not.

420
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,430
We're not found in literatures.

421
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:33,440
We also made assumptions, for example, that specifically for screening for trisomy 18 and 2013 and so, etc. For 2013, we assumed that to 100%.

422
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:41,220
Although it cannot be that high. So but we just make those assumptions to make the model run and.

423
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:51,460
Yeah. And we also have a collapse of the quality of life and life expectancy data.

424
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:58,940
Since we did not since as I just mentioned, we also consider the shallow perspective.

425
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:05,830
But it is pretty hard for us to find those data in the leisure reviews because it is hard to

426
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:13,510
measure the quality of life for our children while they pass away in one month or two months.

427
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:19,030
So we also make assumptions based on our daily collection of life expectancy.

428
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:25,510
For example, you can see the life expectancy for a child with trisomy 21 is 60.

429
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:31,390
So we just make assumptions of the quality of life.

430
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:39,250
0.8 And we can see the life expectancy for children with trisomy 18 and 13 is less than one year.

431
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:43,080
We just make that assumption too.

432
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:50,990
And similar for children with Family X, I mean, ask me X, which is 30.

433
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:56,050
We make the assumption that is point five. Yes.

434
00:46:56,050 --> 00:47:02,860
So we because those level of quality of life are not lifetime quality of life.

435
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:12,560
So we first calculated a quality reduction using it caused by a disease using those two parts of data and

436
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:18,640
then apply a decision tree and calculate the qualities for mothers and cost per household or for pregnancy.

437
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:26,940
And furthermore, we also calculate a quality for our newborns based on our assumptions.

438
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:30,490
But those possibilities for discussion for.

439
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:45,700
So this is our result of our analysis. So we observe that cell free DNA as cost saving, as cause effective compared to bus winning.

440
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:54,190
So is the DNA screening will save about 1,000 USD more than screening tests per pregnancy if we

441
00:47:54,190 --> 00:48:02,670
use the annual cohort of 3.6 million libraries per year and that will keep everything constant.

442
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:08,140
We will have cut DNA save about 4.8 billion USD per year.

443
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:25,720
Well, that screening also the the cost, the C.F. DNA screening will have the incremental quality of .01616 compared to the ask for screening.

444
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:37,970
And so yeah, again, it is cost effective is cost effective compared to screening and both tests are cost effective compared to nothing.

445
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:46,980
Thank you. So I did follow up on the sensitivity analysis.

446
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:53,070
The upper bound and lower bound data from the data just haven't just showed.

447
00:48:53,520 --> 00:49:00,240
And we create a tornado diagram of the ten most influential factors of the here.

448
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:04,710
And based on this diagram, we could complete a three minute takeaway.

449
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:11,670
So first is the the class brings activity of trust month 21 has the largest impact on

450
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:17,940
the model is very obviously here which makes a lot of sense because from the contrary,

451
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:26,700
we know that of course, spring sensitivity play a very part in the role and trust 21 is the most common and impolite.

452
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:37,950
And so this factor is very important. And the second one is the overall self-rated you as being in dominant position compared to the classical,

453
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:48,600
because in most cases your ICR are negative, which means the self rating is when is more cost effective.

454
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:56,670
And classically there is the one exception, just the fourth that self in general specifically also self.

455
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:04,170
Which leads to the third one takeaway which is the low self rating is because it

456
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:09,150
may make the self rate in bringing not more dominant to the course screening

457
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:27,900
because just as the air is a positive but at a still in the range of opinion is to pay the $5,377 are of just black so which is totally acceptable.

458
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:31,970
So one is anterior analysis.

459
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:36,090
So next they will talk about the decision cards. Thank you.

460
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,320
Okay. So discussion. What can we learn from model?

461
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:47,670
Well, our results tell us that insurance and government should build infrastructure to support cell free DNA at the current status.

462
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:52,890
This is exciting. We look forward to seeing where this goes.

463
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,130
We're also looking at a few different things as well.

464
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:02,190
So I'm looking around the room and you all are a little bit glazed over and you're like, Why does this apply to me?

465
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:07,440
You know, who cares if I'm male? Like, I'm not the mother I have in the baby.

466
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,870
But, you know, perspective does matter.

467
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:19,440
And also, I was thinking back upon why we should all care about things like this and the data collection and how many of us have seen Gattaca.

468
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,200
Gattaca is one of my favorite movies of all time.

469
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:28,190
This kind of research that we're talking about right now is what is going to lead to decisions were made in Gattaca.

470
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:35,150
Right. And so what we're looking at is, okay, if we take all this data, there's still so much left out right on.

471
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:41,579
When I was going through, I had to make this assumption to make this model run. So we have a long way to go before we get to that future of Gattaca.

472
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:48,750
Right? We also have some ethical things to consider. So we decided to look at the perspective of the mother and the children because they

473
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:51,870
are the people who are going to be living with the results of whatever occurs.

474
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:59,370
So depending on if we're choosing this perspective, like if we chose the insurer or the government, maybe they would prefer screening.

475
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:04,500
But we were like, No, we're going to look at the patient. So things to consider as you move forward.

476
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,070
And we also need to consider the tradeoffs and calculating the quality of life for children.

477
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,550
What is best for the mother and the fetus may not be best for the child that's born.

478
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:18,299
And so looking at that and considering that, that's a big ethical question,

479
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:24,000
like looking forward and that's a lot of morals you're weighing, again, that Gattaca mindset of what we do.

480
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:30,810
And so we need thinking of that theory, thinking of that ethical and the next steps.

481
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:38,390
I'm again come back to okay, well, given what we know now, which is always subject to change, what can you do?

482
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:44,760
And the biggest thing would be the stakeholders who are financially invested and have all of those resources

483
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:51,000
invested should begin to build infrastructure and processes and systems that are effective for the patient.

484
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:56,370
So there's a lot of limitations. I think we all know this.

485
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,870
Thankfully, we all are somewhat aware in this room this isn't going to be scary.

486
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,100
But for people like insurers and governments who a lot of skin in the game, this might be.

487
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:09,690
But it's hard it's hard to look at this time framing.

488
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:13,140
So there's no gold standard to measure the time impact on quality of life.

489
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:20,130
We're making a lot of assumptions and who knows, like what the child's actual quality of life is after being born.

490
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:23,909
We kind of discussed that Ellen last week talked about it.

491
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:30,930
So kind of thinking about that, the quality of life, taking prenatal screenings, pregnancy loss with or without future pregnancies.

492
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:39,490
Again, that does termination does affect how the mother might affect how the mother is able to use her reproductive systems in the future.

493
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:46,370
Well. So life expectancy for children and employees might be longer due to different changes in technology,

494
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:49,730
quality of life termination, miscarriage from the newborn perspective.

495
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:54,979
Look through it all. There's so much it's going to be. Depend a lot on the preferences.

496
00:53:54,980 --> 00:54:01,730
It's going to depend a lot on the locations. We've all kind of talked about how much, especially in our federalist system,

497
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:07,670
how much depends upon the state you live in, the legislation, how much depends on the insurance system you're a part of.

498
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,970
So looking at all of that, so kind of the main takeaway is this is pretty cool.

499
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:18,200
There were a lot of assumptions made. We have a lot more data to look at.

500
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:25,040
Our big result was that cell free DNA would be the most cost effective for the mother and the fetus.

501
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,440
But again, that's taking into account the perspective. So that's kind of what my group has worked on.

502
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:37,100
So the next steps of this is to repeat the study. Again, we there's a lot of data to be collected, right?

503
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:44,299
Like so much data. So we'd love to kind of collect more that data that was missing do somewhat with more expert oversight.

504
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:50,390
Because as amazing as these individuals here are, we're not maybe complete experts quite yet.

505
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:56,990
So looking at that and then we also want to consider the different study perspectives, health care systems, locations,

506
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:04,610
and really focus on that patient perspective and then understand the collisions between where the mother and fetus,

507
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:09,710
what options they have based upon their location, health systems, what have you.

508
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:18,920
And then ultimately, we want to analyze how those different places, how those different time frames affect the mother and the child and warehouse.

509
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:23,540
So that's kind of where we're at and where we have to go. So thank you for listening to us.

510
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:27,530
Hopefully we made you change your mind or think about Gekko again.

511
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:37,220
Thank you. Oh, my.

512
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:42,350
Go ahead. So I saw you guys did some adoption in the metal section.

513
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:52,009
I'm just, like, curious to know what was the basis because I think for one assumption you are assigning a probability of point 2 to 1 year,

514
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:56,160
whereas for another adoption you're assigning like point 5 to 13 years.

515
00:55:56,180 --> 00:56:00,229
So I'm just like curious to know what was on this one.

516
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:07,700
So the main reasoning behind the point two is mainly thinking about, you know, what will the quality of be like once you actually board it?

517
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:13,910
Oftentimes a lot of these babies with Trisomy 13 and 18 end up having to go to the hospital in the ICU,

518
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:17,690
needing breathing support and all of that, which I think is a lot worse than, you know,

519
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:23,870
someone who might be trisomy 21, who does have, you know, a longer time outside of the hospital versus,

520
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:28,460
you know, have you a back and forth taking all the medications that someone with 1318 might have as well.

521
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:36,649
And then the you know, the length of or the the longevity of both of those are not assumptions.

522
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:39,590
But I think that there is also variation within that one year, you know,

523
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:42,890
whether some lived two months to 12 months and you want to account for that as well,

524
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:48,200
rather than assume that anyone who was born with Trisomy 1318 is born for that entire one year.

525
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:55,340
So I think that point to sort of comes from both the actual longevity and all of the things that they had to undergo while they're alive.

526
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:04,969
Did you guys,

527
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:11,840
in your conclusion in analysis to talk about like health equity considerations because like obviously this is probably partially genetic,

528
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:18,140
these like aneuploidy, but I'm sure that to some extent it's influenced by like if you're exposed to toxic chemicals in your environment, right?

529
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:25,700
Because DNA mutations and all that. So do you guys like consider like, oh, some groups are more likely to experience one genetically,

530
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:31,070
but also just based on with the environments in which they live more likely to experience these abnormalities.

531
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:37,590
I think there's some consideration into multiple pregnancies.

532
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:43,440
So if you have a genetic history of these genetic disorders, then you're more likely to get the screening in the first place.

533
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:49,920
And unfortunately, if you have like a previous miscarriage or other sort of non viability of your pregnancy,

534
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,350
you're again more likely to get the screening in the first place.

535
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:58,950
Some of our considerations for the conclusions was to make this more widespread as it's more available, because as we mentioned,

536
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:04,409
it's the more specific groups of family history, risk factors that are being pushed into the genetic screening.

537
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:07,889
But if it is more cost effective to offer it to more people,

538
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:14,970
we thought that there would be more room to be able to do those kinds of investigations into family histories, environmental considerations as well.

539
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:27,580
She's. Well, thank you very much.

540
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:32,170
And we'll get the end of life group here, too.

541
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:46,250
Thank you. And actually, as they're getting ready, you know, I will say I appreciate the comments about kind of the ethics of this policy decision.

542
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:51,129
This is this is an interesting one. And, of course, you can think about ethics with almost any policy question.

543
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:54,220
But this is one particularly where that's that's salient.

544
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:59,110
And and as we know, of course, I'm teaching this class and cost effective policies.

545
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:05,079
I think it's very important. Hopefully you do, too. But it's not the only thing we care about when we're making these policy decisions.

546
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:11,620
And there are other things kind of outside of just the economics and crude already adjusted life years.

547
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,469
That is that's important for the policy decision making.

548
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:22,810
And I like the you know, in your main analysis, you really focused on that quality adjusted life years of the of the the mother.

549
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:27,850
But you did also calculate what about the quality of life perspective for that newborn.

550
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:33,810
And and but it's difficult to know quite how to how to value that in those you know,

551
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:41,709
like you said there are a lot of other issues go there about subsequent children and so forth that you weren't able to incorporate analysis.

552
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:45,580
And it's difficult to know precisely how to look at that as well. Thank you.

553
00:59:56,790 --> 01:00:28,120
Because. It's simply.

554
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:35,670
Stored up in the fridge.

555
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,620
Hi, everyone. Sorry I lost my voice, so apologize.

556
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:42,540
It's all like this.

557
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:52,049
But my group and I are going to go over the cost effective analysis of palliative curative palliative care for mostly pancreatic cancer society.

558
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:57,540
Agenda for our presentation. We're going to go over the introduction and background, go into the methods,

559
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:03,100
results, discussion, and then have some time for question answer to start it off.

560
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:11,370
I want to go through just three quick definitions or two definitions and what metastatic figurative cancers, pancreatic cancer.

561
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:17,850
Pancreatic cancer is where the tumors spread beyond the pancreas, which different parts of the organs of the body.

562
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:28,050
Palliative care is the primary goal of increasing and maintaining quality of life versus prolonging the life year of the patient.

563
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:33,270
And the period of care is primary goal just prolonging the life of the patient.

564
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:41,190
So this is a late stage cancer, and the purpose of our paper is to do an analysis on financial,

565
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:46,379
financial costs, quality of life, life, years in quality, adjusted life,

566
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:55,260
years for the patient that has the static pancreatic cancer also is short form of it and that are undergoing through types of care,

567
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:58,950
either palliative curative or both palliative curative care.

568
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:05,880
From a health care perspective, which is to focus on patient providers as well as the care,

569
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:13,350
it's a primary objectives of palliative and curative care are different for each treatment will have

570
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:20,700
a primary outcome which will be measured alongside palliative curative and both palliative care.

571
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:28,139
The primary outcome palliative care will be measured in quality of life and curative care will be measured in life,

572
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:32,340
years and in the model that's going to be used for our analysis as a market model.

573
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:37,380
And the reason for that is because the analysis focuses on multiple years of data.

574
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:44,070
So it just made sense to go with kind of model. And this is very important for multiple reasons.

575
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:55,140
And the three major reasons are it's going to help make patients make better informed decisions both personally and financially.

576
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:01,320
And then it can aid insurance companies in determining what the reimbursement rates should be.

577
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:08,220
So I'm going to hand it over to Thomas is going to go into more detail about the methods of our cost of doing business.

578
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:16,150
Okay. Thanks. So from our perspective, we took the health care sector for one reason.

579
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:24,940
It's. The perspective that almost every analysis or study we looked at took our time horizon is just around the

580
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:32,140
time diagnosis to about five years because the media found the survival after five years is about 3.1%.

581
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:35,560
So most people are dead after five years. Our outcomes.

582
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:39,390
I remember looking at costs, health, utility expense, expectancy.

583
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:43,120
Our model is really basic because once you have metastatic pancreatic cancer,

584
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:47,440
you don't go anywhere but die or you survive with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

585
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,600
And treatment regimens.

586
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:55,450
Such interventions for looking out are going to be really care by itself, sure to serve by itself in a combination of the states.

587
01:03:57,670 --> 01:04:04,510
So, I mean, families are looking at are once again some of the mortality rate here, the cost colleagues are using.

588
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:11,580
And after discovering that 3% and this is just the overview of the parameter values that we have with their ranges and parentheses.

589
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:15,360
So the number by itself is a base value and the ranges are in the presence.

590
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:24,010
So for our parameters, we kind of the way we did is we needed some information.

591
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:29,050
And then from that information we could estimate a value.

592
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:34,690
So for our retelling rates, we needed the five year survival rate of the general U.S. population,

593
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:43,820
and then we needed some retrospective or experimental study data that kind of related receiving first line treatment to know for line treatment,

594
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:49,660
which is representative of our curative groups. An important assumption we have to make, though,

595
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:54,370
is that area of care is not really being studied in this model and that is

596
01:04:54,370 --> 01:05:00,220
because many of the studies that did suggest that cancer does are retrospective.

597
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:04,329
So there is no determination of a causal association.

598
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:09,490
And also there's a very small interval between the initial period of care console and death.

599
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:16,970
This was usually around 2 to 4 months. So if there was an increase in the length of life, this would be very minimal.

600
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:21,880
And not only that, it was very hard for us to quantify due to the nature of the studies themselves,

601
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,660
but that does make the calculation mortality rates easier for us.

602
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:31,599
And we're basically just going to have a treat for those that received curative care.

603
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:36,249
Andrew did not. So really quick, don't even worry about all this.

604
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:44,200
We take the Seer five year survival rate and we can convert that to a U.S. population median survival time, which is conveniently just one year.

605
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:49,810
And then we can take a ratio of the values that we found in the study that we're taking our data from,

606
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:54,670
and then multiply that by the US median survival time.

607
01:05:55,330 --> 01:06:00,159
So in this case, that allowed us to calculate our yearly mortality rates,

608
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:09,370
which ended up being .42 and .68 respectively for curative and not for care in terms of uncertainty.

609
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:15,729
We are putting both of the values be bounded by point five, which is the population mean, just for argument's sake,

610
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:21,100
to say, hey, what if this intervention resulted in no difference from the average population?

611
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:32,020
So lower bound for curative where we use the median survival of the treatment group that had the highest value of median survival.

612
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:35,889
So I'd be the least amount of data you would expect from curative care.

613
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:43,440
And then for the non-zero bound, the study had a value of median survival for all the individuals who died during the study.

614
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:51,590
So it's really looking at the worst case scenario. We just talked to Joe because we need to do a couple more things.

615
01:06:51,620 --> 01:07:01,250
We have a study that gives us our cost values. We need an inflation ratio in order to calculate the value of care and palliative care care combined.

616
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:09,350
We needed some sort of estimate of the cost saving value, and that's just because it was very hard to find specific data on that group itself.

617
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:19,970
And because the study we used was Japanese, we needed some sort of cost ratio between healthcare costs in Japan and in the US.

618
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:27,290
So really we just need to convert the costs from that study of the years that give us daily cost.

619
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:32,630
So we have to multiply by 365, we multiply by the cost ratio, by the inflation ratio,

620
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:39,140
and then we get a period of to costs and to get the combined intervention, we just use that cost saving value that I mentioned earlier.

621
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:44,900
And for uncertainty, the cost values are given with 95% confidence intervals.

622
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:49,160
So that's what we use for a bounce of the data and for quality calculations.

623
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:57,530
We're using the same study and we also just needed some evidence to predict that health care combined with curative care.

624
01:07:57,750 --> 01:08:01,010
Yes, a higher quality of life. Make sure to parallel.

625
01:08:02,490 --> 01:08:09,180
So within the study they weren't using a market model like we are.

626
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:14,160
So their quality values, they just had a health utility and they divided it by 365,

627
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:22,290
which is not useful for us because there was like a quality .04 and it didn't really make sense given the methods we were using.

628
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:25,220
So we adjust that for just the time that they were alive.

629
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:31,440
So, you know, it's 5 to 6, five divided by the mean admission period and that gives us values for palliative and curative care.

630
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:41,880
And we couldn't really find a another good study for the quality of life associated with curative imperative care combined.

631
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:49,470
So what we did to estimate that was we took the difference between the two groups on their own and then add to that security try and say,

632
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:58,110
you know, it's sort of a linear increase, kind of assuming no synergism between the two and certainty is the same as before,

633
01:08:58,110 --> 01:09:04,320
where we just use the confidence intervals that we were given to account for uncertainty in our estimated values.

634
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:11,880
And so looking at our results here for curative care,

635
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:18,870
you can see that both that curative care was dominated for both our discounted and non discounted rates.

636
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:31,230
You can see here is that curative care is the most expensive and does not have as many quality life years as committed, curative and palliative care.

637
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:44,550
And this holds true for non discounted as well. And if you can see here, looking at our discounted tornado analysis for palliative care,

638
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:52,920
we have like a lower bound for properties per person to live is around 330000 to $3000 per person to live for.

639
01:09:54,030 --> 01:09:57,839
Palliative care is around four 10,000 because it's so much cheaper.

640
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,680
Palliative care is usually custom personalized.

641
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:05,760
For palliative care is for 25,000, 40, 20,000.

642
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:10,740
And this really holds true again for our not discounted rates.

643
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:18,470
And then in our results here you can see that for our mortality rate for.

644
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:28,299
People who received palliative care or who received curative care either are have

645
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:32,140
higher life expectancy rates than just those who just received palliative care alone.

646
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:43,120
And this is further described here in our in our graph, where you can see in blue up 3.3, 1.5.

647
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:47,260
Palliative care and critical care has a higher life expectancy.

648
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:52,240
And just how do you care alone? We again describe this in our grim.

649
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:56,660
I'll now pass it on to Andrew. Yeah.

650
01:10:56,770 --> 01:11:01,140
So obviously you what the practical application of what this cost effectiveness analysis can really do for people.

651
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:04,360
It's really going to be looking at two parties, the consumer and the pair.

652
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:15,820
So for the consumer, just as some logic and some data to a very emotional time in a patient's lifespan, I mean, you're dealing with cancer, obviously.

653
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:23,979
And not only that, it's a I guess in the late stage. So being able to add some more definitive numbers and logic to that decision,

654
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:26,890
you know, whatever that decision may be, there's always going to be a good thing.

655
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:34,540
Then in overall is gives you a clear picture of those two options or I guess three options of the two on on their own.

656
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:40,479
And then the third combined that gives you a look at what all that will cost, how long that will actually extend.

657
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,920
You know exactly what our cost purpose analysis is really supposed to be used for.

658
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:48,130
And then, of course, once you see that, it allows you to be able to budget for that.

659
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:54,400
And a lot of the times a lot of the studies are going to be on total cost overall is what we found.

660
01:11:54,730 --> 01:12:01,660
So by being able to put it into a more yearly and that can be taken from that monthly type of cost,

661
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:07,400
it's going to be a lot easier to budget that way when of course we also have what the payer is looking at.

662
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:13,660
The payers, the insurance companies are always going to appreciate more data for for what they do.

663
01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:19,910
And as much as we would love to have insurers cover everything, that's not always the case.

664
01:12:19,930 --> 01:12:27,970
So by seeing this cost analysis, they can really see which options are any more beneficial for them to cover and to not cover.

665
01:12:30,730 --> 01:12:35,050
And there are a lot of limitations for this as we've gone through the group.

666
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:40,450
Kind of see that was the case for a lot of these. The first going to be kind of just the narrow scope of what we were actually looking at.

667
01:12:40,450 --> 01:12:46,950
So not only were we looking at a specific type of cancer, really at a specific stage of that specific type of cancer.

668
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:51,090
So it definitely is going to limit the data on what we can actually find.

669
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:56,790
There's a short time horizon again because it's late stage pancreatic cancer.

670
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:04,980
The life expectancy is going to be incredibly short. Not having just such a short time horizon, of course, again, limits the diagnosis.

671
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:08,310
Demerits is all going back to just a full on lack of data.

672
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:12,750
And then for the main study that we did usually mentioned is the Japanese study.

673
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:18,870
And that of course brings in some complications in terms of health care costing different US health care costs,

674
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:22,080
as we all know, is just so vastly different from that everywhere else in the world.

675
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:26,219
So to not only add, you have to look at inflation.

676
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:34,080
We also have to look at the conversions from, you know, Japanese prices over to the US prices, which we did the best we could.

677
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,580
But that's that's going to be hard to get to. Perfect.

678
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:42,840
Then the last thing is kind of care being included in the usual care for a lot of these studies.

679
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:49,140
Luckily, we found one that was pretty aligned with what we were doing in our project, but that was really the only one.

680
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:53,970
All the other ones would usually assume that type of care was included in the curative care.

681
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:59,220
So it really made it difficult to single out curative care as its own specific group,

682
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:03,210
as opposed to just palliative care was a little more simple as well as the combined care.

683
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:11,040
Lastly, I'd like to take a moment to look at next steps. So what we'd like to see in terms of research beyond this point, right?

684
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:14,589
So first off, as Andrew said, it really starts with cutting more data.

685
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:18,909
And especially in the U.S., we it was incredibly focused to find data in the U.S. And like you said,

686
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:22,930
we mainly used the Japanese study to format a lot of our data.

687
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:28,450
But more on the SB. Fantastic. And then beyond that filtering guided by co-morbidities and other relevant factors.

688
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:33,520
Cancer really is a disease of aging, especially metastatic cancer, and when you get older,

689
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:36,370
tend to have comorbidities and that kind of affects your care a little bit.

690
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,799
And age and other all, in fact, have a really good way to filter that data on a cost factor.

691
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:45,910
Analysis study of drug usage to cover metastatic pancreatic cancer would also be really interesting data to look

692
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:52,690
at and a study to perhaps do in the future to look at drugs specifically how effective those are given the cost.

693
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:58,690
And that'd be great for payers as well. And then perhaps of course, I guess some sort, which it's difficult because it really is terminal,

694
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:06,309
but maybe perhaps finding that pancreatic cancer cohort and doing a study to determine quality because that was another difficult we

695
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:14,230
had was getting an accurate information of of quality of life and utility value for each of these patients for the pancreatic cancer.

696
01:15:15,070 --> 01:15:18,190
So those are my next steps. And we'd like to take any questions, if you have any.

697
01:15:18,670 --> 01:15:36,300
Thank you. Questions that I have for you then.

698
01:15:37,230 --> 01:15:45,300
So if you're in your alley and you're in the present presenting the results, I think you show the the 22 grams.

699
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:51,240
And then following the turnaround, there are a couple of so we've seen train items, I understand that.

700
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:54,890
But the next graph, I wasn't sure I know you had it.

701
01:15:55,230 --> 01:16:02,280
I didn't give you a whole lot of time for these presentations, but the next and the next actually, maybe even for that.

702
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:06,740
So what's your just kind of general policy conclusion?

703
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:11,220
And this is for anyone when you see this this tornado diagram.

704
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:19,149
If you saw this and we're going to make a recommendation to the Society of Oncologists or something like that,

705
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:21,020
I mean, what would you what's your takeaway from this?

706
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:31,239
I think the most practical means of this would just be to implement both palliative care as a form of treatment rather than any other form of care.

707
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:37,390
And we have to really just lump that up in one song because palliative care kind of care together.

708
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:41,650
I really have like the same amount of like qualities per say through the lump it all in one song.

709
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:52,150
So by doing that with Tornado, that was good to me as we couldn't really split up health care a lot as we had to do so from a policy perspective,

710
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:56,919
we would just have to say just off of this diagram and not listening to one as well,

711
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:01,860
that I think curative care would be like the best form of treatment for that as compared.

712
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:12,089
So in the base case here, your cost ratio is $450,000 per year.

713
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:15,520
So is that right. Yeah. Or around it from like the low around.

714
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:24,509
Well I mean, I mean if you had your previous slide, I think it's expensive, you would meet your main end of results.

715
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:28,990
It's about or two back I guess, or three.

716
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:35,550
So. Right, this is I mean, it's saying, you know, palliative care is that is the least expensive one.

717
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:44,010
Yeah. And then curative and palliative care, it's about 100 $450,000, right?

718
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,440
Yeah. So is that a is that a good value for money?

719
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:53,690
What? Or is there something else we should be thinking about here?

720
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:58,520
I think what you have, what has we understand that we're dealing with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

721
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:03,260
So whatever intervention that you're going to do is going to be highly expensive first, which is already terminal.

722
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:06,770
That's already spreading like a wave through the body weight like.

723
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:10,250
Sure. So whatever intervention that you do is going to be highly expensive.

724
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:17,060
It just depends on how much you want to be and how much policymakers want to pay for someone like Thomas that is going to die.

725
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:21,229
Well, I will say, you know, Observationally,

726
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:28,390
I think we do often see that people are willing to pay a lot more per quality in in and buy in end stage cancer care than they are.

727
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:32,270
You're not going to get a full life. You're out of this. You're going to get a certain months. It's all relative to month.

728
01:18:32,270 --> 01:18:39,440
And that's why we had to adjust it from a five year timeframe just to yeah, timeframes are short here,

729
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:43,850
so whatever intervention is going to do is going to be hugely expensive and you're not going to get as many life years.

730
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:49,040
But it just depends on what people are willing to pay, what policymakers are willing to pay.

731
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:55,020
So. I think that's going to be motivating to try and seek alternative treatment

732
01:18:55,020 --> 01:19:00,000
or alternative drugs to come to fruition in order to try to drop this cost.

733
01:19:00,330 --> 01:19:09,300
Because a lot of the cost values are based on the current chemotherapy drugs and current first line therapies that are available today.

734
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:17,040
So while this is expensive, it might be beneficial for the healthcare sector to subsidize research into newer drugs.

735
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:22,770
Yeah, well, certainly the cure to drugs, you know, don't add much life expectancy and they're very expensive.

736
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:31,270
So it would be nice to have some terms, you know. You also look at it from a stance of having all kind of cares.

737
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:35,280
It's. Both experts are doing together.

738
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:41,370
You can get a better way of life for.

739
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:52,230
Other questions from the audience. Okay.

740
01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:55,830
Well, thank you to all of our groups today. Thanks for your presentations.

741
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:59,119
It's nice to get that. I'll be enjoying use of.
