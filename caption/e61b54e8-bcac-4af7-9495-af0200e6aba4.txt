1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:24,250
Right. Yeah, you're right.

2
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:32,650
I have. That's right.

3
00:00:48,800 --> 00:01:30,840
I. This is.

4
00:01:48,990 --> 00:02:08,490
I think it's a little different in this league for me and the health educators.

5
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:24,210
Good morning, everybody. I know.

6
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:32,580
I'm sorry I didn't bring you any cake. I guess we all should have been in the bio stats class.

7
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,989
It was, like, huge. I don't know if you saw the cake was like, huge.

8
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,170
I'm like, oh, there go.

9
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:47,310
My reviews. Wow.

10
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,790
So great to see you all today.

11
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,450
It's our last day together. We've got to act now.

12
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:02,690
Thank you. It's very sad. We got two groups to the event.

13
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,770
So obviously, unless the groups, you know, try to take up the entire time.

14
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,880
And I know you're all looking like who's in group three and seven, don't you, there.

15
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:23,040
We will wrap up pretty early. So we will have first group three and then we'll have group seven.

16
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,780
Then I'll say, I promise, very, very, very brief words to thank you and then we'll be done.

17
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,760
Other than that announcement? Well, I'll say the announcers for the end, too.

18
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,510
So. All right, so I'll just turn it over.

19
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,370
Group three You ready to do?

20
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:09,640
Okay. Since the instruments.

21
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:16,180
Well, I can start. Of course, I have the first episode.

22
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:25,410
Don't know which one is on. Do we just this?

23
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,070
I guess. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know.

24
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:46,340
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Yeah, that thing. Yeah.

25
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,310
Okay, I'm going next. And that's a clicker up there, too.

26
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,780
Yeah. Oh, I forgot to put the thingy. Yeah. Yeah.

27
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,400
Huh? Yeah, we tried it again.

28
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:07,400
Forgot to put the. So I was I was so focused on that cake.

29
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:14,360
I'm like. Cake. Yeah.

30
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:32,360
I was looking out for your health. Thank could. I'm ready whenever you are.

31
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,100
Okay. Awesome. So. Hi, everyone. We're group three.

32
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,520
I'm Patty. I'm Sophie. I'm Emily. Caitlin.

33
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:46,280
Alejandro. And we'll be talking about the fruit and vegetable prescription program.

34
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:53,090
So first, an introduction on the background and context of Flint, Michigan, where this program is based.

35
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,940
As I'm sure all of you know, there's a long history of political and economic disenfranchisement in Flint.

36
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:06,770
First, with the collapse of the auto industry as automakers chose to move their companies out of the city, drawing funds away from the city.

37
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:15,380
And then, as the non democratically elected emergency managers switched the city's water supply to the Flint River and citing the Flint water crisis,

38
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,429
these decisions have disproportionately impacted the city's residents,

39
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:24,530
who are predominantly African-American and among the poorest in the state or in the country, actually.

40
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,720
So one of many social problems that arises from this is that youth in Flint face

41
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,130
several socially mediated environmental barriers to accessing fresh produce.

42
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,019
Just some examples of this.

43
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:43,790
There's a high child poverty rate around 60%, and gas research has shown that there's a limited availability of healthy food in the city.

44
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:49,700
The significance of this problem is that research has also shown that childhood dietary behaviors track into

45
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:55,310
adulthood and childhood intake of fruits and vegetables affects health and well-being throughout the life course.

46
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:03,650
So a description of our program. The Fruit and Vegetable Prescription program was originally started at the Hurley Children's Hospital,

47
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:09,290
but as you can see, it's since grown to include partnerships and support from a number of different organizations,

48
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,879
including the Mac Children's Health Center, Michigan Health Endowment Fund, the MSU,

49
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:19,280
Hurley Children's Hospital, Pediatric Public Health Initiative, and the Flint Farmers Market and Flint Fresh.

50
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:26,149
So it's centered around youth in Flint, and it's based out of three of the largest pediatric clinics in Flint.

51
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,020
And how it works is every time children go to see a doctor at one of those clinics,

52
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:35,870
the doctor prescribes them a $15 prescription or voucher for fresh fruits and vegetables.

53
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:43,700
And those are redeemable at the Flint Farmers Market, which is co-located with the Hurley Children's Hospital and next to the city's bus terminal.

54
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:51,320
And they're also redeemable at Flint Fresh, which is a mobile produce market that also offers online ordering and delivery.

55
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,280
So here's a snapshot of our logic model and inputs.

56
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,580
You can see all those organizations that were listed on the previous slide.

57
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:06,659
The main activities is that staff will need to teach physicians how to use the prescriptions within the electronic

58
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,980
medical records because that's how they're stored and kept track of because they are like real prescriptions.

59
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:20,480
And then we're hoping that that'll allow people to use those prescriptions, access fresh produce and increase childhood intake of fresh produce.

60
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:27,190
So the interested parties for our program are the program participants, the children and then their families,

61
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,420
as well as pediatricians and other child health care and child care workers in Flint.

62
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,810
And then those three major funding bodies and partnerships, the Children's Health Center,

63
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:41,590
the MSU, Hurley Children's Hospital and the Michigan Health Endowment Fund.

64
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:48,429
So with that in mind, the purpose of our evaluation is to provide the Community Health Foundation and Michigan

65
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:53,979
Health Endowment Fund with a report about the activities and outcomes relating to produce,

66
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,690
purchasing and consumption behavior to allow those offenders to make decisions about

67
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,530
the feasibility and potential community health benefits of sustaining the program.

68
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,360
So now we have the evaluation design for process evaluation.

69
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,840
We are going to be able to define exactly different questions we want to answer and check it out the cadence of our question.

70
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:20,300
One, we wanted to see to what extent the position properly implement the program.

71
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,360
After striking about 215 hours of pediatric manuals at every pediatric visit.

72
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,700
And then to. Indicate by the metric behind it,

73
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,290
we're going to look at the distribution rate of the number of options prescribed

74
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,100
by physicians divided by the number of pediatric visits during that study.

75
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,850
And then for questions, we were going to look at how many of these Hopkins were actually for fruits and vegetables.

76
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:54,910
I heard Spence, because they've been so amazing every year for this question is the retention rate.

77
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:00,640
So that's the number of volunteers that we're for fruits and vegetables divided by the number of boxes that were prescribed.

78
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:10,960
And then our outcome evaluation design, we are going to utilize the pre sperimentale one group retest from test retest approach.

79
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:23,399
We selected it because we are in the experimental design phase so we are not utilizing control group and we only really need to evaluate the

80
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:30,510
change from our participants before and after to see if this program has been smoking and can actually utilize the whole plant community.

81
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,410
But we're not trying to oh, we're not trying to generalize to the whole field.

82
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,340
We're just trying to generalize for a specific population.

83
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,210
So that's part we the design and that's why you can see it as integration.

84
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,630
It's notation that the other officers are pretest.

85
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,610
Then we have our. Our intervention. And then we have our.

86
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:57,690
And using a free experimental one group brings us post-test design points with

87
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:02,049
limitations to internal and external validity for us to internal validity.

88
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:06,920
Our history, maturation testing, conservation and regression to the mean history.

89
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:14,379
Maturation threats are a result of the studies designed by not using a control group testing instrumentation and regressions.

90
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,340
The new threats could be a result of multiple measurements and no control group.

91
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:23,230
The threats to external validity include selection settings, testing and multiple treatment effects.

92
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,910
And all of these threats are, at least in part, due because there's no control group.

93
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,870
We will be using a lot of probability criteria and sampling and participants will be recruited

94
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:40,419
through criterion to determine criteria that they are low income residents of Flint,

95
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,390
Michigan. There are two outcome questions that are important to evaluate the program.

96
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:52,030
One, Did the program succeed in increasing the purchasing of fruits and vegetables for participants during the program compared to

97
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:58,350
the participants reported difference in fruit and vegetable consumption following the program and to indicate key indicators,

98
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,600
we will help answer these questions.

99
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:06,820
The first question will be measured by the number of individuals that reported purchasing more fruits and vegetables after purchasing the program.

100
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:12,700
And the second outcome question will be measured by the number of individuals that report consuming more fruits and vegetables.

101
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,020
So moving into our methods, just to kind of break down our sampling strategy a little bit more,

102
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,889
we decided to focus our research on families of low SCA status because we're

103
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:27,340
interested in how the program was able to impact this particular population.

104
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,830
We were also interested in assessing the lack of access to healthy options and other resources prior to our program.

105
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:39,970
And then by focusing specifically on this population, we're able to establish generalizability about low CSA families and our intervention.

106
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:47,350
And like I said, we did non probability sampling because we non randomly selected those we wanted to capture in our data collection.

107
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,399
And we specifically utilized criteria in sampling because we wanted to select specific

108
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,940
subgroups with predetermined characteristics from the larger population and flint.

109
00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:00,070
This is also best for looking in depth at specific subgroups, so we figured this would best fit our research goals.

110
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:10,540
So for a quantitative data collection, kind of like we said earlier,

111
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:16,989
we want to identify if there's any numerical change really in the amount of fruits and vegetables purchased on a weekly basis.

112
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:23,680
And if there is any association between actually buying more fruits and vegetables weekly and then consuming more fruits and vegetables.

113
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:29,110
So we plan to approach these questions with two different types of self-reported surveys from participants.

114
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:35,140
So first, we'll have that fruit and veggie checklist, which will be distributed in digital format.

115
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:42,220
It will be a weekly, monthly calendar style list where they can tally up the specific fresh products that were purchased during the month.

116
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,390
And this will allow us to track spending changes on a weekly and monthly basis.

117
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,580
Um, and they'll be submitted monthly as not burden participants too much.

118
00:13:52,270 --> 00:14:00,460
And then having checklists completed by hand on paper will also be supplemented for those who are not comfortable with the digital format.

119
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:08,310
Secondly. We will ask participants to submit records of their vegetable and fruit consumption from week to week.

120
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:17,070
Also submitted at the end of each month. And so they can report how many times they cooked, how many of their cooked meals involved fresh produce,

121
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,510
how many fresh fruits and vegetables went uneaten in their household.

122
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,330
And those will kind of be evaluated with different scales.

123
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:32,180
So like Emily mentioned, in addition to the quantitative data, we're also going to have a qualitative section.

124
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,400
And these are going to determine, like,

125
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:40,530
the feelings of perception that participants are going to use the same survey as the method of data collection.

126
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:47,870
And it will also be distributed electronically just to kind of help ease the burden and kind of make it like a one thing that they need to complete.

127
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,159
And then some qualitative questions that will be asked include,

128
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,430
like identifying some accomplishments and challenges that they have and accessing the fruits, vegetables.

129
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,710
And then determining how, like modifying their diet has impacted them and made them feel.

130
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:14,500
So for analyzing our process and outcome evaluations, we want to look at, as Alejandro mentioned,

131
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:22,120
the voucher redemption rate and the rate of distribution of prescriptions from physicians to know the distribution rate.

132
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:29,350
We'll have access to data from participant e-mailers, so that will provide us information.

133
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,339
If the prescription was provided for redemption rate,

134
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:40,540
continuous tracking in contact with the Flint Fresh Store in the Flint Farmers Market will be insightful for that type of data.

135
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:48,490
And then our outcome evaluation is looking at changes in fruit and vegetable consumption and purchasing, which we have mentioned before,

136
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:53,990
analyzing the data from the self-reported surveys and then kind of compiling that into I'm like

137
00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:00,370
visual graphs probably will help identify positive or negative trends in either of the indicators.

138
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:07,210
So the standards used to advise intervention will determine the rate of success of the program,

139
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,460
the voucher redemption rate, and then the rate of distribution will be analyzed together.

140
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:18,250
And then we will conclude that a percentage of 75% or higher would determine the success of both of these interventions.

141
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:23,830
And then the standards for success and fruit and vegetable consumption will be determined by analyzing

142
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:29,110
the participants initial value at the start of the program compared to the values and of the program.

143
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,230
And then increased consumption rate of 50% or higher would determine that that intervention was successful.

144
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,939
And then for dissemination.

145
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:44,100
So we selected three different ways to disseminate our results, kind of based on the population that we're tailoring it towards.

146
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:48,270
So for we have a written report, oral presentation and then an infographic.

147
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:53,250
So the written report would be directed towards the funders and university based researchers that Patty mentioned in the beginning.

148
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,010
And this could kind of inform them of the success rate of the program itself and whether or not it could be a benefit to the community.

149
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,299
The oral presentation would be tailored towards community organizations,

150
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,580
the three pediatric clinics that we worked with and then also community members.

151
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:12,059
So this is kind of provide a high level overview of the findings of our study and also provide

152
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,480
time for stakeholders to ask questions and express their thoughts about the program itself.

153
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:21,840
And then we'd also provide an extra deliverable to community members in the form of a digestible infographic.

154
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,600
And we figured this would be a great way to highlight the positive outcomes

155
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,880
of the study and the benefits of increased fruit and vegetable consumption. So it would kind of include more educational resources as well,

156
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,890
and it would highlight the importance of making healthy choices and resources for how to obtain this type of diet.

157
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,640
Thank you all. Thank you.

158
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:11,209
I think I missed the end of the question, but if I understood it right, we would ask the doctors and work with those partnerships.

159
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:19,010
We have to see if physicians can try doing more nutrition education in their visits as they're prescribing the vouchers,

160
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:25,670
just giving them more information about what these are for and the benefits of like fruit and vegetable intake in childhood.

161
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:54,690
Jackie. Criteria for. Most of these prescriptions are given out at like well-child visits.

162
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,140
So just like normal routine visits with the children.

163
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,480
But that's definitely something important to keep in mind.

164
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:07,020
And also realizing that like then this program is not reaching people who are not able to visit a doctor or a pediatrician.

165
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:13,370
So that's a fair portion of the population that will be missing. I'm sorry if I misunderstood.

166
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,270
You had mentioned a few different threats to validity in your slides.

167
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:35,510
I was just wondering. Those. I mean, yeah, we're definitely going to be done,

168
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:41,300
but I think we kind of have to of how do you like to spend four months at a time

169
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,200
with basically just that we're going to have these trends that we know that,

170
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,919
but we're just in like pilot testing this program. It's like, okay,

171
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,090
that we have the same rights as long as we just see like the results before

172
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,530
that we can bring it to the broader community and then start to try to make.

173
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:03,060
And we had also talked about an experimental design.

174
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:10,230
But we decided that it just wasn't ethical for this population, like withholding, like access to produce from some kids.

175
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:16,710
So we decided we'd rather have those. Right.

176
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:50,870
Okay. I'm sorry. The confusion.

177
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,230
I don't know. Claire, do you want to use the clicker? I don't know if you use.

178
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:16,060
I guess I could just tap on the screen. Can.

179
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:28,690
Okay. So we're group seven. I'm Jennifer and I'm here along with my group Isabella, Claire, Nora, Hannah and Rita.

180
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:33,550
And we're presenting on the Ann Arbor YMCA Diabetes Prevention Program, or DPP for short.

181
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,230
So a quick overview of the presentation. Give a little bit of background and the program description,

182
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,250
and then we'll get into the design and analysis of the evaluation and then the dissemination.

183
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:50,319
So some quick background prediabetes is a condition with high blood sugar levels that are not yet high enough to be diagnosed as type two diabetes,

184
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,960
but are often higher than we would like to see.

185
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:59,830
And Type two diabetes is described as cells in your pancreas that typically respond to insulin but are not functioning properly,

186
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:08,980
and they're causing your blood sugar levels to rise. And older adults, 65 and older are more vulnerable to prediabetes and developing type two.

187
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:15,190
And they make up about 15% of the population in Washtenaw County and 50% of older adults has prediabetes.

188
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:19,899
And it is the leading cause of death for adults in this age group. And in 2019,

189
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,920
the Washtenaw County did a needs assessment that identified diabetes as a priority

190
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:31,210
because they see that the older adult population is growing in the county. So little description of our program.

191
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:38,800
The YMCA. DPP is based off of the National CDC Diabetes Prevention Curriculum, and the YMCA here in Ann Arbor has adopted it.

192
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:44,020
This program aims to prevent adults from developing Type two diabetes who are high risk or

193
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,460
who have received a pre-diabetes diagnosis by adopting and maintaining a healthier lifestyle.

194
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,050
So this program runs for a whole year and it contains 25 sessions.

195
00:22:53,350 --> 00:23:00,130
And these sessions are led by life coaches that teach participants dietary, physical activity and problem solving skills.

196
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:07,099
So the purpose of our evaluation is to help determine the effectiveness, fidelity,

197
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,780
distribution of information about the program and the sealant aspects of this program.

198
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:22,580
And so overall, this will help inform other future programs, either in the YMCA or other programs that are in the CDC curriculum.

199
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,840
To make modifications or if any, or to improve or augment certain components of the program.

200
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,979
So this is this is a little bit about the curriculum of the AP.

201
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:43,299
So as Jennifer mentioned, the yearlong program consists of 25 classroom based sessions regarding topics of healthy eating,

202
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,810
exercise and problem solving skills, which are listed here.

203
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:50,950
And they are divided into two big portions.

204
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,980
So like the first six months and then the last six months.

205
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,970
So here is our logic model we've made according to the program, information we gathered and.

206
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:10,030
Here. I just wanted to highlight the specs and logic model that we that our evaluation

207
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:15,760
questions will be focusing on so that Hannah to talk more about our evaluations.

208
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:28,480
So going a little bit into the standards first, these are set by the CBC who created the curriculum.

209
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:36,480
So the four main standards that they have set is that over a long period of time participating in train,

210
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:46,790
their weight loss, which is expected at least 5 to 7% and an average of at least 150 minutes of exercise per week.

211
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:56,810
They also found that for individuals who successfully completed the program that their diabetes decreased by 58%.

212
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:03,890
And for folks who did contract diabetes, they experienced the late onset of.

213
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,930
Or on average, four.

214
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:19,730
So for our evaluation, our first question is to what extent the alliance is or approaches our resources and proper training to implement the program.

215
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:24,140
And the second is that the landscape I program reach the.

216
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:38,450
So conduct to conduct their process evaluation. So for quantity of data, for the first question regarding training and proper resources,

217
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:43,189
we're going to be counting the number of staff we're trained on this and then

218
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:46,360
also looking at the number of sessions that were delivered and average amount.

219
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:56,980
First the CDC standard is that. In the first six months, then between six and seven, six months.

220
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:10,700
And then also we talked about the amount of training and the Web survey and stuff and the coordinators would close any questions.

221
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:17,880
Basically reading how well they thought their sessions went and they felt they matched these guidelines.

222
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:27,600
Here they were. And then also for answering with regards to training, there would be similar questions, but an open ended format for interviews with.

223
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:31,900
Feedback on staff training, preparedness materials, and those interviews will be.

224
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:38,420
As well. And then the second question, I'm about reaching the intended audience.

225
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:45,170
Should it be part of the program, have to be recruited to the PRO program so you can be referred to a health care provider or yourself.

226
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:48,810
So we need been totaling the amount of health care providers.

227
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:56,730
Then how many? The providers of comedy were recruited through staff to see if there's a gap there.

228
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:05,330
We also want to know the proportion of the prediabetic adults in the program out of the estimated total of prediabetic adults.

229
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:14,100
And then for quality data, there's also going to be focus groups and interviews with participants and stuff

230
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:19,030
asking about those barriers or hesitancy as the chances to joining the program.

231
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:26,730
Then similar manner. There will be an open ended survey to health care providers that study population.

232
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,710
Difficulties. They had recruiting participants if they felt there were any barriers and that.

233
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:38,790
Joining us. And for our upcoming evaluation, we'll be focusing on two.

234
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:43,000
Still did, participants in the program reached their desired goal.

235
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:51,580
Or skill level due to the intervention? And were there specific components of the curriculum that stood out?

236
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:59,010
And was it for the changes in knowledge, attitudes and behaviors due to that intervention and more than use?

237
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:05,340
So to measure this, we have to evaluate these two questions.

238
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:09,840
We have split it up into quantitative and qualitative variables.

239
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,650
So on the positive side, this falls in line standards.

240
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:21,700
The actual percent weight loss for each participant. Their estimated minutes of exercise per week.

241
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,360
And their prediabetes and diabetic studies what you measure by.

242
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:39,740
Either they want to see protests or any other of the various blood determining whether they're no longer at risk for still for diabetics or.

243
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:54,750
And on the positive side, we will be asking participants what exercise routines about this particular activity adapted to their regular routines,

244
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,760
what type changes have also been implemented as a result of the program?

245
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:08,489
And also greater self-advocacy for fathers is particularly important when you're dealing with senior people.

246
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:12,650
Sometimes their attitude is, Oh, why do I need to change anything I.

247
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,440
But we want to make sure that they. Change that change.

248
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:32,950
Adverse health outcomes. And so, as data collection says, class class surveys will be administered during every class to keep track of participants.

249
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:37,270
Current weight. Average exercise per week. Attendance and referral method.

250
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:42,760
In addition, a daily tracker will be used to keep track of meals, physical activity for the day and mood.

251
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,100
The evaluation team will give program coordinators an anonymous,

252
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,629
self-administered Web assessment following the program's last session that asks how many

253
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:57,220
staff were trained as lifestyle coaches and how many total sessions were delivered within.

254
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,990
The Self-Administered survey will include Likert scale skills regarding consistency

255
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:06,550
of session delivery among the staff matching CDC guidelines and staff preparedness.

256
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:14,620
Quantitative measures are percentage, weight loss or gain estimated weekly activity at the end of the program at six months and 12 months.

257
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:17,710
Follow up and prediabetic or diabetic status.

258
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,860
At the last session of the program, participants will be asked to update their current weight estimated physical activity per week

259
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,780
and if they know the current status of their health to obtain follow up information on weight,

260
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,030
physical activity, diabetic status.

261
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:40,419
A phone interview will be administered and be conducted following the last session will be conducting semi-structured interviews with staff,

262
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:46,930
which will include questions regarding how prepared the staff felt their training, what types of materials were given to them and participants,

263
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:54,459
and if candidates had any barriers or hesitancy during the recruitment process or sessions will be also conducting a

264
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:59,680
focus group at the last session of the program with a mix of participants recruited by their providers and staff.

265
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:04,810
And that will be an opportunity to discuss feelings on YMCA and staff preparedness

266
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:08,860
and if they felt that there were any barriers or hesitancy in joining the program.

267
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:18,580
So for our sampling approach and strategy, our population of interest are individuals aged 16 above who are prediabetic living in Ann Arbor,

268
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,700
which is the same criteria for individuals enrolled in the YMCA.

269
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:28,030
And so people who are already diagnosed with diabetes can't participate in the program.

270
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:33,370
Or if you get a blood test through your health care provider and it shows that you are diabetic, you also can't participate.

271
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:40,120
And we will be using a probability approach to ensure that our sample is representative of our population of interest,

272
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:47,479
and so we can also generalize our findings to them. Specifically, we wanted to use a stratified sampling approach groups proportionally.

273
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:54,010
And by the way, participants were recruited into the program either through a health care provider or through the YMCA staff.

274
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,860
And that speaks to one of our processes, our questions,

275
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:05,770
and then our sampling frame will be DBP participants aged 60 and older who are currently enrolled or who have previously enrolled in the program.

276
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:16,040
So this is our design location, which is to conduct a single time series analysis, which is a concept, experimental study design,

277
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:23,239
and the multiple observations all allow us to do like within group comparisons and to see whether the

278
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:31,040
participants lifestyle changes are affected by evaluation of intervention rather than the noise or trend.

279
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:36,290
And we didn't use a control group to compare because it would all be harmful to not

280
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:41,600
give them the control group interventions when we already know they have pre-diabetic.

281
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:51,989
And the reason that we have the an observation in between of the intervention is because that the EP was divided

282
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:58,860
into two portions as aforementioned and the first six months and with the first six month and second six months.

283
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:05,280
So we kind of wanted to have a midpoint check to see whether there is a change after the first portion of the program.

284
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:10,800
So basically the two axis here are representing the same like that we do prevention programs.

285
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:20,919
So as I mentioned, in order to evaluate the process and outcomes for use for qualitative data.

286
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:26,690
So we're going to do it as such. So for frequency, it's important to get a number of.

287
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,590
Wrong. What's the sex of the participants?

288
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,580
Attendance. CBC has strict guidelines on.

289
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:43,350
In order to successfully complete the program, how many sessions attendance must attend with the.

290
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:52,669
And from time to time it's a firefighter or three staff and staff members.

291
00:33:52,670 --> 00:34:00,630
Only staff members are required to put on. And then the proportion of pre-diabetes.

292
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,010
Patience at the beginning and.

293
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:14,400
And then poor dispersion for looking at increases participants percent weight loss amount of exercise on average for a week

294
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:22,060
and completion of the program because we are expecting that not everyone who's involved in the program will finish the 12.

295
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:33,720
And then for association. So this isn't causation nearly correlation, but seeing in exercise and diet had a impact on weight loss.

296
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,910
See if the ratio of exercise and diet to weight loss.

297
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,960
Changed their stance and then attended his first.

298
00:34:47,410 --> 00:35:01,000
And on the positive side is that since this is a trial, we will be using results from three surveys of surveys and then the follow up surveys.

299
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,630
That will be. And we picked problems to raise because we're expecting that we're worried about.

300
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:13,050
Are older and they're about as. That's I mean, so far there's probably.

301
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:23,180
Receptive and then for or dichotomous outcomes we're looking at simply do they still have pre-diabetes?

302
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:29,940
Did they experience an increase increased knowledge for various exercise diet and.

303
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:35,680
Diabetes related concepts and if they experienced barriers to the program.

304
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,810
And we would. Analyze this using a consumer's quest to.

305
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:53,330
Living in an apartment in those outcomes. We're looking at weight loss, percentages of exercise and satisfaction in the program.

306
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,270
And self-efficacy, and we were determined. Significant.

307
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:08,010
So our conclusion will address the four questions in the variable topic explained.

308
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:15,659
We do have some limitations for the study for internal validity, and most of our surveys are self-reported.

309
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,630
So there's always a. Right of accuracy there.

310
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:24,050
And we do not have a control group as much as we thought it would be.

311
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,250
Goal to have a control group, given that if they don't.

312
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,830
This kind of stuff, do anything about their projects that is just like let your thought experiment a little bit.

313
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,310
There's so many things that go.

314
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:48,250
Someone tell all the social determinants of health and it's a multitude of factors and ask whether someone has heart disease outside of.

315
00:36:53,710 --> 00:37:00,370
So the result, the evaluation results are going to be disseminated via an annual report and for graphics,

316
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:07,840
one pagers and a structural manual with the goal to be disseminating it at different offices in different cities.

317
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:12,670
Yes. So on the right side, are different invested parties or stakeholders?

318
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:20,200
Which are the funders, which would be the CDC. They help to develop the curriculum and the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services,

319
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:28,820
along with the YMCA staff and so coaches program participants, current and future participants with future.

320
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,850
We're using that as a strategy to bring people into the study in the future or into the program.

321
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,919
And also health care providers,

322
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:42,700
which goes back to one of our process e-mail questions to determine if we were effective in recruiting people into our program.

323
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:57,860
Into the program. Question.

324
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:16,800
For your process evaluation about the program's success and then mentioned asking participants about barriers to participation.

325
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,240
I guess I was wondering if we thought about and ways to maybe capture.

326
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,690
Perspective on what was going well or facilitators.

327
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,139
Know, within the focus group. But we would have the participants be part of this.

328
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,420
Part of the. How they felt about stuff.

329
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:52,180
Fairness as well as well. This. And I think we were also hoping to do the survey with the providers that were recruiting

330
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:56,160
them into assuming that they have like an ongoing relationship with participants,

331
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:01,510
maybe like asking getting questions about if they had barriers to enrolling in the program and maybe if they like dropped out,

332
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:05,140
like maybe having those conversations with the providers and we'd be able to get those responses through them.

333
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,830
Yeah. Jackie clarified.

334
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:20,250
They? We don't have a comparison.

335
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,560
It's not like a super. But.

336
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:43,430
We're looking at it like if there was a comparison Google something where subsequent updates on the start of the program.

337
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:15,590
We types it to a little bit, but not as much as before. So the question was how many?

338
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,940
More serious as they are, they tend to be more resistant to change.

339
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:27,159
The CDC has designed this curriculum in mind.

340
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:34,340
That is already. Participants are full participants with the elders.

341
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:39,680
So a lot of the things are the way that the curriculum is designed is of.

342
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:49,010
Family focused on things like not your individual outcomes but because this particular things.

343
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:53,330
The standard of care usually starts in the late summer.

344
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:57,590
All that has was before. You.

345
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:02,400
Regarding holidays and the patients and their family.

346
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:10,490
I'm curious about like not only the benefits that happens for yourself, but better for your family, for your children.

347
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:21,330
So that's kind of like. And also in the CDC training that is provided for the coaches.

348
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:27,720
Like a lot of it's surrounded about like giving support to participants to hopefully retain engagement until they finish the program successfully.

349
00:41:48,910 --> 00:42:00,160
All right. Well, it's been a fun semester, so, like, in my life, I'm going to pick up the mic just first announcements.

350
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:04,870
So technically, the papers do or the report, the plan is due today.

351
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:19,150
If you do need extra time, especially if you present it this week and you want to revisit based on questions you got, you know, just let us know.

352
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:24,070
And we're, you know, we're happy to be flexible. Communication is.

353
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:31,350
Very welcome and encouraged. Let's see what else.

354
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:39,040
And also look for and look for an email or announcement in the next couple of days.

355
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:51,370
About one part of the grading for the plan is just getting feedback or you getting giving feedback about your team members.

356
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:58,780
This is really just a way of, you know, if there were some issue that emerged and.

357
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:05,340
You know, you want to be able to share those with us confidentially.

358
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:12,719
This is an opportunity to do so. I'll tell you, in all the years I've used this, I've only had to reduce it great.

359
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,500
Once. So. You know, don't worry.

360
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:26,770
Usually it's, you know, extraordinary circumstances, like this person just never contributed.

361
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:34,930
That's usually the only time I'm going to reduce a great. But I, you know, please, you know, take the time to do it.

362
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,830
So I think that's it for announcements.

363
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:45,580
We're still grading the going through the quizzes as well.

364
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,560
And we should have the grade for the class up.

365
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:58,830
For the class up a few days after the last day of classes.

366
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:07,279
That just gives us time to like, you know, go through, you know, make sure that, you know, if there's any things that need to be addressed,

367
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:13,910
we can address them before us officially submit the grades, which after I do that, it becomes very difficult to change it.

368
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:21,620
So I usually kind of delay. Other than that, I just want to say, well, first, thank you to Hannah.

369
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:25,280
She, you know, gave Hannah. Thank you. Thank you.

370
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:37,080
She you know, she's come here and, you know, worked with you all, you know, giving you, you know, good feedback on your assignments.

371
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:45,959
So, you know, thank you for, you know, serving as a GSI for this cause as one of the thank you all as well for,

372
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:52,620
you know, coming asking questions, having comments, engaging with the material.

373
00:44:53,350 --> 00:45:01,080
I teach not, you know, that I do this basically on the side, as I've told some students, because I just enjoy doing it.

374
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,910
You know, I've been. Working in public health for a really long time.

375
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:20,390
And it's a joy for me to be able to work with students and, you know, see you along your way in your professional journey.

376
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:32,180
If you ever have any questions or comments or anything about public health, about evaluation, please feel free to reach out.

377
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:38,050
And then I also just encourage you always in a class by saying this be nice to your colleagues.

378
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:44,570
These are the people you're going to see. You're going to see them at other conferences.

379
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:49,700
You're going to work with them on projects. You never know when you're going to.

380
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:54,499
And I say when specifically. You never know when you're going to encounter somebody.

381
00:45:54,500 --> 00:46:00,030
So. You know, I just encourage you all to continue to.

382
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:05,780
Be supportive of one another and encourage one another.

383
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:09,990
Other than that, I look forward to seeing you out in the field.

384
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:16,500
Some of you are almost done with this program and you're going to be out there and they'll celebrate you.

385
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:21,620
I'll be out there, going to be working and be part of like the work that we're doing.

386
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:27,440
You know, the pandemic has really highlighted how important public health is.

387
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:35,720
You know, you've all had the blessing of coming into this to this work.

388
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:42,440
You've had the blessing of coming into this work where people actually know what public health is.

389
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:50,820
Even if they don't like it, they at least know. So, you know, you're very visible and we really do save lives.

390
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:56,600
So I just encourage you to continue on and fight the good fight.

391
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:04,200
Other than that, like I said. You know, enjoy the rest of your finals.

392
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:12,420
Enjoy the break. If you celebrate, enjoy celebrations and even if you do or do not get some rest.

393
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:17,940
Because again, the fight is ongoing and you need your strength.

394
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:21,750
So there you go. I will see you later.

395
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:35,990
Oh. Hello.

396
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:40,220
Thank you. You're welcome. I have a question.

397
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:45,140
What? You're, like, disappeared off my TV screens.

398
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:51,290
And is a weird question. So like t because you were actually right.

399
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:56,740
Because usually when people say that and it's not weird, it was like here and now it's not anywhere.

400
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:01,010
And I know making the speech is absurd and I have a lot of classes, but it like disappeared from here.

401
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:08,240
When I go into my courses, it's, it's not in this list, but if I go into the all persons list, it is there.

402
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:15,110
And I'm just asking because I'm the person who submitted the assignment for my group and my group

403
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:20,900
members said they can see it and I can see that it says it's submitted and like not yet graded,

404
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:24,970
but then it is not there. I just wanted to make sure you had it right.

405
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:32,600
I don't want to screw everyone over. I mean, if they can see it, then I should.

406
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:38,660
I should have it. That is okay. But. But the fact that you can pull it up tells me that you're probably fine.

407
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,860
You just did some weird canvas. Okay. Okay.

408
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:50,630
That's what I was hoping. I just usually when somebody say something where it's like, Oh, I have a question about a job or a career.

409
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:55,540
That really was weird. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think that's a canvas thing.

410
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:01,129
Okay. Okay. I submitted I asked my group members, I was like, it looks weird online.

411
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:06,110
Can you just check? And they said, I can see. So I hope it's okay.

412
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:09,200
If it's not, then I will let you know.

413
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,480
But okay. Yeah, but yeah. Okay.

414
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,790
Just I can't stay on campus.

415
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:26,120
I mean, yeah, it's great this but I, when I started college we used Blackboard and at my university and it was like right in the dark ages.

416
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:31,070
I get, you know. Oh I have you. Yeah, I've used like for, for, for something else I was doing.

417
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,690
I don't know, it was far worse than this.

418
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:39,379
And yeah. You know what, I think I would agree with that.

419
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:50,330
I think. Yeah, if you ask me now online, the online program uses Coursera which is difficult on our end because it's really complex.

420
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:55,970
But I don't know in terms of at least we have canvas and we had C tools.

421
00:49:56,390 --> 00:50:00,400
All right. Well, so my mom is a professor here. Oh, yeah.

422
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:06,110
And so I have heard the saga of tools my whole life because she's been a professor.

423
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:09,139
Professors. What school is she? School education. Oh, okay. What's her name?

424
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:12,650
Yeah, Elizabeth Moji. Oh, yeah, they are former Dean, right?

425
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:17,600
Oh, current Dean. Okay. Yeah. I don't know enough about School of. Yeah, I knew that.

426
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:21,680
Dean. Yeah. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. So how do you know this?

427
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:27,590
Good. Mainly because when I worked in social work.

428
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:42,370
You know, they're right next to each other. Yeah. And then there is a an evaluation center in Cedar that we worked.

429
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:46,930
Yeah, we kind of like, you know, it's hard because we were very similar.

430
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:53,680
Yeah. Although. Yeah.

431
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:58,320
Yeah, he's doing it now.

432
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:04,400
Or maybe he was like, Darren was okay because I was Nate.

433
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,330
I was the equivalent of Nate in social work. Yeah, social work.

434
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,940
So I know maybe one problem that he needs.

435
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:24,970
Yeah, he does sound like Nate and I would talk because, you know, we would both come direct, and the center was small, but that's what I.

436
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:31,060
That's why I always give the last message to see three degrees of separation.

437
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:36,760
You never know. This past.

438
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:46,200
No is not possible given how they set up different.

439
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:06,460
Well, there's always push and pull, you know, like. You know, I was I was trained as a as a scientist.

440
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:14,720
And well, you know, we always joke to value players who are trained in a program where they have to do a lot of unlearning.

441
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:19,560
But, you know, it's a very surgical unlearning.

442
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:26,200
Right. You don't want to unlearn the methods. You have to unlearn the assumptions that the research.

443
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:36,830
Infrastructure needs to be in two universes and that the participants in that process that way and that's why.

444
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:57,410
So in my own. In.

445
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:04,790
Here. No, I.

446
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,430
Thank you. That's why I like teaching.

447
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:18,440
What are you saying? I'm getting tired.

448
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:23,000
Yeah, I've been. I've been doing double duty for a long time.

449
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:27,050
Like, I'm 40. You got to.

450
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:34,210
Like three down there. I'm like, I'm fatigued.

451
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:41,520
Yeah, it's time to pass the torch. Although I love it and I'll probably keep it.

452
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:47,050
There's also an occupational health sciences program that I also teach for after teaching for.

453
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:57,630
I love it. And I just don't.

454
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:07,490
Telegraph. So some really bad luck can.

455
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:16,930
I think you and I. I'm more.

456
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,450
I've always been more. I can't hear you.

457
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:32,070
Here's my chance. What's going?

458
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:46,860
You know, I actually found something that the curriculum people understand this you talking about in the book

459
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:50,969
that you obviously have never been in a room where like three people showed up for your career.

460
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:54,440
I mean, they're like. What did I do wrong?

461
00:54:55,050 --> 00:55:00,810
What is that supposed to be? Yeah, I heard.

462
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:05,920
So he must approve it. But, yeah, it is just.

463
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:12,490
It's just a different. The world.

464
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:19,010
You know, funding is important. Right.

465
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:36,350
That's when just. You know, I do want to let you know.

466
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,330
I'm certain that. Have a great.

467
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:56,450
Here. Well. I love you.

468
00:55:57,050 --> 00:56:00,200
But it's why I left for you.

469
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:04,450
Unless you regress, I think I don't care.

470
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:10,990
I used to. I thought.

471
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:28,310
You. That's why I assure you that I would like.

472
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:37,270
There. Probably stay where I am.

473
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:48,190
Hi. I know how you feel. So like I do every time I go to.

474
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:58,570
And then I. I don't know.

475
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:04,480
I suppose in my career I didn't realize I.

476
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:26,150
But I. Yeah. I.

477
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:34,070
But. And now.

478
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:49,740
Now back to what I think is your biggest.

479
00:57:54,950 --> 00:58:12,660
And in the past few years. Other than. I think this is the one you're going to love because I actually.

480
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:23,470
Social. Have also, obviously.

481
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:41,820
So I kind of like the series that I wanted to tell you about.

482
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:51,120
They are just like, I believe in that game. One.

483
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:10,630
And this happened while I suffered as part of my severe.

484
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:19,200
Time is your science and.

485
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:26,640
Oh, we're going to have a lot.

486
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:36,970
Yeah. I. Academy Award winner.

487
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:44,860
The. Yes, we heard.

488
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:52,370
So. Of.

489
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:10,460
First thing I know, we can't go back to D.C. and gamble.

490
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,090
Oh, yeah, I'm here. I mean, I like D.C.

491
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:32,720
Well, 82. That's what you would do. The switch where it's like new location is so busy, I'm like, Yeah, I don't want to go there.

492
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:38,690
Well, good luck. Thank you. Thank you. And good luck going in-depth search.

493
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:53,660
Read more. Sorry I couldn't do.

494
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:59,990
I can't see how they, um.

495
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:09,870
Know. I think they mentioned. But I do think they have an.

496
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:18,250
They also. Yeah.

497
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:22,719
They mentioned open ended. And if I remember. Yeah, I remember that.

498
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,700
But all the analysis. That they talked about.

499
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:31,040
They talked about. We want.

500
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:43,840
I was also kind of worried about the sample size. She?

501
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:55,510
Yeah. You know what I feel like?

502
01:01:55,540 --> 01:02:02,420
No problem. In addition, you.

503
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:17,820
Not sure. But listen.

504
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:28,970
Yeah, but no, I almost forgot. My second question was sort of about survey fatigue or survey the older population.

505
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:37,200
The response rate might not be great, but people like to talk on the phone.

506
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:40,560
That is true. Actually, that is true, you know.

507
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:45,060
So the phone service might get better. Yeah.

508
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:49,570
They? We enter.

509
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:55,740
No surprise. They just chatted it up.

510
01:02:56,070 --> 01:03:02,460
Yeah, but no, I mean, like, I got a girl or I love you and I have you, Miss Dorothy.

511
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:05,520
You know what I mean? This hair. I got to go.

512
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:10,750
To work back to when when I used to do phone service,

513
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:16,610
like thinking about it now it usually gets you older people who would like to know what you really do.

514
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:19,399
So yeah, that approach might work better.

515
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:24,020
I think I was just thinking about the idea of We're going to call someone four times, I feel like after a couple.

516
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:30,780
Yeah. Yeah. Oh.

517
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:39,220
And I still remember when I was a freshman. Um. Freshman year just at the university's fundraising.

518
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:46,340
Um. I got on the phone with the older lady.

519
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:51,530
I was a student here and. We talk a lot about.

520
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:57,090
On that point, though, I would like to talk to this lady here.

521
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:01,990
And. And then I quit, like after I got the phone.

522
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:10,750
Yeah. I don't know. It's like it was kind of interesting doing it because we were asking with a

523
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:15,610
quantitative question like experience on what to buy to just get a story and response.

524
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:21,050
So I look a little bit like. That's.

525
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:25,610
So. Yeah. See that?

526
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:28,980
And then also this one. The same.

527
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:35,600
Yeah. You know, it's like, here's what we think that really matters in your experience.

528
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:39,919
But what you're telling me is something you know, I don't know.

529
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:45,560
I think it's better to have some. The song.

530
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:51,630
That opening. What exactly?

531
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:05,060
No, I don't think so. A survivor.

532
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:09,700
How they. I've got.

533
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:19,060
So. Because I'm getting older.

534
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:23,270
So, I mean. I'm tired, so.

535
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:32,890
I just want to go back like with 930. She was on.

536
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:47,090
Unless I'm just sick. And then I have to make a case for it in the house.

537
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:51,450
Don't walk around. I'm sick. I'm sick.

538
01:05:53,550 --> 01:06:00,180
I'm that right now in my house, I have to make a case for being able to go to bed early.

539
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:06,240
So I have to make sure everyone understand very clearly that I'm sick and I'm not serving today.

540
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:14,080
I heard that. So.

541
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:21,780
Can I just go to bed? Because if I don't, somebody would show up, especially my daughter.

542
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:27,010
The school to the man who likes girls was doing that. And the boys were very.

543
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:39,650
School. Question about the test.

544
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:45,450
You felt like your pre and post office and I was like, Oh yeah.

545
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:51,810
And the second. Oh, that's.

546
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:57,560
I told her I would never do that. I tried to give a homemade.

547
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:03,100
What should I do? I rely on that thing.

548
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:10,319
I can barely remember my middle name yet.

549
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:21,270
So. Much.

550
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:28,000
You know, I. Yeah.

551
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:38,710
And then. It's.

552
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:54,400
It just. It made me feel. What was the controversial topic?

553
01:08:02,430 --> 01:08:10,190
Yeah. I really wanted to. But if you want me to.

554
01:08:33,480 --> 01:10:03,320
It be? I happen to like.

555
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:59,030
He. I didn't see anything.

556
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:07,180
It was more like an issue that actually happened.

557
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,240
It is.
