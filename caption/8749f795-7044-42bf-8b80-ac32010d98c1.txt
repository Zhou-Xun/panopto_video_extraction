1
00:00:02,632 --> 00:00:04,855
Hello My name is Kevin Thompson.

2
00:00:04,855 --> 00:00:09,149
I'm one of the infection preventionists here at our infection prevention and

3
00:00:09,149 --> 00:00:12,345
epidemiology department at the University of Michigan.

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:20,222
And I'm here today to talk to you about ventilator associated events.

5
00:00:20,222 --> 00:00:24,050
So just to provide a brief overview of what we'll be

6
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,423
talking about regarding ventilator associated events.

7
00:00:28,423 --> 00:00:35,570
We'll start with a brief background information on mechanical ventilation.

8
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,596
We'll talk about surveillance definitions for

9
00:00:38,596 --> 00:00:42,590
ventilator associated events for both adults and pediatrics.

10
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:48,977
As the definitions are different for those two populations.

11
00:00:48,977 --> 00:00:50,714
We'll talk about workflows and

12
00:00:50,714 --> 00:00:54,583
prevention strategies that occur here at the University of Michigan.

13
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:59,842
And then finally we'll go through some case studies to apply what we've learned.

14
00:00:59,842 --> 00:01:07,597
These case studies will occur in class.

15
00:01:07,597 --> 00:01:13,190
So mechanical ventilation for a patient to qualify for

16
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,601
a ventilator associated event.

17
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:19,809
They have to be mechanically ventilated.

18
00:01:19,809 --> 00:01:22,350
So what is mechanical ventilation?

19
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,915
Well when a patient is unable to breathe on their own or

20
00:01:26,915 --> 00:01:30,877
when the need arises to protect their airway.

21
00:01:30,877 --> 00:01:35,049
And this could be due to a host of different issues whether they have

22
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:37,220
a severe respiratory infection.

23
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,000
Whether there's been a trauma or a host of other issues.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,619
The patients unable to breathe on their own and

25
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:53,448
a tube needs to be inserted into their trachea to provide air into their lungs.

26
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:57,329
So there are different types of intubation

27
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,977
endotracheal intubation or ET tube is one method.

28
00:02:01,977 --> 00:02:09,360
Where a tube is placed into the trachea through the mouth.

29
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,548
And this may be a cuffed ET tube.

30
00:02:13,548 --> 00:02:18,874
As you can see from the slide cuffed into ET tubes prevent

31
00:02:18,874 --> 00:02:23,522
gastric contents from passing into the lungs and

32
00:02:23,522 --> 00:02:27,167
gas from leaking back from the lungs.

33
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:29,239
So this is important.

34
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:33,249
We don't want a patient to aspirated right or

35
00:02:33,249 --> 00:02:38,526
end up with gastric contents in their lungs because that can

36
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:43,925
lead to infection complications specifically pneumonia.

37
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:50,834
We also don't want gas leaking back from the lungs into the patient's stomach.

38
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:54,318
From efficiency standpoint,

39
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,607
that's definitely not what we want.

40
00:02:58,607 --> 00:03:03,678
There are nasal intubation.

41
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:08,606
Okay so this is where the tube is placed into your trachea about through

42
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:10,710
your nose versus your mouth.

43
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:15,683
This is used for patients undergoing facial surgery.

44
00:03:15,683 --> 00:03:22,470
Or when ET intubation would not otherwise be feasible.

45
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,194
And then lastly we have tracheostomy.

46
00:03:26,194 --> 00:03:30,630
So for tracheostomy this device is inserted through

47
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,078
an opening that's actually made through the neck.

48
00:03:35,078 --> 00:03:41,490
And into the trachea instead of through the nose or through the mouth.

49
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:46,763
This is not used as often as endotracheal intubation but

50
00:03:46,763 --> 00:03:51,813
in certain cases or circumstances patients are going

51
00:03:51,813 --> 00:03:56,427
to be ventilated for an extended period of time.

52
00:03:56,427 --> 00:04:01,274
When they have a severe neurologic injury or

53
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:06,390
other reason why ET2 would not be indicated.

54
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:13,479
Tracheostomy is an option.

55
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:16,750
So when we're talking about ventilator associated events.

56
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,482
We're talking about complications from being on the ventilator.

57
00:04:21,482 --> 00:04:24,779
So in order to qualify for

58
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:29,805
VAE just like you to qualify for PVAP.

59
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:38,417
You have to have an indwelling central venous catheter pick line for

60
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:42,659
greater than two calendar days.

61
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:48,357
For IVAC you have to have a fully indwelling catheter in place for

62
00:04:48,357 --> 00:04:51,321
greater than two calendar days.

63
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:54,093
There has to be a device in place right?

64
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:58,408
In order to meet the criteria that surveillance criteria for

65
00:04:58,408 --> 00:05:00,782
a device associated infection.

66
00:05:00,782 --> 00:05:06,403
So for ventilator associated infections the patients have to be violated right?

67
00:05:06,403 --> 00:05:11,419
The first day or day one would be the day that the patient was intubated.

68
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:15,119
Had the ET2 placed nasal intubation or

69
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:19,725
tracheostomy placed and put on the ventilator.

70
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:24,691
And we take those settings into account as you'll see when we go

71
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,982
through the surveillance definitions.

72
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:31,584
But really a patient can't be evaluated for

73
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:34,904
a VAE until day 3 of their ventilation.

74
00:05:34,904 --> 00:05:40,794
So you'll see again when we go through the surveillance definitions why?

75
00:05:40,794 --> 00:05:46,026
But again we don't attribute complications or ventilated

76
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:53,148
associated events to patients that have been ventilated for fewer than 3 days.

77
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:58,095
It's just not there long enough.

78
00:05:58,095 --> 00:06:05,455
No just like we do surveillance for other types of infections.

79
00:06:05,455 --> 00:06:09,967
We do do VEA surveillance because there are risks

80
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:14,158
associated with patients that develop VAE.

81
00:06:14,158 --> 00:06:19,988
Right increased mortality length of ventilation.

82
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:26,427
So if somebody's on a ventilator they need assistance breathing.

83
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:30,713
And then they end up with a respiratory infection on top of that.

84
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:35,588
The amount of time they're going to need that ventilatory support is going to be

85
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:36,399
increased.

86
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,727
That's not good for the patient.

87
00:06:38,727 --> 00:06:40,491
So we want to avoid those.

88
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:45,402
So identifying when these instances occur it's important to

89
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:47,960
preventing them in the future.

90
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,976
An increased length of state right.

91
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:54,174
So the longer somebody is going to need a ventilator support,

92
00:06:54,174 --> 00:06:58,695
likely the longer their length of stay in the hospital is going to be

93
00:06:58,695 --> 00:07:01,621
probably longer length of stay in the ICU.

94
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,843
And that's not good for the hospital.

95
00:07:04,843 --> 00:07:06,694
It's not good for the patient.

96
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:08,030
It increased cost of care.

97
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:14,272
It increases medications the patient may need antibiotics and so on.

98
00:07:14,272 --> 00:07:18,325
And when we think of all these factors combine right now

99
00:07:18,325 --> 00:07:23,184
the estimated cost of a VAP or ventilator associated pneumonia.

100
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:27,132
It's approximately $40,000 of increased cost right?

101
00:07:27,132 --> 00:07:32,470
And right now those are all hospital services that end

102
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:37,818
up getting passed on to the patient through billing.

103
00:07:37,818 --> 00:07:42,935
Some of those are reimbursed but as we continue to surveillance

104
00:07:42,935 --> 00:07:47,665
continue to accumulate data not only from our hospital but

105
00:07:47,665 --> 00:07:51,153
from hospitals across the United States.

106
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:56,112
It's reasonable to expect that in the future these

107
00:07:56,112 --> 00:08:00,157
type of events will be non reimbursable.

108
00:08:00,157 --> 00:08:04,876
Meaning any increased cost due to preventable

109
00:08:04,876 --> 00:08:09,595
condition that occurs while in the hospital,

110
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:13,469
the hospital has to absorb that cost.

111
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:16,951
So regarding surveillance,

112
00:08:16,951 --> 00:08:21,548
we didn't always complete ventilator

113
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:26,840
surveillance under the auspice of VAE year,

114
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,753
ventilator associated events.

115
00:08:30,753 --> 00:08:35,185
Historically we had only really done surveillance for

116
00:08:35,185 --> 00:08:40,013
identification of VAP ventilator associated pneumonia.

117
00:08:40,013 --> 00:08:43,197
That was the surveillance definition that we used for years.

118
00:08:43,197 --> 00:08:47,930
Over time, I think what we collectively in health care learned

119
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,487
was that there was very low interest reliability associated

120
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:56,255
with defining ventilator associated among VAP.

121
00:08:56,255 --> 00:08:58,888
It was very subjective.

122
00:08:58,888 --> 00:09:03,856
There was a large pile of criteria that needed to be

123
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:08,840
met including chest imaging, labs, cultures.

124
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:14,725
Whether or not ventilator settings need to be changed and

125
00:09:14,725 --> 00:09:18,779
by how much did they need to be changed?

126
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:24,332
Some of this was objective information, but some of it wasn't.

127
00:09:24,332 --> 00:09:28,640
And what we found is that different people doing different surveillance would

128
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,154
call different events ventilator associated pneumonias and others wouldn't.

129
00:09:33,154 --> 00:09:37,957
So for benchmarking purposes or comparing from one hospital to the next,

130
00:09:37,957 --> 00:09:42,380
we found it was really not very reliable using this VAP definition.

131
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,934
This is also really labor intensive, It took a lot of time to

132
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:51,596
complete these reviews and it just wasn't very effective.

133
00:09:51,596 --> 00:09:55,712
So in 2013 the CDCs National Safety Network or

134
00:09:55,712 --> 00:10:00,619
an HHSN rolled out the VAE definitions for adults, right?

135
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:07,989
And this is for adults only but it excludes already graphic findings.

136
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:13,396
There's a very specific time frame or infection window period if that's

137
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:18,206
familiar terminology to you in which the criteria need to be met.

138
00:10:18,206 --> 00:10:22,894
It's a very objective very logical progression kind of through

139
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:27,162
this new surveillance definition and the ultimate goal.

140
00:10:27,162 --> 00:10:32,069
Also that these criteria could be applied in a way that could be automated

141
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:33,121
in the future.

142
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:38,510
And we're starting to see a little bit of that now that we'll discuss later.

143
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:46,229
But those are some of the reasons why the definition change from VAP to general VAE.

144
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:51,232
Okay so when we talk about VAE and we're getting

145
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:56,746
ready to talk about the surveillance definitions.

146
00:10:56,746 --> 00:11:03,815
Soon for adults VA is fall into three categories VACs, IVACs and PVAPs.

147
00:11:03,815 --> 00:11:09,603
VACs are also known as ventilator associated conditions.

148
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:14,347
These might be infection related but they might not be infection related

149
00:11:14,347 --> 00:11:19,027
ventilator settings can change for a whole host of different reasons.

150
00:11:19,027 --> 00:11:21,988
And some of those we are concerned about and

151
00:11:21,988 --> 00:11:26,770
some of those have nothing to do with infection prevention efforts.

152
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:31,234
But that being said the VACs our ventilator associated conditions.

153
00:11:31,234 --> 00:11:36,345
IVAC would be defined as infection related ventilator associated conditions.

154
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:40,843
So there's additional criteria that need to be met for

155
00:11:40,843 --> 00:11:44,178
IVAC as well go through in a few minutes.

156
00:11:44,178 --> 00:11:49,062
But IVAC would be infection related, associate conditions,

157
00:11:49,062 --> 00:11:50,911
and then lastly PVAPs.

158
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:55,713
Or possible ventilator associated pneumonias would be

159
00:11:55,713 --> 00:12:00,109
the most significant out of the three types of VAE.

160
00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:06,110
