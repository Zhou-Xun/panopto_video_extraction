Hi, this is Atisa Sioshansi. And welcome to the Connect the Issues podcast,

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:15,770
where we highlight important issues and discuss how they are connected to our communities. Because as we say here, connection catalyzes action.

3
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:24,680
Our goal with this two episode series is to help you connect the health impacts of climate change to our homeless community here in Los Angeles.

4
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,590
In episode one, we covered heat waves, climate change and the impact on L.a.'s homeless populations.

5
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:37,790
And now, in episode two, we will discuss air pollution, climate change and the impact on L.A.'s homeless populations.

6
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:44,630
So let's start with some brief stats and background on the issues we want to connect today.

7
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,500
First, a recap of homelessness in L.A.

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:56,420
Based on the last fall homelessness report that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, released.

9
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,880
Los Angeles is number two on the list of cities with the highest homelessness populations.

10
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,920
So New York City is number one. So let me put it all in perspective and numbers.

11
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,130
According to the report, in 2020,

12
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:18,050
580,466 people experienced homelessness in the U.S. on a given single night,

13
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:28,610
which was a 2.2 percent increase from the previous year. Unfortunately, homelessness rates have been rising consecutively since 2016,

14
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:38,210
and California accounted for 28 percent of the total homeless population and 51 percent of the unsheltered homeless population.

15
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:44,030
Los Angeles metro area accounted for approximately sixty four thousand homeless people,

16
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:54,470
which is about 11 percent of the total homeless population, making L.A. number two to New York City, which has about 13 percent of the total.

17
00:01:54,470 --> 00:02:04,010
So more than one in 10 homeless people reside in L.A., which is a significant number to keep in mind.

18
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:12,170
Now, let's discuss air pollution and climate change in L.A., although there are many impacts of climate change in L.A.,

19
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:17,270
two of the most critical issues for L.A. region are heat waves and air pollution.

20
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,230
Since we are focusing on air pollution in this episode.

21
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:27,380
Let me give you some background information information similarly to what we discussed about heat waves,

22
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,360
the increased temperatures we are seeing with climate change is also increasing the amount of air

23
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:39,590
pollution and bad air days in L.A. Some of the key concerns with L.A. air quality include ozone,

24
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:47,360
fine particulate matter and soot and smoke from wildfires, which, by the way, are also increasing due to climate change.

25
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,000
But we'll get to that. And climate change is further increasing the concentrations of these air contaminants.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,660
For example,

27
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:05,610
L.A. experienced one hundred and fifty seven bad air days for ozone pollution and more than 30 bad air days for fine particulate pollution in 2020.

28
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,000
And that's in 2020, a year when there was.

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,110
Plus, traffic on the roads because of COVID lockdowns.

30
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:24,310
So now we see that we have two key issues coming together homelessness and climate change in L.A. we have a high homeless population living in L.A.,

31
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:32,400
which is a city that is experiencing even more and longer heat waves and bad air days due to climate change.

32
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:40,890
Now, let's discuss the health impacts so that we can make the connection between air pollution, climate change and the homeless population of L.A.

33
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:51,720
We'll make the connection by considering what makes L.A. LA's homeless community vulnerable, what the expectations of climate change impacts are.

34
00:03:51,720 --> 00:04:02,340
And finally, what additional health impacts that are going to affect this already vulnerable population.

35
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,960
So let's start with what makes the L.A. homeless community vulnerable.

36
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:15,150
Well, as we stated in the last episode, they live in vulnerable areas and spend more time outdoors.

37
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:21,090
They experience higher rates of poverty, food insecurity and poor access to transportation.

38
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:26,640
And the community has a high prevalence of mental illness, cardiovascular disease,

39
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:32,820
respiratory conditions, alcoholism, drug addiction and social social isolation.

40
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:40,170
So what are the expectations of climate change impacts as a result of air pollution?

41
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:45,030
Well, climate change will increase the levels of ground level ozone.

42
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:52,020
The heat from the increased temperatures increases. The photo of chemical reactions that form Ozone,

43
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:59,550
and there are two main groups of smog forming pollutants that are that require balance reductions for ozone levels to not increase.

44
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:08,580
And these pollutants include carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds or viruses.

45
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:19,680
Additionally, we will continue to see higher concentrations of smoke pollutants as the number and duration of wildfires increases with climate change.

46
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:30,810
Some studies estimate that air pollution related deaths could increase by 20 to 30 percent by 2050 and by 30 to 45 percent by the 2080.

47
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:38,700
And finally, what are the additional health impacts that are expected for this already vulnerable population?

48
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:47,280
Well, LA's homeless population will experience even higher air pollution related deaths and illnesses such as asthma,

49
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:55,890
lung cancer, heart disease, stroke and breathing issues as a result of the increased air pollution and bad days.

50
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:03,330
Now that we have made the connection, let's take let's talk about some simple actions that you can take.

51
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:09,210
Most of the solutions to reducing the health impacts we discussed are either tied to adaptation,

52
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:17,700
which are efforts that help the community live with the issues or mitigation, which are efforts that will help stop air pollution.

53
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:24,330
Some actions that any of you that are listening to this podcast can consider taking include.

54
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:32,310
Learning about the plans and efforts your local community in L.A. already has in place to help to help help the homeless during bad air days.

55
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:40,560
So, for example, many communities open up indoor spaces with better ventilation expand and they expand shelter services.

56
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,130
And you can find out how you can help your local efforts. For example,

57
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:49,530
many outreach efforts are required prior to and during bad air days to help the

58
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:55,500
homeless population know what shelters and indoor spaces are available to them.

59
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:03,150
And additionally, individuals can try to reduce their contributions to the air pollutants by considering driving on

60
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:11,740
electric cars less and using less household cleaning and just disinfecting chemicals which emit Velshi's.

61
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:21,520
So now you have a much clearer understanding of air pollution and climate change and the impacts on LA's homeless community.

62
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:28,960
Thanks for listening to this episode of Connect the issue because as we say here, connection, catalyze this action.

63
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,506
I look forward to connecting with you for our next series of connect the issues.
