00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:12,710
In this lecture segment, we're going to begin talking about a few factors that contribute to health disparities,

2
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:18,840
factors that may contribute to or determine inequities in health outcomes.

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,900
As I said earlier, this won't be a thorough accounting or in-depth look,

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:35,760
but we will spend some time talking about health behaviors and how health behaviors are shaped by the social determinants of health.

5
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,910
The first health determinant I will describe is health behaviors.

6
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,590
Our daily behaviors influence our health.

7
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:54,880
If we look at premature or early deaths, we see that about half of those early deaths are caused by negative health behaviors.

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:05,330
About 15 percent of early deaths are attributable to smoking, 18 percent to poor diet and physical inactivity, etc.

9
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:11,920
We're going to devote multiple online lessons to these health behaviors later this semester.

10
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,410
But for now, what I want to draw your attention to is that we know there are demographic

11
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:22,870
differences in the rates at which people engage in these unhealthy behaviors.

12
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:35,710
And these differences contribute to some of the differences in infant mortality, life expectancy and disease rates we discussed earlier in the lesson.

13
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:45,110
Let me give you an example. You will not be surprised to hear that smoking is an important contributor to life expectancy.

14
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:50,510
But smoking behavior is not equally distributed across the population.

15
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:58,730
There are differences in smoking rates based on how many years of education one obtains in this graph,

16
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:08,530
the percent of individuals smoking is on the x axis and the level of educational attainment is on the Y axis.

17
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:20,490
You can see here just eight percent of people with a bachelor's degree smoke, compared to 20 percent of people with a high school degree or less.

18
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:30,960
Obesity itself is not a health behavior, but we know body size is shaped by both diet and physical activity to health behaviors

19
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:37,180
that are important for remaining vital and maintaining a high quality of life.

20
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:46,500
This slide shows differences in obesity rates for men and women, both for Caucasians and African-Americans.

21
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,400
With gender and race on the x axis and obesity rates on the y axis,

22
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:02,500
you'll notice that obesity rates for white men and women and for black men hover around one third.

23
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:08,400
For African-American women, the obesity rate is over 50 percent.

24
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:19,800
So when we think about factors that might lead or contribute to differences in life expectancy, infant mortality or other health outcomes,

25
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:33,460
considering the role of health behaviors like smoking, diet, physical activity, drinking or sexual behavior are all important.

26
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,330
But too often when people think about health behaviors,

27
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:46,450
it turns into a blame game focusing on the individual instead of the factors that occur outside the individual,

28
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,980
that may lead to negative health behaviors.

29
00:03:50,980 --> 00:04:05,000
Instead of focusing on resources like time, money or a physical environment that promotes health people wrongly or solely focus on choice.

30
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,390
This is especially true with regard to body size,

31
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:19,440
where people are quick to blame individual willpower but fail to examine other factors that influence one's ability to maintain a healthy weight.

32
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:28,720
Let's move on to discussing a group of factors that shape health behaviors, the social determinants of health.

33
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,620
A broad category of influences we term the social determinants of health is another key

34
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:41,920
determinant of health and health disparities in order to understand health disparities.

35
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:48,960
We need to step back and look at differences in resources across populations.

36
00:04:48,960 --> 00:05:02,200
These resources shape the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age, in other words, our social and physical environments.

37
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:09,580
These include factors like economic stability, neighborhoods and the built environment.

38
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:18,890
Education, food access, social support networks and access to health care systems.

39
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:25,130
Differences in the social determinants of health, including differences in social,

40
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:33,090
economic and environmental resources, are largely responsible for health disparities.

41
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:42,880
Over the next few slides, I'll talk about how several of these may underlie health disparities.

42
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:52,630
Economic stability affects health through resources to afford food, safe and stable housing and medical care.

43
00:05:52,630 --> 00:06:01,090
As you saw in unnatural causes, stresses from poverty, job and housing instability affects health,

44
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:10,380
as does the inability to afford healthy, nutritious foods or to pay for medication or needed medical care.

45
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,500
Where you live can have a direct influence on your health.

46
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:24,050
Housing quality and safety, access to healthy foods and parks and pollution levels very significantly across communities.

47
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:31,300
Again, we saw some great examples of this factor in unnatural causes.

48
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,820
We saw how neighborhood safety influences quality of life and health for some,

49
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:45,580
while crime or fear of crime affects stress and physical activity levels for others.

50
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:52,960
Education, another social determinants of health affects health through higher incomes and employment,

51
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,060
increases health knowledge and more social resources and less stress.

52
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:04,150
People who have higher incomes can afford to take better care of their health.

53
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:09,400
Often have jobs where they can leave work early or take a lunch break to run to the gym.

54
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,140
Higher education, often associated with higher incomes,

55
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:24,530
affords people the power and privilege to make behavioral choices that improves or protects their health and well-being.

56
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:34,380
Whether or not someone can consistently access healthy quality foods also has an important influence on their health.

57
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:40,650
Think about where you grew up. How far did you have to travel to a grocery store?

58
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:48,710
What types of food were available to you? Could you easily access a variety of healthy foods?

59
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:58,940
How much did that food cost? Even if you grew up in close proximity to affordable, high quality food,

60
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:06,470
recent food shortages and disruptions in the supply chain related to covid-19 or perhaps

61
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:14,050
just living on campus without a car may have caused you to rethink food access.

62
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:23,920
Later in this semester, you'll hear from a member of our nutritional sciences department who will talk more about the relationship between food,

63
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:36,600
food, access and health. The next social determinant that I want to mention is social and community context, this includes social cohesion,

64
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:46,240
support from family and friends, civic participation, incarceration and the experiences of discrimination.

65
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:57,270
Experiencing racism can affect health through limited economic opportunities, residential segregation and through increased stress levels.

66
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:04,150
Socially vulnerable communities are more likely to be adversely affected through a disaster event.

67
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:16,030
For instance, the elderly, the disabled and low income families may have more difficulty evacuating during a hurricane or flood.

68
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:28,760
A broad but important category, social and community context plays an important role in understanding and addressing health disparities.

69
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:36,660
Later in the semester, we will spend a lecture and a discussion section learning about the US health care system.

70
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:45,180
Well, one theme of the semester is that medical care has a much smaller influence on health and extending life than most people think.

71
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:55,710
I do want to note that access to health care and the quality of health care you receive is a social determinants of health.

72
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:07,740
Well, race and racism in and of themselves are not social determinants of health, racism influences or shapes, access to housing and health care,

73
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:18,570
economic and educational opportunities, criminal justice outcomes and processes, and the amount of wealth held by Americans.

74
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:24,210
The connection between racism and the social determinants of health leads the

75
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:31,110
public health community to declare that racism is a public health problem.

76
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:41,190
As we end today's lesson, I hope you'll take away the understanding the health disparities or health inequities are unjust,

77
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,400
avoidable differences in health.

78
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:53,820
There are disparities in many health outcomes, as well as the key measures of population health we discussed earlier in the semester.

79
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,500
Well, health behaviors play a role in driving inequities in health.

80
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:07,000
Understanding and addressing the social determinants of health is critical to addressing health disparities.

81
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,010
The work of public health is to strive for the highest possible standard of health,

82
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:23,383
for all to do so by eliminating health disparities and in doing so one day, achieving health equity.
