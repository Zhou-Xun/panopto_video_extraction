00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:15,740
Okay so today we're going to learn one of my favorite meditations, and this is just a way of combining some of the skills that we've already learned.

2
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:22,220
So when we think back to the self-awareness module, this is one visualization of

3
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,180
how to tune in with what's going on inside you in the moment.

4
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,990
So if you think about snow globes, you were the ones with snow inside, where you

5
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:34,500
shake it up, and it settles. That's the kind of imagery we're using today.

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,220
But I really like glitter bottles and you can make these, I think they're really fun to make.

7
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,760
You can put writing on the bottles, mantras and things.

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,400
You can put stickers. I have multiple of these with all different colors of glitter,

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,340
combining glitter can be fun to kind of just match your mood.

10
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,130
So think about, it's just an activity that you can do in and of itself.

11
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:06,860
But this is also a visual that we're gonna be using as we move through this meditation module.

12
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:16,620
What I want you to do, is just kind of get comfortable in a seat somewhere where you feel supported, you can kind of relax a little bit.

13
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,430
We're going to start with deep breathing. So what I want you to do,

14
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,470
sometimes people find it helpful to rest a hand on their chest or hand on their belly,

15
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:31,150
sometimes they just want their hands to be kind of relaxed at their side, either way is fine.

16
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,600
You can close your eyes, I do that sometimes just to kind of help me focus.

17
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,510
Or you can just find a place in the room that you're in to just let your eyes rest in that spot

18
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:45,300
while we do this. So I want you to take a deep breath in.

19
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:51,130
Breathing in like you want the air to go all the way down to your toes. Hold it for just a moment.

20
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:58,830
And exhale. Inhale.

21
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:06,290
Hold it. And exhale.

22
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:15,460
We'll do one more of those. Inhale. Hold it.

23
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:23,490
And exhale. With each exhale, you're letting go.

24
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:30,660
And now I want you to just kind of find your own natural, relaxed breath.

25
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:43,810
So you're going to find a slow, deep breath, almost kind of how it feels in your asleep and you're breathing. Often, you feel it a little bit in your belly.

26
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:53,790
You're just inhaling an opening. Holding it, exhaling and letting go.

27
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,210
Now, on any given day, this could be the place where you just do this,

28
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:07,550
you just don't even go any further than this. You're just inhaling, opening, pausing,

29
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:17,550
exhaling, and letting go. And then if you want, you can add this next step.

30
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:30,970
As you find yourself in a nice pace, slow, deep breath, you're going to turn your attention inward and visualize what's floating around inside.

31
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:39,550
Some people kind of visualize this as in their head, kind of in your chest or your stomach area, wherever it makes sense for you.

32
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:45,410
But you're just going to kind of notice, what's floating around inside?

33
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:54,140
And so if you think about this as an internal snow globe, or you think about this as your internal glitter bottle,

34
00:03:54,140 --> 00:04:04,860
you're just going to breathe and observe. And it may be kind of calm and clear and settled like this.

35
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:12,530
And if that's the case, continue to just observe and notice.

36
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:19,680
It may also be kind of stirred up and have a lot floating around in there,

37
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:32,350
and that's okay too. You're just going to breath and observe.

38
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:42,380
If it's hard to visualize, just go back to the breathing. You're not analyzing anything that's floating around in there,

39
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:49,870
you're not labeling it good or bad. You're just noticing, observing,

40
00:04:49,870 --> 00:05:05,810
and breathing. You may find that there are certain things that when you noticed them, they kind of get stirred up, and more chaotic,

41
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:17,610
that's okay too. Just breathing and noticing.

42
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:24,930
Often as we do this, we start to feel less like we're in there, kind of surrounded by all of the chaos,

43
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:34,800
and more like we can kind of stand outside of it a little bit and just breath.

44
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,140
Sometimes you'll notice distractions, noises, and that's okay.

45
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:52,990
It's also things floating around, continue to just notice and breathe. Slow, and deep.

46
00:05:52,990 --> 00:06:00,220
Sometimes we have kind of like pop ups. Like, oh, no, I need to send this email all that, and we just kind of say, okay, sticky note it,

47
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:12,220
I'll get to it as soon as this is done. We just need to breathe slowly. As we breathe, often,

48
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:18,290
things kind of slow down and settle some. If that's not happening, it's okay.

49
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:28,890
Just the fact that you can breathe while noticing everything that's in there, is enough.

50
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:40,640
If it does start to get a little more settled down and calm and quiet. It can sometimes be useful to just kind of introduce a question.

51
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:52,880
What do I need right now? And we're not going to think or analyze or search, we're just going to see if something kind of comes up.

52
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:04,420
And if not, that's okay, we'll just continue to breathe and observe.

53
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:11,640
Notice what it's like to not have to figure anything out, analyze it,

54
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:29,160
label it, but just to breathe.

55
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,670
As we get ready to exit this meditation, what I want you to do

56
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:40,710
is introduced one more question and just see if anything floats up.

57
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:53,440
What is this next moment about? Some of you may be leaving this meditation to go straight to other tasks or to spend time with somebody,

58
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,860
and so you want to be able to just kind of leave everything here and go give full attention to that.

59
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:08,020
For some of us, we might say, I just want to keep breathing slower and deeper for the next five, fifteen minutes after this,

60
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:15,140
and so that's what the next moment is about. Whatever it is, just kind of notice it.

61
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:25,500
Take a few more slow, deep breaths. When you're ready,

62
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:34,150
you can bring your attention back, or near it, sometimes kind of resettling in to all of this is helpful.

63
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:42,000
I want you to think about how you can use this. We kind of stretched it out a little bit and you can stretch this out longer,

64
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,330
you can stay in that place for as long as you need.

65
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:51,580
You may, when you get done, want to jot down a few things that came up like, oh, this is really weighing on me,

66
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:57,020
I want to set a time to have a conversation about it, I want to get some more help to sort through that thing that was floating around in there, and

67
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:03,470
kept popping up. But this is a check in that you can do, riding the bus, on a walk,

68
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:10,870
just visualizing your internal glitter bottle or snow globe, noticing what's in there, practicing

69
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:16,180
not judging it, but just breathing and kind of taking inventory.

70
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:22,220
The other thing to notice is that part that we did at the beginning, that you can do by herself anytime.

71
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:30,020
And the words can kind of help you stay focusing on your breath. So I think about it this, inhale and open,

72
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:34,490
hold it. Exhale, let go.

73
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:40,150
It's kind of like a pendulum for me. That thing that swings back and forth.

74
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:46,440
Inhale and open. Hold it. Exhale, let go.

75
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:52,250
If you're saying those words to yourself, it'll keep the breath slow,

76
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:59,450
and kind of anchor you into focusing on your breath. So you've got a breathing exercise, a glitter ball meditation,

77
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,840
and if you noticed, it followed that check in process that we have. What am I holding?

78
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:14,360
What do I need right now? And what is this next moment about? So play with the pieces and practice, practice, practice.
