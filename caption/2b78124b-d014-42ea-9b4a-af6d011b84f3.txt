00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,560
Hello, everyone. Welcome
back to Nutrition 590.

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,020
Have you ever thought
about punctuation in

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,005
the context of gene
expression and epigenetics?

4
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:20,700
No, not really?

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,550
Well listen to this
set of three words.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,920
The first time I say
the three words,

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,340
there is no punctuation,
"Let's eat grandma."

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,665
Now let's add a comma,
"Let's eat, grandma."

9
00:00:34,665 --> 00:00:37,005
The simple comma changes

10
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:39,555
the way the words
are interpreted.

11
00:00:39,555 --> 00:00:43,295
In this module, we'll learn
about histone modifications,

12
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:46,250
which acts similarly in
our epigenome to control

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,900
the 3D structure of

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,760
the genetic material to make it

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,810
more or less easy to express.

16
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,980
The three learning objectives in

17
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,929
this module include; first,

18
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:59,315
describing why
histone modifications

19
00:00:59,315 --> 00:01:02,200
are important in regulating
gene expression.

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,095
Two, understanding that
histone modifications

21
00:01:06,095 --> 00:01:10,115
are numerous and more complex
than DNA methylation.

22
00:01:10,115 --> 00:01:13,415
Finally, looking at
the primary literature

23
00:01:13,415 --> 00:01:14,990
to review the role of

24
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:18,410
histone modifications
following protein restriction

25
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,830
in an animal model study.

26
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,560
The DNA double helix
does not exist in

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,250
a linear format that is often
depicted in our textbooks.

28
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,410
In fact, it's packaged
inside a cell's nucleus.

29
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,420
One way that DNA is packaged is

30
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,735
via histones and
histone modifications.

31
00:01:38,735 --> 00:01:42,230
Histones are a family
of basic proteins that

32
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:46,520
associate with DNA in the
nucleus and help condense it.

33
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,220
The DNA and protein structure
is called chromatin.

34
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,750
A histone modification is

35
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,739
a covalent modification
to a histone protein,

36
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:01,790
and this can include
methylation, phosphorylation,

37
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:06,315
acetylation, ubiquitination,
and SUMOylation.

38
00:02:06,315 --> 00:02:08,010
The modifications made of

39
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,270
histones can impact
gene expression

40
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,939
by altering the
chromatin structure

41
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:16,820
and recruiting histone modifiers.

42
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,389
Histone proteins
act to package DNA,

43
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:24,410
and this DNA wraps around
a set of eight histones,

44
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,595
and this is called a nucleosome.

45
00:02:26,595 --> 00:02:29,300
A nucleosome has two copies

46
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,730
of each of four core histones,

47
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,715
and these four histones
are labeled 2A,

48
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:38,245
2B, 3 and 4.

49
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:40,610
The histone modifications act

50
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,815
in diverse biological processes,

51
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:47,270
such as transcriptional
activation and inactivation,

52
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,340
chromosome packaging, and in

53
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,220
helping DNA damage and repair.

54
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,440
Histone modifications and

55
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,300
their corresponding nomenclature

56
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,480
are a bit more complex
than DNA methylation.

57
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,750
This slide is a bit of a primer.

58
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,855
We're going to use
one example here.

59
00:03:03,855 --> 00:03:07,800
This is histone 3 lysine
4 monomethylation.

60
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,340
So let me describe that
in a bit more detail.

61
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,840
The first part is

62
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,175
the histone protein
which is being modified.

63
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:19,230
In this example, that
is histone 3 or H3.

64
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,975
The next part is a single
letter amino acid abbreviation.

65
00:03:23,975 --> 00:03:26,120
Here's where those of
you who have taken

66
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,740
biochemistry may start having

67
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,900
flashbacks to your flashcards,

68
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,980
which you had your amino
acids depicted on them.

69
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,030
In this example, the K stands
for the lysine amino acid,

70
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,410
and this occurs at

71
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,545
the fourth amino acid
position of the histone tail.

72
00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:46,795
So that is histone 3, lysine 4.

73
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:49,410
The last part of this acronym,

74
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,325
Me1, represents monomethylation.

75
00:03:53,325 --> 00:03:58,585
So H3K4me1 denotes
the monomethylation

76
00:03:58,585 --> 00:04:00,155
of the fourth residue,

77
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:02,210
a lysine, from the start of

78
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,920
the N-terminal tail of
the histone 3 protein.

79
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,290
This slide is an
example depiction of

80
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,355
a histone code for those
four basic histone proteins.

81
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:15,440
You will notice methylation,

82
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,225
phosphorylation, acetylation,
and ubiquitination.

83
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:22,010
For methylation, you will
notice that there are

84
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,115
colors associated with a
traffic light pattern,

85
00:04:25,115 --> 00:04:28,505
from red, green, and yellow.

86
00:04:28,505 --> 00:04:32,120
This is meant to represent a
modification that represses,

87
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,740
activates, or dampens
down gene expression.

88
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,120
So focusing on the first part

89
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,325
of this figure,
which is histone 3,

90
00:04:40,325 --> 00:04:45,920
you will notice that histone
3 is acetylated at lysine 9,

91
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,975
14, 18, and 23.

92
00:04:49,975 --> 00:04:56,400
It's methylated at arginine
2 and lysine 4, 9, 27,

93
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,430
36, and 79 and finally

94
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,615
phosphorylated at
serine 10 and 28.

95
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,600
Moving below, histone 4,

96
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,945
you can see is acetylated
at lysine 5, 8, 12,

97
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:17,355
and 16 and methylated at
arginine 3 and lysine 20,

98
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:20,915
and finally phosphorylated
as serine 1.

99
00:05:20,915 --> 00:05:23,840
As you move to the
bottom of this graph,

100
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,320
which shows histone 2A and 2B,

101
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,565
I want to draw your attention to

102
00:05:28,565 --> 00:05:31,045
the rectangle on the right.

103
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:33,910
So here, this is not
the histone tail,

104
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,505
but the histone protein
globular domain.

105
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:38,110
In this case, you'll see

106
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,320
the modification Ub,
which is ubiquitination.

107
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,970
So this is another type of

108
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,250
large protein modification on

109
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,950
a histone tail that can
affect gene expression.

110
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,310
For a moment, I
want to focus in on

111
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,755
just one type of
histone modification.

112
00:05:53,755 --> 00:05:56,360
This is histone acetylation.

113
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,310
Histone acetylation occurs
by the enzymatic addition of

114
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,640
an acetyl group from
the acetyl coenzyme A.

115
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,840
One basic rule of
histone modifications is

116
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,170
that acetylation activates
gene expression.

117
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,745
So the opposite of
DNA methylation.

118
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:16,550
This is because the acetylation

119
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,465
of the lysine residue,
so remember the K,

120
00:06:19,465 --> 00:06:23,345
neutralizes the basic
charge and promotes

121
00:06:23,345 --> 00:06:25,910
chromatin relaxation
and the recruitment of

122
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,230
proteins that can
activate transcription.

123
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,150
There are series of
enzymes that can put

124
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,650
on acetylation marks
and take them off.

125
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,640
The first modifying
enzyme involved in

126
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,780
histone acetylation
is called HAT.

127
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,735
So this is histone
acetyltransferase,

128
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:46,340
and they play a critical
role in controlling

129
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,700
histone 3 and histone
4 acetylation.

130
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,295
The second set of
enzymes are called

131
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:55,925
HDACs or histone deacetylases,

132
00:06:55,925 --> 00:06:59,044
and these catalyze
the hydraulic removal

133
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:02,590
of acetyl groups from these
histone lysine residues.

134
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,940
We know through basic
science research

135
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,190
that an imbalance in
the equilibrium of

136
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,050
histone acetylation has been

137
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,900
associated with certain
negative prognoses,

138
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,295
such as tumorigenesis
and cancer progression.

139
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:17,810
So it's okay if you
still feel a little bit

140
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,230
confused about the mechanism
of histone modifications.

141
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,780
We hope this research
article will help you

142
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,880
better understand
the application of

143
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,420
histone modifications
in an epigenetic study

144
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,610
as well as begin to introduce to

145
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,830
you to some of the
methods that we use to

146
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,765
measure or quantify levels
of histone modification.

147
00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:40,250
This study was motivated by

148
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,280
the knowledge that maternal
nutrition during pregnancy

149
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,490
is a very important
factor that can result in

150
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,390
persistent alterations to
the offspring epigenome,

151
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,550
and that these can
associate with later

152
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,975
in life negative health outcomes.

153
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,270
So this is the whole point of

154
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,885
the developmental origins
of health and disease.

155
00:07:58,885 --> 00:08:03,290
Additionally, epigenetic
regulations mediated by

156
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,430
the macro or micro nutrients
that are consumed by mothers

157
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,090
during pregnancy are
increasingly recognized as

158
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,580
a prenatal mechanism
that can program

159
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,245
offspring susceptibility
to disease development.

160
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:19,640
So the goal of this
research article,

161
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,605
which was published in 2011

162
00:08:21,605 --> 00:08:24,005
in the Journal of
Nutritional Biochemistry,

163
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:25,820
is to examine the effect of

164
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,460
a maternal low protein diet

165
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,595
on the regulation of
a gene called p16,

166
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:35,405
which is important for cell
cycle gene expression.

167
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:38,785
They're looking in the
mammary gland of offspring.

168
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:41,540
So this is an animal study in

169
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,125
rats that can access the
target tissue of interest,

170
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,170
which is the breast tissue.

171
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,175
Based on previous research,

172
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:53,230
we know that p16 is a
tumor suppressor gene.

173
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,690
In general, you want tumor
suppressor genes to be on or

174
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,655
expressed so that they can
reduce cancer susceptibility.

175
00:09:00,655 --> 00:09:02,630
Here, I'm beginning
to show you some

176
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,370
of the results from the study.

177
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,855
In the first figure,

178
00:09:05,855 --> 00:09:10,070
you'll see this is the
levels of mRNA expression.

179
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,230
So this is simply
gene expression of

180
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,905
that p16 tumor suppressor gene.

181
00:09:14,905 --> 00:09:17,150
In the animals whose mothers

182
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,920
consumed the low-protein diet,

183
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,365
you can see on the
right side of the graph

184
00:09:21,365 --> 00:09:24,725
that there is a lower
level of expression.

185
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:28,000
The second thing that
the researchers did was,

186
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,980
not only look at gene expression,

187
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,525
but translate this
to protein levels.

188
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:35,165
In this case, it is as expected.

189
00:09:35,165 --> 00:09:38,404
Individuals whose mothers
consumed low protein,

190
00:09:38,404 --> 00:09:41,120
not only had a lower
level of gene expression,

191
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,865
but also lower protein levels.

192
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:45,500
So what does all this have to

193
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,575
do with histone modifications?

194
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:49,250
Here on this slide,

195
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,530
the researchers are
showing the results from

196
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,410
four specific histone
modifications.

197
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,015
We're looking at histone 4

198
00:09:56,015 --> 00:10:00,180
acetylation, histone
3 acetylation,

199
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,065
histone 3 lysine 4 dimethylation,

200
00:10:04,065 --> 00:10:08,025
and finally histone 3
lysine 9 trimethylation.

201
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:11,555
In the case of two of these
histone modifications,

202
00:10:11,555 --> 00:10:13,865
the ones that are depicted
with the asterisks,

203
00:10:13,865 --> 00:10:17,450
we can see that maternal
low protein consumption

204
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,505
resulted in altered
levels of histones.

205
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:24,650
So now you can begin to see
the mechanism that links

206
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,110
the maternal dietary
exposure with

207
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,510
the offspring gene
expression changes

208
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,970
in the mammary gland.

209
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,820
The fact that p16 is
decreased through

210
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,850
histone modifications is
an effect which could

211
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,240
lead to increased cancer
risk later in life.
