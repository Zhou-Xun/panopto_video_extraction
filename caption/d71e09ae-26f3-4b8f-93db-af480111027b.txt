1
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:19,570
Simply. All right.

2
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:31,680
So we're going to finish up our discussion of marginal structural models in structural mean models today.

3
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:40,780
And then it'll be moving on to a discussion of basically assessing mediation, using instrumental variables.

4
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:52,359
And then a little sort of review piece, we try to sort of connect the principal stratification approach with the sort of direct and indirect effects

5
00:00:52,360 --> 00:01:01,870
approach and refer to as the causal association versus the causal effects approach when it's happening.

6
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,670
Which in some sense is sort of the core. To my mind, it's sort of core.

7
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,220
Part of the class is sort of covered there.

8
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:25,650
Well, then we'll then kind of finish up with some discussion about causal inference in time to event settings,

9
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,910
which has its own little twists and turns like the Bayesian stuff.

10
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,900
In that, assuming I did, you know, having some survival analysis is not appropriate for this course.

11
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,170
So I'll do a little bit of sort of summary on that.

12
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,850
And then if we have time, we'll kind of move this into the there's a sort of a special case of this sort of exposure,

13
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,700
reduce confounding and in time varying settings.

14
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:59,670
So basically it's a situation where if we're following over time exposures or treatments

15
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:06,180
can be impacted by sort of an intermediate outcome that can sort of change how you,

16
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,750
you know, reacting to an exposure or a treatment.

17
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:15,540
And so you sort of get this chain of of exposure induced confounding over time

18
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,540
and there's sort of extensions of the work we've done already to assess that.

19
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:28,470
So that'll be the end of the course if we get that if we get that for the topic in the earlier pieces.

20
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:38,729
Okay. So before I dive in, any questions from what he came to office hours.

21
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:50,330
So that felt you were able to review the material we covered on Monday, if not the office hours done.

22
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,440
Okay. So I want to finish up with this sensitivity analysis for exposure induced confounding.

23
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:16,840
So this is basically going to be sort of connected to the sort of general issue of of unmeasured

24
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:25,210
confounding that we we looked at in our previous sort of direct approach to to mediation.

25
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:32,700
So again, this assumption that we can fix a mediator value allows us to estimate the control direct effects of

26
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,809
the presence of exposure induced confounding but for natural direct or natural indirect effects,

27
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:43,690
we don't control that mediator. So any exposure reduced confounding manifests bias.

28
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:52,089
So we can kind of conduct sensitivity analysis about the degrees of confounding.

29
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,740
But the previous methods that we discussed in class notes don't quite work.

30
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:05,610
So as before, we're going to retain this assumption that the unconfirmed attacks,

31
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,820
there's an unconfirmed exposure and them both the outcome and the mediator.

32
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:21,890
So basically who brokenness association between a the treatment or exposure and the potential outcome of the ultimate outcome victory

33
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:30,450
restorative potential outcome for the mediator then which we have X so sort of conditional on X basically of randomization of the,

34
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,070
of the exposure or the or the treatment.

35
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:42,780
But we're not going to require these additional steps that we get the mediator and the outcome to be

36
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:50,550
independent given treatment in X or that the exposure induced confounding is taken care of by X.

37
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:59,860
So so the sensitivity analysis not we sort of relax that assumption,

38
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:07,050
we then allow for differences and that's why I'm turning the term B cross world potential outcomes.

39
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,420
And so what would happen at potential outcome if we switch the treatment assignment

40
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,960
but intervene somehow to observe the outcome at a fixed level of the mediator.

41
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:27,300
Right, right. So this basically this this gamma m says if for some fixed level mediation and some set of covariates

42
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:35,399
that there's a discrepancy here between our expected outcome under treatment and the given.

43
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,660
Well, the mediator assigned to treatment. Right. So this is a thing we can estimate.

44
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,080
And then what would happen to that potential outcome had we actually put the person on control?

45
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:54,510
So it's a bit strange, but I'll go through this example and I'm going to return to this physician encouragement

46
00:05:54,510 --> 00:06:01,230
design or a treatment assignment is indeed randomized a the treatment taken is in so.

47
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:09,180
Some states can get the first because of the realization this is this is by design going to be true.

48
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:16,080
But of course, we don't know about the mediator and the outcome.

49
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:27,209
Reputation doesn't take care of that. So so the contrast up here basically between subjects who get a sign of encouragement.

50
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,930
AAM received the treatment but that was not a sign of encouragement.

51
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:36,420
AAM but still took the treatment under a counterfactual world where both groups are assigned encouragement and get treatment.

52
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:43,710
So it's a bit weird but that's the that's the logic of these cross world settings.

53
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:56,509
So we're going to start off by estimating our natural, direct, natural indirect effects, assuming no bias by any sort of standard.

54
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:00,200
Not only assumptions hold and I'll call those estimates.

55
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:10,280
Q Indeed. Q And i.e., we then compute this gamma term and we can show that the biased,

56
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:18,079
corrected estimates basically either subtract off gamma for the natural direct effect or ad demand for a natural indirect effect or gamma.

57
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:29,389
Is this this kind of discrepancy in this potential outcome averaged over the distribution

58
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:36,560
of the mediator under control given x so everything here like conditions on x.

59
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:48,880
So ah, just to remind everybody, these are estimates of the natural, direct, natural, indirect effect.

60
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:55,479
So in the general case it's the difference between the potential outcome but ah,

61
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:06,130
treatment control at a given level the mediator ex averaged over the distribution of a mediator under control and for the natural indirect effect.

62
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:14,889
Basically we look at the at the at the mean under treatment for a given level

63
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:20,830
of mediator and X and average that over the distribution of the mediator.

64
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:27,310
Well the difference in the distribution of the mediators under treatment or under control.

65
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:34,240
And if we have these linear models and there's a couple tables here, so sorry about that.

66
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,720
I think the first hypo is I had this is a it should be.

67
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:50,169
M Right. So our linear model for Y given a m an X allows for treatment effect, mediator,

68
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:55,389
effect, interaction and then adjustment for covariates that our mediator,

69
00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:03,100
given our outcome, is just given I'm sorry, a mediator given her treatment assignment and covariance is just.

70
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:12,330
That sort of treatment assignment and then covariates and there's a further area here here to there should be better to so going

71
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:20,220
back to our bear and Kenny stuff right this is beta or direct effect becomes beta one in our indirect effect is beta two alpha one.

72
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,520
So and then of course we have to allow for each interactions.

73
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:36,450
So just to I thought it might be worthwhile to think it's kind of hard that I have to bring down my markers.

74
00:09:41,770 --> 00:10:06,960
So basically, this is going to be just a complete. So.

75
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:21,480
All right. So we worked out that. Or for an actual direct effect here.

76
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,490
Happy people back to the fold. But.

77
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,620
A few words of caution here. Right? This is what happens if we.

78
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:58,270
Your assumptions of. Instead of this potential outcome.

79
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,160
And their treatment. My apologies for the mediator.

80
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:12,240
Really go back to the model based estimates of assumptions for the data.

81
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:22,410
And the logic here is that we're one which sets this sort of natural, indirect effect.

82
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:31,439
We're studying the outcome of a mediator that control the average,

83
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:41,640
that over the natural and sensitive averages of the distribution of mediators in the sample population percentage representative.

84
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,420
So. So we plug in a linear model here.

85
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,180
All right.

86
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:19,110
So I love your model. Right.

87
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:28,110
I better not sit here and vote. I have a better one, a innovative one in a store and doesn't change that.

88
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:36,540
Made it to them both. And then a better three and a half.

89
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,420
Eight three. And they start to fade.

90
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:47,549
Force is better for X for the bad or nice bad things they force.

91
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,600
Cancel your self-esteem. They want to.

92
00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:05,350
So. All right. So basically now this is somebody over the distribution of them doing a certain X so.

93
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:15,710
To replace this fatal one. Fatal one times is probably some issue.

94
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:25,200
This is just a few more, right? I will use this. And then the big three, the education bill.

95
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:42,720
Is there an X? Their great summation of Around Here and Start.

96
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,670
So this. I just went right off my.

97
00:13:53,900 --> 00:14:21,650
Not only. So I guess it also bears mentioning, right?

98
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:25,530
I mean, this is an aside there are other modeling assumptions you could use here.

99
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:31,650
Right. So I see that we can have other kinds of interactions if you had some.

100
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:41,420
I'd love to hear more machine learning type thing going on here. This is all could be used.

101
00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:02,580
So that takes care of my Q and B he acts.

102
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:11,150
So for. So through the natural indirect effect.

103
00:15:14,440 --> 00:16:09,780
It's. We think so in natural indirect effects,

104
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:21,570
which is where you keep the potential outcome under a given level of and decreasing the fact

105
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,940
that they're looking to see how the distribution of the mediator changes between treatment.

106
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:32,430
Acceptable to allow us to get you the.

107
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,180
Yeah. So, um.

108
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,770
All right. So. So a little bit differently. So basically, I get this.

109
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:58,810
Anywhere. I don't have a name, but I have this full expectation.

110
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:20,310
Those terms. These end up just being differences in the probabilities distributions some do over and so it's just different people.

111
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,940
Very good. And here.

112
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:42,020
Same reason. This whole thing. So.

113
00:17:47,290 --> 00:18:15,689
But at the same time hearing. All right.

114
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:29,210
So this also you. And I do have.

115
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:44,680
It's been two times and so. End up being expectations and a star a.

116
00:18:50,430 --> 00:19:26,620
And. Better for him to go back to the same things.

117
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:55,190
Zero. So I just made it to Spain.

118
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:00,560
Spend a. And.

119
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:14,080
Expectations. So basically you expect them to give me an X and not a.

120
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:29,260
For tax. Star.

121
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,340
That's right.

122
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,340
We should just let it.

123
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,840
For one thing. Star.

124
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:32,790
So. And of course I would average over x speed values at X and then take an air sample average to get an overall average of the coverage.

125
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:38,470
What kind of empirical distribution idea? Okay.

126
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,700
So many questions and some sense that should be a review of what we talked about before.

127
00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:06,880
So. Now to show the bias correction piece.

128
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:18,140
That's going to require a little more work. So we think.

129
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,790
You can do a good trick of doing this to kind of keep yourself.

130
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:57,530
Science. So.

131
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:34,050
All right. So basically it's an assault off.

132
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,310
Remind ourselves that. So it's sort of natural.

133
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:55,260
We developed an indirect, indirect effects. We let the mediator take on whatever the value is of this assignment or that

134
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:59,790
this corresponds to the potential outcome itself under that reading assignment.

135
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:07,950
So. And then.

136
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:32,490
Right. It's like that again.

137
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:38,110
Because of what? Jeff.

138
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:44,959
I'm going to just throw that in there from here. Why you're shaking your head.

139
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:51,200
Yes. But again, it's about a mediator and mediator.

140
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,809
It's actually outcome. Right now, potential outcomes are sort of first thing you ever start off with.

141
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:03,530
You're right. So then.

142
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:20,080
I think for various reasons, I'm going to just call as soon be the delay as equal to one as opposed to a star.

143
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:28,330
So but then setting aside my can I go from here to here for that term?

144
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:38,110
What can I use when observed? Data conditioned condition done.

145
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:52,660
And. Well, essentially now it is an assumption.

146
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:58,320
It's kind of in some sense kind of an obvious one, one that we make maybe unconsciously points.

147
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:26,460
But is it trivial? Yes.

148
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:33,899
Part of that consistency, right side of that you can see our observed outcomes in of correspond to our potential

149
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:43,440
outcome when the actual treatment assignment matches that potential of them and.

150
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,170
And lastly, just for bonus points here, by the way.

151
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:17,360
Anybody remember what this is called? It's just a probability statement, right?

152
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:24,950
Well, yeah. Left a probability or or sometimes a red iterated expectation.

153
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:33,570
So. Okay. So that means I can write.

154
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:17,310
Right. So you just go. You're here for one year and.

155
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:36,990
There's no potential out of control in the media is whatever it would have been under control.

156
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:48,450
I'm sorry. You know I'm in here.

157
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:14,100
It's really the problem. Zero.

158
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:42,220
Now for this review, but just before you here.

159
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:55,730
So so for my natural, direct and indirect effects, I'm going to need these quantities, but I'm also going to need this quantity here.

160
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:01,570
Right. This is a sort of cross world thing, treatment, potential outcome of the treatment.

161
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:06,010
The mediator set to its whatever value would have been under control.

162
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:34,660
So. So when you iterated expectations again and then.

163
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,859
And again I said my treatment here is essentially I confounder once I condition x both respect

164
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:20,230
to the potential outcome of interest in the mediators under different treatment levels.

165
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:39,110
So I just plopped that in. So.

166
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:29,370
Now I can use my observed values of consistency that I observe in grades zero four, and here's a potential outcome.

167
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:38,630
Zero. And the last little step here.

168
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:50,590
Is. Now I'm going to go back.

169
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:45,630
And so. So basically if I didn't have any issues with with confounding between the mediator and the outcome, these two values would be the same.

170
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,620
But now you don't allow for that possibility that occurs. Right.

171
00:33:50,280 --> 00:34:05,550
So the difference between these games, so between this and this, so they replace this with this here I have to subtract off my definition.

172
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:21,490
So I can look at potential outcome there for the outcome. So but now I can once I've got that in the back to make consistency assumption.

173
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:50,830
You could just write this as sort of one max. But romanticizing the personality piece here.

174
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:10,050
So. Okay, so we're here, right?

175
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:27,880
Oh, no, that's right. Sorry. That's right. And so on to do the.

176
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:56,280
So this is this quantity thing, of course, can estimate this data just going to this sensitivity parameter.

177
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:23,720
So. All right.

178
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:55,870
That. So this is what I'm terming this capital, Gamma X.

179
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:00,800
All right.

180
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:19,840
So basically just sort of pulling out the sensitivity turn from an additional potential outcome and retreat with the media as a control given as.

181
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:34,700
All right. So this is by definition biased bias with biases and bias associated with an indirect effect.

182
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:50,840
It's going to be this by usual estimate or by natural indirect effect, minus the true natural indirect effect.

183
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,760
So. But.

184
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:40,940
So I'm just writing that out as usual to meet her through events.

185
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:52,600
Minus the the actual indirect effect was justified in terms of potential outcomes.

186
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:02,800
Specifically, the difference of the treatment concerned changing the mediator to be whatever it would be in treatment versus control.

187
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:22,880
Okay. So. Where he worked out this piece here.

188
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:40,580
When you go to. So.

189
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:50,750
So just, you know, turning these parts, clinicians expectation is when you're upgrader.

190
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:56,990
And what I've got from here is basically what I want the true value plus that.

191
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:05,750
So if anything here cancels except my negative tax.

192
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:27,590
And. Or my bias or my natural, direct effect.

193
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:40,410
And that's just my estimate. And this meant true values.

194
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:56,150
True values or I hold the mediator, consider its natural value or control to change the treatment.

195
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:23,470
Now I need your estimate without bias.

196
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:28,180
You know, bias is confounding.

197
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:47,930
Very different sort of difference in the outcomes of the mediation.

198
00:42:48,920 --> 00:43:01,040
COSTELLO We were happy to be observed and then given a one equals zero and then averaging over that distribution the control.

199
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:20,370
Of course I want to subtract the truth. So the same game I did before.

200
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:39,660
Basically for this sort of crossroad, peace end up with this.

201
00:43:54,700 --> 00:44:04,060
Thanks for. Biased term, but then for my regular potential outcomes, that doesn't come into play.

202
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:28,730
Right. So everything cancels here except for my. So that provides.

203
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:42,680
Essentially the results live on the slides. So when I want to correct.

204
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:52,830
My natural, direct and natural indirect effect estimate is that you have to add or subtract

205
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:04,860
these gamma axes where they are and turn this assumed difference in the.

206
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:18,230
Potential outcome treat with a mediator under treatment before you actually expose different treatment control pieces.

207
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:25,130
Of course, always condition units at every sober distribution of the mediator.

208
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:36,560
And I'm sure. Okay.

209
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:44,600
So the questions that are papers are running around and everything.

210
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:30,540
And I pull down and go on. So it's very interesting.

211
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:40,569
She basically proceeds using the bootstrap. Of course, I suppose you could get one here, but a prior on that gamma.

212
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:44,090
But in the sensitive analysis, we're going to assume that's just fixed and known.

213
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:51,070
But we do have to estimate variability in this distribution of.

214
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:58,170
Given April zero and X as well as the sort of.

215
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:11,440
Estimates of the natural and natural indirect effect made in the absence of bias and then compute that bias corrected use percentiles.

216
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:27,130
Okay. So based on the odds ratio scale for the natural direct effect can basically be obtained by subtracting off

217
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:39,250
this biased estimate or where we take our gamma acts and now divide it by expected value of Y under control x,

218
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:45,510
and then for the natural indirect effect basically the same thing.

219
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:50,560
So now you divide by a value of y given equal to one an x.

220
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:55,030
So the details of this I don't want to get into basically a lot of algebra.

221
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:58,840
You just did enough algebra, basic probability.

222
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:07,210
So I guess real quickly, obviously if if gamma x is basically zero, right,

223
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:14,910
then basically this quantity is just the odds ratios and default back to to this, right?

224
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:23,200
This basically becomes one of the dominator. So in terms of the direct effect, it's sort of an indirect effect.

225
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:27,970
So it depends on whether we're setting able to zero an equal to one.

226
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:33,700
I mean, when they're looking at direct or indirect effects, also some in binary meters in outcomes.

227
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:43,150
Right. So. And then we have the usual direct and indirect effect as two meters.

228
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:54,549
So. So what kind of time with that?

229
00:48:54,550 --> 00:49:01,280
We'll look at the proofs on that which. Okay.

230
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:09,940
So we're going to finish up. Think we have time to finish up with looking at this?

231
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:13,690
It's sort of hinted at before this physician encouragement study.

232
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:19,740
So we use this in principal stratification analysis.

233
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:23,620
We can do the same sort of direct and indirect effect analysis here.

234
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:31,540
So treatment remains this randomized assignment. And the mediator then is going to be whether or not the patient actually seek treatment.

235
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:37,610
Right. So so that's.

236
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:47,290
That, of course, taken. Right. It's not randomized.

237
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:51,459
So we're going to conditioning to be able to covariates. There's not a whole lot here.

238
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:56,650
But I do have this sort of baseline measure of of CCD, which is the depression measure.

239
00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:05,080
So in some sense, their baseline outcome or the severity of their illness and and their age.

240
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,820
So it's employment analysis.

241
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:18,970
I guess I'm not going to go through here suggests no no interaction between the treatment and the mediator.

242
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:30,190
So I'm going to sort of that can allow dependance of the natural, direct and indirect effects on covariates to to be removed.

243
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:34,480
So the whole thing becomes kind of simpler, a little more like the bear and candy type analysis.

244
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:43,630
Okay. So I'm going to plug this in using this regression mediation.

245
00:50:51,170 --> 00:51:04,100
Function in art, so I'm defining my baseline covariance as age in this baseline severity measure.

246
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:15,640
And I have to tell it what the outcome is, what the treatment variable is, and what the mediator is, so on.

247
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:20,680
And you know, treatment control.

248
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:27,889
I'm I look at the control group effect under the meters at 2 to 0 but but actually

249
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:31,880
that's not going to matter up here because we've got no no interaction piece going on.

250
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:38,300
So linear models have no interaction.

251
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:47,510
So surprisingly it's a the treatment assigned does correspond thankfully to the treatment taken not a

252
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:52,760
whole lot going on in terms of prediction of baseline covariance that's another feature a lot of these.

253
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:06,190
Models for. For. Predicting compliance.

254
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:20,649
Payment compliance. Okay. So so we plug this in your outcome model surprisingly the association with the baseline

255
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:26,650
measure but once we control for the treatment taken treatment sign doesn't really do much.

256
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,780
So we get the mediation analysis out. Our.

257
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:44,670
Because there's no interaction here. These conventional measures aren't going to matter.

258
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,889
So our total effect is down here.

259
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:56,280
And now we're you know, so we're looking at a difference of about three in terms of the of the outcome here.

260
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:04,010
That's quite significant. But the.

261
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:10,460
A natural indirect or that natural indirect effect actually does reach significance.

262
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:16,760
So this is sort of the treatment effect amongst those who apply to the treatment.

263
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:26,840
And then, well, the treatment effect that goes that's associated with the change in actually taking the treatment.

264
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:33,709
And and then this sort of direct effect of treatment doesn't really seem to be three much higher rate.

265
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:40,230
So that tends to be right around zero. So, you know, this is kind of what we expect, right?

266
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:50,610
This natural direct effect is very close to zero, that in order to get some impact of of the calls and on on on your treatment,

267
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:54,780
he actually has to cause your doctor to to change their treatment.

268
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,870
They would have done so.

269
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:04,350
Of course, mediators is very close to one. Right.

270
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:11,630
And so it's not quite the exclusion restriction, but it's pretty similar or kind of this principle stratification,

271
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:14,700
direct, indirect approach comparison back to it a little bit.

272
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:22,170
But it is certainly consistent with nearly all of the effect of the treatment being through actually taking it because we'd expect.

273
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:29,880
Okay. So then for the sensitivity analysis.

274
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:37,020
So I should stop here. Questions about this. This is all from our previous mediation work.

275
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:59,030
All right. So for a sensitivity analysis, I'm going to look at a couple different features of Gamma,

276
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:08,960
and I'm actually not really going to let them depend on covariance. So for the first one, I'm going to assume that this if we look at the.

277
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:24,130
Potential outcome of being assigned to treatment and then actually getting the treatment and then that potential outcome.

278
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:30,800
Had you not seen a potential outcome of other under treatment and getting the treatment, but had you actually been assigned a control?

279
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:39,170
So we're looking at a difference of five and then where.

280
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:48,620
We then look at the sort of potential outcome and treatment, but you assigned to it,

281
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:55,880
but not actually taking it and then looking at this difference in an assignment and having that be a little bit smaller like around 2.5.

282
00:55:57,650 --> 00:56:06,270
So. And then I'm going to look at another approach that does depend on X, right?

283
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:23,659
That basically sort of says that this. The sort of a difference in effect now is is going to be a function of the difference in

284
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:28,730
age that this this effect sort of becomes strongest when you're in the oldest group,

285
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:36,890
and then it goes down to zero as you become sort of the smallest sort of the minimum age in a kind of scaling this.

286
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,800
So the age range is around 60 and the standard deviation is around ten.

287
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,800
So. So there's sort of a bit of a scaling factor in there.

288
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:54,350
So so the logic behind this is the subjects who access the best treatment practices,

289
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:58,520
even though their physician was not encouraged to do so, might tend to have better outcomes.

290
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:03,230
Right. So we do have the situation where we assume to fires.

291
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:07,490
But. But we do allow. We certainly have. Well, sorry,

292
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:11,870
we're we're in the situation where people could access the treatment somewhat

293
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:15,820
independently from whether they're assigned to it or not because of that.

294
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:28,080
The sort of. Best practices is something that's measured by what the physician did with the patient,

295
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:32,340
whereas the treatment is basically encouragement to do those best practices.

296
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:41,230
So so the physicians or the subjects who are getting those best practices, treatment, even other physicians are encouraged to do so.

297
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:43,980
My tend to have better outcomes for lower depression scores.

298
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:52,560
Those who did not expect the practices even on their physician which caused you some may have worse outcomes in terms of this exposure.

299
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:56,340
Just confounding, there's the possibility that the reminder calls are impacting patient treatment

300
00:57:56,790 --> 00:58:00,400
in a matter that maybe isn't entirely captured by the best practices indicator.

301
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,780
So this has been a failure of suit ever,

302
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:12,209
but basically that there are sort of some sort of treatment effect that hasn't been entirely

303
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:20,010
captured by by whether or not the recording of best practices is is is there or not.

304
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:30,090
So for the first analysis, as I mentioned, it doesn't really depend on X.

305
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:40,510
So basically the scammer is five of them is one and 2.5 if it was zero.

306
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:44,580
And this this component here. Right, this I can estimate from the data.

307
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:53,190
Right. I mean, minimization, which I do have. So when?

308
00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:58,950
When. But.

309
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:10,750
When there was somebody assigned to control 15 out of 37 actually giving best practices anyway and 22 or not.

310
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:16,840
So that gives me an overall estimate of around 3.5.

311
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:22,929
So if I do that, then to adjust either by subtracting or adding on further natural,

312
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:30,670
direct and direct effects and assets and screen, then for basically that's enough to completely turn things around.

313
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:38,830
So the entire effect of removing a bit more of the physician might recall two pathways other than measured by its best treatment practices.

314
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:45,580
So like I said, so, you know, I kind of set this up as a fairly strong effect,

315
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:54,040
but it still is a little surprising that there could be this if we do have something about about this.

316
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:01,200
Assignment that isn't.

317
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:12,370
It being is it really being about the behavior that isn't being captured by aging and battling depression and there wasn't a lot of association there.

318
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:18,260
Then we could have sort of a fairly. Miss those calls.

319
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:27,020
All right. The second approach, I basically have to do some some averaging here.

320
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:32,670
So here I'm allowing this to depend on this age.

321
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:39,790
So the overall bias measure was was a was a little bit less.

322
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:51,510
I did use logistic regression, so basically to predict their probability of taking treatment that they weren't on it and their age.

323
01:00:54,060 --> 01:01:01,080
So these predictive values and I plug it in to whatever they were taken.

324
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:08,190
Right. So I did this right. I saw that I screwed up the.

325
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:15,010
Stuff I presented just Monday. So but I'll take responsibility for it.

326
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:20,070
But if you do see this, you should say something as appropriate.

327
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:26,480
So here I'm actually, you know, got a probability of an zero for amicable one in this case.

328
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:33,740
So zero. So, all right.

329
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:40,069
So this is a little less dramatic and sort of suggest about one half of the physician reminder causes through some pathway.

330
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:45,020
And that measured by best practices might really do because in some sense, I'm kind of assuming a uniform.

331
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:49,790
Well, if the distribution of age was pretty uniform, then you would get this.

332
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:55,370
But you do the sort of adjustment that for age that would get to be less powerful.

333
01:01:57,190 --> 01:02:01,120
So. All right.

334
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:05,680
So. All right. So I guess we're not 15 minutes over Monday.

335
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:09,880
15 minutes under today. So it all averaged out fine. Okay.

336
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:15,430
So. Right, that's the.

337
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:21,460
Yeah, right. That's the beauty of statistics.

338
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,210
The beauty of the central mean they're more precise.

339
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:34,899
So okay, so you can kind of see how you use this.

340
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:40,299
And so, I mean, again, coming up with some sort of sensible I think the thing with the sensitivity analysis

341
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:43,959
in practice is always trying to figure out what's a sensible measure for this,

342
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:50,380
right? So you could fiddle with this different values and kind of see the whole bunch of typically you would want to just do one,

343
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:55,890
you want to do a whole series of them and see how this impacts. So I haven't done that here.

344
01:02:55,900 --> 01:03:00,610
But but at least going from this down to this, give us some sense, some idea of sensitivity.

345
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:08,290
Sensitivity of the sensitivity. So. Okay, all right.

346
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:15,490
I will give you back more than 10 minutes of your day and again, office hours tomorrow.

347
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:21,450
And I hope things are going on. And I got really excited about the proposals I've been seeing.

348
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:27,400
I hope you're having fun with them now. Just just remember, it's you don't have to do everything, not of your thesis out of this.

349
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:33,190
You don't have to do everything. If you find even if you're getting a little over your head in what you're trying to accomplish,

350
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,900
dial it back a little bit so that you have something to present the report.

351
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:43,750
But. But, yeah. So I think.
