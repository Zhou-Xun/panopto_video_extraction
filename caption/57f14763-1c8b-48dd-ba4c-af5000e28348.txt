1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,220
All right. That's my question. So we're thinking about two level model.

2
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,300
Last question was around the difference between fixed effects and random effects.

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:19,929
So just before we get specifically into those, what are some of the predictors that we might see in a model where we're trying to predict

4
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,860
lower birth rates with a whole bunch of babies that live in a whole bunch of neighborhoods?

5
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:31,080
So you gave me my zip code. Is that going to be maybe a neighborhood level indicator or something like that?

6
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:37,560
All right. So we can think about some of the maybe the census data that's associated with zip codes.

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,760
We can pull we can read in some of that data. Those would be level two variables, predictors.

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,400
They're kind of neighborhood level predictors that we think are going to have some sort of influence on the 16,000 baby birth weight outcomes.

9
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:55,940
What else I see is, as this might be, one is that is that a baby level variable or is that a neighborhood level variable here?

10
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,510
So as a parent, low variable, but we'll just count that as a baby level variable, right?

11
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,810
All right. So we can ask about the the family in which the baby lives.

12
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:13,509
Again, ignoring any sort of symptoms in the case. What else? Now says race and sex.

13
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,870
We know what kind of what races? The baby what sex is the baby shirt? What else?

14
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:31,290
Primary care providers. Sure we can and we can think about some of the things that are available, the access to services that this baby might have.

15
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:37,350
Right. Is that a is that a baby level variable or an entry level variable?

16
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:47,980
Right. Huh. But you said this might be five steps at a time, considering carefully.

17
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:56,500
It depends if we have a single observation. If it is, if we have multiple observations, then yeah, we probably could incorporate a timeline.

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,550
Gestational gestational age. Okay.

19
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,009
Tell me more about that. It's like how long they were in there before they were born.

20
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:12,650
Like a number of weeks or something like that. Sure. Okay. That's a Premier League.

21
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:19,210
All right. So and that's at the base level of the of level as they go.

22
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,080
Right. And then the access to the services of the care providers.

23
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,000
And that question is at a neighborhood or individual level. It depends on how it's operationalized.

24
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:28,570
Right.

25
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:36,370
If we're kind of saying that there are, you know, whatever, three, how many primary care clinics or how many hospitals are in each given neighborhood?

26
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,350
That's a neighborhood level indicator.

27
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,950
If it's how many visits did you have prior to your birth or something like that, that's probably going to be a baby level indicator.

28
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:50,739
All right. Spending on how we how it kind of manifested in our data will depend on will

29
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,980
determine whether we treat it as a level one variable or a level two variable.

30
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,639
Right. So the level one variables are you need are specific to the individual.

31
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,660
They're specific to, in this case, the unit of analysis.

32
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:07,900
We have two choices about how to think about, in this case, those level one variables.

33
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,160
We can allow those level one variables, those covariates,

34
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:20,110
gestational age and number of appointments before access to services where we want to be mind raising sex.

35
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:28,150
Right. All three of those are individual level predictors of an individual baby's birth rate or birth weight.

36
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:35,830
Right. When we make those variables fixed, what are we assuming?

37
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:46,270
So if it's gestational age is a fixed effect, what are we assuming about the relationship between gestational age and birth weight?

38
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:54,250
So you say the slope is the same, the effect of gestational age on birth weight and birth weight.

39
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,430
And I'm just going to go ahead and assume that that's a positive association,

40
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:02,810
that although the higher your gestational age, the more your weight birth right.

41
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:08,260
We assume that that association or slope is the same across what?

42
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:16,020
The man who sent Nathan Love claims he was sent crazy.

43
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:22,620
Thank you. Yes. It's that same across all. Not just five neighborhoods, but all 1100 neighborhoods.

44
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:28,680
Every single neighborhood has the same association between gestational age and birth week.

45
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:34,080
Right. That's a big time assumption because that's kind of saying, I don't care where you live in Wayne County.

46
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:40,340
I don't. All I need to know is how much or how well you were in that womb before you came out.

47
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,929
And that's going to be a better predictor of your your birth weight than did you live in Hamtramck?

48
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,760
Did you live in wherever else might be?

49
00:04:51,140 --> 00:05:02,270
Is that a tenable assumption or is that is that a valid conception of how we think where you live plays out in terms of your first week?

50
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:09,200
If the answer to your answer is no, that neighborhood matters.

51
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,850
What can we do? This is the second part of two questions.

52
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:28,350
Some solutions. You. Well, we had a random effect for neighborhood for the association between gestational age and birth weight.

53
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:36,750
We allowed the effect of gestational age on birth weight to vary by your neighborhood.

54
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:47,190
Right. Yeah, well, like, kind of in, like, kind of the simplest terms we had, right?

55
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:54,190
We had two levels of equations and this is a big B is gestational age.

56
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,520
Right. That was kind of our basic equation.

57
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,560
But then we set our way with multilevel models. We have choices.

58
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,530
We can allow. Game on or something.

59
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,620
I don't remember. Right. We can allow.

60
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:28,100
We can allow associations to be the same across all neighborhoods.

61
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:35,180
This would be kind of mean birth weight. This would be kind of the association between gestational age and or outcome variable.

62
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:41,120
Or we can make a decision about adding some sort of random effect this.

63
00:06:52,500 --> 00:07:00,030
We can make a decision about including a random effect, which basically means are we going to allow this coefficient,

64
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:07,140
this coefficient for gestational age or one year to change in gestational age, lead to some sort of change in birth weight.

65
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:15,690
Right. This random effect says that this variable or this this coefficient,

66
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:20,130
this regression coefficient should change depending on what neighborhood you belong to.

67
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,310
This is a fixed effect. It is the same for every single neighborhood.

68
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,060
If you think about just running this like a typical regression equation,

69
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,020
this would be what we say is the relationship across every single neighborhood.

70
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:40,440
All 16,000 babies. Their gestational age and their gestational age and their birth weight.

71
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:47,220
This is a little bit of a modification that we that we make based on what neighborhood you live in.

72
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,730
This is fixed. This is random, right.

73
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,680
We estimate this to allow for some of the variability across the neighborhood.

74
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:08,190
So any time we want to make assumptions about whether things are fixed, we're saying that that's going to be true of all of our unit analysis.

75
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,130
Any time you talk about those random effects,

76
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:18,840
we're really talking about how the grouping variable changes some of those individual level or lower level relationships.

77
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:24,840
And the reason why I'm qualifying that with the lower level relationships is because as soon as you introduce a third level,

78
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,960
you can actually have random effects for your level two predictors.

79
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,780
So if you believe that some of those census variables that are, you know, what is it,

80
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,160
owner occupied housing, which is going to be a neighborhood level variable.

81
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:53,880
If you think that the effect of owner occupied housing on a baby's birth weight varies depending on what city you live in.

82
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,540
You can include a random effect for your neighborhood.

83
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:11,720
Okay. So it's increasing complexity in an attempt to try to model what we really think is happening.

84
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,420
It might be that we're okay. Just saying I don't care what city you belong to.

85
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:21,170
Owner occupied housing is owner occupied housing and therefore it's going to be fixed.

86
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,810
That was really winded, but it's also really it's a complex question.

87
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:32,360
Are you getting the sense with this fixed versus random effects? Yeah, that makes sense.

88
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:41,930
A second part is like you're in a home or observing the difference in the variance.

89
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:48,600
It's sort of what to concentrate on because I know the vaccine.

90
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,250
Oh, yeah. Okay. So there are models and indicators. Yeah.

91
00:09:52,910 --> 00:10:01,960
So the AC and Besi are both kind of corrections for and you can think of them a little bit like a likelihood ratio test.

92
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:08,270
Right. So they're based on a the same kind of underlying principles. You're talking about how the likelihood, which is basically ours, you know,

93
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:16,130
we try a whole bunch of model parameters like we're going to try a mean we're going to try a slope and we can see which ones fit the data the best,

94
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:16,980
right?

95
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:24,320
When we do find one that we're kind of comfortable with for a given model, we're going to have essentially an estimate of how likely that model is.

96
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,100
Given that, given the data, that's what our likelihood function is kind of giving us.

97
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:36,020
We are testing between models, whether there's enough improvement in the likelihood function based on adding additional predictors.

98
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:41,510
We did this for the general linear model. We're doing this where multilevel models wouldn't do this with no curve models to

99
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,890
basically any time that we move away from all us for use something like that.

100
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,920
A.D.A. Where it called penalized log likelihood estimates.

101
00:10:52,430 --> 00:11:00,080
So they take into account whether you are in a different way the number of variables or predictors that you have in the model.

102
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:06,350
The assumption there is all things being equal better to have a simpler model.

103
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,770
The more complex you are, the greater the penalty.

104
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:16,580
And that would include either a fixed effect or an effect because those are all parameters that we need to estimate the all costs, degrees of freedom.

105
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,300
They all cost us bits of information. Right.

106
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,970
So I see a bike here. Nice, because it's quite simply lower values, better fit.

107
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,680
There's not a there's not an associated P value.

108
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:38,270
There's not a there's not a distribution or assumption that you have to make about how they're going to change.

109
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,490
Whereas in LRT, we do think that there's, you know, it's distributed as a chi square statistic.

110
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,920
You then test the model's chi square change. We see a p value, just all of the better or not.

111
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,310
These three statistics are we talk about the ratio test and CBC.

112
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:01,220
They should agree more often than not. If there's a lot of disagreement, then that's probably a concern.

113
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,270
But basically, do we have a significant LRT?

114
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,850
Do we have lower as CBC votes?

115
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:15,080
You could look to see just the change in the devient which deviates excuse me, which is minus two times the log likelihood.

116
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,890
That's how we get to that LRT test. And as a matter of fact.

117
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:28,390
Um, this is another way to kind of ask the same sort of question.

118
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,830
Down here at the bottom. Anybody know what the answer to this question is?

119
00:12:43,200 --> 00:13:00,570
Any. Why is it? And so, I mean, the difference is when we have three variances like this to say that they're significantly different,

120
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:08,070
we're using some form of Chi Square test. If these were three vaccines, we wouldn't need to test that.

121
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,510
That's I mean of we're like what? It really comes down into practice.

122
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,410
That's why AC And basic information criterion,

123
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:22,500
the Asian information criterion evolves kind of do the same thing with slightly different assumptions because more conservative.

124
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,670
So that would be less likely to be lower than the SC or you know, generally speaking.

125
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,649
How about this type one right here? Oh, my God.

126
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,770
This is good. This is good. He's got this.

127
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:49,510
I was back so week. He's got this.

128
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,330
Well, come now, folks. Maybe you should consider the ICC.

129
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,930
Yes, sir. Is this. Is it? Yes. This is a non ignorable ICC.

130
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,320
I like it. I like that. What does it mean?

131
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:28,470
I think the system is the proportion of variability in the amount of time that might be attributed to.

132
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:45,360
And for a second interview that left the printers I heard says it looks like we have a two on right.

133
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:51,280
Well, we can live on one level. One is. Hmm.

134
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,780
Or kids. Right. Adolescence.

135
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,080
Adolescence belongs to his unit here. Yeah, right.

136
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,750
So we kind of think about adolescents that are not so good in families.

137
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:14,080
If we had an IQ of 1 to 6, then yes, our outcome variable is throws at interest rates, interest in exercising things that would it be.

138
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,530
What proportion of that variability is is found at the family level.

139
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:33,649
About 26%, right? So a quarter of the variability of exercise interest for adolescents might be found at the family level.

140
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:41,230
So that can be include any like what is it that you know that families might do that encourage exercise, one of which might be kind of parental.

141
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:47,900
Right. So but yes, Jenny, very, very formally, it's a proportion of variability, a level two.

142
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:56,600
So whatever our level one unit of analysis is and whenever a level one outcome variable is, 26% of that variability is our level to remain.

143
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:05,300
And it could be Amanda looks at two families in this case, but it could have just as easily been school or town or.

144
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:10,790
Jim, I don't know. Right. Questions about that.

145
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:21,930
And then I. I forgot this was here. I mean, people, they they can confidently answer this question.

146
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:32,920
So there is nice. Question about this right now, and let's make sure that we're feeling good.

147
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:45,110
What's still what's still shaky. Today is the time to conserve.

148
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:50,570
Yes, please. So the first is when the.

149
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,150
Well, there's a variable that can that doesn't change based on.

150
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:05,080
Tell me through this we have interest as an outcome exercise interest.

151
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,670
We have kids necessary adolescence nestled within families and it is a variable of interest.

152
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:13,450
The outcome of interest is how much interest you have in exercising.

153
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,889
Right? Um, when pretty good amount of time of exercise.

154
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:25,390
So the amount of time that you spent, so how many hours a week you exercise, we have a variable, one of which is interesting is interest.

155
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,229
You know, like if you go to gym class 3 hours a week, you have at least 3 hours.

156
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,680
But there might be some other things that predict you're the number of hours you spend exercising,

157
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,920
one of which could be interest your next event in families.

158
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,300
Tell me a little bit about a fixed or random effect for that particular.

159
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:51,550
Oh, they say this is when it's just looking at adolescent interests, but then random is when you allow that interest to vary but state of mind.

160
00:17:53,380 --> 00:18:01,330
Yes. Yes. I'm going to put that very first one where you said the adolescent interest, just to make sure we're kind of on the same page.

161
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:09,969
That would mean that the effect of interest on the number of hours you exercise is going to be the same regardless of what family we're talking about.

162
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:20,980
Yeah, right. One is, again, kind of constant across all level two units of analysis.

163
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:27,640
That's what this would be. As soon as we had this random effect, we're saying now that this interest slope.

164
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,720
Which risks this is worse.

165
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,200
If this interest slope is a lot to vary depending on which family you come from.

166
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:49,770
Mm hmm. And then we could do so we can actually add and this is as you start to see more multilevel models,

167
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:54,420
and especially when you set them up like this, I kind of like it when they're set up like this instead of just one big long equation.

168
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:02,550
Because just remember, we can take this and substitute them. And this is all just this can all just get substituted right into there.

169
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:11,250
But we can add predictors at the family level for your interest slope, right?

170
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,620
So this parental modeling variable that we have,

171
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:26,070
we might think that understanding a little bit about a family's parental model modeling would explain some of this effect of interest.

172
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:34,430
Okay. And that's actually going to be represented as an interaction term because

173
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,730
it'll get kind of plugged in here and multiplied by our our inches variable.

174
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:46,670
We can also just kind of include parental modeling as a variable by itself on so it doesn't interact with interest at all.

175
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:54,680
And just confused people. You get that how that can kind of work.

176
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:00,860
So basically a holding one of them kind of constant checks to see if the other ones change.

177
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,690
Very like something. Maybe an injury. Well, it could be you.

178
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,660
One is how this affects every season.

179
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:15,630
Goodbye. So right now, this.

180
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:25,020
This is why one zero we get plugged into here by itself.

181
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,170
It would get multiplied by whatever somebody says is their interest level and exercise.

182
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:36,060
All right. So it does not matter what family you come from.

183
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:42,270
We take this one coefficient and we're going to estimate. We're going to multiply it by your interest, just like we've done.

184
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:49,380
As soon as I add this level to this family level, random effect.

185
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:54,120
Both of these get substituted in here, right here.

186
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:02,160
They both end up getting multiplied by a person's interest level and kind of contributing to what this slope will ultimately be.

187
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:13,110
Where it can get trickier is when we have a pair, like when we have a family level variable.

188
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:27,430
If I include. Family modeling is also learned.

189
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:36,940
But this all gets plugged in to this data zero, which means we have kind of an overall mean exercise.

190
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:45,729
We will also have the effect of family modeling behavior on our hours very just by itself.

191
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:49,180
It has nothing to do with the individual's interest.

192
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:57,420
But we also have the opportunity to essentially create an interaction term where we say we

193
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:03,940
think that family modeling could also interact in some way with our interest variable.

194
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:24,510
And that's kind of how this works. Now this whole thing gets plugged into this beta one zero and distributive property.

195
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,450
Multiply, multiply, multiply that.

196
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,360
So in order to have it read, in effect, you have to have a face.

197
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:40,760
Yes and yes. From there, you can add more red.

198
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:47,090
That means that you have to have more face. Yes. It's absolutely true.

199
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:51,870
So for each one each? No. What's another thing that predicts your idea?

200
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:57,220
Number of hours you exercise. Well, what?

201
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:07,380
Food. Food. All right. How much food you eat might be associated with, how much you exercise.

202
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,880
Right. We now have a choice here.

203
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:18,630
Do we think that this association relationship will vary by families or level to unit?

204
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:23,100
Or will this be the same for every single adolescent in our sample size?

205
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,270
Regardless of the answer to that question in a multilevel framework.

206
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:38,850
We've created a new fixed effect. So to represent that, we now have this new equation down here for 100 bonus points.

207
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:51,420
Well, what should I write to or what should I put on the right side of that equation? The Y to the, I guess, 200001.

208
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,590
No, no, you're right. It is exactly that.

209
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:08,770
Although. This is now the overview, the average effect of food.

210
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,510
On the number of hours you exercise at this point, does this matter what family you belong to?

211
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:23,470
Oh, you're so good. It does not. The effect of food on your exercise does not matter.

212
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:28,720
I don't care whose family you belong to. But if I wanted it to, what would I do?

213
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,180
At the. We'll take the fifth. Yeah, but.

214
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,129
Yeah. Yeah. You're missing the lease right about now.

215
00:24:46,130 --> 00:25:04,060
And they are, so. So if you like the model after adding the bedroom, is that enough to justify not using it as a room?

216
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:10,510
Yes, that's exactly what I would do. So my very my very first test would be without this at all.

217
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,680
So if we let's just pretend this is already something we could include if we had run this model.

218
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,380
Now we want to see whether or not food makes a difference.

219
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,549
We include a main effect for food, main effects, fixed effect, whatever you want to call it,

220
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:26,200
because it's the average the average effect of food on your exercise.

221
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,140
And we test that model against what I ran before.

222
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:35,080
And then if I had good reason to believe that this random effect should be there, I'll add my random effect.

223
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:41,650
We can look at the change in model fit from the model where it would win without the random effect.

224
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:47,110
If it's not significant, we can just drop this and make our lives a little bit easier to get.

225
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:53,020
It really is so bad. I know it's complex.

226
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,810
I know it's weird.

227
00:25:53,870 --> 00:26:02,920
Some new jargon to remember, but in terms of, you know, what's kind of what the output is going to look like and then what's actually happening.

228
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:10,510
You want to be able to do this, especially in our worlds, because so many times we run into truly nested data, whether again,

229
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:14,500
they're true kind of grouping variables or socially constructed variables or however you want to think about it.

230
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:18,160
Oftentimes the nesting is going to matter.

231
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,330
Remember how to run this model. Does everybody know how to run this model?

232
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:29,140
You know how I run this model, you know? And we just walk through and make sure you know how to run this model.

233
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:33,309
Right? There's nothing in the equation except for you're acknowledging a grouping variable,

234
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:39,940
which is that very first multilevel model that we ran where we had that straight up and down line and we put our grouping variable in there.

235
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:44,200
Right. We're just trying to figure out whether or not the group matters.

236
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,950
And it's one the group matters that we go through all this mumbo jumbo.

237
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,620
But when a group doesn't matter, when that first random effect is just not significant or doesn't improve the model fit,

238
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:57,670
we can safely ignore all of this stuff. And that's.

239
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:18,130
How we think, how we feel. The nice thing about this week is that growth models are just another way of thinking about multilevel models.

240
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:27,330
How come? Growth models are just multilevel models.

241
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:32,340
So come. Yes.

242
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:41,420
Tell me more. Well, first.

243
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:51,370
260. We're looking at the. To.

244
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,710
Yeah. Oh yeah.

245
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,810
Hopefully what I'm trying out for. Yeah.

246
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:08,410
So yeah, we're talking about a new sort of message in the case of growth models, what's getting nested at the lowest level?

247
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:18,750
What becomes our new level one? You know, what's our new level one when we start talking about growth models?

248
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,270
Yeah. It's time. It's repeated observations.

249
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:36,000
That's what makes our our new sort of nesting that the idea that you have two or more observations that come from the same individual,

250
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,430
what's the whole point in US thing what's our concern with nothing conceptually in.

251
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,910
What's the will? Why are we worried about this thing? And just in general,

252
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:56,820
why do we care that individuals live in neighborhoods or doctors who live in are part of clinics so that we can figure out the biggest.

253
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,240
Something's changing. Maybe not.

254
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:15,450
Where is this case? Tell me a little bit more about what you think. So we have like, for example, if they were taking an individual in a school.

255
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:23,210
Mm hmm. These different. Like. Places where that could have an effect on whatever outcome that we're looking for.

256
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:27,980
Yes. That that that effect an outcome that we're working with anytime we talk about investing.

257
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:36,410
We're assuming there's something about that grouping variable among folks there to just take a second and think critically about this.

258
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:45,320
We started this whole ordeal because we were worried about a regression violation or an assumption violation.

259
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:53,450
It was the assumption of independence. If folks remember that from a couple of weeks ago, it's a big it's an important part of regression.

260
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:59,870
But what it's really saying is that our grouping variable has an effect on all the stuff below it.

261
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:07,760
In this case, we were or we start out with schools and students, a student level outcome, student level math achievement.

262
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:13,160
We couldn't disassociate that student level math test from the school that they went to.

263
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:20,680
Group matters. You have clinics that have a whole bunch of doctors and some doctors provide excellent care.

264
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:28,280
Some provide not so great care. We can't disassociate that care that a doctor provides from that clinic.

265
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,020
Right.

266
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:37,800
And maybe what sort of resources or structures or whatever policies are at the clinic level that could be influencing those doctors within that.

267
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:46,880
With this with with growth models are new nesting is the person themselves.

268
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:54,560
And when you think about it, I hope it makes sense that you can't disassociate an individual's repeated observations.

269
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,430
If I ask you the same question three times every two days,

270
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:04,520
what's the likelihood that your observations are going to be more highly correlated than I am?

271
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:08,390
If I asked three different people the same questions once?

272
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:19,040
That's what we're kind of getting at here. Those those individual level outcomes depend on that level two unit, which is just you.

273
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:26,420
And then we can we can extrapolate to the same sort of analysis that we read that we talked about last week.

274
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,940
We can talk about how you are also nested within your groups or your neighborhoods or your whatever.

275
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,300
We're going to talk about your departments, whatever that grouping variable could be.

276
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:44,129
So a growth model is just a it's just a different conceptualization of the

277
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:47,670
multilevel stuff that we've been that we've been discussing questions about this.

278
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,950
Group matters, but in this case, group is a person.

279
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,720
Okay. Questions at least cover this.

280
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:12,930
So this is just another way of guys is doing doing the exact same thing I just said.

281
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:19,620
We're not thinking about students or the person level characteristics as they're a level two unit, right?

282
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:26,490
There are level one stuff. That all gets nested within a person. These are more highly correlated.

283
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:32,010
They're not independent. There's no way those observations coming from the same person are going to be independent.

284
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,899
So we have an empirical argument,

285
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:40,920
but we also have a conceptual argument for why we should think about these as grouped in some way rather than having one,

286
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,340
two, three, four or five, six, six. Just kind of separate observations.

287
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,350
If we just ignored this hierarchy,

288
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:53,400
we would be doing ourselves a disservice because there's something about these three observations that keeps them from being completely separate.

289
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:58,960
That makes sense. Questions.

290
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,690
Maybe I should make that slide. Next time, when this picture look completely different,

291
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:10,910
if I just showed you six observations with none of this stuff, and then all of a sudden you plop this stuff on.

292
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:17,470
Oh, okay. Of course. No wonder we think about these as clusters, and we think about these students as clustered,

293
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:22,660
and we think about these teachers as clustered data and why we need to treat it just a little bit differently.

294
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,120
All right.

295
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:33,969
So again, I think we couldn't figure out how to get the session on a Tuesday recorded, at least to me, just a little of kind of an overview.

296
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:40,680
But how about like just kind of the basic set ups and how we do some of this, how to do it?

297
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:45,870
Did you cover some of this? Yeah.

298
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,750
You were all here, you know? She was like social media.

299
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:59,490
I'll go see that person. Okay? That's right. All right. So for four profiles, what you need are three waves of data.

300
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:02,940
So if you're gonna start doing this in practice, if you're gonna have just two days of data,

301
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,590
you had a theater cluster, but you can just use a definitive test, right?

302
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,870
If you only have two observations. Save yourself this aggravation.

303
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,490
Use a T test. If, on the other hand, you have three or more waves of data,

304
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:18,270
that's what we're going to need to actually construct the growth models that we'll talk about,

305
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:23,790
because you need to have at least one point for your intercept, which will be kind of our starting value.

306
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:29,940
Any one point for your slope, that's our what the change in time looks like.

307
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:33,570
And then we need to have one extra value. So that's why you need at least three waves of data.

308
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:39,390
If you want to have quadratic information represented within your equation, you need four slopes or four points.

309
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,830
Okay, this is just practically speaking, if you plan to do this kind of work in the future,

310
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:53,670
we do want some form of time and this is sometimes explicit, other times it's implied.

311
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:59,220
So you might have like a very specific schedule in which you're collecting data, but you can talk through time,

312
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,050
or you might just have three observations from the same people over the course of whatever period,

313
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,660
and you can sort of construct your time variable that way.

314
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:11,790
The real big thing is that you just have this the information coming from the same people, right?

315
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:17,549
They're nested. They're clustered with an individual with most growth models that you'll see.

316
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:24,690
We're going to talk about a continuous outcome. But you could model a, you know, a dichotomous outcome or category of outcome if you wanted to.

317
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:33,890
Sure. What I like about both models is they all just kind of two related but different questions.

318
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,890
One is how people are changing individually.

319
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:42,740
So ultimately, what we're going to be doing and we have an outcome variable and we care about using it as a running example,

320
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:55,720
it's an individual little thing that might change over time. Her friends.

321
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,319
No. All right.

322
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:08,460
So you have a number of friends that that could change over the course of I mean, we say like a degree program.

323
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:15,780
So we're we're going to ask you maybe add three time points over your MPH at the beginning or the middle and then at the end.

324
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:25,380
And we want to know whether your your friendships, your number of friendships is going up as stay flat or has potentially gone down.

325
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:31,680
What we're ultimately going to do is take those points and we want to estimate the slope for each and every one of.

326
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:36,590
Right. We're going to figure out how every one of your friendship circles has changed.

327
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,940
Do they go up? Do they stay flat? Do you go down?

328
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:43,500
And we're going to have all sorts of variability, I'm assuming, across the 12 folks that are in the room.

329
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:50,490
And we're going to have some sort of average level of friendship change during our degree program.

330
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:56,700
Right. On average, people gain 1.25 friends over the course of their degree program or something like that.

331
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:04,080
We could talk about what are some of the things that predict that change?

332
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:11,220
Some of the classes that you took, some of the experiences that you had, some of the groups that you joined.

333
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:18,540
Right. And they can be happening at the individual measurement level, like where, you know,

334
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,410
the classes that you might take in your first semester versus your second year or something like that.

335
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:27,300
That could be changing the way that that slope goes up, down or stays flat.

336
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:36,630
So we're going to be talking about questions specific to your trajectory, but then we can also talk across everyone for whom we have a slope.

337
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:41,760
And what are some of the overarching variables that sort of predict friendships within degree programs?

338
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:46,890
So we get to both look at the individual as well as sort of the group as a whole.

339
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:53,880
And that's what's kind of neat about the different types of questions that we can answer or ask with with growth models.

340
00:37:54,030 --> 00:38:02,159
What's changing your specific slope? How skis can slope change from from beginning to the end versus what are some of the things

341
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:08,670
at the group level that predict on average how your friendships change questions about that.

342
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:21,560
All right. I just mentioned this. So we're going to have some unknown growth slope.

343
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,879
We have three points. So we're talking about a linear change here. It's going to be flat.

344
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,030
It's either going up, it's staying flat or it's going down.

345
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:35,240
We're not talking about those kind of trajectories where it goes up. You know, we had a great first year, but then, you know,

346
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:39,110
something fell off the bottom and you lost some friendships or then you kind of bounced back again.

347
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,870
Right. That's not what these models are going to be able to do.

348
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,800
And you can make an argument for whether that's a good representation of reality or not.

349
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:51,770
You know, it might not be fair to say that, you know, once I started on a trajectory, that's where I ended up.

350
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,950
It could be that I started really slow. I was very shy.

351
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:59,390
But then over time I started to see quite a bit of change in my friendship, relationships or networks.

352
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:03,770
We can't do that with these specific analysis, or at least the specifics.

353
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:08,240
We're just like three time points or with just a linear, a linear slope.

354
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:13,640
So we talk about this language, things like linear associations and stuff,

355
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:18,560
and we can kind of we kind of set it aside or I bet your folks aren't thinking about it really critically,

356
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:23,299
but it is kind of important when you start to say, All right, what is friendship, relation,

357
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:27,290
or relationships really look like and how am I going to reflect that in my model?

358
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:33,550
If you don't think that friendships just go up or down or stay flat, then this is not the right model for this data.

359
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:40,790
And you got to figure out something else. We're going to have some individual level predictors.

360
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:46,280
We're going to have some group level predictors, and we'll get to that in just a second. But they're all designed to predict this sloth.

361
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:51,680
My goodness, if you're not tired of seeing equations that look like this, I would be shocked.

362
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,009
But at the same time, doesn't this look with a couple of little changes?

363
00:39:55,010 --> 00:40:00,800
Pretty familiar. Raise your hand if it looks nice and familiar or shaking your head.

364
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:07,700
I sure hope so. And that's a good thing y because everything stays the exact same.

365
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:11,210
This is an intercept. How do I interpret an intercept?

366
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:18,020
Oh, don't be me. Come on. How do I interpret an intercept?

367
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:23,690
It is the expected value of my outcome variable when I need to know everything else.

368
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:32,570
What are. You know where it is? How can I know zero zero where everything in this equation is zero?

369
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:36,800
This is my predicted outcome variable right now going.

370
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:42,950
How about this one? When we have a one year change, what is this?

371
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:47,089
Something about constant visit? Well, no, but I like your holding everything else.

372
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:51,350
Constant. This is my slope.

373
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:55,760
This is a unit change. My predictive variable is associated with a yeah, keep going.

374
00:40:55,970 --> 00:41:05,870
The outcome like if the predicted variable changes by whatever about error pi is going to be.

375
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:10,549
Yeah. Yeah. Then the outcome variable change is actually a unit change.

376
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:17,450
And in this loss, Leslie, Ira here is going to be associated with about a high level increase or decrease in my outcome variable.

377
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:24,710
Holding everything else in the mall constant. Right. These are these.

378
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:28,150
These interpretations haven't changed. Yeah, we are.

379
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:36,670
We're moving into kind of this different territory. We use a little bit of a different lexicon here, but the underlying model will not change.

380
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,490
And I think that's really important for us to remember,

381
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:45,820
because even when we go off into these fancy areas of statistics, the basics is still multiple regression.

382
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:53,800
All right. And I think that's a positive. Now, I said there are some caveats or how the language starts to change.

383
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:59,840
We do see these subscripts like we did with multilevel models before.

384
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,400
It was j, it was individual I in group J.

385
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:09,160
Now we're going to be talking about individual at time T Right.

386
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:15,700
So this is observation like one, two or three, and this is my individual observations.

387
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:26,670
One, two and three are nested within individual. I can't just say what's observation two, it's Gracie's observation or two, it's Amy's observation.

388
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:29,910
Level three, it's Delaney's observation at level one, right?

389
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:34,720
That's what we have to remember. These models are going to do. They're not going to two separate those.

390
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,099
All right. This is our our value for individual.

391
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:47,620
At a time when everything else in the model is zero, we're going to talk about how we're going to scale this variable,

392
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:51,310
our time predictor, so that we have a meaningful zero value.

393
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,170
Essentially, we're going to scale at such that a zero for our time variable means the beginning,

394
00:42:56,650 --> 00:43:02,650
the start baseline, so that this now has a very, very interpretable meaning for us.

395
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:11,820
This is what your predicted value is when you start this. So my friend, you had when you came to speech value and what that value is.

396
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:14,440
But that's what it's mine that that's what this model is going to estimate.

397
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:20,800
Now this becomes, ah, how does how does, how does our outcome variable change over time?

398
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,200
This is the one that we're usually the most interested in,

399
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:29,350
although kind of the baseline value can be really interesting to what was your substance use rate at age 15 across the sample?

400
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:33,730
Interesting. But this one is usually what the growth models really care about.

401
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:37,569
How is my outcome variable changing over time? All right.

402
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:43,810
So it's going to take information from observations one, two and three or four or five and six in this particular picture.

403
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:50,770
And try to make a try to give us an idea about how friendships are changing over the course of your degree programs.

404
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:03,300
This is fancy, but it's not that fancy. It really isn't that fancy.

405
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:16,380
It's the same stuff that we were doing over here on the board. The big changes here now are that instead of using BS, we're going to use pies for it.

406
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:19,530
Still getting at the same idea that this level one equation.

407
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:33,170
Oops, this level one equation has some level two interaction between right ah person level characteristics.

408
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:39,410
That's what level two is here. Within person between person.

409
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,970
With in-person between person.

410
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:56,080
So we're going to take this when in-person or just this kind of with in-person where you start and we're going to move it up to level two.

411
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:01,300
We're going to take this with in-person. This is your change over time or move this up to level two.

412
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:07,360
What are some of the between person characteristics that might be predicting some of this change or where you start?

413
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:12,340
We can also allow both of these things to vary by individuals, right?

414
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:16,840
So it's the same sort of question around fixed effects versus random effects.

415
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,660
Do we assume everybody starts at the same place?

416
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:25,810
Do we assume everybody changes their friendships over time at the same rate and in the same direction?

417
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:30,970
These are questions that we can ask ourselves and we'll test with by changing models.

418
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:39,340
All this fancy still all this fancy jargon up here is just another way of saying we have an average starting value of friendships.

419
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:46,120
We have an average weight of friendships change during your degree programs and we can what those vary or not.

420
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:54,549
And then we can also include a whole bunch of predictors. These would be level two predictors, which are what between person predictors?

421
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:57,910
This would be precariousness.

422
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:10,820
Uh, prior friendships coming to the program, proximity to restaurants and bars,

423
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:15,450
I don't know, whatever else predicts friendships willing to join the clubs?

424
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:20,860
Join. Right. These are kind of between person level predictors, right?

425
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:27,209
The things that are kind of talk about us as a as kind of average individuals, not at time.

426
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:33,210
One, two and three. Just kind of across the across the time period that we're talking about.

427
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:46,890
Questions about this. I know the map looks kind of funny, but it's the same stuff that we were doing over here.

428
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:56,170
Okay. And this should look awful familiar because that is exactly what we just did over there.

429
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,310
Okay. We're going to take all this information we're going to substituted in here.

430
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:04,899
We're going to take all this information. We're going to substitute in here. First effect.

431
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:09,370
Fixed effect. Fixed effects. Fixed effect. This is just however many we wanted to add.

432
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:14,890
Random effect. Random effect changes unique to the individual.

433
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,340
Do I want to let everybody start with a different level of friendships?

434
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:23,080
Or do I know for certain that pretty much people are all coming in with 2.8 friends?

435
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:33,790
Changes in friendships over time. Do I want to just say that everybody's going to get two more friends by joining each bag or other?

436
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:38,170
Or do I want to allow that to vary by individual?

437
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,940
Do I want to let everybody have their own sort of growth rate in terms of their friendships?

438
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:49,950
Those are fun questions. I think it's kind of neat questions.

439
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,470
Move away from this man.

440
00:47:55,060 --> 00:48:04,940
Sounds like Elise already talked to you a little bit about this, but we don't have to be limited to a linear change in time because again,

441
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:09,139
I bet you with friendships there, it isn't pretty much a straight you're on a trajectory and this is what happens.

442
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:11,060
There's probably an inflection point somewhere.

443
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:19,790
We couldn't do that if we only had three time points, but if we had more than three, we could include polynomials which allow that growth to curve.

444
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:24,320
You could either flatten out or it could accelerate depending on what the data start to suggest.

445
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:32,270
Right, for data that you're going to use.

446
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:35,600
I don't know how many people think they might be using this stuff in practice.

447
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,860
I would imagine it could be more common than you think.

448
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:51,080
Patients that you see multiple times, community members with whom you have multiple interactions pre post test with a six month follow up.

449
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:55,150
Um, I don't know if there are other examples that you can think of, right?

450
00:48:55,190 --> 00:49:02,930
Any sort of time series data that you might or you might have access to, all of these can be models as a, as a set of growth equations.

451
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:09,109
You need a few different things though you do need so you can have multiple levels

452
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:12,890
with an individual between individual and then whatever individuals are nested in.

453
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:18,319
So this could be all right with an individual that scores some of the individual

454
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,620
predictors on the school or teacher level predictors or something like that.

455
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:28,850
And we have an outcome variable that we there's going to be some sort of continuous variable, at least in this in this case,

456
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:34,909
time variable is how we're doing or indicating that time passes observations one, two and three.

457
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:38,090
It's not observation, two, one, three or three, two, one.

458
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:43,490
Right. There is an order. There is time that has passed and we need to be able to represent that within our model.

459
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:53,810
And then we can have predictors that are both as optional and what that means, but time variance or time invariant.

460
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:59,840
So time varying could mean that every time that you collect data, you have that predictor present and it changes with each one.

461
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:06,290
You can also have time invariant predictors that are not going to change across all three or multiple waves of administration.

462
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:13,940
So what are some of the things that you think change at the data collection level versus things that are going to be concerned for people across time?

463
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:21,440
You do need some way to link these observations, so you need to be able to know that this is Justin one, two, three, four.

464
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:24,200
One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. Right.

465
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:28,850
So you need to be able to indicate, just like we did with the school data, which students belong to, which school,

466
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:35,030
which individual observations belong to, which individuals and those individuals belong to one grouping in.

467
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:48,560
But this is just walking us through the the different levels.

468
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:55,280
So the biggest difference here. One, again, you those same I.D. variables there, letting people know that this is between individuals.

469
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:59,680
Now, we are talking about time invariant predictors, right.

470
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:04,790
They are going to be the same across all three waves of administration because now we are talking about the person,

471
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:09,530
not at the individual observation level. Same thing with level three data.

472
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:15,480
But now you're now whatever you are, grouping variables going to be school, department, clinic, whatever.

473
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:20,030
That's where those variables are going to go, or at least how we're going to think about it.

474
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:28,770
I'll show you an example here. All right. The example from lecture two.

475
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:32,450
I got the lecture example now.

476
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:36,830
So our example here is going to use the first data. Yeah.

477
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:42,470
And instead of just using wave one, we're going to use four waves of data over two years.

478
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:50,840
One, three, four is 14, 15, 16, 17. On average, we're going to use three observations from the parent support measure that,

479
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:56,580
you know, love the family conflict measure, which is like how much families fight or argue.

480
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:04,340
I forget another another and a couple of variables,

481
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:10,460
mildew or things like how they whether they spend time together or whether they make decisions together.

482
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:15,620
I think whether they have conversations over dinner or stuff like that.

483
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:23,750
So kind of a positive one and a more negative one. But the key here is that we have data from four waves from four different years.

484
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:29,460
Okay. Now, this is where that time question is going to come in.

485
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:36,510
I told you that we had data from four different years. Our doesn't know that or any other software that you might want to use.

486
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:43,830
This is that time variable that we have to think about. What what's what time is represented here.

487
00:52:49,600 --> 00:53:00,280
It's not there's not a time variable. It's kind of embedded in the fact that, you know, that we collected this in 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997.

488
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,620
All right. That's getting old, but that's our time.

489
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:14,310
So we're going to have to remember that and think through how we can use that into that that knowledge as we're constructing our growth model.

490
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:18,059
All right. And there is a fourth very there's a fourth family conflict one.

491
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:22,530
And there's also a family, 1,000,001. All right.

492
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,930
Here's my this is making the same point. We don't have an explicit this is my time.

493
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:32,490
But we know that these different columns represent time going by.

494
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:36,270
Right. This is where they started. This is where they're going to end.

495
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:42,000
Right. We want to understand what that slope looks like. How is your parent's support changed over time?

496
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,780
How is your family conflict changed over time?

497
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:52,140
And can we predict some of those different things? We have to make a change to the structure of our data.

498
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,800
If you up. If you plan to use this kind of data.

499
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,480
Start listening now. Okay.

500
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:06,990
We have right now, this is what we call wide format, wide, meaning that we have each role is an individual and it has all of their information.

501
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:13,680
We are going to convert this into long format where each individual is going to have multiple rows.

502
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:21,810
And that's going to. That's going to allow us to make this time thing explosive questions.

503
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:26,490
We have to do a little bit of work.

504
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:35,520
You can use multiple packages, but the one that I think I'm sure I'm going to recommend, hopefully it's not deprecated is the Reshape function.

505
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:42,480
It's in the Reshape package. And we need to basically tell are a few different things.

506
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:46,920
One is we talked about that ID variable. How do I know which person we're talking about?

507
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:55,379
So every person has an ID. So we need to make sure that when we're receiving reshaping data now this this person,

508
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:59,850
number one, therefore observations, appearance of work, stay together.

509
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:05,460
Therefore, observations of family conflicts stay together. That's what that ID variable is going to do.

510
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:11,970
We're going to talk through which specific variables are going to be grouped.

511
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:17,309
So, for example, within our within our data frame,

512
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:21,210
we want columns two through five because we know that it's going to be our parent support variables.

513
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:24,840
Six or nine are going to be our family conflict variables. All right.

514
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,210
We're going to rename these things with whatever we want to call them.

515
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,370
We can we can do that within this function.

516
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:38,910
Otherwise, it's just going to assign some random thing like V one, which you might be fine with, or you can always rename it afterwards.

517
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:47,610
But the other big one here is this new variable that we're going to have that we're going to call wave, which is essentially time.

518
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:54,330
And it's our way to index that these observations are things are sequential order and time is passing.

519
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:58,110
We're not saying exactly how much time is passing in this case.

520
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:07,920
We're just saying no. That observation was parent support one, two, three and four belong to the same individual and are time going by.

521
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:14,670
That's essentially what this is. This this this reshaping is going to do for us.

522
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,770
And then we also are moving from what's called wide to long.

523
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:22,559
I know this is going over quickly, but we'll have a little bit of time to figure out when I'll figure out how to do this.

524
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:27,660
I will spend next week doing this in practice.

525
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:37,080
What's actually happening? We are taking this value, these values, and we're stacking them on top of each other.

526
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:48,480
All right. That's all we've really done. Notice now that ID has one, two, three, four observations.

527
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:58,620
So person one now has four rows of data because we have four values for parent support that vary over time.

528
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:05,490
They change. Okay. We've taken the one, we've taken the wide format and we've converted now to long format.

529
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:14,580
We did the exact same thing with family conflict. If you go back to that slide three slides ago, we had 1.2, 1.8, 1.6, 1.1 or 1.0.

530
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:19,140
We've now reshaped them. We've flip them down here so that they're stacked.

531
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:25,590
Anything that we have stacked like this is a level one predictor.

532
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:27,720
It's something that changes over time.

533
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:35,280
Anything that's going to be constant across these four different for different rows is going to be something fixed at level two.

534
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:38,760
It's a it's an invariant predictor, right?

535
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:44,490
Participant race is probably not going to change from time one to time four.

536
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:49,950
So you would see that same race represented. If you're the way you lose your housing location or something,

537
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:55,740
you think about some of the things that are not going to change over time versus some of the things that could feasibly change over time.

538
00:57:56,550 --> 00:58:01,560
And so those are all decisions that we need to make in terms of how we might restructure our data.

539
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,180
These are some examples of some of the questions that we can ask.

540
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:12,510
The one that I think people are going to care about the most is what is parent support look like over time.

541
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:21,720
Just out of curiosity, does anybody have a hypothesis? You have 500 students talking about their parents support from age 14 to age 17.

542
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:28,950
Where do you think parents support looks like over time? Now it's a lot of decline.

543
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:35,610
All right. So that's a question we can answer. We can ask you a question about the proportion of variability between versus within individuals.

544
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,720
Can anybody tell me just even conceptually, what that question is asking?

545
00:58:53,260 --> 00:59:03,170
I think within an individual it's over for time points and how parents support changes bridges between individuals it's for.

546
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:12,950
Like the change? Yeah, well, essentially it's kind of saying how much of the variability in parents support is because

547
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:16,939
of what's happening at the individual time points versus kind of across the spectrum.

548
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:21,709
So it's the same thing as the ICC. This is essentially ICC.

549
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:25,040
Question What proportion of the variability is at level two?

550
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:32,419
Level two is between individuals. So how much of your parents support matter is more about what's kind of constant

551
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:37,820
around level two at the person level versus at that individual observation level,

552
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:41,210
how things are changing specifically at different points in time.

553
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:47,870
Those are some of the questions that we're trying to answer with level one versus level two characteristics.

554
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:57,800
The third question here is the intercept value. We can use that because if we scale times so that zero equals when you start are age 14,

555
00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:02,690
we can ask about whether or not people have a lot of different parents support when they start high school.

556
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:07,520
We can change that or we can change that intercept if we wanted to.

557
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:13,610
But usually we're most interested in kind of baseline variability is a big part of what we do.

558
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:22,010
Can we characterize everybody's change in parents support with one number, or should we really recognize that people are kind of all over the place?

559
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:26,950
And then certainly what sort of variables predict whether someone's parent supports going up,

560
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,830
down, staying flat, whatever else might be at the end of the day.

561
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,380
What we're really doing is something that looks a lot like this.

562
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:41,240
This is just each individual, the first ten where I take their data points and I construct a line,

563
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:48,350
This is how your year, your parents support is changing over time. We remember doing something like this with schools, right?

564
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:51,500
It was C and math achievement.

565
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:57,470
Now here we're kind of trying to do the same thing after just off.

566
01:00:57,490 --> 01:01:01,850
And we think this parents support go up or down or stay flat on average.

567
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:12,639
Hmm. On average.

568
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:20,920
What do you think? Kind of stay the same.

569
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:26,750
Because some going up B, have some going down. Yes, I'm staying flat.

570
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,129
And I mean, some of the folks have said, yeah, it's probably going to go down.

571
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:35,090
I see one, two, three, four kind of going down, but we have a couple going up.

572
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:39,590
So rather than having to look at 513 of these and making some sort of guess,

573
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,070
that's what our model is going to tell us just on average what's happening.

574
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:47,719
And then can we try to figure out what's going to determine whether you are this person

575
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:52,250
where your parents support is going way up versus this person where it's going way down?

576
01:01:53,060 --> 01:02:02,390
Can we use any of the other data that we have available to us to figure out what predicts some of the variability in slopes,

577
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:06,500
some of the variability in how your parents support changes over time?

578
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:14,719
That's what this is all about. All right.

579
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:19,820
My very first growth model is going to look a lot like my very first multilevel model.

580
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:25,940
Okay? All I'm doing here and I'm a planner and I'll have it, is estimating my outcome variable.

581
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:29,749
In this case, it's parent support. But it's not just parents who voiced their support.

582
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:33,440
And for different time points. For different time points.

583
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:39,020
This is a good basically I'm going to be a flat line that we're trying to estimate here.

584
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:45,140
It's going to be the average amount of parent support across all 513 individuals.

585
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,670
I am going to include this random effect. This is our ID variable.

586
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:55,130
This is going to say that my parent's support variable varies by who's responding.

587
01:02:55,490 --> 01:03:02,630
I can't just describe the entire sample with one level of social support or one basically flat line and social support.

588
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:06,920
I want to have that line change depending on who I'm talking about.

589
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:13,220
I'm hoping this is still sounded awfully familiar to all we had to do last week with the multilevel model stuff.

590
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:21,740
We're going to get an estimate in this case because we're only estimating an intercept and the way that

591
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:30,980
we scale time has a logical zero value so that a zero essentially equals the your baseline value.

592
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:36,830
This is going to be the same thing as your starting value of parent support kind of across the entire sample.

593
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:48,860
Okay. So on average, on a scale of 1 to 5, most people are reporting what you would call that, probably like agree.

594
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:53,970
My parents are supportive and this would be across all those six or seven variables that that we've used in the past.

595
01:03:55,110 --> 01:04:04,950
We have, like we had before, some level of person level variability as well as within individual level variability.

596
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:08,340
And this is where it's going to be a little bit different from what we've done so far.

597
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:17,040
When we talk about growth models, the proportion of variability that can be that we can be found at level two is often a lot higher.

598
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:20,549
So the effect of neighborhoods on individual level outcomes,

599
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:26,460
the effective clinic or department or state or political party or whatever on individual level outcomes,

600
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:32,040
those IQs were ranging from like zero to point two or we saw one point to six or something like that.

601
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:40,860
When we start talking about growth stuff, it's not uncommon to see high levels of level two variability.

602
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:47,399
So 53% of the variability in parents support is kind of found across individuals kind of saying that

603
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:51,390
it's not so much about where in time we started talking to other people about their parents support.

604
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:57,360
We just want to know a little bit more about the person as a whole. What are some of the characteristics of the person as a whole?

605
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:02,340
All those individual level predictors that we normally think about as this sex race, whatever is going to be.

606
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:13,090
How are we doing, folks? Can I show you one more?

607
01:05:14,530 --> 01:05:20,500
All right. I promise we'll start and Tuesday mode in have video on and off if you really need.

608
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:26,410
That'll be fine. This is my this is my first growth model.

609
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:31,780
And what I've done is I've included this new variable index.

610
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:39,100
This time it's saying that those content, those rows one, two, three and four represent time going by.

611
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:42,580
You can't flip the order. One precedes the other.

612
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,260
In this case, it's about a year change. So that's helpful for our interpretation.

613
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:52,000
But we are saying that time is predicting our outcome.

614
01:05:52,000 --> 01:06:02,320
Variable parent support. We are allowing you we are allowing individuals to change over time because we are not estimating a random effect for slope.

615
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:08,860
We are just trying to figure out across 530 people what does parent support look like over time?

616
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:20,400
What does parent support look like over time? Yakabuski You just look right there, Tony.

617
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:23,850
That's all you need to know right there. What?

618
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:31,020
What happens to parents support over time? It increases a unit change in.

619
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:44,490
A year change in time is associated with about 1.0 to 6 increase in your parent support.

620
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:48,390
Parent support on average across 513 people.

621
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:53,340
Looks a little bit like that. Not flat, maybe just a little bit like that.

622
01:06:54,210 --> 01:07:00,330
So we saw those ten graphs, we saw 513 of those graphs and we averaged them all together.

623
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:12,940
It would be point 0 to 6. Now it looks like this is marginally significance and not all that much different from zero.

624
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:22,210
I won't make I won't do it. But if. What do you think is the next step following this equation or this analysis?

625
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:34,550
He then? Feel like I'm skipping a step, but eventually because the difference.

626
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:39,790
Yeah. What's the next model I want to test? You're absolutely right.

627
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:44,770
But what's the next model I want to test? What are we saying is about this point or to sex?

628
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:50,900
Who is this true for? Who?

629
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:54,830
What's individual therapy and measurement?

630
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:01,140
This is between group. Would you add in like a random.

631
01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:07,850
Right. So right now we're saying that this is how your parents support changes for all 513 people in the sample.

632
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:12,800
I don't care who you are. I don't care where you come from. I don't care what else we know about you.

633
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:18,829
This is how your parents support is going to change. My next step will be to add that random effect to say, Wait a minute,

634
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:24,290
there is a unique effect of an individual on how your parents support changes over time.

635
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:30,020
So that be like adding in another like demographic variable like that.

636
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:37,010
Well, we can do that to try to predict it, but first of all, we need to do is include.

637
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:44,450
This is now time. I'm saying this is now time we'll have.

638
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:56,320
This is time. This is our this is that right?

639
01:08:56,620 --> 01:09:00,670
We're saying that we'll just substitute this in. I don't care who you are.

640
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,130
This is what I this is what the effect of time is going to be.

641
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:12,850
We will then add this random effect to allow that slope to change, depending on who we're talking about.

642
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:22,990
And we want to know if by allowing slopes to change versus just forcing everybody to an exact same intercept results in a better fitting model.

643
01:09:24,610 --> 01:09:31,839
Because what we know now is that people start with about a four on their parents support and over the course of four years,

644
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:36,790
the high school that parents board gets a little bit better over time each year.

645
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:41,680
It's getting a little bit higher. A little bit higher. But we know that there are probably some people for whom this is not true.

646
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,550
And can we see this within our model? All right.

647
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:52,300
I'm going to suggest a period for next week rather than trying to jump into yet another topic.

648
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:58,060
Let's keep working through this example and then we're going to give folks some time to to work

649
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:03,400
on and we'll do a lot of homework or we have a growth model kind of homework or practice,

650
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:09,520
too. So be prepared to well, if you would like to join.

651
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:17,920
On Tuesday it's going to be online, so I'll send a zoom link to everybody and then we will will continue on with this example.

652
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:21,850
All right. Since I guess I'll see you on camera, hopefully.

653
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:27,520
But if not, have a safe weekend. Have an enjoyable Thanksgiving if I don't see you next Tuesday.

654
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,540
Safe travels and all that kind of good stuff. But thank you. I know this is a lot.

655
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:36,759
I know it's maybe abstract, but there's there's good value, there's good stuff.

656
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:41,520
And how you might want to use these things is my very first academic paper that I wrote was using growth models.

657
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:45,480
So you can you can do it if I could do it and you could definitely do it.

658
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:50,080
But we'll get there. All right. We'll get we get some practice. All right. Have a great day, everybody.
