00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Injury part for occupational injuries and falls in previous segments of this lecture,

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
we focused on motor vehicle deaths and overdose deaths in this segment.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We will examine fatalities due to falls and deaths in the workplace.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let's begin with Falls. You don't hear about it very much, but fatal injuries from falls are not rare.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Falls represent the third leading cause of unintentional injury deaths in the United States not far behind.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Deaths from motor vehicles and deaths due to falls have been increasing in recent years

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and are projected to continue to increase in parallel with the aging of the population.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This chart tells a simple and important story.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Death from an unintentional fall can happen to anyone, but the risk of death among the elderly is exponentially greater than among young people.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And since the population of the United States has been and will continue to grow older for many years to come.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The problem of falls and deaths from falls has been growing and will continue to increase for many years.

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
There are a number of reasons for age being such an overwhelming risk factor for death from falls as people age.

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There are a variety of physiological changes that occur that contribute to an increased risk of falling eyesight and hearing deteriorate.

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Strength, coordination and balance also decline and can become impaired.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The elderly are far more likely to have multiple chronic illnesses, and having chronic illness can affect all of these physiologic factors.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
In addition to having increased risk factors for falling,

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,000
the elderly are also far more at risk of a fatal outcome from a fall compared to a younger person who experiences a similar fall.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The elderly tend to have weaker and more brittle bones and therefore are more likely to fracture bones when they fall.

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
They are more likely to experience head injuries when they fall and if they survive the immediate injuries from a fall,

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,000
the elderly are far more likely to die in the immediate post injury period from complications of their fall related injuries.

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
In combination with whatever underlying chronic illnesses may also be present,

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
it may be surprising to learn that most falls among the elderly occur on the flat.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So-called ground level falls. Stairs may be riskier, but falls on stairs or in the bathroom are less common.

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Also, most falls occur in the home.

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It is also important to note that falling is a risk factor for falling again.

26
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
In other words, if someone experiences a fall, he or she is at greater risk of falling again.

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So far, there has been limited progress in addressing the growing epidemic of falls in deaths from falls among the elderly.

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It is very difficult to design engineering controls to prevent falls in the home or to mitigate the impact of falls.

29
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Unlike motor vehicles, where government policy on multiple levels has led to safer cars, safer roads and safer driving,

30
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,000
such engineering and behavioral approaches are less readily available to prevent or mitigate the impact of falls in the home.

31
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Clearly, more research is needed to address this growing problem. Now, let's move on to consider occupational fatal injuries.

32
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Over the last hundred years or so, the rate of fatal occupational injuries in the United States has fallen almost 20 fold.

33
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is a major public health achievement, but it took a long time and a lot of effort.

34
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And despite such progress, it is important to note that in the United States this year,

35
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:51,000
more than 5000 people will get up in the morning and go to work, but never come home to their families in the following slides.

36
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We will examine these data in greater detail. The number and the rate of fatal workplace injuries varies considerably.

37
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
More than 20 fold.

38
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Among major industry sectors, four industry sectors standout for having the highest fatality rates construction, transportation and warehousing.

39
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting and mining.

40
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Quarrying, oil and gas extraction. A common thread is that all four of these high risk industry sectors involve outdoor and often manual work.

41
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It is much more difficult to design and deploy engineering controls to prevent or

42
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:46,000
to mitigate injuries in outdoor environments compared to indoor work settings.

43
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This slide displays the civilian occupations with the highest fatal injury rates.

44
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Again, we see a pattern that is similar to the previous slide.

45
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Outdoor and more manual occupations have the highest rates of fatal injuries.

46
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And while the raw numbers of fatal injuries are relatively slow, small and most of these categories.

47
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:22,000
This is not the case for deaths among commercial drivers. More fatal injuries resulted from transportation incidents.

48
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Men from any other event in twenty seventeen roadway incidents alone accounted for almost 13 hundred deaths.

49
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,000
About one in four fatal work injuries. Other types of transportation incidents, such as those involving pedestrians, aircraft,

50
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
boats and railroads, accounted for another seven hundred and seventy eight deaths.

51
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Falls to a lower level are the second leading mechanism of fatal workplace injuries.

52
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Think of construction workers or roofers. Violence, particularly involving homicides, is also an important factor in workplace fatalities.

53
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
There are some notable differences in the distribution of fatal work injuries by sex.

54
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Not surprisingly, men experience more fatal work injuries than women.

55
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This is largely due to the fact that men are much more likely to be employed in industry sectors and job categories that involve the greatest risk,

56
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
such as outdoor occupations. However, the sex distribution of homicides is noticeable.

57
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Notably, different women experience a much higher proportion of fatal injuries due to homicides relative to men.

58
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The reason is not that women are more likely to work in jobs that have a higher risk of homicide,

59
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
such as working in stores or banks at risk of robberies,

60
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:09,000
but rather that the workplace is all too often where women are victims of domestic or partner violence.

61
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
As mentioned previously, the rate of fatal occupational injuries has declined almost 20 fold in the last hundred years or so.

62
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
This is a major success, but it involved a wide variety of prevention strategies.

63
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:33,000
At the beginning of the 20th century, there were no child labor laws and children were frequently employed in very dangerous occupations.

64
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Child labor was outlawed in the first decades of the 20th century.

65
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Unions have played an important role in promoting safer workplaces.

66
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Many occupations involving work with or in proximity to hazardous substances such as lead or asbestos or hazardous equipment.

67
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Many laws, rules and work practices have been implemented to eliminate or reduce these hazards.

68
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The nature of work in the United States has fundamentally changed from being primarily physical to being more service oriented.

69
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Nevertheless, as we've seen, there are still many outdoor and high risk occupations that exist and will likely continue to exist.

70
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:28,000
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, all states implemented some form of workers compensation laws.

71
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,000
These laws establish the legal liability of employers for worker injuries and deaths and made it much easier for workers

72
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:44,000
or their families to seek and obtain compensation from their employers for work related injuries and fatalities.

73
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Not surprisingly, as work injuries and fatalities began to cost employers more money,

74
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:59,000
employers took a much greater interest in implementing safe work practices that contributed to reduced work injuries and fatalities.

75
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
In addition to workers compensation laws, many states and importantly,

76
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
the federal government implemented greater regulation and enforcement mechanisms for workplace safety.

77
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The law establishing the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, was passed in 1970.

78
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Overall, unintentional injuries are the third leading cause of death in the United States.

79
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Language is especially important when thinking about unintentional injuries.

80
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
They are not just accidents, which implies they are random and unavoidable.

81
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
A public health approach with a focus on prevention has been very successful in

82
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
reducing unintentional injuries and fatalities for a number of major categories,

83
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:59,000
such as those related to motor vehicles and occupation. On the other hand, we have also had major challenges or setbacks,

84
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:08,000
as demonstrated by the enormous increase in overdose deaths in the United States beginning in the 1990s and extending to about 2017.

85
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yet even in this instance, a combination of recent efforts appears to have contributed to a decrease in overdose deaths in the last year or two.

86
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Hopefully, this latest trend will continue.

87
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Finally, there are major areas where more research is needed to identify effective and affordable prevention strategies,

88
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
such as to prevent and or to mitigate the impact of falls among the elderly.

89
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:47,489
In the final segment of this lecture on injuries, we will focus on intentional injuries, specifically homicides and suicides.
