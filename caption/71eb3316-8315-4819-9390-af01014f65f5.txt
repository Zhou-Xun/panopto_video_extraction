1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:24,370
So I think all the way up to this, you know, I think that's going to jump over the next several months.

2
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:35,120
Congresswoman, you know, you were talking about this.

3
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:50,230
Not only is it something like this, it's something that, you know,

4
00:00:54,630 --> 00:01:25,260
it's just about paramount that this is talking about this idea that I think you have to realize it's partly because of connections to our problems,

5
00:01:28,920 --> 00:02:11,320
because if we don't do, it will come back to haunt you.

6
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:35,070
You know, no, because I mean, this is what I have to see with this BP executives.

7
00:02:35,070 --> 00:03:08,100
I mean, this morning, it's going to be an announcement, six, six, 61166, six, six, six, six, six, six.

8
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:17,310
Genetics with 10 million people.

9
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:29,580
You know, what do you think you're going to do on systems like that?

10
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:36,390
But not just one.

11
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:47,280
All right. All right. Again, for the last week, a seminar just finished.

12
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,080
Okay, so let's get started on this lecture.

13
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,250
So we're going to continue on this the library, right, about our whole distribution.

14
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,980
Last time we introduced the notion of conditional distribution.

15
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:07,410
Right. So this time, we're going to move on to compound distributions,

16
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:16,830
although introduce the notion of additional taxation and variance to control distribution, whether that means.

17
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:29,700
And so in practice, sometimes we may be able to correctly evaluate the distribution of a random variable, but sometimes it's not that straightforward.

18
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:39,300
So in modern cases, actually the random variable is easier, more easily defined under this condition idea.

19
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:46,590
Now words we can define the variable conditional another round of variable graphical easily,

20
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:53,670
but the direct correlation of the distribution of one random variable is not so straightforward.

21
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:59,040
So we can take advantage of this conditioning to help us to write a part of the right amount.

22
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,600
We're going to discuss two scenarios. One is sort of mixture and one is kind of.

23
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:12,230
Both are very related, slightly different, but the overall idea is the same.

24
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:22,580
So that is the conditional distributions of why given acts is relatively easy to write out and the margin

25
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,800
of acts is relatively easy to write out by the margin of the Y is not a very straightforward to writer.

26
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:40,240
Then we can go through this round, right? We are not that marginal or conditional y given I forgot the joint of x and y and then marginalize it.

27
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:47,570
Figure out the distribution so that by the count on that it makes sure distribution.

28
00:05:50,470 --> 00:06:02,350
The more specific. But we can start with the strong distribution of X and Y by using the definition that the drawing distribution,

29
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:11,590
the drawing PDF or piano is equal to the product of this conditional preamp, the amp times, the marginal of us.

30
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:17,290
And then we can use this integration to get the margin of the Y, right?

31
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,950
So that's not the case. It's actually continuous.

32
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:25,530
And you replace the integration with summation, your random marbles.

33
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:31,450
Are this correct? So this is also related to the law of total probability.

34
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:37,120
Recall that in the original, when we first introduced the law of total probability,

35
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:45,900
one of the main uses of that is that this is your sample space, right?

36
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:52,710
And your target is to evaluate the probability of this event be probably directly evaluated.

37
00:06:52,740 --> 00:07:01,390
It is not very straightforward, but if you can somehow got a plantation, we want a to a three.

38
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:11,710
I'll give you our sample space and a conditional probability of B gave a one be given a two and three is easier to evaluate.

39
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:18,990
Now you can use this low total probability to help you evaluate the probability of the studies, right?

40
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:25,390
So that's the same idea. So here is just extending that to this random variable six.

41
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:38,200
Recall that for the law of total probability, we also look at the example of the the Monty Hall problem.

42
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:38,940
All right.

43
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:49,450
So assuming there are three doors, one has a car behind it, whether you should switch after what code, one of the other doors does not have card.

44
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:57,430
So we use this conditional probability. And as the law of total probability, you help us evaluate the probability of be.

45
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,620
So here is that example to solidify that idea.

46
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:11,010
Suppose patients entering a cancer clinical trial can be cured with a certain probability,

47
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:17,700
and the time to relapse for patients who are not cured follows an exponential distribution.

48
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:27,120
The question is, what is the distribution of time to lock, to relax or a randomly chosen patient?

49
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:35,590
Right. So that is the question of interest, that distribution of time to relapse or a randomly chosen patient.

50
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:46,780
So if I did note this y to be a time to relapse or a randomly chosen patient, we want to know the distribution of y.

51
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:54,190
So that's when we are trying to get. Okay. But based on this description is not very straightforward.

52
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:01,790
How do you evaluate the PDA or PMI or CTA or this random variable y do?

53
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:11,790
Right. All right. Because you don't know whether a randomly chosen patient is a patient that is actually

54
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:19,840
cured or a patient actually who is not cured because of these different types of patients.

55
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,960
They have very different time to relax distribution. Our patient that is cured.

56
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:33,350
The time to relapse is essentially just infinity, right?

57
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,810
Because it never really is cured. So the time to relapse is infinite.

58
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:44,830
But for a patient that is not cured, the time to relapse follows exponential distribution.

59
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,680
But that actually gave us a sense of if you introduce another random variable out,

60
00:09:53,990 --> 00:10:04,290
which is the indicator of whether or not the patient is cured, we do know the distribution of y given acts as we just answered.

61
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:11,750
Right. So the y axis is an indicator of whether or not the patient is cured.

62
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,670
For example, let's say X is one.

63
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:33,470
If the patient is not cured and zero if it's cured or if this way, then we know this is what is the distribution of x.

64
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,800
AX is the indicator of whether randomly chosen location is secure or not.

65
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,480
What is the distribution of X supernovae and what is that?

66
00:10:51,630 --> 00:11:01,320
If I define X to be one, to be not cured and zero to be cured, what is the probability of success in this case?

67
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,430
What's the probability of one that one minus theta?

68
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,540
Theta is the probability of being cured.

69
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:22,830
In this case, if we define one to be not cured. In other words, if we define our success to be not cured, not success rate is one minus theta.

70
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:34,320
So set this as and so they would know it follows Bernoulli distribution, which is parameter one minus theta if we define it this way.

71
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:43,130
And of course you can switch the order of this set of this to you can define zero to be not here to one to be cured.

72
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:46,980
Then it's up another distribution which parameter theta right.

73
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:53,940
Anyway, so given access the distribution of y is also known.

74
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,409
That is if answer is zero.

75
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:06,450
Given that is zero, we know y is infinity.

76
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:18,220
That's why I should be accused by counsel and should be offended, because if the patient is cured, even the patient is cured.

77
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:34,840
The time to relapse should be better. Alternatively, if y given see one follows a distribution that is exponential distribution with prime dilemma.

78
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:42,770
Even the patient is not cured. We know the time to realize all those experts are distribution with private.

79
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:50,620
All right. So that to fully define the conditional distribution of a Y given x.

80
00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:00,130
So in this case we do know the marginal distribution of X and the condition distribution of like of an X,

81
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:09,490
and we can use that to to derive the marginal distribution for Y using this compound idea.

82
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,050
So directly, deriving the distribution of a Y may not be straightforward,

83
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:24,280
but we can leverage this conditional distribution of the marginal distribution because the distribution of a lot more specifically, you know, these.

84
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:34,620
This CDF for Y marginal seat Y is equal to this summation.

85
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:43,950
This is essentially just that law of total probability and the breakdown of the sample space based on the two status of acts,

86
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:55,170
actually a zero and acts equal to one. And for each one you have this marginal and you have this conditional and the if actually is equal to zero.

87
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,490
We know the probability of x equals zero is what theta.

88
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:10,440
Okay, so that gives theta and the probability of y less than a particular set and small y given the patient is cure is always zero.

89
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:20,000
And why is that? Even the patient is cured.

90
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:26,540
What is the probability that the time to relapse is less than the fixed constant?

91
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:35,000
It should be zero, right? Because as we argued, given axis zero, the time to relapse is infinity.

92
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,890
So the probability of this random hour of a less than a fixed coulson is always zero.

93
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:46,700
That's why you have to zero times better and perhaps equal to one.

94
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:59,900
You have the probability of the patient not cured as one minus theta and the probability of this y of this for this not cured patient.

95
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,159
The probability of the time to relapse. Last time.

96
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:12,680
Why is this city a function for these financial institutions which have this one minus e to the active lockdown times Y for

97
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:24,860
the to put everything together you can got the marginal CDP or Y one minus theta times one minus E to the negative lambda y.

98
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:35,020
But that is your CDI or any y greater than zero less that you've been.

99
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:41,330
But that way we can derive the marginal form of.

100
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:51,969
So this is an example which show you the right derivation of the margin of alignment obviously forward,

101
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:58,660
but you can always go through this detour first got the conditional and you got the margin

102
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:04,420
of the other one to get the joint and then integrate out of one to get the margin.

103
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:23,560
So if you draw this video, our function looks like this. This is why Euro started from zero and as I understand it, started to increase from 0.0.

104
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:42,970
There is a limit. And what is this value as y approaching infinity?

105
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:50,040
What is what does this KDR function? Approaching.

106
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:58,850
Is there one and not one have to look at this formula.

107
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:04,430
All right. If y goes to infinity, what does this photograph of a project.

108
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,780
I made it better. All right. That's the limit operation.

109
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:19,090
Y goes to infinity. This term goes away. So the second parenthesis is just one.

110
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:28,450
So the entire term approaching one minus theta. That seems to be contradictory to what we have learned says.

111
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:34,750
We argue that that why infinity should be equal to one for any retroviral.

112
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:42,610
So what's in between? Why there is a gap or one is here.

113
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:51,320
Why there is a gap of height theta. But it.

114
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:06,410
This is still a valid or a correct idea.

115
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:23,280
So first question, do you think it's a correct seduction? Yes.

116
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:30,030
You know, no. I think we have to add data to it.

117
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:37,050
So where we have to add theta to this function.

118
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:46,030
Other thoughts? And different thoughts.

119
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:54,780
All. The answer is it is still a valid and largest city function.

120
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:04,410
Recall that all we require for the city our function is ask why infinity is equal to one, right?

121
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:13,380
What this tells us is that y y as y goes to infinity is one minus theta.

122
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:23,130
There is a gap between this Lima operation and this apply infinity because this is a special case that is actually called a zero.

123
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,640
Then Y actually only takes infinity, right?

124
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:33,090
So that's where this gap is from. This gap is corresponding to those pure patients.

125
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:40,110
All right. So for those one minus theta is a probability.

126
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:46,860
The randomly chosen patient is is now cured. And then theta is the probability where the patient is cured.

127
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,300
If is cured, then the time to relapse it just the infinity.

128
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:55,950
So that's why there is a gap. And this and why infinity is still one.

129
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,000
It's just that the limit of y goes to infinity. At Y, y is no longer apply infinity.

130
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:09,360
That applied function is now continuous at the infinity point.

131
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:19,450
Yes. So this means that we're including infinity in our support that again various for the support of why does this mean right?

132
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:27,260
Why are we allowed to do this if we don't include it is a potential value because it seems like we're putting point maps on a point last,

133
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:34,560
but it's a special infinity. But still y or infinity is not in this court.

134
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:47,520
Infinity is well, technically infinity is in the support and in this case it is in the support.

135
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,760
Otherwise it is not in the support. You cannot have a point. That's right.

136
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:59,370
So it is in the support. So it has a point. And that point as is theta that is corresponding to those cured patients.

137
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:06,209
So this is a static case and if you want to understand it in a slightly different way,

138
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:15,240
consider you do not fall off with this patients infinity law, but rather you have a fixed end point for this study.

139
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:21,390
Then there will be a unmask at the end point of the study instead of the infinity.

140
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:27,269
That might be easier to understand if you just follow up with this patient for, say,

141
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:36,870
20 years and then there will be a jump at t equal to 20 and that jump going to be theta

142
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:45,150
plus some small quantity from this cure patients who are still having relapse at 20 years.

143
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:56,100
But anyway, this charm is due to this cured patient that those patients have this point mass at infinity.

144
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,050
Okay. So it's still a valid CTF.

145
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:11,130
All right. So next example. It's not acts I be independent are normally rhinovirus.

146
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:17,370
So each one is taken by zero one and they all share the same parameter theta.

147
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:28,680
But suppose the total number of this Bernoulli random variable is M is no longer a constant, but rather is a random.

148
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:39,210
And specifically we allow the though we love this and who follows the follow up calls on distribution with prime to Lambda.

149
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:45,720
So if we denote a new round our us to be as one.

150
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:56,940
There's no t here. As we set out, it would be x one plus x two all the way through n where this lower index end is also a random variable.

151
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,050
Then we get a new round of variable. Right?

152
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,200
So we some derivation we can say that this new round of arrival is also a plus on

153
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:15,189
distribution with new parameter theta times theta is that one of the parameter?

154
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,970
Lambda is our original causal rate.

155
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,200
And sometimes we call this an awesome process.

156
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:32,440
It's kind of an awesome process because compared to the original puzzling process and Lambda,

157
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,500
these new person rate is strictly smaller than the original plus rate.

158
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:45,700
Theta is a probability, so theta times lambda is strictly a smaller lambda.

159
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:57,970
So then plus our process and to show that this as this newly defined random variable, as I say, follows a person distribution,

160
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:05,410
we have to resort to this compile idea again because you can easily say that directly

161
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:10,990
deriving the distribution for us may not be so straightforward is not an easy task.

162
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:23,260
But if a condition of how the other word fits at the end to be a constant, then the derivation is much simpler.

163
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:30,729
In fact, previously we have already shown that if you add a bunch of plus all right.

164
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:35,620
Of variables facing some random variable, you still got a person right about right.

165
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:43,660
That is something that we have already shown. It must say Y is equal to x one plus x two.

166
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:55,090
Those are awesome just because I'm the one with all the two and they are independent.

167
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:04,940
From previous lecture we know Y is also a person not in parallel with rate.

168
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:08,980
I'm the one passed on, right?

169
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:17,140
That's what I have learned. Now the only difference is that this new random variable has is a summation of bunch of Bernoulli random variable.

170
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:23,620
And the number of this Bernoulli random variable is also random.

171
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:34,709
So if we can somehow fix this and the problem will be much easier, the sum of independent Connolly random variable is a binomial random.

172
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:42,370
Now I say it's nothing to do with this summation, of course, on this.

173
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:55,290
If you have a bunch of independent business, we run a viable business based.

174
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:01,660
There's going to be a binomial random variable and beta.

175
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:08,020
Each of them are normally theta and.

176
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:19,090
They are independent. Then the summation of this finite number of Bernoulli run Navarro-Valls is a binomial random variable.

177
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:25,840
That is something that can be shown. And actually, that's how we define binomial in the first place.

178
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:32,040
We conduct these independent trials multiple times. Just count how many times you have successes.

179
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:36,910
That's how we define the final. Right. That's exactly that.

180
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:48,640
So here the idea is if we can somehow face this and that it to be fixed instead of random, that we can derive the distribution.

181
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:55,450
So that is to say, as given, we know exactly what distribution that is.

182
00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:09,340
That is if binomial with n trials and success rate theta over, we know the margin of error, which is a plus on lambda.

183
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:23,080
So from this tool we can derive the join of as an end and the marginal mass and the

184
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:31,450
marginal as is also of course on distribution with parameter theta and theta times longer.

185
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:44,910
And we're going to show that in a second. The idea is this we resort to this conditional distribution, so help us derive the marginal for the House.

186
00:27:48,560 --> 00:28:00,570
And here is an example where we actually have this this particular set up.

187
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:07,110
Assume that N is the number of drug infections injections during a specific time period,

188
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:15,870
which could be a random variable, the number of drug in that injection during a specific time period.

189
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:26,790
So that is a random variable. And in particular for each injection, there is a probability that that needle is contaminated with HIV.

190
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:37,410
And we denoted that by our side. So our side is the indicator of whether the needle is contaminated with HIV or not.

191
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,390
One means it's contaminated. Zero means it's not okay.

192
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,650
And asked is the number of contaminated needles used in the time period?

193
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:57,810
The other words this as is x one plus x two plus all the way to x.

194
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:07,420
All right. The number of contaminated needles and just that the some of those indicators.

195
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,580
If you have contaminated needle, then you out of one.

196
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:22,780
If you do not, you had a zero. The total number of injections is also random and each injection is also random, either contaminant or not.

197
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:35,499
So that's exactly the previous setup. If we assume this and the number of injection calls up plus on distribution with lambda and these x,

198
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:47,320
I apologize if I binary or no independent bernoulli random variable with parameter beta then we can use the previous.

199
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:55,150
Result took got the marginal distribution for us.

200
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,030
You know,

201
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:11,210
as is then the person process is also some random variable and we can get this probability of as high as by plugging in that goes on distribution.

202
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:24,140
And if we want to ask the question of whether the subject who is, you know, went through this drug injections or got HIV or not,

203
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:33,760
that just corresponds to the probability of as equal to zero versus as not equal to zero as equal to zero.

204
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:40,610
That means none of this injections, none of the needles is contaminated with HIV.

205
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:48,350
So that is the probability of knowing, you know, HIV and one minus that is the probability of HIV.

206
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:59,090
So to answer that question, we can just convert that to the problem of evaluating the probability of the marginal distribution of us.

207
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:05,240
Now the question boils down to how to derive the PMI for us.

208
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:11,900
And as we said before, we can use this conditional idea.

209
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,549
So there are three.

210
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:25,160
Evaluating the probability of A-Z for us is not easy, but if a conditional and with six and that becomes a much more manageable problem.

211
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:35,420
In particular, we can break down our original piano into the right hand side, which is low of total probability.

212
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:45,470
All right. So the summation of small N, which is the index from zero to infinity, the probability of RC for us,

213
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:51,650
any country that is given an equal to at times the probability of an equal to.

214
00:31:53,110 --> 00:32:04,700
Okay. And I'll give you a couple minutes trying to write out what this is and try to simplify it, say whether you can derive a PMI for us.

215
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:19,520
Again, recall that as given is a binomial distribution and theta and the margin of n is a force on distribution.

216
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:35,570
Find out how to use this knowledge to plug in the corresponding path and try to simplify his calculations.

217
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,860
All right, so let's look at this together. So.

218
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,149
But the first thought is,

219
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:39,400
what do we have from this law of total probability that we can rewrite this marginal as as the summation of the conditional plot times,

220
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:47,020
the marginal event, and then the next then is to plug in the conditional PMF and the marginal PMA.

221
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:54,610
And before that we need to notice that this range needs to have a little adjustment.

222
00:37:55,570 --> 00:38:06,310
Recall that as is the number of as is defined as x one plus x two all the way to.

223
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:17,230
So if this capital random variable has taken value, small s, which has a constant.

224
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:24,170
What we know is that this cattle and has to be greater or equal to this minus.

225
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:32,380
Right. Otherwise, there is no way that any time God has contaminated needles from the last injection.

226
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:42,640
The only the smallest value that you have to ask contaminated needles is to have as injections.

227
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,569
So this, as the small one,

228
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:57,730
has to go from as get anything smaller that has a probability of the conditional probability of RC four as and is always zero.

229
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:04,510
So that is a small adjustment that we need to make. And once we do that, we can employ in this a piano.

230
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:10,900
The conditional piano is just a Bernoulli binomial piano.

231
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:16,600
With this end, to be the total number of trials has to be the number of successes.

232
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:23,950
Theta is a success rate. Okay. And the second part, the marginal end is just the a plus on piano.

233
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:27,670
So you write a piano on this way.

234
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:37,960
And once you write playing in the perhaps you can do a simplification and factorial just cancels out and all the terms are not involved.

235
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:46,060
These are the concept that does not involve in whatever Riemann is, the term that involve it.

236
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:53,620
So if you further look at this formula, we can do some change of our most.

237
00:39:53,950 --> 00:40:02,649
Is that okay? And from asking the infinity you can redefine M or and start to be a minus house and start going to be

238
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:09,520
start starting from zero to infinity correspond to whatever inside this summation I'm going to be in.

239
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:18,440
The numerator is a factorial denominator. Numerator is a power term times a lambda her.

240
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:27,370
So both can be combined at minus three times lambda to the power and star, and the denominator is the star factorial.

241
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:33,850
So that should remind us of the power for a cosine distribution.

242
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:40,510
All right, we have a row in the denominator. We also have a power term in the numerator.

243
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:49,560
All we are, all that's needed is that this exponential term a constant, but just for this piano, for that parameter.

244
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:57,310
So if we have this course, this additional exponential term, we got exactly as on piano.

245
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:07,300
So the summation goes away. Summation is equal to one. And after some calculation, you can add up with this quantity and further organize the terms.

246
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:16,210
You end up with this formula lambda theta to the power as to the next theta over AC factorial.

247
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:24,070
Again, that's a puzzle. Yeah. With its own rate being this lambda time theta.

248
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:32,740
So that's why this has marginally as a proposal distribution which parameter theta.

249
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:41,730
So it's derived from this conditional idea. Iraq The relation is much hotter.

250
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,040
A conditional derivation is manageable. Questions.

251
00:41:55,930 --> 00:42:00,600
All right. So another example, Iraq, the use of this knowledge.

252
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:05,040
Suppose the number of mice in the litter is plus all that.

253
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:12,580
And each of these mice mouse has probably has a probability of being malformed.

254
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:18,370
Malformed. What is the distribution of the number of malformed pups in the letter?

255
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:25,660
This is exactly a setup that we have talked about before.

256
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:30,580
Right. The number of mice as denoted by n n is causal.

257
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:41,240
And each cup, each mouse has probably better of being malformed,

258
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:59,450
so it really known as I to be the indicator of whether the mouth is malformed with one being malformed, zero being not malformed so we know is false.

259
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:02,810
About Bernoulli, distribution was probably better.

260
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:08,900
The question is what is the distribution of the number of malformed pox?

261
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,140
So the number of malformed parts is just a summation.

262
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:26,710
I was from one and I saw a bit in our as by that we know that this total number is a on its individual as a independent Bernoulli.

263
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:42,170
So this summation follows a thin well thought process so we can directly write out the distribution as causal was parameter theta times lambda.

264
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:50,559
So that gave us a distribution of the total number of malformed parts in the later the right to use it.

265
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,130
Not one. Do we have any question?

266
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,510
So that's one exponential plus on distribution.

267
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:15,410
Since previously we have seen essentially a Poisson Bernoulli distribution individual being Bernoulli conditional being

268
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:25,800
individual being Bernoulli condition conditional distribution being a photon distribution being a binomial distribution,

269
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,860
the total number being on a number being chosen.

270
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:32,810
Then we have this drawing distribution or marginal distribution.

271
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:38,870
So here is a slightly different setting where the conditional distribution is across our distribution.

272
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,680
Y Given that is a person and the person has a rate.

273
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:47,690
X Right. So that is a causal rate is random.

274
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:55,440
And this puzzle rate itself follows its distribution with the alumna.

275
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:04,030
Then the question is what is a marginal distribution for? Does that make sense?

276
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:10,330
So this act is a puzzle, right? It itself is a exponential distribution.

277
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:20,770
First of all, we know that person rate has to be positive and that type of distribution also takes support on the positive paths it spends.

278
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:25,630
So that part, it makes sense, it's valid.

279
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:34,030
And we know that marginal vaccines exponential conditional of why human acts is causal.

280
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:43,659
Then we can use this conditional idea to derive the marginal look at and particular to give in a context that Y being

281
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:55,090
the number of red blood cells in the human body and this X is the mean the plus own rate for that also run a variable.

282
00:45:55,660 --> 00:46:03,520
It could be associated with personal characteristics such as age, gender, BMI, etc.

283
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:16,720
So this x is. A function of those characteristics, and that as follows Exponential distribution.

284
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:27,880
Then given the x, y is z proton distribution, what is the marginal distribution for Y to get that, we again use this conditional idea.

285
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:36,590
To evaluate the probability of y equal to this small y are different from the previous example.

286
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:43,160
Now since that x is continuous. So instead of having this summation, now we have this integration.

287
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:56,669
The same idea of total probability. But since the condition of the partition is continuous right around a variable, instead of using summation,

288
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:04,110
we have to use this integration to integrate of conditional pmt of y given at

289
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:12,300
times the marginal p m a pdf of x an integrated from zero to infinity to it.

290
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:18,660
A sense of x is only has support of the zero infinity.

291
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:25,530
So this integration is from zero to infinity. You plug in this corresponding piano and PDA.

292
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:32,130
So this card is a PMF or plus on this part is a PDF The Exponential.

293
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,620
So you solve this integration.

294
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:44,400
Okay, I'll give you one minute to solve this integration and say what you got, what you got at the marginal for this Y right of our whole.

295
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:21,720
All right. So let's look at this together. So to solve this integration, to simplify this integration, again, the trait that we use,

296
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:30,900
as always, is try to find whether that is corresponding to some PDA of some known function.

297
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:37,350
Right. Once you simplify this function by taking out the term that does not involve axing it,

298
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:45,030
which is a constant that I can take out of this integration, you will end up with two terms inside this integration.

299
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:53,010
One is a power time X to the power of Y, and the other is like exponential to E to a power all inactive lambda plus one context.

300
00:50:54,240 --> 00:51:04,870
So that is the signal and you should be reminded of the kernel for a common distribution here.

301
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:11,760
A kernel means the central part. The central part for a density function.

302
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:16,530
A part of the density function that involved the the parallel.

303
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:25,270
Okay. So this power term times exponential terms should remind us of the common distribution in particular.

304
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:36,750
If you refer to the common distribution column idea, you can say that it actually has a close connection to what we have inside this integration.

305
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:40,770
As long as we match all of those parameters,

306
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:50,340
we find the IT as it is actually corresponding to a common distribution parameter Y plus one and one over plus one.

307
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:52,230
So with that,

308
00:51:52,590 --> 00:52:05,730
you can add and take out additional constants to make it exactly the PDA for a common distribution so that it can get rid of this integration.

309
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,219
With some derivation,

310
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:19,410
you will find that integration just goes away and the constant as long as this guy lambda over y factorial comma function of y plus one times one

311
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:30,299
over lambda plus one to the power of y plus one and in particular y is a constant right y is a by the integer because y if an x follows a plus,

312
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:37,770
also y is an integer. So this comma y clause which is the y factorial, that's a property of the common function.

313
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:45,330
So that cancels out with this factor a term. In the end we have this a piano for y.

314
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:59,880
For Y is lambda over lambda plus one y plus 1 p.m. y y lambda over one plus lambda y plus one.

315
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:07,850
And what is this distribution? You got?

316
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:24,300
Little bit tricky, right? So you can either rewrite it in this form over one plus lambda times one over one plus lambda.

317
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:38,800
So the Y. As I've written about this land over one over one plus on the assumption that between zero and one right.

318
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:42,670
And a one over one plus one, it's also between zero and one.

319
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:45,940
And don't those two it becomes one.

320
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:49,580
So that reminds I'll remind us of the probability.

321
00:53:49,600 --> 00:54:03,850
So if you denote this one over, if you know this the lambda over one class of lambda as p, that is just a p times y minus p to the power of y.

322
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:14,410
And what is that? If the PM approach like this one distribution is not magic, right?

323
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:23,340
T is a probability of success and you have y failures before your final success.

324
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:34,170
That's exactly geometrically as geometric with parameter y.

325
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:42,150
Should we as parents are alarmed over one.

326
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:49,470
So the success rate is now over 1.9 and the firing rate is one minus.

327
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:59,130
Okay. So why is it that how many experiment that you have to do in order to get the first success?

328
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:04,520
Okay. So now let's take a break and come back to.

329
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:41,690
Been working on.

330
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:10,010
Definition of X and then it goes.

331
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:20,610
Yes, absolutely. So you just consider that as you know, that it's not that.

332
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:36,920
It's so that everybody is just like first good observation, Martin, all the time.

333
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:55,570
But given that the things that you use that term over the age of 36 inches line

334
00:56:55,910 --> 00:57:30,200
on the Internet is still an integral part of your real number of people here.

335
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,620
Yeah, well, this is you can do that for us.

336
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:52,879
I mean, it's a mortgage three years ago because that's all you can do right now.

337
00:57:52,880 --> 00:58:24,700
It is something that you can use the remote control and see that I know what you're going through.

338
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:33,860
Oh, that's cool.

339
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:45,570
Your church people can call it a lot better than be sitting on social media.

340
00:58:46,550 --> 00:59:00,830
And she had a lot of people that have a job.

341
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:08,850
They should be able to look at difference.

342
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:12,499
God, if you got that. And so after the match,

343
00:59:12,500 --> 01:00:08,620
exactly what should we be thinking about what is happening at the meeting with you guys doing me So you think that you would allow the Hudson.

344
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:18,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I.

345
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:48,130
So this new model that earlier you people were.

346
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:54,960
2500 is like you.

347
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:12,640
I don't know. Yeah, my third one, too.

348
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:20,510
I'll try to do it in computer.

349
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:40,190
So let's see. That is one is also a very famous distribution figure by not usually the previous example.

350
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:45,080
No, I don't think so. For some distribution, I say.

351
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:51,050
After this derivation, we know that the so called exponential cosine and just a geometric distribution.

352
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:56,540
But in most cases it's not solving in all of our sample.

353
01:01:56,850 --> 01:02:03,860
The other words, we know the exact family where I belongs to the family where y given up,

354
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:12,650
the family of y given access belongs to but the marginal distribution of alignment nograles finding known family.

355
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:16,970
In that case, we have to just give it a new name.

356
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:27,170
So that's the case for the speed of a normal distribution. Assume the y comes from a binomial distribution where an is a constant,

357
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:34,160
a p is a parameter which is is is a random variable which follows the distribution

358
01:02:34,490 --> 01:02:39,300
with parameter alpha and beta x and recall that are beta distribution.

359
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,950
The pdf is defined this way are p from 0 to 1.

360
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:53,090
Beta distribution is defined as a 0 to 1 in the other word like given p is binomial

361
01:02:53,720 --> 01:03:00,710
with an and he and he is a beta distribution which parameter alpha and beta.

362
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:08,660
And in that case, if you do the derivation using this conditional idea becomes the marginal distribution for Y.

363
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:22,340
You can gather a piano for this marginal distribution of Y, but it doesn't follows any particular families that we have learned.

364
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:34,610
In fact, we call it the beta binomial distribution in particular, and we can derive the marginal Y by integrating out the P parameter.

365
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:42,590
Namely, we can derive this marginal PMR for Y equal to this small y.

366
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:50,510
By solving this integration, you integrate out the P in this product.

367
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:59,960
So the first part is a conditional PMA of Y given P, right?

368
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:04,130
That's the PMA or this binomial component.

369
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:13,640
And the second part is the PDF or P from this beta distribution.

370
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:18,270
And the integration ranges from 0 to 1. Okay.

371
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:28,510
But we can derive that to write down the derivation.

372
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:38,050
If you look at this integration, right,

373
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:48,100
the first thing that we have to notice is which term involved the parameter P because that's why they became part.

374
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:58,610
Once you notice all the terms that involve P, then you can consider whether that is a kernel of some function or a kernel of some distributions.

375
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:06,430
So if you look at this term inside the integration, there are four terms that involve P and all of them are power terms.

376
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:11,980
In fact, two of them are P to the sum power and two of them are one minus P to the power.

377
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:16,240
That just reminds us of the power distribution. Right.

378
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:22,930
Furthermore, the integration is from 0 to 1, which further confirm that we should consider the beta distribution.

379
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:38,020
So if we combine them, we get p to the power of y plus alpha minus one and one minus P times, minus y minus one.

380
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:43,660
And then you have this additional constant of beta function.

381
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:58,510
Alpha beta. So this term to remind you of the beta distribution, whereas parameter Y was alpha, minus y plus beta.

382
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,070
That's the core of that beta distribution.

383
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:11,920
And we need to double check whether that's a valid distribution because for beta distribution, we know both parameter has to be positive.

384
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:19,360
So let's say why is a binomial why conditional on p is a binomial?

385
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:23,480
So y must be zero one to all the way to n, right?

386
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:28,450
So y plus alpha must be a positive number. A minus y must be positive.

387
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:32,110
So a minus y plus beta also has to be a positive number.

388
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:33,550
So this is a valid set up.

389
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:45,850
With that, we can write out exactly what this integration is, that is this quantity and choose y times the ratio of this to beta functions.

390
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:56,790
Numerator is a new beta function, a primary alpha plus y beta plus and minus y and denominator is our original beta function all by the band and.

391
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,920
So that is the piano or why? And what is a support for one?

392
01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:20,690
What is a support alliance? She was.

393
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:34,770
With the support of a wide range.

394
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:40,950
Nusrat. Very good to have the same as the marginal.

395
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:46,190
Same as the conditional. Right. We can decide to support from this conditional distribution.

396
01:07:46,970 --> 01:07:57,860
Why can't we know that's a binomial? Since it's a binomial, this y must go from zero to at taking all the integers from 0 to 1.

397
01:07:58,610 --> 01:08:03,290
So the marginalize it marginalization stop does not tend to support.

398
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:11,090
So after marginalizing the Y, getting the marginal plan for Y, the support remained the same.

399
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:20,960
It's still zero or two in all the evidence. And here this counselor is the PMO for this marginal distribution,

400
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:26,870
and apparently that doesn't follow any particular family that I would have learned so far.

401
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:30,530
In fact, there is no known family to it.

402
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:34,610
So people just give it a new name. We call it the beta binomial distribution.

403
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:43,730
And furthermore, we can we can move one step further.

404
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:47,720
So recall that or we know why. Give me.

405
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:56,210
Right. That is a binomial. We know the marginal p, which is a beta of a beta.

406
01:08:56,660 --> 01:09:07,070
And now with some derivation, we know the marginal of y is a beta binomial with corresponding parameters.

407
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:14,360
So with this we can also use the band theorem to derive the distribution or beta.

408
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:26,270
Given what I recall that the Bayer theorem that we learned last time is just useful for switching the order of two around variables.

409
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:32,510
If you know like MMP, you can also consider using the bear theorem to derive p given y.

410
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:41,360
P itself is a continuous random variable. So peak in a y should also be a continuous random variable.

411
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:52,050
That is to say we can derive the period of p m a long drink or a pdf of pig of a y.

412
01:09:52,080 --> 01:10:08,640
Finally, given that P is by the Bayes theorem, it's the joint distribution of Y divided by the marginal distribution for Y.

413
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:13,990
Which we know all of them. All right.

414
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:23,980
So the numerator and the other reason as to why give a P and the marginal p.

415
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:38,040
Then you just plug in all the corresponding formulas for the conditional distribution, marginal distribution and simplify.

416
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:45,770
So let's do that together. So if you plug in the Y camp, that's a binomial.

417
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:56,870
And choose y y y my p minus y and z.

418
01:10:56,900 --> 01:11:03,380
Marginal is a beta distribution. P minus one minus P.

419
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:10,320
Beta minus one. Divided by the alphabet.

420
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:20,500
Numerator is the marginal or y which is a beta binomial and true is y.

421
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:27,430
Y. Plus and minus y.

422
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:31,750
Over way to alpha beta.

423
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:37,930
So what is like plugging in all the corresponding terms, all the corresponding followers?

424
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:43,750
This is one we got and the next step is to simplify it once be simplified.

425
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:49,600
We got the conditional pdf or p, even y, right?

426
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:58,210
This term cancels out this term and it combined these cancels out.

427
01:11:59,170 --> 01:12:17,150
And what do we have is P to the Y plus our the minus one, minus P plus and minus y minus one and greater of us y you want.

428
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:24,250
And what is that? That's just a beta, right?

429
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:29,290
That's just a beta PDA, which means base marginal.

430
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:41,350
This conditional distribution of P given Y follows a beta distribution which is parameter of Y greater plus and minus y.

431
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:47,290
That's actually a very surprising result,

432
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:56,050
which means the marginal distribution of here is better and the conditional distribution given Y is also better.

433
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:02,290
That's not always the case. If you change the distribution, it may be different.

434
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:08,770
But for this particular case, you do have the same distribution or the marginal distribution.

435
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:15,340
P And the condition of distribution. You gave out one and embedded Bayesian statistics.

436
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:26,470
We call this the conjugate family. Okay, so in practice, a Y is your data and the data that you collect P is a parameter of interest.

437
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:31,810
So the Marvel distribution or P is called the prior distribution.

438
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:41,620
If you impose this data prior, what we can find from this bear theorem is that a posterior distribution here is a posterior.

439
01:13:44,270 --> 01:13:53,510
Posterior distribution for this private LP interest given data is also in the same family, which greatly simplifies the calculation.

440
01:13:54,260 --> 01:14:03,230
All right. So that is to say, if you know your prior is better, you are a conditional distribution of theta given the parameter is binomial.

441
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:07,370
You do not need to calculate. Do not need to do any calculation.

442
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:12,320
You can directly write out the posterior distributions of the prime and all the interest

443
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:19,040
given data which greatly simplify our calculation and it can directly use this result.

444
01:14:19,310 --> 01:14:29,580
And that's called a conjugate family. So this beta binomial is a very famous conjugate family.

445
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:36,420
There are all the conjugate families which we will probably in our later courses.

446
01:14:36,690 --> 01:14:46,440
But this beta by now is just one of those most famous conjugate families because of its simplicity that is very commonly used in present statistics.

447
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:52,020
Because once you impose this distribution, you know, you do not have to do the calculation.

448
01:14:52,290 --> 01:14:59,640
You can theoretically take advantage of this, the relationships between the marginal and the conditional to write out the distribution.

449
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:07,460
All right. Any questions?

450
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:24,530
Okay. So let's move on to another topic, which is very important, a conditional expectation and a balance.

451
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:33,650
So far we have defined a distribution for two around variables and also the conditional distribution, marginal distribution, etc.

452
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:40,910
And we haven't talked about, you know, extending this notion of moment to this conditional aspects.

453
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:47,180
So now less formally define what is a conditional expectation and conditional parents.

454
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:54,660
But to write about was I sent away a conditional expectation of my game.

455
01:15:54,670 --> 01:16:05,710
An x is denoted as e y given x and that is defined using the conditional PDA of y.

456
01:16:05,950 --> 01:16:17,500
Given that given x is continuous for the the summation using this conditional PMA if it's discrete run available,

457
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:25,360
whether it's this continuous, we're talking about a y, y, given x.

458
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:33,370
All right. We do not really care about X in this case because conditional X axes, carlson axes fixed.

459
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:40,810
So whether it's continuous or discrete, we're talking about a one continuous case.

460
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:44,680
Here is a formula for calculating the conditional expectation.

461
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:51,490
It shows these formal play that just the standard calculation of expectation.

462
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:56,710
All right. We replaced the marginal PDA with the conditional PDA.

463
01:16:57,610 --> 01:17:04,600
Okay. Then solving this a Y times the conditional CDF of Y given x that defines the conditional expectation.

464
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:11,480
Similarly, we can use conditional distribution to define conditional variance.

465
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:16,580
Recall that we can define the second order moment,

466
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:22,430
conditional moment using in the same way indicating they are not capable of

467
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:31,550
doing infinitely y square like x y you y to define the second order moment.

468
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:46,820
And then with this two moments we can use. A relation of White Square and give an X minus E like of an x square to accompany the marriage.

469
01:17:47,150 --> 01:17:49,550
So that's one way to calculate the conditional Barras.

470
01:17:49,910 --> 01:18:02,150
Alternatively, we can follow that definition of marriage by writing all the various additional measures to be to taxation.

471
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:06,980
Oh. Y minus y given us.

472
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:22,230
All right. Now, the definition directly in a patient of a lie minus condition or expectation squared.

473
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:31,030
In a way, you got the same quantity. That's how we define conditional variances.

474
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:35,690
Again, very similar to the definition of expectation of errors.

475
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:39,630
The only difference is that we replaced the average place.

476
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:53,870
We replaced this marginal PDF or PMS by the conditional PDF or piano, and once we define it, there are very important results that we can leverage.

477
01:18:53,870 --> 01:19:01,130
On why a result is the relation between the conditional expectation and the marginal expectation.

478
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:06,860
By any power random, our house acts on a Y. We always have the following relation.

479
01:19:07,490 --> 01:19:14,450
That is, the marginal exportation of Y is always equal to the double expectations of Y given x.

480
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:24,320
So this is also known as the iterative utility expectation or expectation property.

481
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:35,630
Before we prove it. Let's pause for a second and take a look at what's on the right hand side and inside.

482
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:51,690
It's a conditional expectation. So this guy inside the internal condition, our expectation is a function of X, right?

483
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:58,730
This guy is just a function of X, some other function.

484
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:11,470
If you think about how this conditional expectation is calculated as they have, why it does not, right?

485
01:20:11,650 --> 01:20:23,720
Because why has been integrated out. The only thing that's allowed inside these conditional expectation is acts, because that is conditional.

486
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:28,910
So it's treated as a concept. So then it becomes a function of acts.

487
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:33,880
So then the outside expectation is taken with respect to acts.

488
01:20:35,190 --> 01:20:36,520
So that's how it's operated.

489
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:45,730
And again, inside is the conditional expectations like them and acts says that conditional expectation is calculated this way.

490
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:50,050
There is no y it. All the whys has been integrated out.

491
01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:56,560
The only parameter that is still locked is acts. So that is the function of X.

492
01:20:56,950 --> 01:21:00,340
And the outside instrumentation is taken with respect to acts.

493
01:21:01,310 --> 01:21:07,720
And is that clear? So that's how this two expectations are calculated.

494
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:16,120
Inside is account is the expectation with respect to Y and outside is an expectation with respect, with respect to acts.

495
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:24,280
Now let's look at how to prove that. It's.

496
01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:32,930
So the marginal expectation of why is, as we have seen before, for now,

497
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:38,210
for simplicity and let's just assume we are dealing with continuous functions, continuous random variables.

498
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:45,290
Okay. So the marginal expectation of Y is just the integration from nothing infinity.

499
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:51,300
Infinity Y times the marginal PMA, PDO or Y E1.

500
01:21:53,180 --> 01:22:05,060
And this marginal PDF can be derived from the integration of the time period and by integrating all x you again the marginal p one.

501
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:10,339
So then you can rewrite that as a double integration of y times.

502
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:16,820
The joint P, the x and y, you first integrate out y axis and then integrate out y.

503
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:20,810
All right. So that's what's on the left hand side.

504
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:25,130
Right. By using the definition of this expectation.

505
01:22:26,330 --> 01:22:34,060
And now we can do some transformation instead of writing the original aspects.

506
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:40,580
What we call what do we want is a conditional, conditional roundabout of Y given X.

507
01:22:40,910 --> 01:22:49,670
So we have to create a conditional distribution from this drawing distribution so that we can got closer to the right hand side.

508
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:59,030
All right. So from this joint distribution, we can use this relation to get the conditional distribution of Y given X.

509
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:04,340
And in addition, we have to multiply the marginal acts.

510
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:13,640
As a result, what we have is this quantity and now integration y times y given acts and aspects of x.

511
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:20,330
And from there you can say this term.

512
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:28,210
If you're integrated. If you're integrated with respect to why, that's exactly what do we what we need.

513
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:32,380
Right. If you first integrate this guy was a respected.

514
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:38,590
Why that exactly gave us the expectation of why if an X which is the inside.

515
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:49,590
And then it was locked into this apex, as I mentioned before, this expectation of why commit acts as a function of acts.

516
01:23:50,070 --> 01:24:02,000
So if you further write it out, that's going to be negative activation of expectation of why given acts, which is B which is the the right hand side.

517
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:18,150
So the the key to the proof is to notice late spectators unconditional expectation of why human acts is a function of acts.

518
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:26,460
That is really the case. Once you've noticed that is a function of key, then it can say the inner integration.

519
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:33,090
It just takes expectation, conditional expectation. And the outer integration is the expectation with respect to acts.

520
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:45,820
Notation of that function. With respect to acts. So that proves this equation is stable, integrated, stable expectation result.

521
01:24:47,770 --> 01:24:51,910
Again, this is a universal result or any pair of random variables and always holds,

522
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:56,610
no matter whether they're independent, unrelated, dependent, whatever.

523
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:00,430
They are always hot and heading to random arrivals.

524
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:09,460
You always have this marginal expectation equal to the established expectation and also you can switch the order.

525
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,630
That's the same, but switch the order at.

526
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:23,410
These as well. And again, this outside expectation is or is right with respect to what?

527
01:25:23,850 --> 01:25:33,630
Because inside it's a function of what. Any questions?

528
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:52,850
Okay. So let's take a look at an example and say why that's important and how we can use that to simplify the calculation.

529
01:25:53,600 --> 01:26:00,260
So suppose Z one, Z 2 to 0. We all have the same mean, which is how?

530
01:26:01,130 --> 01:26:12,020
And consider this component random variable as was defined az1 plus zeta all the way to z capital and our capital.

531
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:18,139
It is also a random variable. Then what we know is that of the conditional expectation of ask.

532
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:23,540
Given that is this and times out, why is that?

533
01:26:28,990 --> 01:26:39,340
Conditioned on expectations of this as given that when we talk about a has given this capital and becomes a

534
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:52,470
constant right to what has given us is just the expectation of Z one was all the way to the end given it.

535
01:26:54,320 --> 01:27:03,220
All right. Once you conditional and becomes a constant, it does not have any randomness in it.

536
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:10,090
So this is just the summation of X number of random variables.

537
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:14,740
And what do we know about the expectation? It's a linear operation.

538
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:26,110
So we can break down this summation to the expectation of az1, all the way to expectation of Z.

539
01:27:27,970 --> 01:27:31,500
All right. Because you conditional upon it,

540
01:27:31,720 --> 01:27:40,930
you condition our capital n so M becomes a constant only because of that you can break down this conditional expectation.

541
01:27:41,170 --> 01:27:47,920
So this summation of and marginal expectations and each one of them is them.

542
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:53,530
So in total we have capital N concept, right?

543
01:27:55,150 --> 01:28:02,480
We are clear about that. So notice that, as I mentioned before, this is a function of that.

544
01:28:04,670 --> 01:28:10,090
Right. It does not have a house in it, but it does have and it is a constant event.

545
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:24,290
Furthermore, we can calculate the marginal expectation of us by using this double expectation formula inside and we know its end times m outside.

546
01:28:24,710 --> 01:28:31,940
We have added another expectation is a concept so it can be taken outside of this patient.

547
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:38,060
So finally, the expectation of us is just a patient of this capital n times that.

548
01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:45,540
So that's how we can calculate the marginal expectation of using this expectation.

549
01:28:51,010 --> 01:28:54,870
So in practice they can be very handy, especially if you have to.

550
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:58,900
If you have to construct your random variable in this conditional way,

551
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:09,640
then you can easily evaluate the expectation of the marginal rate of viable interest using this type of expectation.

552
01:29:11,710 --> 01:29:17,830
For example, consider go back to the first example that we have.

553
01:29:18,370 --> 01:29:25,490
Talk about this, that. Time to relax, take sample.

554
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:36,350
So let me ask you a question. Or a randomly chosen patient, what is the expected time to relapse?

555
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:50,840
There's a question there. What is expected? Time to relax for a randomly chosen patient?

556
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:02,070
Yes. I think it's absurdity is infinity.

557
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:07,450
And why is that? Because the weight of infinity is going to like.

558
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:11,790
Overpower like any other. What about.

559
01:30:13,130 --> 01:30:21,830
Yes. That's a clever way of answering this question, but a formal way to show these facts and how they do it.

560
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:27,170
Well, think about we can use this double expectation. Right.

561
01:30:27,650 --> 01:30:33,260
So because of this random variable, why a time to relax is defining this conditional way.

562
01:30:33,590 --> 01:30:36,320
So if you want to calculate this expectation of life,

563
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:51,350
we can do occasional y given odds and specification over that I using this double expectation and inside given x.

564
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:59,970
I've actually on a zero. We know that's cured.

565
01:31:00,150 --> 01:31:06,210
So it's actually quite a zero. They say expectation of y is infinity.

566
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:16,290
And if ax is one, which means it's not cured, then the expectation of y is one over lambda.

567
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:20,910
And as I said, exponential distribution was from the lambda.

568
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:26,730
So that's one over lambda then I need to do is to calculate the expectation of this.

569
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:33,440
Two numbers, right? Four zero and ask for one.

570
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:44,570
Recall that the probability of passing on a zero is theta and the probability of AC for a one is one minus theta.

571
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:53,480
So formally, if you want to calculate it, it should be a summation of infinity times theta.

572
01:31:57,690 --> 01:32:02,400
And one over lambda and one minus theta.

573
01:32:03,450 --> 01:32:08,880
And since you have infinity, as Jonathan said, that's infinity.

574
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:13,770
Right. That's the formal way of calculating things about patient.

575
01:32:16,410 --> 01:32:23,770
Does that make sense? That's how we can use this double plantation to help you calculate the expectation of a random

576
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:30,070
variable which might be defined in the first place using this conditional distribution.

577
01:32:34,210 --> 01:32:38,710
You can also consider other this other examples.

578
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:44,470
Try to calculate the conditional expectation and say how to use that at.

579
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:49,840
All right. So that's four things about patients cholesterol expectation.

580
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:58,479
Now let's move on to the condition of veterans. We also have a very nice and easy way of calculating marginal barriers using this

581
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:03,680
condition idea that is the following relation or any parallel run of our beliefs.

582
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:13,630
In a Y weighting, we can calculate the marginal appearance of why using this two quantities.

583
01:33:17,230 --> 01:33:24,460
The first one is the expectation of the condition of error. And the second one is the variance of the conditional expectation.

584
01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:30,870
At first glance, it may seem a little bit complicated.

585
01:33:31,310 --> 01:33:38,300
But in fact, it can simplify your calculation quite a bit in many examples, which we'll see.

586
01:33:45,530 --> 01:33:50,989
We'll see in the in the couple of slides, the examples where they're actually solving the barriers,

587
01:33:50,990 --> 01:33:57,560
maybe invisible by using this formula, it becomes visible.

588
01:33:58,220 --> 01:34:01,459
And so, again, the formula is barriers.

589
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:09,080
Margin of error is equal to the expectation of conditional barriers plus the barriers of conditional expectation.

590
01:34:11,740 --> 01:34:20,230
Again before we prove that. Prove that. Consider what this is inside this expectation of variance.

591
01:34:21,730 --> 01:34:26,380
If you calculate the conditional variance of like human acts because it's they'll have y in it.

592
01:34:28,690 --> 01:34:34,690
That's not right. It's a function of X. This is the function of X.

593
01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:40,900
Similarly, the conditional expectation of Y given X does not have a limit.

594
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:45,520
It has acts in it does not have Y in it. That's a function of X.

595
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:51,220
So this outside expectation and outside variance is always a respect to X.

596
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:56,230
And that's how you kind of calculate it.

597
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:01,370
Now let's take a look at how to prove it.

598
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:14,870
On the left hand side and we have this margin of error. So first, let's write out what the margin of Paris is.

599
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:21,170
But that is why. Square minus UI square.

600
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:27,360
Okay. So we want to introduce this conditional notion.

601
01:35:28,770 --> 01:35:36,960
So one way to do that is use this double expectation result on the first term.

602
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:41,700
So as they say, exportation of a random variable Y square is also about a variable.

603
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:49,860
We can always write it in this way. Right.

604
01:35:52,150 --> 01:35:59,980
So there is no condition, but we can add a condition and use this expectation to cancel out that condition.

605
01:36:01,090 --> 01:36:05,140
So that is the direct usage of this expectation.

606
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:10,390
Similarly, for the second one, we can do the same trip. Or for now, that's just a Libyan as is.

607
01:36:16,830 --> 01:36:20,370
And. Now.

608
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:24,390
Let's take a look at this inside the hall.

609
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:30,690
What do we want? On the right hand side is first we want an expectation of some conditional balance.

610
01:36:32,130 --> 01:36:39,210
So now we have the expectation we need to create a conditional variance inside so that we have the first step.

611
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:44,400
So if we have a conditional variance of Y given X.

612
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:57,600
You need to have this guy. Your Honor, to fight this summation equal to the original one.

613
01:36:58,230 --> 01:37:14,370
And that is because conditional bearers of why given acts is equal to the application of Y squared minus the expectation of Y given x squared.

614
01:37:15,070 --> 01:37:21,900
And I using that we can convert the original expectation of y squared given to these two terms.

615
01:37:22,290 --> 01:37:30,210
Now we do have this conditional barrister. All right, so mission one is completed.

616
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:36,719
Now let's work on the second term. Notice that this expectation is a linear operator.

617
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:39,780
So that. Exactly. Give us the item one.

618
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:46,230
Okay. And if you take all of the other items out, this is what we have.

619
01:37:48,290 --> 01:37:55,910
Right? So this is what we know so far.

620
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:04,970
What remains is to try to prove the second part is equal to the variance of the conditional expectation.

621
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:19,550
So I gave you one minute trying to show that trying to show this guy is equal to the variance of the conditional expectation.

622
01:38:20,600 --> 01:40:02,650
And. Right.

623
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:07,190
If he got it. Let's have this together.

624
01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:19,460
So what do we want to God is the virus of conditional expectation.

625
01:40:19,820 --> 01:40:25,280
So in the first term, we do have this conditional expectation. But in the second, we haven't got it right.

626
01:40:25,850 --> 01:40:34,310
So that's the starting point. We can create this conditional expectation in the second term by again using this expectation.

627
01:40:35,210 --> 01:40:39,350
I mean this carry over very crude and.

628
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:54,760
We set our expectation on why we can write it as it's and why even acts and the application of that.

629
01:40:55,900 --> 01:41:03,880
Hey, I write it this way. All right. Now we do have this expectation, condition and expectation in both places.

630
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:13,600
And now recall that the conditional expectation of why given acts is a function of acts,

631
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:19,270
although it looks scary, but in fact, it's just a function of acts.

632
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:25,990
If you take the entire term and look at of what you have.

633
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:29,020
Right, you can just replace it by and I say that without it.

634
01:41:29,650 --> 01:41:39,310
So what you really have here A about health, which is a function of X, what you really have here is expectation about acts.

635
01:41:42,780 --> 01:41:49,400
Square. Minus the expectation of about acts.

636
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:56,260
Squared. Right.

637
01:41:56,750 --> 01:42:05,050
And what is that? What is the expectation of some random variable squared minus the expectation of a random variable squared?

638
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:14,320
That's the variance right now to exactly the barrens of Delta X.

639
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:19,390
So now we replace that as back to what it really is.

640
01:42:19,810 --> 01:42:27,450
That is a conditional expectation. And that is give us what do we want and give us?

641
01:42:46,990 --> 01:42:48,160
So that completes the proof.

642
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:57,790
We start from the margin of errors and end up with occasional conditional errors plus barriers of conditional expectation.

643
01:42:59,590 --> 01:43:07,240
Again, this is a flexible utility of this double expectation result.

644
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:18,420
I gave us this the variance result. The key here is to notice, no matter how complicated a farmer looks like nowadays,

645
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:22,600
what function that is either the conditional expectation or like of an ax.

646
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:28,420
It's just a function of X. There's not a mystery to it is just a function of X.

647
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:36,010
Once you notice that, it's just coming over to you wherever you need it.

648
01:43:36,430 --> 01:43:39,490
And so that complete the proof. Any questions?

649
01:43:43,710 --> 01:43:44,100
All right.

650
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:58,410
So with that, we can use the results to help us calculate the mean and barriers for this random variable defined from this conditional process.

651
01:43:59,550 --> 01:44:02,400
For example, in the compound on process,

652
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:14,870
recall that each individual run of our always optionally with me or in fact we don't necessarily have to 90 to be personally.

653
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:20,070
We can allow it to be any independent random variable with particular mere checking of errors.

654
01:44:20,330 --> 01:44:20,530
Okay,

655
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:32,870
so that's more excited and the end to be person distribution with parameter lambda time t then we know expect margin expectation of an Islamic team.

656
01:44:33,330 --> 01:44:42,360
Baron So it's also left the team. Now consider this newly constructed random variable x one plus x two all the way to x capital.

657
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:51,870
As we said before, this house is constructed using this conventional idea directly calculating the distribution,

658
01:44:52,080 --> 01:45:05,790
the mean the variance house is not easy, but notice that as given and is much easier to to conceive and much easier to to understand.

659
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:13,980
And the margin of error is also well known. So with this tool we can calculate the distribution of us and I'm over.

660
01:45:14,190 --> 01:45:18,990
If we're just interested in any patient embarrassment as we can use, what do we just do?

661
01:45:19,740 --> 01:45:30,900
What we just learned by example. The expectation as is the expectation of us given end and the expectation of that.

662
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:36,180
Right. And what is that? What is the expectation of us, given it?

663
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:49,570
Conditional and becomes a constant. So what is the expectation of us given a.

664
01:45:58,930 --> 01:46:03,330
Yes. So it's not the sum of the expectations.

665
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:09,330
It's not. So what is that? One is one half.

666
01:46:09,330 --> 01:46:13,310
So one. So each one has meaning.

667
01:46:14,690 --> 01:46:20,030
So if you sum them up, as am I, am I right?

668
01:46:20,410 --> 01:46:27,800
Are you good? So that is inside of this expectation and outside, as I said, this is the expectation with respect to.

669
01:46:28,510 --> 01:46:36,380
And so if you calculate that we know the expectation with respect to earn is alumna T so that's m lambda t.

670
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:41,880
So that you've got the margin expectation of us.

671
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:45,960
So now let's work on the various margin of error, as I've asked.

672
01:46:47,820 --> 01:46:54,240
So try to write it out using this formula that we introduced and see what we can get.

673
01:46:54,450 --> 01:47:09,840
Okay. Nice.

674
01:48:00,470 --> 01:48:07,760
All right. I hope you all got it. So the barons can be written as the sum of these two terms.

675
01:48:07,770 --> 01:48:12,260
What is the expectation of the condition of ours? One is about a condition of expectation.

676
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:16,670
So when you do the calculation, just be careful about what each term is.

677
01:48:17,090 --> 01:48:23,450
That's the only tricky part. Once you notice what each part is, is plug it in and do a calculation.

678
01:48:24,350 --> 01:48:29,120
So on the first part, we need to first calculate what is a conditional.

679
01:48:29,130 --> 01:48:34,460
Paris is a given. And again given that and becomes a concept.

680
01:48:34,790 --> 01:48:44,100
So the variance of the summation of any terms, especially the independent and just the sum of individual variance, right?

681
01:48:44,420 --> 01:48:47,760
If you don't recall that, make sure you go back to check out previous note.

682
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:53,120
When we talk about Barrons, we talk about if the rest of our goals are independent.

683
01:48:53,150 --> 01:49:00,860
The variance of the summation is equal to the summation of the amounts that give us and Times Sigma squared.

684
01:49:02,690 --> 01:49:10,669
And the second term we are we just calculated, which is I'm confident that you need to evaluate what is the expectation of this

685
01:49:10,670 --> 01:49:16,490
end times Sigma Square Sigma squared is a constant and is the organic variable,

686
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:20,720
so we can calculate the expectation that says sigma squared and solemnity.

687
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:25,970
Similarly for the second term is a constant and is around a variable.

688
01:49:26,030 --> 01:49:27,049
So Mary, by the way,

689
01:49:27,050 --> 01:49:38,600
the variance of that is just at square times laminated because Paul Barron's when I recall said you multiply to run a variable the bar is going to.

690
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:47,210
Take a square of that constant, multiply the balance of the right amount and give us the final result.

691
01:49:47,630 --> 01:49:53,390
The balance margin of error for us is just that sigma squared plus nine square times lambda.

692
01:49:55,450 --> 01:49:58,997
You say we don't need to know the distribution. I just knowing the.
