1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:09,690
Okay. Good morning, everyone. We are going to start our today's lecture about human reproduction.

2
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:19,080
Okay. Just to remind you this week, there is no homework for this class.

3
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:27,150
Then you will need to prepare for next Monday. Then let's start our today class about human reproduction.

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,689
As always, I am going to talk a little bit about that.

5
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:39,030
The genetics of human reproduction, maybe. So issues with that trend of timing of evolutionary human evolution.

6
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,430
And then in the second part, we will have we will have that discussion, as we always do.

7
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,480
Then I have to show this graph.

8
00:00:51,850 --> 00:01:03,899
Oh. Okay. This is why I believe you select this useful trait of being like history or

9
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:10,010
defeating a species that is dire need to allocate different energy resources,

10
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,910
time to maintain its growth and reproduction. We have discussed before our human species.

11
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,930
It seems to be more like the figure two that we have here.

12
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,710
We spend a lot of time on paintings.

13
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:33,990
We spend a lot of time on both in growth and also we are as being less time in reproduction as compared to other species.

14
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:44,520
Now, this figure assumes that the trade of our equal between sexes, like at trade off,

15
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,960
for example, among males is the same, for example, at that rate of females.

16
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:57,270
However, what do you think? Do you think that trade off are the same thinking that human species is thinking about evolution?

17
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,920
Do you think that trade off?

18
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:10,130
How about about the same between female and male and only think about current modern population to even think about our evolution.

19
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:24,310
Veronica I think personally, like in our species, at least, the females tend to take more.

20
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,290
Reproduction. Leg How long are gestation is a lifetime.

21
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,610
But we also do get a lot of help from our community.

22
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:39,400
So. There is bad blood and we can't go back in time and know like.

23
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,980
Exactly. No, no, that's completely right.

24
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:57,380
I think in the females in our species, I spend more time than they need to spend time in lactation gestation during the ninth month of pregnancy.

25
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,549
A woman can't can reproduce again. However,

26
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:10,040
in the for out for I mean that is not such a limitation then thinking that we can

27
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:18,169
think about a different trade off that in fact Darwin's thought about these people,

28
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:25,640
about the concept of sexual selection and sexual selection with the advantage with certain individuals

29
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:32,390
half of their overall that individuals of that same sex and species in respect of reproduction.

30
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:41,420
And then the idea of Darwin that there is a competition between members of the same species, also the same sex to reproduction for reproduction.

31
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:49,160
Then let me give you some examples. These are three different species of bird.

32
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,810
Would we observe different type of sexual selection?

33
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,510
To your left, you had a pick up. Um.

34
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,710
You know, what is the male here? The up shoes.

35
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:09,800
Hmm. Attracting people yet? The pickup. Well, here we have a male and a female.

36
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,140
Which one of them? Male. Who is a big fan?

37
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:26,180
Exactly. And this is the case where males are subject to an a stronger sexual selection in these individuals.

38
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:34,850
This graph below what we are observing, the average number of offspring per individual in pick ups,

39
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:41,090
but that red bar indicates the variability of number of offspring.

40
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:52,640
Then what we observe is that both females and males in the pickup, they have about the same number of offspring bear individual.

41
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,110
However we look, there are huge variability among males.

42
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,590
What that indicates that they are so males that they don't have any offspring at all.

43
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,030
And we have a few means that they have a huge number of offspring,

44
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:14,870
then that this is represented by this body in the number of not being very individual in this case per male.

45
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:23,060
As a consequence, because of this you you but ability the result is stronger selection for the mate for the males in that vehicle.

46
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:29,840
And what we observe either when that is the case that males they do not provide any

47
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,380
parental care at all or the parental care is given by that by the by the mother.

48
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:45,590
Another consequence of the strong sexual selection is that we observe the dimorphism between sexes.

49
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:53,960
We observe that this big difference in shape or size between the male and female,

50
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:59,300
because the male is going to use the difference just to attract females and to reproduce.

51
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:07,069
Okay. You know that if pieces of bird, for example, this said Sibert, you will see that again.

52
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:13,340
The mean of offspring for the individual is about the same and also the variability is about the same,

53
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:23,660
meaning that the reason why you're different or more middle falls between, for example, one male and either male or female on another female.

54
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,790
Then these separate sea birds in particular, they tend to be monogamous.

55
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:39,470
They raised their offspring together and therefore they a they provide parental care about the same amount of energy and resources.

56
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,990
Therefore, you see that the reason that these sex polymorphism males are female,

57
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:53,180
they they seem basically the same because there is not a strong sexual selection for any other sexes.

58
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:03,430
In the other extreme, we have these redneck falafel Arab country here.

59
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:08,250
You'll see that again, that it's a number of well-prepared individual.

60
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:18,240
But now that variability is higher among females, meaning that females in this species are going to compete for to compete for access to the males.

61
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,299
The males are usually the one to provide all the parental care in this in this case.

62
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:30,690
And you'll see again that sex polymorphism these see the female here, they are aggressive.

63
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,840
They are larger than males. And this see the male here?

64
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:39,000
What do you think it occurs in humans, or at least even during our species?

65
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:48,470
What do you. What do we should? Regarding the that for example, the the sexual dimorphism.

66
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,170
I was raised by my father. Mm hmm. Because he retired.

67
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,550
65. I was born after he's 65, so he.

68
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,670
He was with me every day. My mom still works.

69
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,940
Okay. Yeah. But by thinking about it in the past, during our evolution.

70
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,550
Oh, then this is not how the young man is doing the hunting, but they always.

71
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,920
You're not sure where they going to get that day.

72
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:24,970
So the woman never stay at home, had to raise the kids and make sure that the cubs, wherever the home animals are,

73
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,470
you know, they have to do both just in case the men come back with, no, we're nothing.

74
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,500
You know that that's true.

75
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:42,100
And what we observe based on the escalating cult remains is that in that in the past, there was sexual dimorphism in our ancestors,

76
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:47,590
that by looking the size of the body soluble, that old remains, however,

77
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:55,660
have declined over time the sexual dimorphism between males and females during our our evolution.

78
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:01,780
For example, comparing the US along with taking some variances that leave around 4 to 3 million years ago.

79
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:10,480
This is the average size of a female, 105 centimeters compared to, I mean, 151 centimeter.

80
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:16,450
Then then that is are I say a sex fragmentary form there.

81
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,970
But I've passed that time pass.

82
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:31,600
You see, for example, for Homo erectus that if I are 1,000,000.7 to less than a million years ago both sex and what about model is about the same

83
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:40,870
size and now in our perennial species that is still slightly more fizzles but is much less compared to our ancestors.

84
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:52,690
Why is that? Hmm? Why do you think any education here, sex officer refer to the differences or.

85
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,860
Or at least, let's say, for example, body side made some females.

86
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:07,990
Now how, how do you think her being uh, is the mating during our evolution?

87
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:21,010
Um, I think we have gone through that before to think of youth group and gradually that gene crossing and they're now both at home.

88
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:35,910
Uh, yeah, yeah. What I'm referring to. Do you think that the ring evolution where our family groups were more monogamous, polygamous, you know,

89
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:44,860
used to be polygamous, but you're about to touch on like, I think in the later, like the fourth, three year ago.

90
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,760
Mm hmm. They had more. Myriam Robin versus I think now it's become.

91
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:06,320
Yep. Exactly where we are. Because even knowing what society they are from, society that they are people who are polygamist.

92
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:12,740
But it seen during evolution the the most common type of family group was a monogamous.

93
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:22,130
So how many group. Now that implies that males contributed also to their to the raising of their own children.

94
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:28,610
Then even though there is sexual dimorphism but is wasn't have been decrease over time.

95
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:39,680
If we compare, for example, to two other primates right now, you'll see that the difference of sexual dimorphism in humans, about 1.15,

96
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:46,910
you see body size between May and some females that chimpanzees about 1.29

97
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,740
they see that bonobo obedience chimpanzee is another species of chimpanzees,

98
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,070
about 1.36. But for gorillas and orangutan,

99
00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:02,750
you'll see that a size of the male is more than twice the size of the female because there is a strong sexual selection for males there,

100
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,850
because only just a few males tend to are to have most of the offspring in a group.

101
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:18,470
Then they that will be something like this. They become acute by the by the ability of reproduction of males.

102
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:25,820
That is another case now in humans. And this is the reason why we observe these less sexual dimorphism.

103
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:34,250
Now, then, just consider some point now to that fall of mind when we discuss that that caused

104
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:40,100
all human human made reproductive Farmville are different compared to females,

105
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:48,680
even when males are contributing to the raising of their own children, but that the cost of revolution is lower.

106
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:56,270
For example, males do not expend becoming of metabolic energy toward reproduction,

107
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:07,370
yet the formation of of that may just be mutagenesis female has to invest more time energy menstruation, lactation gestation.

108
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:12,560
Not even though we have discussed the grandmother hypothesis,

109
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:19,820
the the hypothesis that the grandmother had to to raise their own grandkids by still all the

110
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:26,700
energy involved in these metabolic processes are much much higher compared to our male and.

111
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:42,730
Now in general, in mammals, not only in primates, but in mammals, that male reproductive success has been determined mostly by the access to females.

112
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:52,879
Of course, to understand the primates, for them to meet, he had to be the leader of the group.

113
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:59,930
So then when they do me the the difference this is great because they are the one will compete you know to meet.

114
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:07,879
But in London like us when we were in school together in the height in a lot of them beef is not really something

115
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:15,570
we look at maybe cognitively the matching and the people get married so then we become not so different.

116
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:23,090
Yes. Let me ask you this question. Let's get back to this energy allocation.

117
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:35,130
For let's say put out for what a prime and don't don't know humans let's say for example, a gorilla an orangutan.

118
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,570
What do you think is going to be more energy allocation here?

119
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:49,250
Maintenance and production. And a boat. Well, yeah, but we.

120
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,100
If we remember these feet, you hear about us extra dimorphism.

121
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,740
You'll see that gorillas, an orangutan, that mate is more than twice the size of the female.

122
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:07,160
That in this primates more big part that energy allocation is going to be our growth.

123
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,810
Exactly. Yeah. To get more body size. Now they're stealing humans.

124
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,260
We accept a differential of energy allocation.

125
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:22,020
Compare may some female body is not thought to be dramatic lacking for other primates.

126
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:41,570
Now. Then these are the general general idea to to keep in mind when discussing the report that he will rejoin human reproduction.

127
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:51,750
Now, what we know about the genetics of human reproduction, what we know about the genes that are involved in the human reproduction.

128
00:15:51,770 --> 00:16:02,980
Now, this is had a recent paper I think form for male puberty and they make of puberty.

129
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:12,920
I think this is they are using the the breaking with the boys when there are also other

130
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:20,180
measures of poverty for males in that it does according to this last study a little later on,

131
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,350
maybe 100 Zimbabweans associated with timing of poverty emails.

132
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:34,610
But what I found interesting is that these some of these barriers were associated with LGBT emails.

133
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,730
There is plenty of these figures here. This is the effect of poverty, this standard deviation.

134
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,690
And he said the effect on a charity, again in a standard deviation.

135
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,780
And you'll see that the gene or rather the snips.

136
00:16:49,310 --> 00:17:01,400
Remember this needs are gene variants that are associated with later puberty in males are associated with longer longevity.

137
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:09,710
Q Say that again. Are Zimbabweans associated with late puberty?

138
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:15,830
Emails were also associated with extended longevity emails.

139
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:27,950
Longer lifespan. The effect that they found is that each one year later, poverty was associated with about nine month longer life.

140
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,230
Now, we don't know exactly that the mechanisms involved,

141
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:42,020
but it seems added the desired genetic component that is added is common to timing of poverty and longevity in humans.

142
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,959
That doesn't make sense. Remember,

143
00:17:46,960 --> 00:18:02,350
our our discussion the last class about like history how the how the human like history has some unique characteristics compared to other primates

144
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:10,690
for example that delay your reproduction extend the longevity and maybe the are still getting the components of that is common to all these traits.

145
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:17,280
Question so far. Do you understand if you want to support the who are these people?

146
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,910
The question is study was done. You mean these parties? Yes.

147
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:28,770
Yes. This is the largest study dying in the UK and there is a big study called the UK Biobank.

148
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:35,130
They recruited, I think, more than half a million participants and they got to inform in the UK.

149
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,840
Then they are basically are a European subjects.

150
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,910
I was there. Mm hmm. Now, then we decide that.

151
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:53,549
Then the trade off in human males. Remember, any.

152
00:18:53,550 --> 00:19:09,030
Any like history has to allocate energy to reproduction to grow to maintain in that in in in males that is the amount of energy resources

153
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:18,270
is allocated to fertility spermatogenesis by is much less compare for example to that investment of energy in somatic tissues.

154
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:31,320
The growth of maintaining multiples. And wow, the hormones that they regulate in these are these somatic investment.

155
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:37,500
Is that also their own? I find this that I think this in combat this paper I don't know you read it.

156
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:53,440
But what this study shows is that in hunter gatherers and this that this, by the way, that they are content that is in Paraguay.

157
00:19:53,860 --> 00:20:06,250
So indigenous populations they found that the test of the two strong levels they remain constant over life in younger ages,

158
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:13,660
for example, in teenage years to young adult, the levels are much lower, for example, to the United States.

159
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:26,200
However, that is not. This decline of testosterone levels we observe in Western societies is more constant over time that contrary to what we observe,

160
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:33,370
for example, in the United States, that in younger ages we had this usually relative to zero, but we had this decrease over time.

161
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:37,970
What what do you think could be related? What does that result in?

162
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:46,390
Rather, all these are, let's say, the thinking that in Paraguay, hunter gatherers, what we see in this level are lower but remains constant.

163
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,240
So in the U.S., who did they look at? The general population.

164
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,279
These are data from the general population. So our lifestyle is not hunter gatherers.

165
00:20:54,280 --> 00:21:00,030
You're going to need more testosterone to maintain things like muscle mass and example to maintain the.

166
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:08,100
The tribe, the village and the environment. Over a longer period of time is just going to start the lower threshold to be maintained.

167
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:16,080
Mm hmm. Exactly. The differ that our basic lifestyle, diet, physical activity, availability of energy.

168
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:24,390
Question professor, isn't to Tesoro what cost the mill building?

169
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:28,829
Uh, I think it related bowlful.

170
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:36,360
There are some genetic factors related to, to to balding because it is hereditary, uh, through the male line.

171
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:46,650
Uh, but yes, I mean, it's not terribly symbolic because it's a lot of hormones, you understand, but mainly as this one.

172
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:56,520
Okay. I won't say the question differently. Mm hmm. Compared to all the lines right there, because that you had really good here.

173
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:06,570
Right there. So I just wondering the in this just cover with a lifestyle with steady output of the test, they don't have the kind of body.

174
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:15,210
Yes, because I think some of it is testosterone involved and also the genes related to that

175
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:20,370
illness that we're seeing because it's estrogen dominance and the receding hairline.

176
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,450
This one is mainly about the liver congestion. That's my study.

177
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:31,290
But I'm seeing my point is that the indigenous culture that people do, they have this kind of holding pattern,

178
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:36,500
like what I leave from my own experience, because when I work at Costa Rica, that would work with.

179
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:48,330
I think I told you about my master's thesis. We work with some indigenous population in Costa Rica where we see to the dislocation these communities.

180
00:22:52,720 --> 00:23:03,120
I don't know if you Alice, the the oldest person in the male the oldest person in that group in the community is called that shattering.

181
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:08,770
They wouldn't even look at a chief. Yeah, I think. Yeah, he was hairy.

182
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:13,570
I was in 70, late seventies when we visited.

183
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:21,440
That's my point. They post balding in.

184
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,390
Certain like it mainly in people like European descent.

185
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:35,560
Interesting. My father introduced me when he was 64 and he didn't have the hair problem, an accumulation of risk factors.

186
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:42,900
Something. If you're already had a nutrition and then you have the genetics or maybe you're eating something in your diet,

187
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:47,440
also like how quickly that would come out.

188
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:57,000
There's also like young guys who just like they have the gene had their ball, the receding hairline starts young like, I know healthy.

189
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:01,180
But in my state, the receding hairline has nothing to do with diet.

190
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:07,540
Yeah, I mean, I think there is the actor gene dominance and things for them that those men will eventually develop breasts.

191
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:18,370
To me, like I know that the receding hairline there go to consumption and that does end up in our water supply.

192
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,730
Do they ever, like filter out for. That's true.

193
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:30,610
Hmm. But I don't know. Anyone knows, because, like, if we're recycling that water, then we're like.

194
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:35,270
People are technically free, like. Hmm.

195
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:45,640
Yeah, I don't know. Okay. You just say that, like, I didn't even know about the plastic so easily.

196
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,230
I mean, with estrogen anyway. Okay, then.

197
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:58,810
But what I also want to show you, are you saying that in the same paper that even though this traditional population,

198
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:05,950
this indigenous population, hunter gatherers, they have this low level of testosterone and they remain closed over time.

199
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:18,070
But they are males, are they? They are still reproductive are in later than life even compared to ah let's say what's comparing to or to Canadians.

200
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:23,499
Wow. I don't know why Canadians. Okay.

201
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:33,790
These are these are the same hunter gatherer populations from different parts of the world is in one part of why you see the Amazonas,

202
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:38,200
Bolivia, Zambia. And these are more mother Canadians.

203
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,890
Okay. Let me explain you this graph that I read online.

204
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:49,900
This is some measure of reproductive capacity in women, in these populations, in these populations.

205
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:59,680
And the blue line represent the reproductive life in men, in the same population.

206
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,550
Then what we also have in general is that bless you.

207
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:14,650
That among each group that is achieved to the right or that may lie compared to that to the to the women that say population.

208
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:21,400
I still you see the Ali for example in in this group and this is quite impressive.

209
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:29,590
In Gambia, a major part of the reproduction for male course afters or other is De La No after.

210
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:39,730
Or what I want to say is the proportion of reproductive males in the population are people older than 60?

211
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:46,270
Now in more societies you'll see that they resisted, but they don't achieve to the right of their men, to women.

212
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:55,570
The doesn't mean again, it doesn't mean that in our society they are made that have changed in 60 or more than 70.

213
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:02,690
What example? But the lines are more similar between both sexes because again, most societies seem to be a more monogamous.

214
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,810
Therefore, the complement of production between men and women.

215
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:14,530
But this this graph, you have to tell you again that even though in these indigenous populations,

216
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:24,610
it still strongly males are low, but the capacity of men remains even the life low and less alone.

217
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,040
Exactly. We don't have these these huge high low. Don't the huge changes.

218
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:34,360
Okay. What we know about women, because we have been talking about men.

219
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:41,620
Let me see how they think now. I think we are going to discuss something about this in the second part, how the timing of menarche.

220
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:51,429
I say so over time. Just to give you a briefing for looking right now based on this critical remains.

221
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:56,350
And again, we need to take care in the interpretation of these data.

222
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,710
But if feel that Alice,

223
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:13,180
during the time of the advent of agriculture 10000 to 1000 years ago in the past is some menarche less an average of maybe ten years.

224
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:18,820
It started to increase a little bit.

225
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:26,140
And then these 5000 years, more or less, the event of, let's say,

226
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:36,730
civilization writing that is now based on historical records and increases to menarche.

227
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:42,850
But in the last two centuries or maybe a century and a half, that it has been a decrease in the age of menarche.

228
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,920
Now we are going to discuss why that could be the case, what are the implications of that?

229
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:59,080
And this is also more recent data. This is from Europe and from the U.S. based on registry data.

230
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:11,710
And again, we observe a decrease in the age of menarche in that baby last two centuries in Western Europe and the United States.

231
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:17,380
But is in that there are some areas that may be in the last 30, 40 or 50 years,

232
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:22,210
there have been high level of or the decrease that you see in this part.

233
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:27,520
Then there you see that we have actually a decrease in the last two centuries.

234
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:33,790
But in the last maybe 40, 50, there have been rather higher plateau.

235
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:39,100
Where went to this? What are the implications of these?

236
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:48,580
What are the evolutionary reason for what we are observing right now regarding genes in Asia, menarche?

237
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,910
Now they are certain genes that they are rare.

238
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:57,290
And I can remember when I say rare, I referred that they are very low frequency in the population,

239
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:01,600
yet in frequency very, very low, maybe just one 1000.

240
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:13,480
But they are a certain mutation. They are they have a very strong effect of puberty in women, for example, a mutation in the gene.

241
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:19,420
They are associated with a delay of more than one year on poverty.

242
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:25,150
You can see already minute now they are older Mendelian disorders.

243
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:37,630
Again, they are rare with a very strong effect. Some of them even they are associated with a very late menarche or absence of puberty.

244
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:45,770
And there are other genes that they are common in that population that is are more or less related to the normal by.

245
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:54,050
You can have menarche in human populations. And I think right now the last is daddy was that was down.

246
00:30:54,380 --> 00:31:00,320
They have far more than 200 genes associated with variation, normal variation.

247
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,550
You mentioned menarche.

248
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:12,680
Now, again, a big limitation on these studies because they are done modeling Europe or or white participant here in the United States.

249
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:19,610
They are less data, for example, in Hispanics, African-Americans.

250
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:24,440
Most of these data came from our European ancestry populations.

251
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:35,960
Now, some of the effects. These are some of the genes and what are the effect of menarche?

252
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:43,700
You see, for example, they are from the effect that they have a three month delay in menarche or just weeks.

253
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:52,710
They are. So, for example, this one, they are very rare that they not only face up to more than one year, do they don't menarche.

254
00:31:53,130 --> 00:32:02,310
Then there is a whole range. Do you think that we can make sure that if we go three weeks next.

255
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,250
I mean, I think we should do. Yeah.

256
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:18,460
Yeah. This a study done with huge, huge sample sizes, 100,000 or more participants.

257
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:23,560
Then because the data are there, they are able to identify these various effects.

258
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:32,590
Now they can identify effects. He does one week effect. So they do a recall on when they had this.

259
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:38,980
I mean. Yes, and many of these are still hard done by self-reported.

260
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:45,400
But I don't remember when I went through the script.

261
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,570
I don't remember exactly that. How how can they go? So details.

262
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:58,120
Yeah, that's that's one limitation I think more of while the more recent studies have been done with younger women.

263
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:03,520
That's right. After menarche, then they are more able to recall the model and the exact year that they had.

264
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:09,190
But yeah, because at the beginning there were many a study done with, um, adult women.

265
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,700
Uh, yeah. Then they did this problem of recall.

266
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:22,450
Now what is interesting is that the genes associated with HIV and Aki also seem to be associated with other traits.

267
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,300
Let me spend your this graph, this table. This is what we call genetic correlations.

268
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:37,510
What we measure is how genes related to what trait correlate with another trait.

269
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:45,370
Then in this case is menarche with all these traits than, for example, for body mass index.

270
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:52,839
You'll see that there is a negative correlation. Okay, you see that P-value that is highly significant, not a negative correlation.

271
00:33:52,840 --> 00:34:06,460
What means here, anyone can then try to explain what a negative correlation means between body mass index is coming up in is when the beer is lower,

272
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:16,210
it's opposite direction. Yep, exactly. Genes that are associated with menarche and associated with lower body mass index.

273
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,240
I will tell you also for obesity,

274
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:34,120
for several traits related to body weight body high even before height is positive genes associated with uh with higher with pollen.

275
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:43,450
I associate also with late poverty puberty. Also there are negative correlation with risk of type two diabetes.

276
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:56,470
Interesting genes associated with late menarche are associated with lower risk of type two diabetes and all the above to height.

277
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:02,380
So these people have a later puberty, but eventually they did catch up on the height.

278
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:10,510
Yeah, these are correlation. Let me explain you how they they do these they they collect information about menarche

279
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:16,360
and then they do the analysis of genes and also they collect information on height.

280
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:21,040
It is not that they are not that person except overall.

281
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:30,840
Now regarding menopause, there are several things identified with timing of menopause.

282
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:34,490
There are some genes, again, that are rare.

283
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,930
Very low frequency that they are associated with very early menopause.

284
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:45,080
For example, by advancing the gene are associated with minimal between 40 and 45 years old.

285
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:52,310
They are premature early menopause. They are all all sorts of Mendelian disorders.

286
00:35:52,520 --> 00:36:01,250
Some of them associated with premature ovarian insufficiency is menopause before age 40 and older,

287
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:09,050
through the genes that are called warming, the populations that are related to the normal variation of menopause.

288
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:16,140
Now, what other what are the relationships between menopause or menarche now?

289
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:22,490
Okay. First, these are some of the effects of Gene, some menopause.

290
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:28,340
You'll see again, they are some effect. They are in the range of month, but they are strong.

291
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,579
For example, I think. Which one? Okay.

292
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,320
This one that M.S. and eight.

293
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:46,970
The the effect is almost when you will delay menopause is what will supplement variant by combining more than 5% frequency in the population.

294
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:58,580
Now what is interesting is that it so that genes that have been found associated with menarche also have been associated with menopause.

295
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,850
Now, this is confusing because then we can see, okay, if they are modulators,

296
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:09,230
indeed we should observe certain correlation between menopausal menarche.

297
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:14,930
But if that is not the case. This was a huge study.

298
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:20,630
Again, this is done that was done in Norway, more than 300,000 women.

299
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,050
And what we have here is Asia menarche.

300
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:44,420
And here we had the mean Asia menopause. The in general we see the we have men of key died years or younger Asian menopause if 50 or more 51 years.

301
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:54,260
But for women that had the men of menarche are 17 or older is about the same was true then

302
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:02,150
they found a significant relation nonlinear significant interact in their relationship.

303
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,540
But the effect is very, very, very weak. Hmm.

304
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:18,110
Then what that means is that if someone has a menarche early age, that doesn't imply is going to affect young menopause at younger ages.

305
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:26,060
There is not this clear correlation between may not be menopause, menarche, menopause.

306
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:33,950
Even though they are doing that, seem to be emboldened to to to moderate.

307
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:39,400
Now, what do you think in that case and in hypothesis an idea? Why do you think menarche.

308
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,010
Asia. Minor menopause.

309
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:55,940
They are not correlated or always very weak correlation weak even if present though the girls from the tropical who a little tropical tropics we had

310
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:06,610
the period that early really early like ten before ten around ten years old and then but then they told us that we had the early we'll finish early.

311
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:10,410
This is because of the other moms in the village.

312
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,440
They they were 65 that they had a baby at 60 years old.

313
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:22,509
So I don't know what my mom was telling me because it didn't me like a survivor bias.

314
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:28,930
Maybe because I heard that children earlier puberty or at risk.

315
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:35,080
You strikes like all these other. Hmm.

316
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:44,550
So they could possibly. Yeah, that could be a reason, you know, I don't know if they control for that in this time,

317
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:50,890
but yeah, that could be a reason that a very minor key could be related to early death.

318
00:39:51,370 --> 00:40:03,330
And then we are now also I mean, these are the issues that would be the case now if into one and another idea that

319
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:08,530
you see that is just a mini essay you have once you're finished releasing them,

320
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:13,000
you're done. Yes. Anything. All right.

321
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,370
Let let me let me show you these figures.

322
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:31,270
Because, remember, the the number are of all sites are established during the youth of life, even before birth.

323
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:42,340
And then after that, the number of viable all sides is decreasing over time until they reach a point that they are they are no more viable.

324
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,800
And then with that, it's a menopause.

325
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:58,420
Now what you're seeing is a big determinant of the rate of depression with this whole cycle viability, because that I mean,

326
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:10,690
that Asian menopause would be ending in part, uh, be affected by how fast the depression is happening.

327
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:15,970
QUESTION Any idea? Idea when people finish?

328
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:23,879
No. So basically that we do have a certain amount of like predefined.

329
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:29,690
However, this lobe is affected by how vibrant the house of that woman.

330
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:34,169
I noticed some of the people will be able to have kids even later.

331
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:45,330
Like I had my a 39 year old because and I had no menopause syndrome or anything because we are healthier so they can slope down a little less sloping,

332
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:51,090
but those people will still have left or a leg eggs, but because they are not so healthy.

333
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:56,160
So the hormones of other plays, vessels just being finished and I don't know what happened to the extra eggs,

334
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:02,520
but people had a tooth that the abstract extra is still being absorbed, the body to take it apart.

335
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,900
So I think there isn't time. Mm hmm. Even you have extra eggs?

336
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,100
Yeah. And you just get absorbed. Yeah, because they are going.

337
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:16,719
They are getting less of it by then. And in fact, they are they are going through apoptosis.

338
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:22,260
They said you are dead now your and you are right in the the affect of the environment.

339
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,169
Because what we know based on, again,

340
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:38,310
in genetic studies is that many of the genes involved in this attrition of eggs are related to our biology weight of DNA repair.

341
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:46,050
I remember our DNA, it being affected by the environment, toxins, UV light, even what we eat.

342
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:57,840
Then that same biological pathway that related to this mechanism of rebirth of DNA are related also to timing of menopause.

343
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:01,260
Meaning then you can think about here in two ways.

344
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:12,420
If we somehow reduce the exposure of these carcinogens or toxins, then we can somehow delay menopause.

345
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:23,820
Or if we somehow can manipulate the genes involved in the DNA repair mechanism, then also we can delay menopause.

346
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:37,049
Now, way we want to do that and this is a huge discussion whether these are work we want to a society to ah to intervene.

347
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:43,620
Yes. To delay menopause. Of course we went to intervene, to react, to decrease toxin in the environment.

348
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:51,030
But society with it. There is a reason why we would like to extend menopause.

349
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:55,530
Really? Hmm. Really?

350
00:43:55,830 --> 00:44:00,060
I mean, that. What I'm saying is if we want to do that. Who wants to do it?

351
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:05,050
Mm hmm. Who wants to do that? Like, how often do you have to be in school?

352
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,890
They'll delay it by ten. That's true.

353
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:22,320
That's true. That wouldn't be a reason. And another reason also will be because even less I'd rather we have song.

354
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:30,790
Because what can imagine the case that we have? Because we had genetic variation related to this DNA repair pathway.

355
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:35,530
Maybe there are some women that they are somebody Asian.

356
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:41,700
They are more susceptible to environmental toxicants and therefore they can have a very early menopause.

357
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:49,690
Then that will be the case that maybe we can intervene too, because also early menopause is associated with other health outcomes.

358
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:53,950
Professor, there's a lot of women on the hormone therapy,

359
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:58,960
replacement therapy because the early termination and they were the ones who had a little problem.

360
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,080
Start with hormone replacement.

361
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:08,170
Yes, I think that now I think it's not recommended for the gender now because cancer.

362
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:19,260
Yeah. Because these are easy. Exactly. The secretaries of all of cancer are also has to be very careful and ethical.

363
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:27,489
So how do they do this? Not because here we are talking about genes that they are genes involved in.

364
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:31,389
There are repair the DNA. The molecule DNA would do this.

365
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:40,360
We don't know keeping standard because people when they have when it comes time to have menopause, everything is kind of closing down and everything.

366
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:44,950
So people get dry skin or that hair get less of an issue.

367
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:49,090
So if you can stretch yourself, people remain younger, longer.

368
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,640
That's true. That's why we want to do that. Yes, exactly.

369
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:58,870
To do that. Or we can. Or we want to intervene only for setting.

370
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:03,840
Let's say we have a baby girl in menopause. You know, maybe some problem with these mechanisms.

371
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:11,499
Yeah. Now, also, what I want to show you here is that there are other pathways I don't know your in your classes about obesity.

372
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:17,170
You and you talk about that talk about the way they related to energy signaling.

373
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:23,920
Then also you see here, they all together make up their pathway related to energy sensing, related to age menopause.

374
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:30,400
But it seems the major determinant, at least from the genetic point of view, are these DNA repair pathways.

375
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:41,429
Now, although they are deemed to have been associated with Asia knowingly menarche,

376
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:48,120
its menopause, but also with other conditions for their reproductive traits.

377
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:56,870
They are some that have been associated, for example, with ovarian cancer risk variations in these genes or even with time upon sexual.

378
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:09,380
Because you can make sure they are similarly styled in that you recruit couples and you ask them whether they are trying to have kids.

379
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:12,600
Then you can you can make sure that time when they get started to try.

380
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:18,129
And I suppose if one pregnancy then if there are genes related to that,

381
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:26,130
go through to the time of pregnancy, although I think there are many also mental factors related to that,

382
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:39,150
then what you're going to hear is that many of these genes associated with menopause also are associated with older traits, including cancer.

383
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:44,010
Number of kids don't book brain of pregnancy, etc.

384
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:56,790
Now, in this paper that was in campus, The Lancet 2017 this is is trying to explain again on this is comparing in the same way that we

385
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:03,389
show the dataset on levels in hunter gatherers and with their societies here they are comparing

386
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:10,680
the the I think these are progesterone levels in us women compared for example again these

387
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:17,610
are hunter gatherers in Bolivia or again we observe much higher levels in Western societies,

388
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:27,930
again related maybe to energy supplies, lifestyles, etc. and they are at the end of the issue.

389
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:35,720
But maybe we can discuss in the second part because we can see that maybe during our evolution.

390
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:41,610
Yeah, well there are, there are even if there is a starvation.

391
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:49,170
But the liability of energy was low compared to Western societies now.

392
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:59,699
That will be then lead to scripting rapidly physiology with low concentration undesirable

393
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:04,590
performance that are going to be associated with reduced breast cancer risk,

394
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:08,790
but also with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.

395
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:16,439
Now, the replicative part, partners, even that we observe now in hunter gatherer societies,

396
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:23,070
we have to decide pretty a long period of breastfeeding that are associated with reduced risk of breast cancer,

397
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,030
but again, are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

398
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:40,620
Now, I want to order to make our point here, because the relationship between parity and breast cancer is, you know, such clear.

399
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:54,780
What what is totally free? Well, we know now, even after maybe 2 to 3 years after believe there is an increase of breast cancer risk.

400
00:49:55,180 --> 00:50:01,780
Hmm. During that period of time that know that woman using higher risk of breast cancer.

401
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:06,120
However, there is a decrease after that time.

402
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:14,310
Then in longer terms, the effect of parity on breast cancer to reduce their risk in the long term.

403
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:22,290
Now, however, is now the reproductive pattern is low parity.

404
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:34,620
Also that delay or revolution due to our our society that now the revolution start late then

405
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:40,439
we are going to have an overall effect by increased risk of breast cancer compared to,

406
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:49,469
let's say, more traditional societies. Or that will be the hypothesis for this paper that now that and really we don't know

407
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:53,910
that I think we don't have evidence about well what that you see in breast cancer,

408
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:55,390
figuring out what you will lose from.

409
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:08,520
I remember I read a couple of papers on pioneer go down it in that some of that gene associated with higher risk of breast cancer also where there

410
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:17,520
was or maybe is will not to drive selection but I think in diaries and it was inconclusive but at least that is the hypothesis that in the past,

411
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:19,050
due to the reproductive patterns,

412
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:29,790
risk of breast cancer was low compared to other societies in risk of cardiovascular disease, rather was high questions.

413
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:39,719
I just saw that the progesterone was found in the water through the wastewater process.

414
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:46,350
Still is telephoning that where they were drinking. I have found that people work at the wastewater management.

415
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:51,050
Hmm. What is wrong? Graduated from you have been and helped to Lansing.

416
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:55,680
Mm hmm. The water for drinking. Okay. Any questions?

417
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,150
Comments. Okay, then let's take.

418
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:07,020
I have 1050. 510. Let's take 5 minutes and get back to 11 to continue with that discussion.

419
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:12,960
And. You know, public health cafes and.

420
00:52:15,638 --> 00:52:19,338
Are you presenting this? Okay.

421
00:52:19,348 --> 00:52:25,648
We are going to continue with the second part or two. They lecture on human reproduction then because it goes.

422
00:52:30,658 --> 00:52:33,748
Do you want me to play, like? Sure. Or just leave it like this?

423
00:52:34,048 --> 00:52:38,848
No, you when you can put it. You chose this one.

424
00:52:40,898 --> 00:52:49,718
Yeah. Mm hmm. So I am focusing on human reproduction and health as an evolutionary perspective.

425
00:52:50,138 --> 00:52:55,988
So some of the things I want to talk about, either life is three being pretty an evolutionary tradeoff.

426
00:52:57,548 --> 00:53:05,278
So looking over the guide, the first question that we were asked to touch on was like, explain the tradeoff of human life history.

427
00:53:05,288 --> 00:53:12,568
So, um, from some of the articles, what do you guys think are some of the tradeoffs of human life story or.

428
00:53:23,238 --> 00:53:29,067
You're going. Or rephrase that question,

429
00:53:29,068 --> 00:53:40,137
what would it be that we circumstances are that say our life history will delay our revolution or will either be simple stances,

430
00:53:40,138 --> 00:53:47,338
rather we'll get earlier our revolution.

431
00:53:51,348 --> 00:54:02,568
Yes. You got it. Do you remember life history? Then why would that feature or literally die when we are ready to reproduce?

432
00:54:03,558 --> 00:54:07,537
Then other we circumstances would be our life history.

433
00:54:07,538 --> 00:54:11,428
It would be rather alien to pollution or relate reproduction.

434
00:54:14,068 --> 00:54:20,727
Most of my friends when I push these and then and then they had one or two visit

435
00:54:20,728 --> 00:54:24,538
because they run on time while all the other ones who didn't go were just dizzy.

436
00:54:24,778 --> 00:54:27,838
They had so many kids back home. Right? Yolanda same thing.

437
00:54:28,228 --> 00:54:35,028
Yeah. Every couple of hours after our visit, our ancestors passed.

438
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:41,508
They didn't have, like, famine and.

439
00:54:44,568 --> 00:54:54,068
That that's true. And then if there is not true, they are going to delay or delay.

440
00:54:54,258 --> 00:55:09,748
I guess you could argue from like an epidemiological. So this is the olden times for birth control, the way polio in their heads.

441
00:55:10,238 --> 00:55:15,218
Okay. Now, I love to do both of these exercises.

442
00:55:15,728 --> 00:55:20,518
I think, like the body can't. Like it doesn't have the energy to start.

443
00:55:21,468 --> 00:55:26,298
So then it's just the way it is. Yeah, exactly.

444
00:55:26,488 --> 00:55:30,197
I mean I think what example. I mean but and give resources.

445
00:55:30,198 --> 00:55:37,668
But I think being in the historical past it was also artificial metaphor requiem for.

446
00:55:39,058 --> 00:55:43,188
I'll take your word for it.

447
00:55:43,668 --> 00:55:48,238
Some of the things mentioned, like we mentioned, the growth, maintenance and reproduction of China.

448
00:55:48,258 --> 00:55:50,898
But a lot of the things that you guys mentioned would like the energies,

449
00:55:50,898 --> 00:55:58,758
the reproduction has an additional level of energy that's needed or like nutrients in overall the energy available.

450
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:02,628
Energy availability is a key source of like variational varying functions.

451
00:56:02,638 --> 00:56:14,718
So if it's if there's low energy or low, low nutritional intake energy, that is going to be low and it's going to have an impact on reproduction.

452
00:56:15,468 --> 00:56:24,828
Also, this is more recent, like in low income countries like high parity is associated associated with like increased mortality.

453
00:56:24,828 --> 00:56:28,278
So it kind of decreases the chances of having like reproduction.

454
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:33,318
And then this would also increase production of pro-inflammatory.

455
00:56:36,878 --> 00:56:44,287
Carotenoids insulin resistance, increased production of triglycerides and cholesterol also increased in like oxidative stress.

456
00:56:44,288 --> 00:56:49,598
So that can contribute to low reproduction or just overall reproduction.

457
00:56:52,768 --> 00:56:59,458
So the next thing we want to focus on with explaining the possible reasons why the age of monarchy increase in the last 20,000 years,

458
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:10,948
the other pieces decreased. In the last 200 years, though, we focused on this graph that was in the endocrine endocrinology and metabolism.

459
00:57:11,308 --> 00:57:14,358
Metabolic metabolism.

460
00:57:14,428 --> 00:57:21,688
Yes. So this this graph is highlighting the relationship between like they'll likely eight rings of menarche,

461
00:57:21,898 --> 00:57:27,328
which is the green, and then the achievement of psychological maturity, which is the pink.

462
00:57:27,628 --> 00:57:35,098
So it's also highlighting the fact that by 2000 years ago it was different and versus like two years ago.

463
00:57:35,188 --> 00:57:41,338
So it's decreased over the years and just kind of like why that might be the reason.

464
00:57:41,608 --> 00:57:47,028
So what might be some of the reasons why you think that that decrease happened between a type?

465
00:57:50,838 --> 00:58:04,578
Any Commonwealth, including the last 20,000 youth up to that time the industry what we think there was rather than increase in the

466
00:58:04,578 --> 00:58:16,008
age I mean meaning that millennial reproduction I mean any idea what publications and work and education are not.

467
00:58:16,038 --> 00:58:20,658
I was thinking the same starting in 20,000 using the past, let's say.

468
00:58:20,658 --> 00:58:26,528
You know that makes sense. I'm talking about that about the first part of that is alive.

469
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:37,238
Why the exactly the reason let's say the start of the agricultural, uh, there was these delay revolution.

470
00:58:37,248 --> 00:58:40,368
But the age, I mean actually was getting dated, dominated that data.

471
00:58:40,698 --> 00:58:46,818
I think that people, once they have possessions, they have animals, they have land, they don't wanna be more stuff.

472
00:58:46,818 --> 00:58:55,028
They're still working on building up to that. Uh, yeah, but the main key, I mean that.

473
00:58:55,248 --> 00:58:58,637
Oh yeah, naturally. No, no, no, no, no.

474
00:58:58,638 --> 00:59:04,158
When they this they decide to do it by right. Because that is I mean I see.

475
00:59:04,998 --> 00:59:11,358
No way. No, no, I mean, I don't I don't know that I'm going to be able to string together all of my thoughts.

476
00:59:12,858 --> 00:59:24,948
So I, I feel like it kind of aligns with being more like having more instability and instability then your kids are less likely to die young,

477
00:59:24,948 --> 00:59:32,238
so you need to have less of them as well. You don't need as long in your life to like how does that make sense?

478
00:59:32,238 --> 00:59:39,227
And so like, you know, you can just like start them out at like 15 like you can like delay that and so then you're going

479
00:59:39,228 --> 00:59:44,968
to be healthier and like the child will be healthier and then you'll be able to give more.

480
00:59:46,108 --> 00:59:49,348
For Israel. It is an establishment plan.

481
00:59:50,638 --> 01:00:03,028
Yes, but that was the. Yeah. I think it is better to wait to introduce China than any other common.

482
01:00:05,928 --> 01:00:12,138
So some of the things that were mentioned were just like the fundamental issues, like modern societies are like waiting.

483
01:00:12,138 --> 01:00:18,768
So their social structures that were later developed like had expectations for like longer childhood education and training.

484
01:00:19,178 --> 01:00:23,538
I'm sorry it cut off on the side. And later, reproductive competencies.

485
01:00:23,628 --> 01:00:28,488
So that mismatch created like a fundamental pressure that like contemporary, like adolescents.

486
01:00:28,488 --> 01:00:37,518
So they didn't need to like kind of reproduce for that social structure, that modern society structure, kind of like limited that need to reproduce.

487
01:00:38,538 --> 01:00:42,018
Yeah. Also I think in part was that. That's right.

488
01:00:43,788 --> 01:00:46,848
Because remember that we had these calls down.

489
01:00:50,158 --> 01:01:02,098
When when humans start to settle animals or batteries, that wrinkle plummets even if there wasn't all these huge famines.

490
01:01:03,688 --> 01:01:13,138
But the what we have found, based on most critical remains is the nutritional status.

491
01:01:14,908 --> 01:01:24,568
What's worse for agricultural societies that for hunter gatherers, and because there was a transition,

492
01:01:27,238 --> 01:01:32,108
they didn't have the technology that we have right now to raise our crops.

493
01:01:32,128 --> 01:01:41,488
So they are they have that nutritional is that even though societies even after the quarter wasn't as good as we have it right now,

494
01:01:42,778 --> 01:01:54,417
also they want that huge range of occupations. Then we find out that delay or menarche was due to a poor individual status in the body.

495
01:01:54,418 --> 01:02:01,198
Wasn't great then obviously related to developmental plasticity that we discussed then there

496
01:02:01,228 --> 01:02:04,437
were these energy sensing mechanism because these are not that bear fruit that they say,

497
01:02:04,438 --> 01:02:06,718
okay, now I'm going to they may not if not tough enough.

498
01:02:07,228 --> 01:02:14,958
You'd rather that body have this tendency mechanism to delay until there is a better moment, something that makes us think that.

499
01:02:15,778 --> 01:02:20,488
So basically the body had to delay due to like things like infectious diseases.

500
01:02:20,698 --> 01:02:24,658
So the body kind of delayed it naturally, but.

501
01:02:26,898 --> 01:02:31,398
I'm moving on to the next one. So the touching on the evolutionary perspective,

502
01:02:31,398 --> 01:02:36,898
so the different effect of prenatal and postnatal nutritional statuses on the age of menarche for this

503
01:02:36,898 --> 01:02:41,838
section was really interesting to me just because it broke down into like I never thought about that.

504
01:02:41,988 --> 01:02:46,398
You had this in your daddy. You see that same paper?

505
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:52,548
No, I didn't know. Maybe that's part of that.

506
01:02:52,788 --> 01:02:57,108
Maybe even we can discuss that for you. This was the one for this one?

507
01:02:57,288 --> 01:03:04,098
Yeah, I don't have that one. But do you buy new papers there?

508
01:03:06,108 --> 01:03:08,508
Or maybe I don't know if I have it in mind.

509
01:03:15,058 --> 01:03:30,568
I think that mistake where there is one that is in government that for you one that we had the effect of psychological status and also,

510
01:03:31,018 --> 01:03:37,468
let's say fetal position is not useful. I mean, I can put yeah.

511
01:03:37,468 --> 01:03:42,088
Maybe you can download that baby better. Yeah. Oh, I see that.

512
01:03:44,618 --> 01:03:52,898
Because that's the very thing that the if that if think if I go to trial it started with it is pre-natal post-natal.

513
01:04:05,118 --> 01:04:08,718
I wouldn't just send it to myself. Yeah.

514
01:04:08,868 --> 01:04:13,578
All right. I think we're going in your PowerPoint.

515
01:04:13,908 --> 01:04:17,338
Yeah. Maybe this is in the downloads.

516
01:04:17,388 --> 01:04:23,528
I think. Wait and download.

517
01:04:23,588 --> 01:04:30,538
Yes. In the folders. This one?

518
01:04:30,918 --> 01:04:34,468
Yeah. No, not the one that say November 21st.

519
01:04:38,488 --> 01:04:42,108
Yeah. Maybe at the beginning.

520
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:49,417
I don't know. I can pull it up.

521
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:53,708
Would you picture this one? Yeah, that one. Right where we have it on my laptop.

522
01:04:54,308 --> 01:04:58,868
But we're going to it as soon as to have it in there.

523
01:04:59,768 --> 01:05:02,948
Yeah. Can anyone tell me what is the effect? I can.

524
01:05:02,948 --> 01:05:07,348
Because here in that in the x axis, we had an ad which really started during chat.

525
01:05:07,458 --> 01:05:10,468
They say both make them and they are white.

526
01:05:10,478 --> 01:05:17,648
Actually, we have some energy. Then what is the effect of I could do actually start on page.

527
01:05:17,678 --> 01:05:26,888
I mean. Yes, so could. I mean, what happens is that not only is that which is born during childhood, what is going to happen in that age?

528
01:05:26,888 --> 01:05:36,578
I mean, do we delay or delay? We're going to be delayed because you'll see that this X-axis represents a barrier.

529
01:05:36,998 --> 01:05:41,428
Mm hmm. To the right, we have better. And then you have better known before they start during childhood.

530
01:05:41,768 --> 01:05:48,138
Then menarche will be a genetic. That would be the case.

531
01:05:48,138 --> 01:05:58,138
Why we are not faring now and increase in IQ motor societies because it is let's sit down more and then

532
01:05:58,178 --> 01:06:08,058
you may never know about what is the effect of fetal nutritional status though that is shown by that.

533
01:06:08,748 --> 01:06:13,288
I wrote that you up there. What is this point?

534
01:06:13,348 --> 01:06:16,698
I mean. Yeah, what is the point as a member of us? Yeah.

535
01:06:17,088 --> 01:06:20,178
That our role is being in poor fetal growth.

536
01:06:20,628 --> 01:06:27,938
Then we have poor fetal growth. What is going to happen with HIV according to the.

537
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:36,688
Meaning when you see. Yeah. What did that direct that the arrow is pointing in the direction.

538
01:06:36,758 --> 01:06:40,108
Okay, so that means less nutrition.

539
01:06:40,858 --> 01:06:48,238
It will be over here. Exactly what? Is there anything that I believe that is up for military families that do during fetal growth?

540
01:06:49,468 --> 01:06:57,328
I mean, it is going to be familiar to anyone in any way or idea from an evolutionary perspective.

541
01:06:58,138 --> 01:07:03,808
Why? Because now we have different that we have positive things forward which are they

542
01:07:03,808 --> 01:07:09,898
start to put in faculties want to eliminate but not usually start to defeat.

543
01:07:09,898 --> 01:07:15,658
That growth is going to accelerate for the foreseeable future.

544
01:07:18,938 --> 01:07:29,698
Erm when I was this kind of musicians, I've heard that from time to mine.

545
01:07:30,248 --> 01:07:38,228
And then I've also heard that breaking. So there might be like a.

546
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:42,808
Yeah, that is possible. And we know that.

547
01:07:43,108 --> 01:07:54,598
We saw that in that article that laid down the exact correlation between the way we traveled and when they got to put it down.

548
01:07:55,978 --> 01:08:08,127
But but but I think that because I think I don't want these figures taken from any particular from any particular publication,

549
01:08:08,128 --> 01:08:16,888
I feel they collected more or less information from different sources that I do believe that how the news is going.

550
01:08:17,418 --> 01:08:26,878
I'm going back to developmental plasticity, how that body is going to interpret poor fetal growth,

551
01:08:28,498 --> 01:08:40,228
and they could have either an immediate or delayed response like it could like try to shift in a way that's like very survival, like immediately.

552
01:08:41,488 --> 01:08:48,087
So an example would be like that. We talked an article like mammals like for the sake of like due to limited nutrition,

553
01:08:48,088 --> 01:08:55,578
they like unintentionally develop like intrauterine growth retardation, which then led to like loss,

554
01:08:55,828 --> 01:09:04,377
like death eventually or sooner did same thing for like tadpoles who like adjust or adapt really

555
01:09:04,378 --> 01:09:09,298
quickly due to like scything but then like it affects their survival rate in a couple of like years.

556
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:19,138
I think if that's the case, then they're going to take like an immediate adaptive response to the situation that they're in so that they can,

557
01:09:19,138 --> 01:09:24,628
like, live in that moment and then like it'll it'll negatively affect them in like a couple of months.

558
01:09:24,748 --> 01:09:30,608
The things are exactly seen that that moderate could be that K down a poor effect on growth.

559
01:09:30,658 --> 01:09:36,718
The the interpretation that the body is going to make the interpretation of antibodies in the gut.

560
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:47,638
Okay when you have a shorter lifespan, things like that, like historical practice review that we need to reproduce how fast we can, then that will be.

561
01:09:47,638 --> 01:09:57,838
That is why with that growth is associated with every minute because you're describing here have the three color lines.

562
01:09:58,318 --> 01:10:06,118
I do the cross section. That means that when you look at the cross section here that is dead is about the same as three points.

563
01:10:06,868 --> 01:10:17,118
But the one who has the early menarche have small birth sex.

564
01:10:18,028 --> 01:10:23,958
That means that we're assuming that we're holding a nutrition constant kind of thought

565
01:10:23,998 --> 01:10:32,398
he was doing like a particular kind of and since nutrition is constant the earlier yeah

566
01:10:32,848 --> 01:10:38,188
so then you said the earlier you conceive that child the child has smaller on birth

567
01:10:38,188 --> 01:10:43,858
that that's why you see that that irrelevance you know these areas he's staring at the

568
01:10:43,858 --> 01:10:48,208
effect of down because you ever seen the pickled bull and what he's trying to start to see

569
01:10:48,208 --> 01:10:55,287
in two different stages of life including fetal growth after childhood that he's seen

570
01:10:55,288 --> 01:11:01,527
that they could have different or positive effects because maybe the what the mechanism

571
01:11:01,528 --> 01:11:07,198
that they depredation are sensing energy sensing in different one stage of the other.

572
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:18,018
Okay. So the thing about the prenatal ones, they also have like postnatal nutritional sadnesses.

573
01:11:18,288 --> 01:11:20,598
So the next one, I have a lot of worries on about my brain.

574
01:11:20,958 --> 01:11:25,128
But like I explained some of the prenatal, which was like the immediate and delayed responses,

575
01:11:25,818 --> 01:11:30,258
the immediate being like they think immediate survival tactics or developments,

576
01:11:30,798 --> 01:11:36,498
delay being that they wait to make the death of trait that become well later manifest in their later life.

577
01:11:37,188 --> 01:11:43,308
Some of those postnatal factors, which was basically defined as a period of postnatal nutritional deprivation, have an organism.

578
01:11:44,028 --> 01:11:49,848
So these ideas have come in evolved because pregnancy impaired, high energetic costs.

579
01:11:50,538 --> 01:11:55,128
Hence the tradeoff between longevity is dependent on like the human female.

580
01:11:56,838 --> 01:12:06,888
So that was one of postnatal factors. So the not the question was how are select persons different between females and male regarding reproduction?

581
01:12:11,318 --> 01:12:16,108
Comments. We just. Some of that in the first part.

582
01:12:16,368 --> 01:12:23,398
Mm hmm. Any one comment? One of the difference between selective pressure between females and males regarding evolution.

583
01:12:28,998 --> 01:12:34,898
Why do you have to be appealing to get.

584
01:12:37,498 --> 01:12:46,648
Yeah, we, we, we discussed the issue of sexual selection in there is sexual selection mostly to work out one with the sexes.

585
01:12:47,398 --> 01:12:55,978
Then we're with 26 people. However, in humans you see that there might be something also objectively measured by body size.

586
01:12:56,338 --> 01:13:04,648
Yes. However, is there in a requirement different between men and women?

587
01:13:04,718 --> 01:13:12,478
Yeah. Yes. In our culture we also have a little bit similar with in the beginning here.

588
01:13:13,258 --> 01:13:18,398
Those were the first rate for reproduction is the first thing.

589
01:13:18,778 --> 01:13:27,928
But now we have learned that the dead body type is more voluptuous because they don't have to tell you either.

590
01:13:28,078 --> 01:13:38,238
So if a woman selection to have benefits for you but understand that the faster is but the for man is the.

591
01:13:38,368 --> 01:13:49,258
Yeah exactly. Do you mean where the body is going to the location is going to be different takes and invest more energy to say in

592
01:13:49,498 --> 01:14:00,598
somatic more so but I think meanwhile that classes on you are right about the the sexless it's regarding biology.

593
01:14:00,778 --> 01:14:08,678
Oh yeah it turns out they have different preferences over a body shape that they are that are.

594
01:14:08,768 --> 01:14:12,508
Then that means that means that even though.

595
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:23,518
They say that now that women by that I mean that what they need as the listing also informatic feature.

596
01:14:25,738 --> 01:14:28,908
He they are not the kind of people to live. Hmm.

597
01:14:30,708 --> 01:14:33,178
So starting with the selective pressure between men.

598
01:14:33,208 --> 01:14:40,998
One thing we did a little early was the test of testosterone levels plays a big role in that select question between males.

599
01:14:43,578 --> 01:14:54,168
So there have been trends that, like men living in high affluent settings compared to men living in less affluent setting,

600
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:59,118
are have limited energy availability. So that affects their testosterone levels.

601
01:14:59,388 --> 01:15:09,708
So watching every low testosterone levels in nutritionally stressed populations seem to be adaptive responses that equate to like that.

602
01:15:09,828 --> 01:15:15,828
And it didn't cost to take testosterone, but we mentioned a lot of that also.

603
01:15:19,468 --> 01:15:24,718
Yeah. I think the next thing for which is females we mention some of this too.

604
01:15:24,718 --> 01:15:32,038
So human ovary functions. And just like that, the access to energy, ecological energy availability.

605
01:15:32,668 --> 01:15:36,088
So developmental conditions shape baseline levels of reproductive function by

606
01:15:36,088 --> 01:15:40,888
adjusting the speed of growth and maturation in response to ecological factors.

607
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:44,908
So these are some of the pressures that like selective pressures that influence

608
01:15:44,908 --> 01:15:49,468
how women like will eventually reproduce and how their ovaries are impacted.

609
01:15:50,908 --> 01:15:58,017
One point that I want to just plug into that point that even though we have found people

610
01:15:58,018 --> 01:16:04,837
have found genes associated with painful menopause and they may not be black as sex.

611
01:16:04,838 --> 01:16:14,128
So Gene that they have these estrogen things like maybe early may not puberty but they are very rarely that it doesn't appear individuals

612
01:16:14,908 --> 01:16:27,988
then the main factors are the factors that are related to timing and then that shows also to the fact that even that is not our gene.

613
01:16:28,438 --> 01:16:38,098
They have people to allow for to respond in environments that even then even more so leverage when you do embarrassment.

614
01:16:38,488 --> 01:16:41,758
But I would respond to the department. Sure.

615
01:16:42,868 --> 01:16:47,187
So our gene, so that our genes can even respond to it.

616
01:16:47,188 --> 01:16:49,768
And then it does have a negative effect later on, but they're only gone.

617
01:16:50,458 --> 01:16:55,257
So are they more inclined to have that immediate reaction to the environment regardless

618
01:16:55,258 --> 01:16:59,488
of like how it could affect them later on or like because I know some of it

619
01:16:59,488 --> 01:17:05,628
was like in the previous thought I mentioned like the delayed in the immediate are

620
01:17:05,668 --> 01:17:10,588
genes more likely to like take the immediate route versus them like delaying.

621
01:17:10,618 --> 01:17:16,948
Exactly. They have to be. Have they had the when they think they have this whole range of possibilities,

622
01:17:17,218 --> 01:17:24,128
remember, not you and they know or reaction then that particular you don't like.

623
01:17:24,178 --> 01:17:28,108
They have a whole range of possible phenotypes depending on the environment.

624
01:17:28,648 --> 01:17:31,768
I didn't get them. That would be that that reason.

625
01:17:33,228 --> 01:17:40,857
Okay. So moving on to the last point was explain how hormonal related cancers so breast and

626
01:17:40,858 --> 01:17:44,728
prostate cancers are a consequence of evolutionary tradeoff and human life story.

627
01:17:46,408 --> 01:17:54,748
So what do you guys think is some of the related by how human life evolution has contributed to like breast and prostate cancer for both?

628
01:17:58,858 --> 01:18:04,538
Yeah. Remember that period that we saw the first part down with this called called

629
01:18:05,048 --> 01:18:11,498
according to this S.A.T. the hypotheses including our the path to our ancestors,

630
01:18:11,498 --> 01:18:19,308
they have higher risk of cardiovascular disease due to the rest of your body and that they have higher body.

631
01:18:22,088 --> 01:18:26,858
Not bad, but prudent evolutionary perspective.

632
01:18:26,858 --> 01:18:31,178
Do you see that? That makes sense. That tradeoff would be okay.

633
01:18:31,658 --> 01:18:40,057
During the past, remember, we have these high, high body, the shorter interval between birth.

634
01:18:40,058 --> 01:18:43,448
But they they want to lead to higher risk of cardiovascular disease.

635
01:18:45,118 --> 01:18:55,838
Makes sense for an average daily perspective. And why is it about cardiovascular disease, in fact?

636
01:18:56,138 --> 01:18:59,738
I mean, these are early death.

637
01:19:02,138 --> 01:19:06,108
Some of these figures. Yeah, there's.

638
01:19:14,588 --> 01:19:21,278
Remember, like, these stories are part of somehow evolution, not resignation.

639
01:19:23,078 --> 01:19:28,108
I'm sorry. Sometimes I have to apologize. Not like that.

640
01:19:29,108 --> 01:19:40,538
But somehow that resolution has to find the ultimate solution viewing, let's say, a benefit, some horrible consequences.

641
01:19:41,048 --> 01:19:47,618
Then you can imagine the cardiovascular disease in the past, but most likely will happen after evolution.

642
01:19:48,038 --> 01:20:01,808
And then let's say there's a rule that Ginsburg's active once bears only reproduce, maybe they time for raising their kids.

643
01:20:03,098 --> 01:20:06,128
That result of cardiovascular disease wasn't the same.

644
01:20:07,448 --> 01:20:15,427
I came from the evolutionary perspective to have a lot of kids in the reading,

645
01:20:15,428 --> 01:20:20,318
a lot of like they were mentioning how a lot of things ultimately lead to protecting against breast cancer.

646
01:20:20,648 --> 01:20:26,778
Well, I know we talk about cardiovascular, but a lot of things can lead to the protection of breast cancer.

647
01:20:26,798 --> 01:20:33,638
So some of the things were listed as like late age at menarche and high propriety,

648
01:20:34,238 --> 01:20:39,278
which prolongs I like breastfeeding period, which ultimately like lead to protection against breast cancer.

649
01:20:39,518 --> 01:20:43,568
So that was I guess just mentioning some of the benefits that like that tradeoff could be

650
01:20:45,368 --> 01:20:54,188
in for men for prostate cancer is again that so pressures of that testosterone level.

651
01:20:56,468 --> 01:21:02,948
There isn't like significant correlations or evidence that show like there's a correlation between like cancer risk and that kind of testosterone.

652
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:09,937
But some showed it's that a lot of studies have shown that like urbanized areas tend to have higher testosterone production,

653
01:21:09,938 --> 01:21:14,798
which also ultimately leads to that high level prostate cancer rate.

654
01:21:17,678 --> 01:21:22,108
And that was. Last. With.

655
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:26,708
Yeah, I guess I'm just. Okay. I don't have to tear apart.

656
01:21:26,918 --> 01:21:32,108
Okay. No, go ahead. Okay. I'll definitely tear apart xenophobia.

657
01:21:32,108 --> 01:21:37,898
Understand? We learned in class that estrogen is actually protective against cardiovascular risk.

658
01:21:38,528 --> 01:21:47,168
So I'm not sure if this diagram is trying to say that having a bunch of birds is what causes the cardiovascular risk or what.

659
01:21:47,798 --> 01:21:58,198
But I'm just like in my head. Yes. And then there's no significant evidence such like having anything like having a child causes.

660
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:04,508
I mean, you would be at higher risk if you weren't properly supplementing.

661
01:22:04,958 --> 01:22:09,128
But I. And then the third thing you're arguing is psychological well-being.

662
01:22:09,788 --> 01:22:13,028
Like having kids. Yeah. That you've been injured.

663
01:22:13,458 --> 01:22:17,258
And so then I'm like, okay, then I'm not seeing any risks.

664
01:22:17,648 --> 01:22:23,268
Mm hmm. Yeah. No. Yeah, I think because, um.

665
01:22:25,658 --> 01:22:36,518
There is how how they just plain BS because also this is related to the availability of resources in the past.

666
01:22:37,268 --> 01:22:44,408
The less energy supply was associated with lower levels that we have right now,

667
01:22:44,948 --> 01:22:51,218
but also the shaft and thereby the between both keeps lower estrogen levels.

668
01:22:51,618 --> 01:22:59,888
Hmm. And the reason is that is they had less life time exposure with that would

669
01:22:59,888 --> 01:23:04,688
be related to the lower risk all hormone related cancers like breast cancer.

670
01:23:05,108 --> 01:23:11,678
But we know down if you get into menopause, these are reasonable people because of the lower levels.

671
01:23:12,278 --> 01:23:18,098
And I assume what they say is that the lifetime exposure to effort was nowhere.

672
01:23:18,488 --> 01:23:22,338
And then she was saying that there's no for sure. Significant evidence.

673
01:23:22,848 --> 01:23:31,337
Yeah. Yet there literally is more confusing data and I think it might be more confusing because of like the selective crap,

674
01:23:31,338 --> 01:23:34,038
like how much testosterone can influence.

675
01:23:34,518 --> 01:23:45,918
So trying to make that like as a clinic scene could be like right on the graph that we saw with this content that it airs from Paraguay,

676
01:23:46,068 --> 01:23:54,558
that they have low levels reported on there, but they keep always going to our guide and they they don't have any problem with reproduction.

677
01:23:56,478 --> 01:24:06,668
So for the the graph that we saw where it was like 60 to 80, that was still like having like kids having that like affect them.

678
01:24:06,678 --> 01:24:11,408
Like because that means they're just higher. How, how, how?

679
01:24:11,508 --> 01:24:17,448
Like the, the chart that was showing like in the later, like the later life or like ages.

680
01:24:18,468 --> 01:24:33,798
Yeah. How does that like probably what happened in these societies are they because they mean they the that they're that is a huge

681
01:24:34,278 --> 01:24:46,847
body ability of of people males they are more het article meaning that are few men are going to compete with more of people.

682
01:24:46,848 --> 01:24:56,148
I think generation usually that is related to social is that to be in that group like cognitive and achieve or VAD there are and

683
01:24:56,148 --> 01:25:06,768
also they tend to be to practice more body than then that giving the analysts a all their maybe they they don't have the same that

684
01:25:06,798 --> 01:25:18,257
physical ability to to have to read but they do we don't hear that then that that reform why are we also said that we don't we see

685
01:25:18,258 --> 01:25:27,888
this data or that we make a theoretical using that's true versus like women have like embryos and eggs that could run out I guess.

686
01:25:28,038 --> 01:25:30,978
So they have to like yeah, it's almost like they stagger off.

687
01:25:32,118 --> 01:25:45,167
But yeah, yes, I, I was part of my thesis here whether they be made master degree, that is that number that you can calculate in population genetics.

688
01:25:45,168 --> 01:25:48,288
That is called the effect size model.

689
01:25:48,348 --> 01:25:58,068
That idea is okay, you can have for example a population of there's thousands of kids by maybe out of a thousand and only a few ones

690
01:25:58,068 --> 01:26:04,307
are contributing to the next generation because not doing I want to reproduce or even the original utilities.

691
01:26:04,308 --> 01:26:13,218
But I really think that using for mathematical calculation you can estimate more or less how many men,

692
01:26:13,428 --> 01:26:17,388
how many women are the from this overpopulation.

693
01:26:19,388 --> 01:26:23,558
Then there seems to be that assumption that we need to take with a grain of salt.

694
01:26:24,098 --> 01:26:30,578
However, it seems that at least the indigenous population or the Americas,

695
01:26:30,578 --> 01:26:40,718
when they travel from Siberia where they started to and went to the Americas, maybe 3000 using the bus, the effective number was very low.

696
01:26:41,348 --> 01:26:49,928
We calculated that maybe just in that doses of effect the number of males and maybe meaning that there was a few,

697
01:26:50,228 --> 01:26:53,438
even if they were more normal, healthy individuals.

698
01:26:53,858 --> 01:26:58,048
But the structure of the societies pretty good article.

699
01:26:58,478 --> 01:27:04,717
Then that's how people made computing work deals. There are things that would be moral in that.

700
01:27:04,718 --> 01:27:11,408
The case that we're all serving these hunter gatherers now that are more to the end, they're the ones who are.

701
01:27:11,408 --> 01:27:18,487
What are you waiting for before? All you have is understand that my father was born in the Gene dynasty and then I went

702
01:27:18,488 --> 01:27:24,607
to school with all my kids and has three mums and the other kids have six months in.

703
01:27:24,608 --> 01:27:31,028
My mum's about 27 years younger than my dad. That's what I was when I was 60, but my mom was 37.

704
01:27:31,988 --> 01:27:33,667
So there's nothing like that.

705
01:27:33,668 --> 01:27:40,808
And not every one, not every making her mother always the kingdom of 3000, because the money you have to have, the house is needed.

706
01:27:41,258 --> 01:27:51,218
So those people spread their genes just exactly mother, without any questions and comments.

707
01:27:54,478 --> 01:28:02,948
Thank you. Okay, before we finish, have some housekeeping.

708
01:28:04,258 --> 01:28:07,738
How you doing with your final report? Fabulous.

709
01:28:08,248 --> 01:28:12,267
Then. Then did you have any question about your report?

710
01:28:12,268 --> 01:28:16,138
Please send me an email. Or you want to set up a meeting with me to discuss it.

711
01:28:16,138 --> 01:28:22,978
I would be more than happy to do it. There is no homework for this week then.

712
01:28:23,218 --> 01:28:28,498
Happy Thanksgiving. Thank you so much for your report, Flora.

713
01:28:29,038 --> 01:28:32,398
I mean, can you start recording? Because you may.
