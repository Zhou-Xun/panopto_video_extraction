1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,800
Okay. Welcome back. So. So remember, this is the second part of the biomarkers topic.

2
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,930
And remember, we were going to start with the exact site assignment of a specific biomarker.

3
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,749
So I hope that you did your work individually.

4
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,720
So now you will be together in groups and then you will report to the class and give a specific biomarker.

5
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:44,070
And then we will devote the rest of the of the class to the part two of the lab assignment.

6
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:52,080
So, so remember we were going to discuss biomarkers of sodium, vitamin D and the calorie intake.

7
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,700
And those are the questions that you need to focus on first.

8
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:02,939
Why is the nutrient important in terms of health? Because I mean, it's like if it's not an important thing, why you should be getting it,

9
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,570
spending so much time and resources and money in analyzing biomarker, right?

10
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,670
So where are the biological specimens where you can measure the nutrient of a fluid intake,

11
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,999
whereas the main study supporting the use of the specimens to measure the nutrient and what is the recommended metric more

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,860
than one where the strengths and where the weaknesses of those methods and any other information that you found useful.

13
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:38,610
So these are the group assignments. So now if you can find your group hopefully,

14
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:47,760
and then the idea is that you will have some time to work together to gather all the individual information you will have to designate one reporter.

15
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:55,020
That person will kind of like gather everything and summarize and that person will be the one explaining to the class with you, fine.

16
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:07,470
Okay. So I don't know how you're going to do it, but I hope that you find your classmates so you can gather together one way or the other.

17
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:24,230
Maybe move around because I.

18
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:46,060
I was looking. A 20.

19
00:02:53,960 --> 00:03:01,510
Someone wrote to me that, you know, we can do this.

20
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:08,860
Yeah. If some of you feel more comfortable going outside, I mean, because there is also a place to sit down together.

21
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:18,610
You can do that, too. Yes.

22
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:26,180
I'm not so sure. Okay.

23
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,420
And we will reconvene in 15 minutes or so.

24
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:54,780
Okay. To monitor.

25
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,381
It has to be sustainable.

26
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:12,053
So the was the reporter for Solium.

27
00:04:13,363 --> 00:04:19,803
Actually. Yes. He.

28
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,143
Okay. Do you want me to pick it up? No, no, you can just.

29
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:44,303
Okay. So sodium is critical for conducting nerve impulses, muscle contraction and relaxation and maintaining osmotic pressure.

30
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:50,153
When you have low sodium, it can cause cardiac arrest, electrolyte imbalances or hypertension.

31
00:04:50,153 --> 00:04:52,732
And too much sodium can lead to hypertension.

32
00:04:52,733 --> 00:05:03,663
CVD and CKD and the main biological specimen where you can measure nutrients like sodium intake is through urine.

33
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:09,413
Since urine is the main route by which sodium is eliminated from the body.

34
00:05:09,923 --> 00:05:20,723
And so so then there is a 24 hour collection of urine which entails like collecting all the urine from a 24 hour period.

35
00:05:21,263 --> 00:05:27,323
But because this can be like burdensome for participants and also clinicians and researchers,

36
00:05:28,493 --> 00:05:35,453
there is some investigation into spot urine collection, which would just be like the first urine of the day usually.

37
00:05:35,843 --> 00:05:39,142
But there is a lot of like mixed validity of this is.

38
00:05:39,143 --> 00:05:48,292
But then there's some methods to try to like calculate 24 hour urine, sodium like urine content from this,

39
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:54,623
but there's like mixed validity of those different methods and it's different in different populations sometimes.

40
00:05:56,273 --> 00:06:04,073
There's also the overnight urine method, which is like a 12 hour collection, which I don't know much about that.

41
00:06:04,913 --> 00:06:16,553
Yeah. Yeah. And then compromise different hours and then plasma sodium levels wouldn't really like be reflective of dietary intake.

42
00:06:17,573 --> 00:06:27,473
Um, so for the 24 hour urine collection, like I said, this is really impractical, especially on a large scale.

43
00:06:28,613 --> 00:06:34,313
It's burdensome for participants and also it's prone to human error due to incomplete collection.

44
00:06:34,313 --> 00:06:39,383
So if you just forget to collect some urine, then you're not collecting all of it.

45
00:06:39,743 --> 00:06:47,063
And the spot test is also just prone to error because you're like extrapolating from it.

46
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:54,953
I guess another thing with the 24 hour two is like ideally you would do multiple 24 hours to assess long term intake,

47
00:06:55,943 --> 00:07:02,873
but then that's like even more complicated. Um, yeah, I think we have.

48
00:07:03,263 --> 00:07:07,612
Yeah, that's very good. And actually the last thing that you said is very important because I mean,

49
00:07:07,613 --> 00:07:13,033
people usually think that, okay, we have the 24 hour collection, then we're fine, right?

50
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:15,653
And then they don't realize that we do use that in a bit.

51
00:07:15,653 --> 00:07:21,232
Immunologic studies, you're going to just use 124 hour and then infer something that happens 20 years later.

52
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,663
Yeah, because actually there are many studies showing that, oh,

53
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:27,863
there's nothing we so the online hypertension for example, which is like, oh yeah, yeah.

54
00:07:28,013 --> 00:07:33,803
And it's because they only use your 124. I mean they should kind of let you repeat it is the same as a 24 hour the goal.

55
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:39,383
Yeah, three is repeated so. Yeah. Do you have any other questions for this group?

56
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:44,873
Very good. Thank you. Okay.

57
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:51,703
Vitamin D was reporting. Unfortunately.

58
00:07:58,623 --> 00:08:02,163
Can. Can you send me, can you send me your notes that you.

59
00:08:02,343 --> 00:08:05,703
Yeah. And the same for you when you're finished choosing me or not.

60
00:08:06,313 --> 00:08:11,463
Okay, uh, so we're talking about vitamin D.

61
00:08:11,613 --> 00:08:17,943
Vitamin D is essential for the regulation of calcium homeostasis and is important for our bone health.

62
00:08:18,513 --> 00:08:22,922
And when we measure vitamin D, what we use is the blood sample,

63
00:08:22,923 --> 00:08:31,353
where we measure a serum 25 hydroxyl vitamin D and also sometimes zero 125 hydroxyl vitamin D.

64
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:37,163
And the main studies supporting this is from 2008.

65
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:45,812
The report of that year intake for calcium and vitamin D from the institution of of medicine is where they establish

66
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:56,042
that the I's for calcium and vitamin D and in that they use a long linear dose response relationship to determine

67
00:08:56,043 --> 00:09:06,513
that the eye for vitamin D and this is also why it's like a nonlinear and dose response relationship occurs and it's

68
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:15,633
very difficult to measure vitamin D intake seriously wrong by the D level because it is largely affected by both.

69
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:26,733
And though generous and extra generous exposure to vitamin D and for what's recommended method,

70
00:09:27,243 --> 00:09:31,203
it's still this serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D is the best method.

71
00:09:31,503 --> 00:09:40,982
It's widely used in a lot of the research to reflect how vitamin D intake level and the strengths is.

72
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:52,892
We now have this a good agreement between this the relationship and there's also another way of

73
00:09:52,893 --> 00:10:02,733
testing is where are they called dried blood spot and they also can use that to measure that level.

74
00:10:03,513 --> 00:10:16,063
So the problem is this dry plaster technique is pretty, uh, I think if you remember invasive, invasive,

75
00:10:16,413 --> 00:10:24,483
the first one is just, you know, but it's a pretty, I mean, excessive invasive instead of intake, right?

76
00:10:24,813 --> 00:10:28,293
Instead of thinking something like that. Yeah. Yeah. But they were. Yeah.

77
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:41,372
And the problem with weathering the rhythm D level is because according to our research, 80 to 90% of our vitamin D intake is actually from the sun.

78
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:47,943
So if it's from the skin, generation and diet only account for 10 to 20%.

79
00:10:48,153 --> 00:10:51,482
But when we measure it, there's no way we can really separate these two.

80
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:59,403
So this serum vitamin D lab was never like a direct reflection of our intake.

81
00:10:59,943 --> 00:11:04,533
It can be largely confounded by, for example, like physical activity.

82
00:11:04,743 --> 00:11:09,723
If even if you are doing more physical activity, we tend to have more exposure.

83
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:15,633
And also next season we tend to have like a lower level in the winter, more in the summer.

84
00:11:17,253 --> 00:11:22,683
Yeah. And, uh, you guys, any questions?

85
00:11:24,873 --> 00:11:31,253
Yeah. So, I mean, you're right. So the problem with that, I mean, these are not really reflecting exclusively in the studies, right?

86
00:11:31,473 --> 00:11:38,733
Unless you are kind of like focusing on a population in the winter that have very little sun exposure,

87
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:42,633
then that would be like a good reflection of intake, but that's usually not the case.

88
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:46,233
Okay, don't forget to send me the note today. Thank you.

89
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:51,903
Okay, so last one. Total energy intake was reported.

90
00:11:54,983 --> 00:12:07,493
You just want us to e-mail you? Yes, please. And you need to put the funds to just not enough.

91
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:12,113
So what we are researching about is the total energy intake.

92
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:19,703
So the importance of total energy intake is about first it's required to maintain the metabolism,

93
00:12:19,913 --> 00:12:25,973
so it will maintain the more normal body temperature and growth in the life, early life.

94
00:12:26,243 --> 00:12:35,633
And also the total energy intake is used as the energy to balance in the body needs and also which is important for the muscle and organ functions.

95
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:44,513
And the biological statement that is much of what the study like, the biomarker we found is the double label water.

96
00:12:44,753 --> 00:12:52,603
And we will use that daily a urine sample collected and analyzed using isotope ratio, mass spectrometry.

97
00:12:53,183 --> 00:13:09,533
And the main study we found to use the this is the study focusing on to on the way we're going to use the

98
00:13:09,683 --> 00:13:17,243
double label water and urine sample to evaluate the extent of dietary misreporting in a large sample,

99
00:13:17,453 --> 00:13:21,263
which is of studies in the 2003.

100
00:13:21,563 --> 00:13:31,793
And the recommended method we found is the double label water, as I mentioned before, and thus and also there's another one called Direct Calorimetry,

101
00:13:31,883 --> 00:13:36,703
which is measuring the heat like, you know what,

102
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:46,513
the heat in the room when sitting in the where you are sitting there and the double label water is considered as the gold standard.

103
00:13:46,523 --> 00:13:48,773
And there are several stressing that.

104
00:13:48,983 --> 00:13:58,033
One of them is that it's highly accurate that since it can calculate all the energy intake which might be misreported by the F,

105
00:13:58,043 --> 00:14:04,613
Q or other dietary questionnaire, and which means it can help with the validation of a pure.

106
00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:11,813
And also it allows patients to move freely compared to another direct calorimetry.

107
00:14:12,053 --> 00:14:19,612
And also that the med calorimetry is the most accurate one to measure the total energy intake.

108
00:14:19,613 --> 00:14:31,733
And it since it's quantifies the metabolic rate the weakness of the label water is that it is very expensive and it needs long time to

109
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:42,532
follow up if you have a like 28 days questionnaire so that you have to measure 28 days and also for the diet of direct calorimetry,

110
00:14:42,533 --> 00:14:50,153
it's also expensive and also the people who are need to measure you to remain in the room and be monitored.

111
00:14:50,163 --> 00:14:55,163
So it's not all like an ideal measurement.

112
00:14:55,733 --> 00:15:07,343
And the other information we found that there are many indirect or proximate measures depending on the study and the population we need.

113
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:13,453
So there is not just one single method for the total energy intake measurement study.

114
00:15:13,463 --> 00:15:17,123
Yeah, I think. Any questions?

115
00:15:18,983 --> 00:15:23,513
You know, very good. So they simply are not so good.

116
00:15:23,873 --> 00:15:31,193
So the only ones who can afford doing the label what it is and people have NIH.

117
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:39,563
I think for all the studies you will find when funded for the groups working at NIH that anyways is expensive.

118
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:48,472
So so you so kind of life three examples of biomarkers that you have chosen all that is but I mean I thought that they were interesting

119
00:15:48,473 --> 00:15:54,113
because they were measuring kind of with different methods and they have different kind of like a strengths and weaknesses.

120
00:15:54,523 --> 00:16:01,433
So in the future you can of like find information about any biomarker.

121
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:05,953
You have to think about these things because I mean, it's like don't, don't, don't do well.

122
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:10,763
Most people feel like, oh, because it's measured with biomarkers, then it's verified.

123
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:14,893
It's not self-reported. No. I mean, biomarkers also have drawbacks.

124
00:16:14,903 --> 00:16:18,593
Right. So so yeah. So that was a very nice exercise.

125
00:16:18,593 --> 00:16:23,813
Thank you for working on that. Any question on this?

126
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:35,662
Okay, so let's move on. So now I'm going to explain the second part of the of the lab, and then we will take a short break.

127
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:43,733
And then the second part of the class, you can just basically work on the lab on this part, on the previous part that you haven't finished.

128
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:48,082
So this this part, we are going to remember the first part.

129
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:56,563
We were validating efficacy questionnaire with biomarkers and that was it kind of like using we were using linear regression at this time, right.

130
00:16:57,533 --> 00:17:00,863
Which is I mean, remember, we can use many methods, right?

131
00:17:01,373 --> 00:17:06,713
The idea is just to compare one. The other flight and the most frequent one is the correlation coefficient,

132
00:17:06,713 --> 00:17:12,083
but you can also use linear regression in iteration, gives you the advantage of adjusting.

133
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:20,362
I mean, you can also suggest in correlation coefficient percent correlation coefficient but will interesting you actually see the bad s of the oh,

134
00:17:20,363 --> 00:17:25,793
this is Jerry adjusting and then you can get a better kind of nice sense of if the the

135
00:17:25,793 --> 00:17:31,963
confounder so the or the variables that induce ideation are really kind of like affecting,

136
00:17:32,003 --> 00:17:40,103
right? So now we are going to go a little further and instead of kind of like using just one method to

137
00:17:40,103 --> 00:17:46,493
validate or put a questionnaire where you want to use two methods because two is better than one,

138
00:17:46,613 --> 00:17:50,903
right? So, so this is going to be the method of trial.

139
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:54,983
So the idea is that you will have your nutrients measured from the fifth.

140
00:17:54,983 --> 00:18:01,942
Q And then you're going to have two independent methods, usually another dietary method that is usually dietary recall.

141
00:18:01,943 --> 00:18:06,293
So 24 hour course and the other method is usually a biomarker, right?

142
00:18:06,593 --> 00:18:10,553
So what we are going to do is that we are going to triangulate in our way.

143
00:18:11,153 --> 00:18:15,083
And then because we are using two independent methods in theory,

144
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:21,533
kind of like our validation is more robust, so it's kind of like is more kind of reliable.

145
00:18:21,803 --> 00:18:22,913
And ideally,

146
00:18:22,913 --> 00:18:31,612
remember one of the problems where we were kind of like validating before with other dietary methods is that usually the errors are correlated.

147
00:18:31,613 --> 00:18:35,303
Remember you have that a record sample, a questionnaire,

148
00:18:35,303 --> 00:18:40,192
people made the same errors when they are reporting their diet regardless of the method they

149
00:18:40,193 --> 00:18:46,522
use and whether errors are correlated that inflate precisely the correlation coefficient.

150
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:53,723
So so when you do this kind of thing you by using the biomarker usually the Russian the biomarker not correlated.

151
00:18:53,993 --> 00:18:58,493
So then that that that helps how little we thought there was can be correlated between

152
00:18:58,493 --> 00:19:03,763
the two that that method so that you will see that once you start with you will see that

153
00:19:04,013 --> 00:19:11,062
sometimes obvious but I want to anticipate anyway so so this method of trials is actually

154
00:19:11,063 --> 00:19:15,563
an application of after analysis that you are going to calculate a validity coefficient.

155
00:19:15,983 --> 00:19:21,093
That validity coefficient actually can be interpreted as a correlation coefficient, not one, right?

156
00:19:21,503 --> 00:19:28,853
But it is coming from three pairwise correlations between the Q the reference dietary method, which in the,

157
00:19:28,893 --> 00:19:35,933
in this case for the data you have will be 24 hour records and thereby your market in this case will be adipose tissue fatty acids.

158
00:19:36,053 --> 00:19:40,013
Okay, so, so this is what you are doing basically.

159
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:49,733
So you have here your frequency questionnaire for this particular there are actually you have the average of two food frequency question.

160
00:19:49,913 --> 00:19:58,733
Okay, but you don't need to do anything. And then you have the biomarker, which in this case would be adipose, adipose tissue, fatty acids.

161
00:19:59,093 --> 00:20:02,933
And then you have that, you have the order of reference dietary reference method,

162
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:13,613
which will be in this case will be 24 hour recall such that a maybe is that you get correlation coefficients between these three things.

163
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:19,643
So you get three correlation coefficient between the biomarkers from a few people

164
00:20:19,643 --> 00:20:25,913
in this review and they will recommend between the market and the refined recall.

165
00:20:26,213 --> 00:20:32,033
And using these three professional coefficients and the equations that I'm going to show you,

166
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:36,733
you can calculate the validity position, which is supposed to be revenue.

167
00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:47,473
The population, which is these which in my would can be interpreted as the correlation of their method with the true dietary intake.

168
00:20:47,603 --> 00:20:51,983
We don't know that for that dietary intake. Right, but kind of like this one.

169
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:57,023
So these are kind of like the equations that you can see.

170
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:02,242
They're not that complicated. Just be careful because those are a square root and be careful with it.

171
00:21:02,243 --> 00:21:05,573
But in the position, they didn't make any mistakes.

172
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:14,623
And basically this would be a really difficult question for me if if you withdraw intake.

173
00:21:14,813 --> 00:21:16,643
Right. My.

174
00:21:21,993 --> 00:21:30,093
The validity coefficient of the dietary reference method, the way they are through intake and evaluate the application of the biomarkers of activity.

175
00:21:30,543 --> 00:21:37,263
In theory, when you are really interested in this one because this is what you are validating right there, how do you think different view?

176
00:21:37,703 --> 00:21:43,743
You are assuming that the reference there that it might be about your marker as opposed to be more or less good.

177
00:21:44,193 --> 00:21:51,453
But in practice sometimes, I mean they'll have to take for granted those things, but also to look at these two things.

178
00:21:52,803 --> 00:22:00,272
So the idea with these validity coefficients will be interpreted as a the same as you interpret declaration of confusion.

179
00:22:00,273 --> 00:22:06,723
I mean, they can go from -1 to 1, right? And the closer to zero then lower the validity, right?

180
00:22:06,723 --> 00:22:10,773
Because it's basically showing no association and the closer to one.

181
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:16,263
I mean, in theory, you get something negative that's pretty bad, right? Because basically showing you versus your T-shirt.

182
00:22:16,263 --> 00:22:18,933
Yeah, that's right. That's usually not not the case.

183
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:29,403
But the closer to one, the higher it is, the better the association and the higher the validity of the method to measure through anything.

184
00:22:29,613 --> 00:22:34,593
Right. Okay, so this is what I already say.

185
00:22:34,983 --> 00:22:38,942
So validity coefficients can interpret the same as you would interpret collection coefficients and

186
00:22:38,943 --> 00:22:43,383
represent the correlation of the dietary method you are trying to validate with a true index.

187
00:22:43,383 --> 00:22:48,393
Right? And we're going to use a data set called triads that you can find canvas.

188
00:22:49,053 --> 00:22:52,563
And this dataset contains information on two fatty acids.

189
00:22:53,043 --> 00:22:57,033
Okay, one is linoleic acid and the other is alpha linolenic acid.

190
00:22:58,623 --> 00:23:05,913
So those are the 2.5 fatty acids of the omega six fatty acids and omega three fatty acids.

191
00:23:05,913 --> 00:23:15,663
Remember, there are two essential fatty acids. And these are you will have information for those two fatty acids from the fifth cue,

192
00:23:16,443 --> 00:23:21,873
the 24 hour recall, and of course, is the mean intake of seven of them for an adipose tissue.

193
00:23:21,963 --> 00:23:26,163
So you have three measures for each fatty acid means you have six measures.

194
00:23:26,163 --> 00:23:33,362
Right. And this information was collected in 94 healthy adults from Costa Rica as part of our validation study.

195
00:23:33,363 --> 00:23:37,053
So this is the same remember the story I told you last week?

196
00:23:37,323 --> 00:23:40,533
So this is going to be relevant for the interpretation of this data.

197
00:23:42,843 --> 00:23:48,723
Do you remember where our following or any one of the main food sources in Costa Rica?

198
00:23:52,003 --> 00:23:55,103
Soybean and soybean.

199
00:23:55,943 --> 00:23:56,733
So. Yeah.

200
00:23:56,763 --> 00:24:05,343
And remember that soybean oil was partially hydrogenated and that was decreasing over the years, which can affect the amount of alpha linolenic.

201
00:24:05,353 --> 00:24:10,813
That's what we all like. So remember that because that that will be relevant for some other questions.

202
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:16,143
Okay. So the first thing you have to do is to calculate validity coefficients for this.

203
00:24:16,153 --> 00:24:21,523
If you did not for our recall for those two fatty acids, then like another linolenic.

204
00:24:22,063 --> 00:24:26,233
So you had to first calculate by correlation coefficient, right?

205
00:24:26,523 --> 00:24:29,563
And remember you have two fatty acids, so you have to do that twice, right?

206
00:24:31,963 --> 00:24:35,833
And I'm say here use lot transformations if needed because these are actually

207
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:39,222
based on correlation coefficient and these are you cannot use this BMI here,

208
00:24:39,223 --> 00:24:44,263
you have to use this one. So you feel that the variables are not normally distributed.

209
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:49,722
You will have to transform them. And again, this is in the eye of the beholder, right?

210
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:54,643
So you feel that it's okay, then you can live it and transform.

211
00:24:54,673 --> 00:24:57,853
You feel like by transforming it makes it worse.

212
00:24:58,183 --> 00:25:02,382
Don't transform it. Just justify that. That means you just going to add note to your analysis.

213
00:25:02,383 --> 00:25:05,833
And I prefer not to transform because of little. I prefer to transform because of that.

214
00:25:06,013 --> 00:25:13,633
Right. And I as useful I take everything as correct as long as you justify it properly.

215
00:25:13,723 --> 00:25:25,483
Okay. So also know that I'm asking you one more thing that I know it's something because you've been coming from adjusting for total energy intake,

216
00:25:25,693 --> 00:25:33,973
your last lab, and now I'm asking you again to do that. So I'm asking you to adjust the viability variables for total energy intake.

217
00:25:34,003 --> 00:25:38,593
You seem that I see myself as we learned previously and why I'm doing that,

218
00:25:38,593 --> 00:25:44,443
because you know that adjusting for totality they remove system age variation and cancels out errors.

219
00:25:44,683 --> 00:25:54,253
So that's that's something that you have to do when you're validating it with, you know, that you only have to do that in the reliability variables.

220
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:58,963
Okay. So if you and you don't have to do that for adiposity,

221
00:25:58,963 --> 00:26:08,083
please do not need to adjust because there's no doubt that we can take for the okay and then you will have to use in those correlation coefficients.

222
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:14,202
Basically you are going to do them in whatever I received was do get right.

223
00:26:14,203 --> 00:26:22,243
So the same you did last week, you have to do it now again and then once instead of using the original variable,

224
00:26:22,243 --> 00:26:26,833
you will use the calorie adjusted variable for the correlation coefficient.

225
00:26:27,103 --> 00:26:35,703
Okay. And then once you have the condition coefficients, you see maybe political reasons using the formulas provided before the ones that I show you,

226
00:26:36,943 --> 00:26:44,443
at least your as usual just cause that was the rest of the issues and evaluate the operations for for

227
00:26:44,443 --> 00:26:53,083
this part and the last thing is just interpretation looking at the validity coefficients that you get,

228
00:26:53,413 --> 00:26:58,333
what are your conclusions and try to write your conclusions in the context of what I complained about.

229
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:06,133
So we are all in Costa Rican class, so please go back to this license because I kind of like told you this story so that you will see that that study,

230
00:27:06,373 --> 00:27:10,333
your results will make a lot of sense thinking about this study.

231
00:27:10,513 --> 00:27:13,933
Okay. Okay. Any questions?

232
00:27:17,273 --> 00:27:23,063
Okay. So let's well, actually, let's take a break so you can go to Raul and then when we go back,

233
00:27:23,063 --> 00:27:27,593
then let's work in Paris and then I will be here too, to answer any question.
