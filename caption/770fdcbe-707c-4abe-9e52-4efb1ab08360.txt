1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:07,340
In this video will review measuring health related quality of life.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,720
How do we measure this utility or quality of life?

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,081
Well, we've got two categories of ways to measure this.

4
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:17,920
We have direct methods on the left and indirect methods on the right.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,856
The direct methods are the standard gamble, the time trade off and rating

6
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:27,240
scales and then indirect methods we have some health state classification systems.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,461
The direct solicitation methods are the standard gamble time trade often rating

8
00:00:30,461 --> 00:00:33,240
scale, which will walk through in a minute here.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,370
The standard gamble looks something like this.

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,210
You remember decision trees and the decision tree concept is enforced here for

11
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,840
the standard gamble method.

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,126
With the standard gamble method we offer survey people and

13
00:00:47,126 --> 00:00:50,461
offer them two options choice A and choice B.

14
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:53,010
Let's start actually with choice B.

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,759
With choice B you end up with they have a certain health state at chronic

16
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,840
illness health state B.

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,880
The bottom here.

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,509
And you live with that health state for the rest of your life for

19
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:10,499
a certain amount of time choice A however, is uncertain outcome,

20
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:14,596
with choice A you have a probability of being healthy,

21
00:01:14,596 --> 00:01:19,740
probability p of being healthy and probably 1 -p of dying.

22
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,655
And we ask the participant to make a choice between choice A and choice B and

23
00:01:24,655 --> 00:01:29,093
vary the probability to determine the point at which that person is

24
00:01:29,093 --> 00:01:32,940
indifferent between choice A and choice B.

25
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,827
So let's say we've gone through this process with someone and

26
00:01:36,827 --> 00:01:41,521
we've determined that a certain health state, this person is indifferent

27
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:46,581
between the certain health state and a gamble of 75% chance of perfect health,

28
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:50,880
25% chance of dying and they're indifferent between those two.

29
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,879
That point of a difference between the choices,

30
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:59,240
the probability of perfect health is that utility associated with that health state.

31
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,190
So that health state would have a utility of 0.75 person said they're indifferent

32
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:11,039
between that health state and a 75% chance of perfect health, 25% chance of death.

33
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,288
The time tradeoff also tries to get this zero to one value but using a different

34
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:21,010
method, here we think about length of time that someone would live.

35
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,753
So this diagram shows on the vertical axis value for quality of life, and

36
00:02:25,753 --> 00:02:29,040
then the horizontal axis is length of life.

37
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,895
And here we ask the participant to think of living a certain amount

38
00:02:33,895 --> 00:02:36,111
of time in a chronic illness.

39
00:02:36,111 --> 00:02:41,569
In this case, health State B for a certain time t and then ask them what period

40
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:47,711
of time, shorter period of time would they in perfect health would they considered to

41
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:53,940
be equivalent to a longer period of time in health state B, the chronic illness.

42
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,691
So an example might be, look something like this to someone will be asked to

43
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:00,966
consider their current health, all aspects of your physical and

44
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:04,550
emotional health that contribute to your quality of life.

45
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:09,153
Suppose you have 20 years left to live, think about what length of time in perfect

46
00:03:09,153 --> 00:03:14,740
health would be equivalent to 20 years in your current state of health.

47
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,880
And so we could ask that or we could ask someone would you be willing

48
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,120
to trade off five years to improve your current health to perfect.

49
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,429
And if they say yes, then we ask would you be willing to trade off seven years or

50
00:03:27,429 --> 00:03:31,341
if they say no, you say would you be willing to trade off three years and

51
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:35,518
kind of iterate going back and forth to determine how long and what length of

52
00:03:35,518 --> 00:03:41,740
time that person considered to be equivalent to their current health state.

53
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,875
How to turn this into the utility value?

54
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,971
Well, the utility is proportion of time in perfect health.

55
00:03:46,971 --> 00:03:48,674
That's equivalent to living for

56
00:03:48,674 --> 00:03:51,840
the specified duration of years in current health.

57
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,522
So an example, let's say the duration with the current health or the lower quality

58
00:03:57,522 --> 00:04:03,042
of life is 20 years and if someone said they're willing to trade one year off for

59
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:08,078
improved health, that's saying that they are indifferent between 19

60
00:04:08,078 --> 00:04:13,070
years with perfect health versus 20 years in this other health state.

61
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,834
So the utility for the current health state would be or

62
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:21,240
the worst health state would be 19/20 or 0.95.

63
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,054
So it's that ratio of time in perfect health versus time in the lower

64
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:29,320
quality health state.

65
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,181
Those are some of the direct methods, the indirect methods look something where we

66
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:36,890
take health state classification systems and

67
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,821
then turn that into quality adjusted life years.

68
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:45,021
Some common health state classification systems are the health utilities,

69
00:04:45,021 --> 00:04:50,040
index the HUI or the EuroQol 5-D or five dimensions or the EQ-5D.

70
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,456
The quality of well being score, sorry, scale or

71
00:04:54,456 --> 00:04:59,040
the short form six dimensions or SF-6D.

72
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,899
These indirect methods use a two stage method to assess community perspective

73
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:05,340
preferences.

74
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,146
So the first thing that happens is they take a community sample looking at values

75
00:05:10,146 --> 00:05:12,030
for a sample of health states.

76
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:17,604
So they give people a variety of fictitious health states and

77
00:05:17,604 --> 00:05:22,305
ask the community to assess the utility associated

78
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:26,810
with those various characteristics of health.

79
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:32,000
Then they ask a patient to describe the characteristics of their health state.

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,358
And then those community values for the different attributes of health are mapped

81
00:05:36,358 --> 00:05:40,463
onto the description from the patient to arrive at a community preference for

82
00:05:40,463 --> 00:05:41,940
that health state.

83
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,440
So let's walk through this what it might look like for the EQ-5D.

84
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,245
So EQ-5D is EuroQol 5-D of their five dimensions that are evaluated of quality

85
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:54,793
of life, mobility, self care, usual activities, pain,

86
00:05:54,793 --> 00:05:57,190
discomfort and anxiety, depression.

87
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,340
And in this case we have three levels of those dimensions, so mobility, you

88
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:08,140
have the three levels listed here, self care, you have three levels listed there.

89
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:13,428
So the first level is always no problems with that dimension and

90
00:06:13,428 --> 00:06:16,531
then the last level is the worst one.

91
00:06:16,531 --> 00:06:20,712
So for example anxiety/depression, the best is not anxious or depressed,

92
00:06:20,712 --> 00:06:23,607
the middle one is moderately anxious or depressed and

93
00:06:23,607 --> 00:06:26,640
the last one is extremely anxious or depressed.

94
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,321
So someone ranks would rate the health state according to these

95
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:35,540
different levels along these five dimensions.

96
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,295
Then community preference analysis has been done

97
00:06:40,295 --> 00:06:45,281
that translates those levels into a utility value.

98
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:49,110
And so there's some scoring mechanism that looks something like this.

99
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,940
So we subtract the relevant coefficients from 1.0.

100
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:00,820
So if someone has perfect in every dimension we don't subtract anything from

101
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:07,640
it but if if someone has any problem we subtract the constant of 8% or 0.081.

102
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,066
And then if someone has a a level two or level three issue under any one of

103
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:15,531
these characteristics, we subtract off that level.

104
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:20,498
So for example if someone has a level three problem with their mobility,

105
00:07:20,498 --> 00:07:23,440
we would subtract off 0.314.

106
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,041
The N3 term is subtracted if any dimension is at level three.

107
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:31,059
So if someone did have mobility problems of level three,

108
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:36,251
we subtract off 0.314 plus we'd subtract off this last piece here,

109
00:07:36,251 --> 00:07:39,440
the N3 coefficient of 0.269.

110
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,122
Anyway, the bottom line here is this stuff would have been evaluated by researchers

111
00:07:45,122 --> 00:07:50,190
to map the levels of those dimensions onto health related quality of life.

112
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,553
And so we can ask patients these questions about how does this health state affect

113
00:07:54,553 --> 00:07:57,634
their mobility, self care, usual activities, pain,

114
00:07:57,634 --> 00:08:00,040
discomfort, and anxiety, depression.

115
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,957
And then we use these community preferences to turn this into one of those

116
00:08:04,957 --> 00:08:07,640
quality of life levels.

117
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,573
If you're interested in finding where I find some sources for

118
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:15,971
these utilities, someone can actually directly collect the data.

119
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:18,827
They find a population to sample, choose a measurement method and

120
00:08:18,827 --> 00:08:20,840
actually collect the data directly.

121
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,030
There are many sources of utilities in the literature.

122
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,299
So many other people, other researchers have collected data, if so,

123
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,839
you wanna consider their sample and method to make sure it's appropriate for

124
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,840
what you're doing.

125
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,356
And the last is very nice resource called

126
00:08:35,356 --> 00:08:40,539
the Tufts New England Medical Center Cost Effectiveness Analysis registry.

127
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:45,220
And you can search that registry to find health utilities for

128
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,891
various health conditions, and that's it for

129
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:53,154
assessing health utilities and measuring them.
