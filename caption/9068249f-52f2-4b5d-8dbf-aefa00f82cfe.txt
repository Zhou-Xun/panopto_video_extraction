1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:08,520
She's I'm pretty sure she had some issues, but I mean, nothing new.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:16,920
It didn't really seem like everything she told us.

3
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:25,320
I talked to her. Yes. Oh, yeah.

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,870
Yeah. Here in the States.

5
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:45,500
The. Do you like my high school routine?

6
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,260
Absolutely. It's.

7
00:00:51,620 --> 00:01:02,330
It's okay. Yeah, it's a little bit. I mean, is it like a three hour class that's only just two weekends and you're done?

8
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,620
What kind of work?

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,370
Like, I can't. It's just a mortar. Yeah. Like, I can't check recording in progress.

10
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:31,060
Like, I came to America to take some time as see how they were to do something that's funny.

11
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:37,310
And I was like, oh, it wasn't important to.

12
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:44,720
Yeah. It was like, you know, it's not. It was like, well, you know, because the concepts.

13
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:54,900
Yeah. That you shouldn't ask specific questions will be harder within the term.

14
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:09,240
Do they hurt the classroom things. And they said they're going to.

15
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,820
Okay. Good morning, everyone. Morning.

16
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,650
So. We're management.

17
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:28,960
And then I would say there's no to class on Tuesday.

18
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,590
So I'm going I will be out of the country for a couple of frames,

19
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:49,470
but there will be class on Thursday and then I think that's going to be the last class and then we'll wrap up.

20
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:55,270
So we are doing perfectly on time in terms of the material.

21
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:06,130
So we are going to finish Monte Carlo simulation and we're going to cover that today and next Thursday.

22
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:27,220
And I feel it. Whereas, you know, let's say a contemplated the need or possibility of seniors in class in some circumstances that we went through.

23
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:39,780
But I know that now many of you have already made plans sort of traveling.

24
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:49,500
So I don't want to. And it wasn't the syllabus, so I don't want to violate anything that was in the syllabus at the beginning.

25
00:04:49,510 --> 00:05:02,380
So I will adjust that for the next offering of the class and it will be probably in clearly stated in the syllabus.

26
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:17,380
But for now, we're going to follow the plan of a week of probably the days I would have put in an exam like the midterm exam.

27
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:41,980
And, you know, as it always is going to be, I think I am going to try to monitor the designed exam so I can detect a lot of things that could happen.

28
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:53,020
But I am confident that a lot of it is good involved.

29
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:05,770
Even if you are particularly particular, you desire or you didn't do maliciously.

30
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:10,089
And that's a lot of pressure. Hopefully that's not an excuse.

31
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:15,910
But my point is, I trust that there's a lesson to learn.

32
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:28,750
We all learn from them that sort of maybe we as a class in general, everyone is very highly of you and we want you to be better.

33
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:35,860
And that's why we want you to strive for all of us every day trying to be better.

34
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,490
So now I am going to.

35
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,180
We did that in the.

36
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,290
It's going to problem 10.1. That's what.

37
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:32,790
And we are going to use at risk for time. And remember, in order to get at risk, you go to the icon on the desktop or you go to a menu.

38
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:38,880
You're looking for the programs, go to policy decision tools.

39
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,450
Then people at risk. 8.2.

40
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,080
It. It's.

41
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:20,610
David, is the video fixed or you didn't check?

42
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:24,720
You didn't even go. So check after complaining.

43
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:39,090
Let's think take EG Risk Inc. is a small company that designed processes themselves to sample their code.

44
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:49,560
The design team has labor for weeks over this new design for the coming winter season.

45
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:55,300
It is now time to decide how many ski jackets to produce in this particular production run.

46
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:01,710
Because of because of the lead times involved, no other production of runs will be possible during the season.

47
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:09,630
Predicting a ski jacket sales month in a month in advance of the selling season can be quite tricky.

48
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,870
At risk can be in operation for only three years.

49
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:21,380
Ski Jacket designs were quite successful in two of those years based on realized sales for the last three years,

50
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,210
according to the economic condition and professional judgment,

51
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:31,950
12 eight risk employees have independently estimated the mine for their new design for the upcoming season.

52
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:42,000
Their estimate is that the estimates are listed in Table two to assist in the decision on the number of units for the production group.

53
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,180
Management has gathered data in Table 10.3.

54
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:55,920
Note that as the price egress changes retailer, any jackets that do not sell during the season can be sold.

55
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:08,970
It support a discount to this counter for a B because they projected the fixed cost of land and equipment is F.

56
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,290
This course is incurred regardless of the size of the production run.

57
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:28,330
C. So that's that's a problem.

58
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,860
And interest management believe the normal distribution is reasonable.

59
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:40,210
It's a reasonable model for the unknown demand to be near what mean understand that information should eg is

60
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:48,280
used for the distribution use a spreadsheet model to simulate that thousand possible outcomes for the amount.

61
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:52,060
In the coming year we're going to use 5000.

62
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:59,860
What is expected? Profit is accurate. Produce is equal to 12,000.

63
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:08,170
What it has done that in view of profits in this case and they are going to sow more of the questions here.

64
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:17,740
So let's this is the table and data is table 10.2 and this is the table, table three.

65
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:25,450
So these are the estimated demand and demands.

66
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,400
These are demand. So the well, estimated demand.

67
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:38,320
Right. And what was you that you were trying to get?

68
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:49,570
So is if if you want to generate a normal distribution using this data, we think that this data came from a normal distribution.

69
00:11:50,860 --> 00:12:02,290
So we want to get a normal distribution that approximate these parameters implied by these data.

70
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:11,800
So we know that we the parameters are defined through normal distribution, our need the system validation.

71
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:18,430
Right. So the first thing I want to do is use you mean or the average of those numbers.

72
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:30,910
I'm desperate to be e an estimation of the mean of of the distribution that get me this sample in the standard deviation of the sample.

73
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:42,040
So let me make this. Our year and the mean is equal to the average.

74
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:55,430
All these numbers. I understand that.

75
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,670
Is t. T. E.

76
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,760
And is this all right? And.

77
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:17,530
It's a certain number. This is it. This up? And let's note that I want to.

78
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:42,460
Not that I want to change the meaning of the Senate in the issue, but what I would like is to show that without formalities, without without decimal.

79
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,130
So we have 12,000, 34 and 97.

80
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:16,460
We are going to use these two numbers as parameters for the normal distribution that we generate at the end.

81
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:35,460
These are going to be a lot of money in. Let's go to the model now.

82
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:49,050
So for that model, I have certain parameters that I need to feel that one of them does first and.

83
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:56,209
Will it start here? The variable cost.

84
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:03,740
The selling price is how the value of the things cost. Then you go back to the table.

85
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:10,340
Data. Variable cost setting price on the value of things cost.

86
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:19,910
So those are my monetary ideas. I'm going to copy them into the model.

87
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:37,070
Kimberly Coffey. A picture that we can see these better.

88
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:53,170
You know what is what you need to decide in this problem, whether it be, so what are we doing?

89
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:57,730
Why are we doing this program? To make you do what?

90
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:05,550
To help you. Figure out how many jackets to produce, how many jackets to produce, right?

91
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,120
So we need to get the proportion one. So these number here.

92
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:21,970
Let's say that is a managerial decision that we need to try several ideas to see which one, you know, is a reasonable number of jackets.

93
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:28,540
So let's say that I peak, let's put any number.

94
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,980
So let's say that I peak at 15.

95
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,220
So that's going to be my problem to me. My production quantity, right?

96
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,580
It doesn't have to be optimal, does have to be good.

97
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:48,910
It doesn't have to be feasible in something that I wouldn't use to feel that one cannot leave that zero.

98
00:16:50,870 --> 00:17:07,620
So now. I'm going to develop my my simulation here.

99
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,720
The first thing is the man, right?

100
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,880
And so I'm going to generate a demand for feedback.

101
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:27,150
So I'm going to I'm going to replicate I'm going to simulate many different scenarios, possible scenarios.

102
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:37,890
And the what is what is that is going to change in this scenario every time I replicate my scenario.

103
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:42,000
What is the main thing that can change that I'm not sure about?

104
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,380
So I know the production quantity because I fix the production.

105
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:57,150
So what is the state of nature here that things that you cannot totally know for sure what's going on, what's going to be.

106
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,410
The actual demand. The demand. Exactly.

107
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:06,100
You don't know what the demand is going to be. You know, that is random.

108
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:15,310
Is is this normally distributed with these mean and the standard deviation which is you looked have here.

109
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:21,240
So the mean of the demand is going to be equal to.

110
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:30,990
The table read out this number and it is standard deviation.

111
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,990
Generally. It's the.

112
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:47,620
Okay. So those are going to be influenced also, right?

113
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:55,429
There's all. Okay.

114
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:59,720
So how the mean and based on the evasion that's I cannot predict.

115
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:12,480
So in order for this and various to change, what I need to do is sample every time from that normal distribution and get it new possible.

116
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:22,370
Imagine another impossible demand. Therefore, here on demand, what do we do?

117
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:26,540
We put a fixed number. Or what do you think I should do here?

118
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:40,980
A random number. A random number that is normally distributed with a mean 12,000 and a standard deviation of 3496.

119
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:47,350
Right. So if we didn't have that risk, we know how to do it there.

120
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:52,200
So that normal ran and so we have at risk.

121
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,820
So we don't have to go to the basic functions in Excel.

122
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:06,760
We just simply go into the at risk capability here and figure out how we generate the

123
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:13,620
mean demand that is normally distributed with this mean and the standard deviation.

124
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:20,250
So now I'm going to go into the function and then the distribution function.

125
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,340
This is going to be continued, right?

126
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:33,720
And then the continuous distribution will look for a normal year.

127
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,479
What is normal likely is normal.

128
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:54,330
This is a specified in normal distribution with a traditional pelagic curve applicable to the solution of outcomes of many data set.

129
00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:02,850
So what is the mean? And the mean is going to be this number here, 12,000.

130
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:07,950
And what is the standard deviation this?

131
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:24,630
And then the usual thing to me is that. I'm in now and Don and I would have in that that is he at risk normal C 11 C 12.

132
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:32,940
Okay I can you know, and these are not always a good idea to anchor the parameters,

133
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:41,159
but we are not going to copy that anywhere but just for good practice.

134
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:51,030
So in case you repeat this experiment and then you forget to do it so as to having a good practice with that.

135
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:00,320
I know. There. And.

136
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:08,190
Okay. This is going to be. We'll come back to it later.

137
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:20,250
We'll come back to that because right now the man is, well, six, six, 7.1, four, four, three, five.

138
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,230
What? This. These are ASCII jackets, right?

139
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,209
So they cannot be fractions of this if we can approximate this key like that.

140
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:37,770
But if we want to be now, we're not solving leading up programs that I need to remain linear.

141
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:41,430
This, this model can be as accurate as you want.

142
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:56,160
So we know that one way to generate those into your numbers is just to take the decimal out and not just hiding the decimal,

143
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:01,540
but actually taken the decimal out and that we get, we think the rounding function.

144
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,680
So if I can get these, I would say. Round.

145
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:16,410
Open for to see and hear.

146
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:28,400
Oh. Zero. That means no. What I need is to whatever came from the river and took out all day.

147
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,100
Right. So now we have No.

148
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:38,130
13 one 181.

149
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:44,520
Let's perform a little bit better.

150
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:58,560
And really, we're going to have the the the thousand separator or the common.

151
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:15,430
So we have a new element. And the issue here is that we're looking at the expected value of the man, not exactly the money, because he's 12,000.

152
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:19,239
So this is in right now in Monte Carlo mode.

153
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,550
If you want to leave that fixed mode here, that.

154
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:31,160
You go to the settings, you'll see that what I've done is I have a static body.

155
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,330
So we have the right to perspective value.

156
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,720
So that means the stated value of the distribution.

157
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:51,650
And you know, the one that that is closest if you want to the tool to an empty you out in this case

158
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:59,490
that's going to be shown on this case is 12,000 so they mean this is blows out.

159
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:14,900
So if you want to generate a right now look at different numbers every time you press function nine and recalculate Excel,

160
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,610
you're going to be saying that this demand is going to change.

161
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:24,470
And that's what we want to do when we replicate thousands of simulations.

162
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:27,710
So that's how sense of iteration, right?

163
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,120
When we do so some iteration. Now, a question for you.

164
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:39,980
Is there a chance of these normal are these these that aren't going negative?

165
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,810
How do you how do you kind of estimate something like that?

166
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,730
It was over jackets from the last year. We also don't sell any this year.

167
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:00,100
Yeah. I mean by their then normal distribution.

168
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,780
So is there any way in ours if we know that in prices of more than half.

169
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:12,610
But if we are simulating and let the normal distribution go to plus infinity to kind of infinity theory,

170
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:22,620
there will be even three or four will be the possibility that you get a negative value of.

171
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,310
Then the question is,

172
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:36,909
is it likely do I have to do anything about or is that so improbable that something like that happen is not going to is not going to mean anything?

173
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:40,570
So let's what would you do about that?

174
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:51,280
So you know that the mean is 12,000 and the standard deviation is 74, 97.

175
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:57,220
So if we want to know how far to the left, you know, those numbers can be,

176
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:04,960
you know that between two all the way to a standard deviation, we get about 95% of the distribution.

177
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:09,400
Between three and minus three is standard deviation. We've got almost all.

178
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,730
So let's try, you know, three standard deviation to the left to see if there's any possibility.

179
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:19,240
So if we check for you will be okay.

180
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:33,900
I want to know what is 12,000 minus three times number radiation, which is 34, 97, right.

181
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:45,540
And 1509 So still, you know, pretty much in the in the positive.

182
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:56,610
So I don't think I have to worry about the chances of, you know, getting a negative number just so small that I wouldn't worry about that.

183
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:06,560
If I had to worry about that, I will make sure that I if something starts negative, then I put a zero instead.

184
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,770
So I do I need a statement or something to do that.

185
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:14,010
But this case, I, I wouldn't worry about that.

186
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:25,860
So this is going to be like anything. Let me freeze that by changing the display to fix it.

187
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,590
All right. Now question, how do I generate revenue?

188
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:42,540
So I have a demand of 12,000 and I have these parameters here.

189
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:48,890
So the the selling price is 800, you know,

190
00:28:49,680 --> 00:29:05,340
a hundred or so if my demand is 12,000 and and the production quantity is actually this, but not 15, but 15 stops of 15,000.

191
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:14,480
That would be too small. So my question is, how do you compute?

192
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:23,000
Give me some formula that will allow me, no matter what the number is here or what number is here.

193
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,340
Right. I can get the right. Right. How would you.

194
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:37,760
How would I do that? 18 times.

195
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:43,200
C7. Yeah. So in general, right.

196
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:55,980
When you say, okay. Right now I, I can sell 12,000 because I have more than enough to sell 12,000 and those to 1000.

197
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,879
I'm going to multiply that times the selling price.

198
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:07,530
Would you say 800 or. Right. So in in this case, I'm going to.

199
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,660
Is my, my, my revenue is going to be 1.2 million.

200
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:18,850
But my point is, in a general case,

201
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:33,560
how would you put a formula that no matter what number is here or what number is is here, then you get the right revenue.

202
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:45,230
And, you know, to make it even more simple to do the tag than actually to write the formulation.

203
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:54,110
I am going to name these these cells.

204
00:30:54,140 --> 00:31:03,240
I'm going to name that supply. This is what I have, right?

205
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:12,290
I know patterns of life and these I'm going to call that theme.

206
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:17,030
And the reason we get so familiar names.

207
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:25,290
So now we have these sell this gold demand and this so called supply.

208
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:37,260
And then I guess one based on demand and supply, just keep me informed me that that would give me the right price.

209
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:46,470
Revenue. This is. I'm between you and me.

210
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:54,290
Let me put this fairly price here. Sorry. Rice.

211
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:05,540
So. So.

212
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:14,930
Well, what would be it for me that should I say, is going to be priced in the times,

213
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:24,450
the demand, or it should be times of price, times the supply, or some combination of the two.

214
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:31,770
What do you think of the two times the price, the minimal of the two times the price?

215
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:40,709
And the question is why the minimum? Anybody else can explain to me why the minimum sentence demanded.

216
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:44,010
You're not going to sell that many. Yeah.

217
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:49,800
So the point is, you know, between what you have and what people want.

218
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:56,610
Right. Well, you can sell $100 is the smallest of the do it people.

219
00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:05,280
If I have a pen, they say if I have 20,000 jackets, people want 10,000.

220
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:12,290
Yeah, I can only sell 10,000. So because that's what people want, I get 10,000 leftover.

221
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:18,760
But if let's say that I have, you know.

222
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:28,380
10,000 involuntary so or I have 10,000 ski jacket and people will want 15,000.

223
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,130
Right I can not that the amount because I don't have enough.

224
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:40,500
So they they only they the most they can sell at $100,000 is my supply, which is 10,000.

225
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:44,970
I see. So is this more or less of the two that I can sell?

226
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:53,370
So my my revenue will be going to be equal to rise.

227
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:02,270
Terms cries. Times.

228
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:10,680
The minimum of the supply.

229
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:25,560
The demand. Okay.

230
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,990
So that's going to be let me make it.

231
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:55,720
Look, let me make this larger and clear from the formula that more explicitly and this is a relationship.

232
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:03,320
Okay. Let me also you noted what needs to be.

233
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:12,310
For clearer and clearer.

234
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:32,010
I am going to. You select the host the host regime and modify the sales so made on the rest of the content.

235
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,240
So that is playing in the audition.

236
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:44,520
So I'm going into alignment and then I grab the text, right?

237
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:57,160
So now I can go and click on my revenue formula and you can see that in one line.

238
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:04,360
So is the price times the minimum between the supply and the limit?

239
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:12,220
So right now my budget is 1.2 million my revenue.

240
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,820
But suppose that I change these number.

241
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,890
This number happens to be my production quantity.

242
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,560
I change that to 7000.

243
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:33,590
Right in this case is going to be 7000, which is the minimal of the two is going to be my you know,

244
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:38,090
I can only sell what I have and not what people want.

245
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:47,150
And then times times a hundred, then you get 700,000.

246
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:51,230
Right? Okay. So let's maybe like that.

247
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:59,100
So I have my seven, 7000, maybe I could make 15,000.

248
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:03,400
Very happy for just a minute. Okay.

249
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:11,710
Now, I need now a formula for the revenue that I'm getting for salvage value.

250
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:22,570
Right. So the idea is, whatever number of keys that I cannot sell, I can at the end of the day, at the end of the season or whatever.

251
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:27,160
Sell that for a discount price of $30.

252
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:32,530
Right. So I'm going to name this sale.

253
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:52,660
You recall that? So much price. Underscore the price.

254
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:07,410
So that's that's going to be that's going to be my son.

255
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,960
But the three daughters are going to be the right.

256
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:22,410
I realized that I'm still paying $80 for a jacket, that I'm setting that for losing $50.

257
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:37,790
You know, Per there is a key now question is give me a formula here that computes their revenue that I get for college,

258
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:45,870
you know, for the extra skis that I haven't been able to to sell anybody.

259
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:57,149
There's anybody this but supply minus demand time salvage price supply minus demand.

260
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:01,260
So that's the excess right times the salvage price.

261
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:10,680
But but what happens is the supply is smaller than the demand and it will be negative supply minus demand.

262
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:17,820
Right. So you need to make sure that you only sale the excess, right.

263
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,889
If it if there is any excess if there is no excess, then you cannot sell anything.

264
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,820
So the revenue is going to be zero, right?

265
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:41,250
So so that my point is, is okay to say supply minus demand, times the salvage price, if the supply is greater than it otherwise would, is zero.

266
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:48,960
Right. It's good we have done something like that in the past, I think.

267
00:39:49,170 --> 00:40:05,819
Right. And one of the one way to do that is it's going to be with if statement I told you another way is going to be like this.

268
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:17,070
So suppose that a right that is for me this is the max of the supply.

269
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:29,750
My man. Or zero.

270
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:41,889
Do you think that works like the if they. So if the supply is greater than the demand, that's a positive number, right?

271
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:47,550
Or less than after. So then you can peg the supply minus demand.

272
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:52,180
And between this positive number and zero, the maximal needs, that positive number.

273
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:56,110
So you compute that and multiply times the salvage price.

274
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:02,139
But if the supply is smaller than the demand, that number is going to be negative.

275
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,500
So in between the negative number and zero, the maximum is.

276
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:12,070
Between a negative number and zero. Which one is bigger?

277
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:19,839
Zero zero. Okay. So he's going to take zero and he's going to multiply that times that this average price.

278
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:26,740
So. So I'm going to multiply that times its average price.

279
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:38,810
And. So that's my formula for this holiday charged.

280
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:45,260
Well. Okay.

281
00:41:45,980 --> 00:42:00,310
And supply management from zero inventory match of supply line item APIs is parentheses so they don't need to spend.

282
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:07,740
And in. Then we could make a salvage price.

283
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,080
And, you know, it is going to be 15 -12.

284
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:21,390
12,000 is 3000. Then 3030 is these 90,000 that you see here.

285
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:30,850
It. Or might it?

286
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:38,260
Now, let's take a look now at the cost.

287
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:45,880
So I'm going to name these cells. This is the unit variable cost.

288
00:42:46,470 --> 00:43:02,230
The things cost. That it closed that you and Putin.

289
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:08,100
Lost. Pretty short.

290
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:16,860
So that's going to be like $80 a unit cost and this is going to be this sale.

291
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:29,570
It's going to be the fixed cost, right? Okay.

292
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:38,950
So you should know from your accounting class what the difference between fixed cost and, you know, union.

293
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:47,250
Of course. I actually from your econ class. Right. So what is the what is the fixed cost in an operation?

294
00:43:47,260 --> 00:44:04,780
They say that the fixed cost of a hospital or a fixed cost of a pharmacy, for example, any any enterprise that you are in involve.

295
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:10,420
So what, what, what what are the fixed costs? What does that 3%.

296
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:16,630
Don't tell me like this item but but in general what the fixed cost for a person.

297
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:35,950
Then take a look. Think about an emergency clinic or in a hospital or whatever.

298
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:46,809
And just very simple terms that fix the things cost is going to be the cause of

299
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:53,860
operating at that clinic or that hospital that is independent of the demand.

300
00:44:53,980 --> 00:45:01,330
No matter what demand you have, you need to satisfy those things you incur on those.

301
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:09,460
Because very early, like, let's say that is salaries.

302
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:22,140
Right. So in in in a certain amount of time, you are and you have that cost and that your payroll costs.

303
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:28,210
Right. So Field, you decide that I am going to start, you know, laying off people.

304
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:37,570
But you have before that kind of a decision for a while, you have something that satisfy no matter what they might feel like.

305
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:49,510
So every month you have to, you know, people get their salaries and, you know, the electricity, for example, power.

306
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:59,740
If you have an operation, regardless of your, you know, patient, more or less, or a customer,

307
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:08,080
you have, you know, they are conditioned to pay the power or the heat to pay.

308
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:15,750
So energy costs are pretty, you know, fixed. It is several things.

309
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,300
If you are paid mortgage, that mortgage is a fixed cost.

310
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:25,750
Right. So there are things that you incur no matter the size of your demand.

311
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:38,710
Well, those are the fixed costs. Now, the variable costs are the cost that you incur here, the volume of demand.

312
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:47,020
Right. So they more for for one extra patient, one extra customer.

313
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:50,349
You spend some resources on that person.

314
00:46:50,350 --> 00:47:10,830
So you let's say that the more you know, the more patients you have, then there are some more syringes that you use or,

315
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:16,660
you know, more, you know, supplies that can deal with that specific customer.

316
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,520
Right. That you need to you know, you need to provide.

317
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,880
So those are the, you know, variable cost.

318
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:30,700
So if you don't have any customer, then you don't spend any money.

319
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:36,070
If you have and the costs are start to grow depending on how many customers you have.

320
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:42,810
So so those are the, you know, the two fundamental basic type of cost.

321
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:57,220
So right now, what we are saying is that if we have a ski jacket production, right?

322
00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:09,010
So these fixed cost, no matter how many jackets you produce, how many quantity you produce, how much, how many ski skipjack you produce,

323
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:24,610
you're going to spend $100,000 for these production that the the variable cost will be depending for for every is key that the you that you produce.

324
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:35,420
The thing is you're going to spend $80 in materials and know things that you know.

325
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:52,540
They the manufacturing process of the boat that is key jacket which my body the whole day all the paraphernalia that goes into to the skin.

326
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:58,629
So there's a certain amount that, of course, that depends on, you know,

327
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:11,080
every time one extra ski jacket is going to cost you an additional number of dollars.

328
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:16,320
So and that is this $80 for this key, Jack.

329
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:25,000
Okay. So so now let's let's compute the variable cost.

330
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:30,690
And we know that we have fixed costs and then we will compute the profit.

331
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:37,120
So let's compute the total variable cost. And the total variable cost is going to be equal to.

332
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:51,360
To what? Maybe the production quantity times the variable cost the production quantity times the variable cost but the production quantity.

333
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:09,969
So we call that supply, right? Yeah. And in times the costs we call that cost.

334
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:21,620
How much one unit cost you cost.

335
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:35,040
Okay. So it's going to be the supply times that goes on.

336
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:40,960
In this case, we have very will cause is 1.2 million.

337
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,180
And the same thing as the revenue that you still have there.

338
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,640
But you have the salvage value and then you have your profit, but you have also bad things.

339
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:03,480
So let's compute the profit. So the profit is going to be all the revenues minus all the people, right?

340
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:14,460
So this is going to be my revenue for selling the the jackets that skin the skin jackets that.

341
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:22,310
And $100 so close.

342
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:30,400
Then I have. The salvage value.

343
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:39,420
And then I need to subtract the variable cost and then I need to subtract the

344
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:46,650
things cost that is not going to change and that's going to be things constant.

345
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:58,649
So that's going to be my main formula here. So it is going to be the two revenues, the, the, you know,

346
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:06,660
the the revenue of for sales then the revenue for this council that that's the salvage value.

347
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:16,770
And then I need to take out the number of all the costs of producing the units.

348
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:20,120
Right. And then the fixed cost.

349
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:27,750
And that's going to be made by my property. And in this case, I'm losing $10,000.

350
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:38,940
Right. If that happens, if I have a demand of 12,000 and then I have a production quantity of 1500, I'm going to be losing $10,000.

351
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:46,710
That's that's it. Be. Now, what I want to do is this is one reality session, right?

352
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:55,530
One single scenario. But I know that the demand is is not going to be 12,000.

353
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:59,150
So there's a lot of possibilities for that demand to be.

354
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:15,480
Right. So it's normally distributed around 12,000, but it can be, you know, any number of sorts of values, you know, around that that 12,000.

355
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:19,800
So what I'm going to do is get a lot of different scenarios.

356
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:26,880
And then at the end, I want to figure out statistics for that outcome, which is the profit.

357
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:35,160
And so I want to know what would be my at my expected profit, my average profit, what's the standard deviation for the profit?

358
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:38,370
What is the probability? The my profit is negative one.

359
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:44,460
So all kind of things that I want to to find out.

360
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:56,580
So in order to do that, this profit has to be a special number, a special value that an address focus on.

361
00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:07,670
So for those special values that you want to keep track code and so you want at risk sale to do to save all the,

362
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:15,510
the, the, the values of all the replications and then produce statistics.

363
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:19,090
Then you need to declare that as outputs, right?

364
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:25,350
If I want to add risk menu, then I go into output here.

365
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:35,700
And he says, define outward action. It's a command that allows you to create a lead to believe that a link that sells itself.

366
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:45,450
I am going to define that sale as my profit.

367
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,560
Right? So I'm going to call that profit. So I'm going to take.

368
00:54:49,800 --> 00:55:06,090
Okay. How about is on top of that, just to be sure I named that self profit seems in any case, I can manipulate that with Excel.

369
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:13,650
I leave it on. So for at risk is going to be code profit for sale is going to profit.

370
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:23,250
So we are set. Now what I'm going to do is change that to 5000 replications.

371
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:32,669
So you are not going to see all these numbers, but what you are going to see is the distribution of these of all these numbers.

372
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:36,120
And then we will get statistics about that.

373
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:40,410
So let me just simulate.

374
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:52,230
Here. Okay.

375
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:59,250
And that's how my outfit looks like. That's how my prophet looks like.

376
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:05,760
And this is, you know, in the valley side, millions here.

377
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:13,229
But that's the distribution of my prophet. And then the mean is -36,000.

378
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:26,520
So the average I'm losing body here and then a standard deviation is $204,000, a huge standard deviation.

379
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:31,830
So that's the low distribution.

380
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,740
So that's the 95% confidence interval.

381
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,180
So let me put the 2.5% here.

382
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:47,890
It's different. 5%, you're right.

383
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:58,920
And then my is between -490,000 to positive 200,000.

384
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:04,710
Right. That's my of my 95% confidence interval.

385
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:09,930
And, you know, I can ask for a lot of statistics.

386
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:18,610
So can you tell me why we have these big four here at 200,000?

387
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:21,700
What's that? So why do we.

388
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:25,800
We don't have a profit larger than 200,000.

389
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,930
So why do you think so?

390
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:44,790
What is the most profit that you can make?

391
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:50,640
What is the profit? The maximum is when your demand is.

392
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:59,390
What is the maximum profit that you can get? 200,000.

393
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:03,920
Yeah, well, you're. Let's take a look.

394
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:10,880
Let's say that your demand is 15,000, right?

395
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:17,420
Your demand is 15,000. So that means that you can sell everything right at $100,000.

396
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:27,260
So the 15,000 your you know, that's your quantity.

397
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:39,140
So you can't sell that. So for each one of these 15,000, you are generating a profit of 20.

398
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:51,739
Right. So. So then you've got 15,000 times ten is a ten and five is 15,000.

399
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:55,250
30,000 and then comes to 60,000.

400
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,470
Right. Yeah.

401
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:08,010
60 and 60,000. And the reason we're here so we have is variable.

402
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:12,430
Sorry. So there's 25 to 15000.

403
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,440
So. Oh. 15,002 is 30,000.

404
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,190
And then the times. Then the 300,000.

405
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:27,399
So you get 300,000 by sending is 50,000, 300,000.

406
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:32,590
And then you need to subtract. The athletes cost 800,000.

407
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:36,430
So the maximum that you can get is that 1200, 200,000.

408
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:43,810
So. Okay. So I understand that the horizontal axis is your profit.

409
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:48,490
Right. Yeah. But then what's the vertical axis? That's your production quantity.

410
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:51,730
So appealing. Oh, probability of both.

411
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:56,680
Okay. So it's super likely that you'll make.

412
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:05,720
$200,000. Yeah, well, is the most likely value is the most likely value.

413
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:11,070
And you can actually see that our is a probability by using close investment.

414
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:16,220
So figured out what the probability of getting this number.

415
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:26,560
So more than that, so 23.1%.

416
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:34,870
So this is what's called the probability density function, right?

417
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:38,730
So you have a spike at 200,000%.

418
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:46,900
But and the what is the probability of getting exactly two and 200,000?

419
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:50,860
So I can isolate this bar and it's 23.1%.

420
01:00:51,310 --> 01:01:00,250
And suppose that I want to say what is the probability of getting more than zero positive?

421
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:05,139
So so the probability of getting a positive profit.

422
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:09,850
Right profit, it is 48.4%.

423
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:16,000
But the probability that you get that, that you lose money are 51.6%.

424
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:24,399
So the graphic, right, you have a 48% probability of making more than $0.

425
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:33,850
If you produce 50,000 jackets and you sell 12,000 jackets, if you produce 15,000, no matter.

426
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:41,830
These is your set number here was realization. But you know, it goes to statistical advice on some of these thoughts.

427
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:50,380
Oh, okay. Okay. So it took the random value or like random values.

428
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:59,080
Okay. Yeah. Okay, thanks. So these number here, you still said they show this breed, right?

429
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:03,040
So for now, you want one number.

430
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:14,200
But the the statistics were computed with 5000 of replications with different numbers for money.

431
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,870
That's why you have the variability. All right.

432
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:27,220
So now we know how the you know what happens.

433
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:32,260
So you probably shouldn't go for 15,000 production quantity.

434
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:37,870
But the question is, how much should you produce that same?

435
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:49,960
That's a question. So what what we are going to do is create a table that will allow allows to get the day

436
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:58,350
to try several values of the production quantity here and compute the minimum value,

437
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:03,669
the maximum value they mean, the standard deviation and so on.

438
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:15,010
So I can of that so that iterations right or that is scenarios and figure out which one that we would like.

439
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:19,690
So here I'm going to add.

440
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:28,500
Probability of.

441
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:44,740
Untreated or equal to zero we are making in money.

442
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:52,400
The probability of getting zero exactly is going to be in this case zero.

443
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:58,190
So asking greater than zero or greater than or equal to zero is the same.

444
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:23,570
So what we're going to do now is I would like to leave to add a column at the beginning, and then I am going to call that column, this simulation.

445
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:28,180
Simulation number.

446
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:46,190
Because I'm going to do different scenarios, changing the production one to see which one I like the risk to put into the model year.

447
01:04:52,630 --> 01:05:03,080
Though, he says. Use a spreadsheet to simulate that, we need to find out some possible outcome for demining the coming year.

448
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,669
Based on this scenario,

449
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:17,450
what is expected profit if eg produce Q equal to 78 Honda skipjack what is expected profit risk of use Q Equal to 12,000 catches?

450
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:24,320
What is it that it will profits in these cases based on the same the two?

451
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:31,250
So this helps in the scenario how many ski jackets you produce to maximize suspected profit?

452
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:44,719
Well, that quantity. Q So what, what I'm going to do now is create a table that can allow me to test all of these numbers.

453
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:54,650
So I need to test 7800 the production quantity of the simulation, number one.

454
01:05:56,330 --> 01:06:03,170
Then simulation number two. Let's start from 7800.

455
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:04,280
Let's start the list.

456
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:17,630
This is start at 8000 and then we go in increments of 2000 or five over, let's say, go in increments of 500 until we check a lot of them.

457
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:26,140
So 8000. 8500.

458
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:32,110
And then it so knows the term.

459
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:46,260
12,000 will be a huge voting.

460
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:53,940
It's got up to 16,000 feet.

461
01:06:55,110 --> 01:07:07,850
So the number of simulations. We did 18.

462
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:36,240
Each. And then, yeah, I can extend this table or this format.

463
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:48,460
Just take. And.

464
01:07:49,790 --> 01:08:06,230
Net sales this quarter when I go all orders in the same include just getting through to.

465
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:17,920
Why? Okay.

466
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:30,050
So I'm going to, you know, do the same thing that I did before, but I'm going to be changing the production quantity.

467
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:36,080
First, I'm going to start with 70 808,000, 8500, 9000.

468
01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:41,670
And I don't want to do it manually as we did before.

469
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:52,400
I want to do an automatic process. So if there is a way in at least 2%, a number of parameters that you want to change from simulation to simulation.

470
01:08:52,970 --> 01:09:04,810
And that that is. Accomplish by if you let's say this is the moment I want to change that.

471
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:13,910
I want to try different values. There is a function in that risk and that, you know, you should remember that you are going to practice that,

472
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:24,580
but you should remember that this is the risk simulation and then take the risk same

473
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:34,550
table and I'm open parentheses and I am going to specify all the numbers that I want to.

474
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:40,049
Replicate. So they're going to be in order.

475
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:43,800
So then I close parentheses.

476
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:54,230
Right. So what happens is that at risk will know that simulation number one corresponds to 7000.

477
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:59,430
Simulation number two corresponds to 80,000, by the way, means by simulation.

478
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:07,320
So this is going to be equivalent of my putting setting 7800 here.

479
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:13,050
Right. And then replicate that run one simulation with 5000 iterations.

480
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:23,510
Get this, this then change the number and let's try 8000 and then run the simulation again with 5000 iteration and get this of this right.

481
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:26,730
So that's equivalent to what I'm going to do now.

482
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:31,100
So I am going when I go to add risk, right?

483
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:39,510
I am going to have at risk that instead of one simulation, I'm going to do eight things simulation.

484
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:50,540
A number of simulations here, which should match the number of entries you have in the racing table, is going to be 80.

485
01:10:50,890 --> 01:11:03,070
So what's going to happen is as soon as the race recognizes that you want to have more than one simulation is going

486
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:13,899
to look for a racing table function in the spreadsheet and then is going to take each value of the racing table.

487
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:17,410
And it's going to change it by simulation. By simulation.

488
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:20,820
So that's the that's the idea.

489
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:34,690
Now, how do I get these numbers in the proper place that needed the maximum, the mean of the standard deviation of profit greater than zero you.

490
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:42,040
But let's say that meaning I'm going to give you the first one is the mean and then I'll type.

491
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:45,430
They will do it because they remember those function.

492
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:50,080
But then you got to simulation results.

493
01:11:50,260 --> 01:12:01,900
In this case, we want the meaning, right, the minimal level simulation so that the simulation results.

494
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:17,770
See the show results, right. And then I'm going to look for it immediately.

495
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:22,270
And the minimum is going to be here.

496
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:34,420
Says Risk Min. Right. So the minimum of setting the minimum number of the simulation and the risk mean it has two parameters.

497
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:37,830
It has. First, the data source.

498
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,920
What is the meaning of what cent of output?

499
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:47,500
Right. And in this case, I have my output here, which is the profit.

500
01:12:47,950 --> 01:12:50,019
Okay. And call that profit. So, you know,

501
01:12:50,020 --> 01:13:02,950
that is that that data source that at that address is accumulated is taking that 5000 replications and the net result of been getting a statistic.

502
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:15,370
So I'm telling addres to put the meaning one of those files outside them and then that will correspond to the simulation number one.

503
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:24,810
Right. So simulation number one into a Z and then clicking.

504
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:34,780
Okay. So what happens is if I if I replicate this formula.

505
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:48,770
This is going to be the meaning of simulation of a one.

506
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:53,630
This is going to be the minimum profit of simulation number two.

507
01:13:53,640 --> 01:14:05,410
But because we haven't done simulation number two right now is not available because one, the same thing I'm going to do pointing to the reason.

508
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:09,620
Right. And then. And then I can.

509
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:14,120
Right here. Risk, Max.

510
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:25,580
Open parenthesis. And then the first parameter is the the data source in this case is profit.

511
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:32,060
I don't need to answer that because I already call that profit and it automatically I sell.

512
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:37,850
And then I'm going to say the number of the simulation that profits from simulation number one.

513
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:42,560
So I click on the 822 so I can copy that formula down.

514
01:14:44,370 --> 01:14:58,680
They they mean is whether you think the formula to get the mean is there the function you go to the intuition very good.

515
01:14:58,980 --> 01:15:09,260
So we have the minimum risk mean the maximum those risk they they mean is risk mean.

516
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:19,210
So this is going to be is. And then we got a profit.

517
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:24,040
And then the number of the simulation, which is simulation one.

518
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:35,110
Standard deviation you might guess that is the risk is.

519
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:40,460
Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.

520
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:44,570
So the risk is.

521
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:49,160
Dee dee dee dee dee dee.

522
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:56,510
And then the parameters are the data set.

523
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:01,280
The number of the simulation. Simulation, number one.

524
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:08,710
And. Okay, so.

525
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:13,030
And then here, what is the probability of?

526
01:16:16,350 --> 01:16:21,390
What is the probability of the profit being greater than or equal to zero?

527
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:28,649
Well, the easiest way to do that,

528
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:37,410
there is a function that that tells you what is the probability that the output is less than or equal to a tiny number.

529
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:52,600
So if we go to that function here and then go into output simulation results and then we have a target return

530
01:16:52,680 --> 01:17:00,240
as the cumulative probability for a target value in the simulated distribution for sale output or input.

531
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:14,910
So if I use that risk target and I say I want to the restarting of that output, which is my main profit and ending and the target is zero.

532
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:22,290
So I want, I want to figure. So what I'm asking is what is the probability of getting zero or less?

533
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:26,580
I want to get the probability of getting more than zero or zero more,

534
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:31,740
which is going to be the same thing in this case, because zero has zero probability.

535
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:40,810
So I what I can do is say one minus the risk target of zero, right?

536
01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:50,010
So I will go to the mean apply the risk targets first and then I put the one minus later.

537
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:56,760
So this is going to be sort the data source and the data source is going to be the profit.

538
01:17:57,450 --> 01:18:01,440
The target value is going to be zero. This is what I need.

539
01:18:01,770 --> 01:18:05,760
And the simulation number is 822 here.

540
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:09,180
Right. So it's three numbers.

541
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:14,580
I need four. Now, this is going to give me the probability of getting zero or less.

542
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:26,400
If I want zero or more, then I do one minus nine minus because the whole distribution is the area is one.

543
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:39,290
The probability of getting any any of them, you know, all the values of any of the targets is taken out from the whole range of possibilities

544
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:51,360
is one and I'm then I click enter and then now I'm ready to copy this formula down.

545
01:18:55,580 --> 01:19:02,030
And then I'm going to start my dating simulation and see how fast it goes.

546
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:29,120
It's not it's not as low as they are.

547
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:58,900
It's working really hard to do animation at some stage in the future.

548
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:17,460
But if I can be like, okay, I can close the ears and they have all my simulation results right now.

549
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:27,090
What are the minimum? The maximum they mean the standard deviations and the probability of generating profit.

550
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:32,670
Right. The the maximum one, I think is at 7800.

551
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:39,120
They probably don't get any profit with 7800, these 92%.

552
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:49,520
So they're one thing. And then the last thing I am going to do today is plot the production quantity and gangs.

553
01:20:50,610 --> 01:20:56,640
They mean what the expected value of those profits.

554
01:20:56,790 --> 01:21:08,250
To see how they look. So I am going to go into home and sorry, insert and then charge.

555
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:12,390
And then I'm going to get this one.

556
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:28,530
This is how they look for the maximum expected profit happen with the same rate with a production quantity of 10,000.

557
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:32,510
Right. And after that, start to decline, decline, decline.

558
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:41,520
You know, by the time we get to 14,000 is pretty much zero or less, a little bit less than zero expected profit.

559
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:47,250
And you remember that we went to 15,000 before and it was negative.

560
01:21:47,410 --> 01:21:51,130
Okay. Here we go. The same thing.

561
01:21:51,150 --> 01:22:05,790
Right. So here we are on a spec dacian losing 55,000 250365 to $51 on average.

562
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:15,420
So you have these, for example, is is your return expected return?

563
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:21,360
Right. So you can go through that. And if you want to incorporate risk.

564
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:37,740
Right. You would go on to include but make another graph if you want and figured out the risk of the use of the production quantity.

565
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:53,030
So if I go and go into production quantity and the probability of the probability of getting more than zero.

566
01:22:53,370 --> 01:22:57,650
So I go insert and.

567
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:09,160
That's pretty much going down from 7800.

568
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:16,660
So the probability of getting, you know, getting profits out of this is pretty high at the beginning.

569
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:20,920
But then it goes down, down, down, down, down.

570
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:24,370
Up to 16,000 is pretty low.

571
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:39,580
So this is telling you how risky those investments are or those that those decisions are and these how profitable they are on this big issue.

572
01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:45,010
So you have to balance it. All right. Let's leave that for now.

573
01:23:46,240 --> 01:24:01,629
Remember, you can e-mail me or ask for any help, but we won't have class on Tuesday, but we will have class that for those of us, if we have a mac.

574
01:24:01,630 --> 01:24:05,170
Are you able to tell us, will we need the Rus virtual lab for the final?

575
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:14,220
If if you have a man who need that, people have anything that the other groups have and probably say the to you.

576
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:32,760
Thank you so much for listening.

577
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:38,530
We'll have you come back soon.

578
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:50,770
I know this is actually something that works for all, so I don't know how you feel about that.

579
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:54,600
I do. That's what she gave me.

580
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:59,470
I did this. Let me.
