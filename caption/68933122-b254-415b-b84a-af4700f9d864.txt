1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,900
And we will get started. Let's get started.

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,900
All right. So mapping is a method used to control confounders.

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,929
It's a partial restriction in the selection of subjects.

4
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:23,670
And people are usually matched on risk factors for disease or other logistical factors, such as time or place.

5
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,920
And matching is really actually quite useful for improving statistical efficiency.

6
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,460
You'll find that matching is more common in case control studies than in cohort studies.

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:49,530
In case control studies, what you're going to see is that controls are matched to cases in cohort or in cross-sectional studies.

8
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,460
Unexposed subjects are doing damage to exposed subjects.

9
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,690
So for matching, what are we match?

10
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:09,960
We ought to match on risk factors for the disease we may match or in place or time we can match within families or social networks.

11
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,830
And sometimes the subject is going to be matched to themselves.

12
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,629
And that's where we are doing those kind of short exposure to remember the cell phone example, for example,

13
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,300
where people were matched for themselves to look at driving and prior weeks on that same day.

14
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,740
There are two types of matching. You've got individual or overall categories of matching.

15
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:45,240
Got individual matching. And so for each case or exposed person, you know, depending on the study design, one or more matched controls are selected.

16
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,370
This type of matching may require special analysis.

17
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,420
It depends on what you're matching on, and we'll go into that.

18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,049
And then we've got frequency matching or group matching where the proportion of controls or

19
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:08,610
unexposed individuals with a certain characteristic or characteristics are is identical.

20
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,860
So the cases are exposed individual. So you're matching on those things.

21
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:18,750
So you might like for here you can match on something like age and sex, for example.

22
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,290
Right. And you're just looking to have kind of the same overall distribution.

23
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:27,090
You're not taking like a 45 year old woman and matching it to a 45 year old woman.

24
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:37,800
Right. But overall, you'll have a partner with the same kind of males and females in the study and the same kind of distribution of ages.

25
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:44,550
So example of that is where 25% of cases are exposed, individuals are married.

26
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:54,330
Then you would select 25% of controls that are that are married can involve any selection ratio.

27
00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:00,450
Might it be even less than one comparison per case or exposed individual?

28
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:10,500
So this is one way of matching where you don't necessarily lose cases if you don't have a match for each case or for exposed individual.

29
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:20,490
No special analysis is needed for frequency matching, although we do want to control for the variable that we're matching on.

30
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,280
If the passenger is related to the exposure.

31
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,649
Eventually we'll go into that.

32
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:43,580
But like if you're doing if you're matching on spec, for example, then you would do a regression test in the regression.

33
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,800
And depending on the study design, we'll go over that. If you don't do it, it may or may not for this trial.

34
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,800
So there's two methods for selecting comparison subjects.

35
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:10,720
There's category matching, where each set of comparison subjects is selected, preferably randomly,

36
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:20,620
from the same matching category or stratum, to which the index subject case by case less exposed person belongs.

37
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:28,300
So in the category match, you might have one categories individuals 45 to 49.

38
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,700
Right. So you would randomly select somebody or several somebody is from that same stratum,

39
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:40,719
but you might also, you know, you might have a number of categories that you're matching on.

40
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,770
Maybe you want to match on age, smoking status and exercise levels, for example.

41
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,880
And you're just saying exercise or exercise or something kind of simple like that.

42
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:59,200
There's also caliper matching where each set of comparison subjects is selected to have values on the

43
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,210
matching variable that are close to the corresponding of the corresponding value of the index case.

44
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:11,740
So you can have a fixed color for matching or something where you're saying kind of like for example, plus or minus two years.

45
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,830
So we're going to not match exactly on age.

46
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:23,350
So we've got a 45 year old woman and you say, okay, well, I'll take another woman who's within plus or minus two years of at 45.

47
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,210
There's also variable caliper matching where you select the closest match.

48
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,530
This is distance matching and then you can get a little bit more into detail than that.

49
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,460
There's also there's kind of called green matching and then optimal matching, which I don't think I have in here.

50
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:58,750
So if you have this going to be my wonderful people here and we will mark our cases with a a C here,

51
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:07,389
let's say we've got a person, you know, kind of a Westerner who's a possible controlled, controlled L Right.

52
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:16,700
And we've got a person here. In a greedy match, you would match this person to this person.

53
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,870
But this case might not have a match. Yeah, right.

54
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,400
Whereas for optimal matching, what happens?

55
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:30,050
This is of course, a very, very, very simplified version of it.

56
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:38,780
You end up matching this case to that person, to that control and that case to that control over there.

57
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:47,400
Right. So that each each case is a quick match or almost all of the cases are never quite so optimal.

58
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,950
And then once. Yes. That's how most dating apps work.

59
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,380
They try and, like, match the most number of pairs, even if you have a better match or someone else doesn't have, like, you know, one.

60
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:06,349
Now, that is interesting. Another fun fact of dating apps actually is Match.com.

61
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:11,720
The algorithm developed by Match.com was developed by guy who's actually a epidemiologists,

62
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,040
funny enough, who used to work for the CDC, isn't there anymore.

63
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:22,190
But yeah, there's a lot of similarities in that.

64
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:26,330
And I guess so I thought I did not know that other than other fact.

65
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:34,770
Well, searching for the. Well, it depends.

66
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,070
It could be physical distance if that's what you're marching on.

67
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,200
But it could be age. It could be other characteristics of the people.

68
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:49,019
It might even be kind of a you know, often this will be done with a propensity score, which we'll go into a little bit.

69
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,180
Right, as well. So there you go. Okay.

70
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:01,350
So get data for distance watching. Okay.

71
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:07,110
Fixed ratio matching is the ratio is the same for all index subjects.

72
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:13,139
So that would be the case or your exposure person. So, you know, per case, I'm going to select one control or four case.

73
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,410
I like to control variable ratio matching.

74
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:21,720
On the other hand, the ratio varies among match sets. This might be by design.

75
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,640
For example, if you use sibling matches, people have different numbers from siblings, right?

76
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:43,440
Although I would say, you know, more commonly you see it because of nonparticipation or missing data or difficulties in finding matches.

77
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:50,879
So you might need to have four controls per case, but maybe you don't have for people that actually match up to that case.

78
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,740
So some cases may have one match, whereas others would have all four.

79
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:05,580
So issues in matching in case control studies, you cannot study the factor that you match on.

80
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:13,000
And this is because you're artificially making the proportions of that exposure are the same in both your cases and your controls.

81
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,710
In cohort studies, however, you can study the factor that you match on.

82
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,660
Another big issue and we'll talk about it in more detail, is over over matching.

83
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,690
And that's just where you're making the two groups who are similar. Right.

84
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:35,860
So you're actually introducing bias because of that frequency matching.

85
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:43,090
Is that the joint distribution of matching variables and the comparison group is similar to the corresponding distribution

86
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:50,410
in the indexed group subjects and for a frequency match are typically not selected until all the cases have occurred.

87
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,650
It can involve any any selection ratio, including less than one.

88
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,480
So you could have, you know, 400 cases and 100 controls.

89
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:11,760
But you're going to say, you know, 53% of them are women because 53% of your cases are women.

90
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:20,070
Right. So frequency matching versus individual matching in case control study in principle,

91
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,780
frequency matching is preferred to individual matching and case control studies.

92
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:35,610
So and that's because controls can be selected from random randomly for mutually exclusive categories of the base population.

93
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:43,560
So it's in principle, it's not always possible. There are reasons why we need to do an individual match for studies and we'll go over that.

94
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:52,559
Uh, so for matching for the analysis, as I already said,

95
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,550
the analysis of the match data should take the matching variables into consideration through some form of stratification.

96
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,130
Matching may not be sufficient to control for confounding.

97
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:14,910
And we'll show an example of that. The major advantage of matching is really that it makes us very more statistically efficient,

98
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:21,720
meaning that you can get more narrow confidence intervals with fewer participants.

99
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:31,740
And that's really because you're balancing the ratio of comparison to index subjects across strata of these matching variables.

100
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:45,640
So for analyzing match data, we'll go through a matched analysis today in the in class activity.

101
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,649
So you've got to take the matching into consideration for the analysis there.

102
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:54,790
Kind of two general math methods. One is a stratified analysis, right?

103
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,720
You can be used for either category or frequency matching.

104
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:11,380
This will be most efficient analytically and it's going to ignore the match sets and stratified on the matching variables for a matched analysis.

105
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:17,410
It's a special form of a stratified analysis where each match match set is its own

106
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:26,660
straight up must be used whenever the match sets are really matched in a unique way.

107
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:34,270
And what I mean by that is if you're matching on time, for example, or caliper matching,

108
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:39,170
if you're matching on a friend, right, then you can't break that match set.

109
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:43,740
You're going to need to use matched analysis, which we'll go through, like how to do that by hand.

110
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,370
But you can also think like, you know, conditional logistic regression.

111
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:48,910
Right.

112
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:59,500
So the match analysis is going to preserve those match sets, but you actually only get information from those match sets that they're discordant.

113
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:12,370
Right. So market analysis can be used with individual and category matching, but it does result in a loss of precision.

114
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:18,620
So like back when I took the cover of Section one, I remember like kind of getting that,

115
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,759
you know, really drilled into me, never break the match, you know, never break the match.

116
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:30,649
But actually, in fact, statistically, it's more efficient to do a stratified analysis or regression analysis,

117
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,070
taking into account the factor that you're matching on.

118
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:40,580
Right. If it's not a unique match, when it's a unique match, do not break the match.

119
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,480
Right. Uh huh.

120
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:53,300
Uh, you can, you can use a stratified analysis or a regression analysis when you are doing caliper matching.

121
00:13:54,590 --> 00:14:04,069
The problem is, is that it will often results in residual confounding and it might lead to to a loss of precision in that analysis.

122
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,760
And that's why the preference would be to do a matched analysis in that case.

123
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:19,370
So match analysis needs to be done with individually matched designs for the matches unique on the only information

124
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:25,280
for discordant pairs is going to be used and two by two tables will be constructed with the matched pairs.

125
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:29,690
Each observation in the in the table represents a pair.

126
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,650
All right. So that's what a match analysis as well. Go back to that in a moment.

127
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:42,290
You mean it could be 1 to 4?

128
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,190
Right. And then you're going to have to take into account each pair still.

129
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,590
Right. Because some will be concordant and some will be discordant.

130
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:57,400
You're still going to throw out the concordant ones, even though that case will be in four different pairs.

131
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:01,490
Right. If it was a 1 to 1, if it was one case for four controls.

132
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,720
I mean, there's just like this is unique. It's just the individual pair.

133
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:18,950
Yeah. All right. So we're going to go into two matching in case control studies and we'll go through that that analysis and in a moment as an example.

134
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,110
And then in class as well. So right controls are going to be matched to cases.

135
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:33,980
You see a lot more matching in case control studies than you see in in cohort studies and certainly can do in both.

136
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:44,510
So here we have an example of a here's kind of our stable base populations or a hypothetical cohort.

137
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:52,610
We're looking at the relationship between beta carotene, which is our exposure here and the incidence of lung cancer.

138
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:58,700
But you're concerned that smoking might be a confounder here.

139
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:07,160
Right. So here is your overall kind of cohort or both full based population data.

140
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:23,210
Does it look like smoking is a confounder? Look at the top table here for smokers, we get an IDR three for non smokers, we get an IDR three.

141
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,320
But for the crude, we get an idea of 5.06.

142
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,340
So is smoking a confounder. Yes.

143
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,420
Is smoking a fact modifier? No. Right.

144
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,670
Okay. So that's our base data. Now we're going to do an unmatched case control study.

145
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:52,700
So we're going to take our 52 cases from up above and we're going to randomly select 52 controls from the study, from the entire study population.

146
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,610
And what you can see, you know, when you do that, you know,

147
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,250
and we're going to stratify by smokers, nonsmokers, we still get the same odds ratio there.

148
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,070
The crude odds ratio is is still confounded.

149
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:15,469
Right. We get the same odds ratio. Well, we get the same loss ratio as IDR, so 5.06 And then of course, because this is confounded,

150
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:23,870
we want to calculate a handle odds ratio, we get 3.0 and a confidence interval of 1.16 to 7.73.

151
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:33,320
So smoking is a confounder in our relationship between beta carotene and lung cancer,

152
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,560
and it's being controlled for right here by this stratified analysis using our mental handle.

153
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:48,650
Okay. So now we're going to do a matched case control study.

154
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:54,170
So up here, once again, same table with our base population, just to remind you of the findings there.

155
00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:01,040
Now we're matching our cases to controls on our confounder, which is smoking here.

156
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:13,910
Right. And what you see is when we first help, when we stratify, we get the same odds ratio as IDR in the street at 3.0.

157
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:26,420
But here's our crude now. So what happened with our crude? Is our crude confounded completely?

158
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,840
Not quite. We matched we so we kind of matched to try to deal with confounding.

159
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:37,669
But it's not completely unfounded. Even though we matched on it.

160
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:47,720
Right. So remember, we need to make sure we introduce that matching variables into the analysis so we end up with a handle right here of 3.0.

161
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:58,280
But our crude is at least much closer right to the unbiased estimate, but it's still a little bit biased.

162
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:06,200
So matching here is not, per say, eliminating all the confounding due to smoking crude is still a little bit off.

163
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:14,210
All right. But now let's look at our unmatched case control study compared to our matched case control study.

164
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:19,250
Right. Same number of participants. We get the same real handful estimate.

165
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:30,260
But what do you notice here? Confidence intervals, right.

166
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,950
So the confidence interval and the unmatched I'm sorry, I've got the point over it.

167
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:41,040
Couple the unmatched case control study, you know, same number of participants.

168
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:49,950
But it's a lot, you know, it's wider than the confidence interval in the matched case control study.

169
00:19:53,490 --> 00:20:01,440
So here you know once we've adjusted for the confounding so we have smoking in the analysis in this case we've stratified by it right?

170
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,910
We get the same mental handle odds ratio regardless of whether or not we matched,

171
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:16,110
but there's a gain in statistical efficiency and we see that in, you know, having smaller confidence intervals.

172
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:30,330
Uh, so the gains tend to be the greatest when the number of cases in cohort in case control studies are small, um, in cohort studies,

173
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,920
the gain is going to be the greatest is going to be greater when the association

174
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,910
between the matching variable and the exposure variable is really strong.

175
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,049
And then in case control studies,

176
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:51,290
it's going to be the greatest when the association between the matching and the disease occurrence is stronger in the base population,

177
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:59,180
you know, so matching in particular will really help you with data efficiency if you've got a small study.

178
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:06,000
Um, something to remember. Okay.

179
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:17,430
So a matched analysis and a case control study. Remember, we need to only do this if individuals are individually matched, okay?

180
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:23,930
And that match is unique and the only information from discordant pairs, as you see.

181
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:29,579
And that's why this is like not our preference because we're collecting such data we're not using, right?

182
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:45,030
So it's not going to be as efficient. So when you do set up aa2 by two table for a matched analysis, remember that each cell here is not a person.

183
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:52,350
Right. There's a two here and a that would be two pairs where both the case and the control were exposed.

184
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,790
Right. And see here if there were four people here, it's two pairs.

185
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,780
So eight people where the control is exposed and the case is unexposed.

186
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,739
So the easiest way to do this is you're going to go just count up the pairs and then

187
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,900
you're going to put them into a two by two table based on your exposure status.

188
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:20,219
Right. This is a case control study.

189
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:27,630
If we were doing it for a cohort study, what do you think we would be basing it on exposure or disease status for our pairs?

190
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:38,830
Case control is going to be. Oh, sure. Disease.

191
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:47,159
Yes, because for exposure status, for measure, we're matching each exposed person to a unexposed person.

192
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:53,250
Right. So they would all be discordant, discordant on exposure status in a in a cohort study.

193
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,630
So, yeah, so it would be disease status. All right.

194
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:06,540
So calculating a matched pairs analysis here we've got E is for exposed and is for not exposed.

195
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,869
Right. We've got our pairs here. Remember, our case could be match.

196
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:13,650
So what? More than one controls one more than one control and vice versa.

197
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,100
But you're still going to represent each pair separately.

198
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:24,060
So we're just going to count up the number of Paris and put them into a two by two table.

199
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,410
So here we've got exposed. Exposed.

200
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:35,969
So we get a two here. And now we're looking for exposed cases, unexposed control.

201
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:47,549
So one, two, three, and this one, four, there controls are exposed and the cases unexposed.

202
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:51,840
So right here we just get one of those and then not exposed.

203
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,959
Not exposed. So we get 1 to 3. Right.

204
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,990
And you're going to pop those into that two by two table.

205
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:10,120
Once again per cohort, you would just do it for disease status here and then we'll calculate that matched pairs odds ratio, right?

206
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:18,650
Which is B over C, we're only using the information from the discordant cells.

207
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:22,840
So here where they're both exposed or both not exposed.

208
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:26,480
Right. We're just we're not using that information from this from those pairs.

209
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,290
All right. So here we've got an example.

210
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:37,880
You can read through that and calculate out that matched pairs analysis.

211
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,400
Oh, and as a separate note, like this was actually a match.

212
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:56,760
They did a master analysis, but the original study didn't require a matched analysis.

213
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,870
I can I tweeted a little bit so that it required to be able to pull the paper and really match

214
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:08,080
entirely what they did just because they didn't really analyze it the way they ought to have.

215
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:21,410
All right. Do we have that watch ratio, the match odds ratio?

216
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:29,540
It's going to be 18 over seven. Right. We're just using the information from these discordant cells.

217
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:37,480
2.57. If I asked you how many people are in the study, what would you tell me?

218
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,990
I'm relying on you, Katie, to add to that. I don't have that information here.

219
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:06,100
How many people are in the study? Oh, yeah.

220
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:10,540
168. Yeah, it should be it.

221
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,720
Yeah. No, it's 84 children with brain tumors and then they're matched to neighborhood control.

222
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:22,140
So we're going to end up with double that number, I guess. Although, do we actually like this up in the table?

223
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:27,330
We have 71 oh 71 pairs.

224
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:41,220
Someone pairs 142 total. I guess we dropped we lost some of the vacation somehow, so we don't have pairs for them.

225
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:45,689
But this happens in papers all the time and they tell you you have a certain number,

226
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:50,190
but then you go and you're like, Wait a minute, where do you lost like 30%?

227
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,329
I mean, where did they go? You know, I actually never noticed that before. I'd never asked that question.

228
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,420
So add that on there. Yeah.

229
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:02,999
The thing I changed here was I made it a neighborhood control. They hadn't matched on neighborhood.

230
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,340
I can't remember what they had matched on, but whatever they had matched on didn't require an individual.

231
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,779
An individual. It wasn't unique.

232
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,470
Right. So they could have done a different analysis. Um.

233
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:26,340
So. All right. So failure to address matching in the analysis tends to introduce bias in case control studies,

234
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:33,029
and it's typically going to bias towards funnel matching on a variable usually eliminates

235
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:38,010
the ability to estimate the effect of the variable on the outcome in case control studies.

236
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:46,770
Right. So for matching in cohort studies, unexposed subjects are matched to exposed subjects.

237
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,590
It's not uncommon in some case control studies to surface.

238
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:59,160
Ignoring the match in cohort studies generally is not going to introduce bias, but does result in a loss of precision.

239
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:06,000
There are exceptions to that rule where you will see it introduce bias, but generally it's not.

240
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:20,430
Okay. So what we're basically doing in a cohort study with a pairwise match is where we're stratifying each type of pair into their own stratum.

241
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:27,900
Right. So we've got type one people where they're reported, right?

242
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:38,550
We've got both the exposed and unexposed individuals develop the disease, either from the causal kind of like this.

243
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:47,670
These are doomed individuals. Right. We've got two type two people, individuals or pairs, really, where they are discordant.

244
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:53,970
So exposed individuals develop the disease, but unexposed individuals do not develop disease.

245
00:29:54,450 --> 00:30:03,809
Right. And this is where the new exposure is positive. And we've got our type three individuals, three pairs where they're discordant.

246
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,900
And again, these are the preventative folks, right?

247
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:14,670
Where the explosive variables are not going to develop the disease in the unexposed individuals due to not the disease.

248
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:29,850
And then we've got our type for people who are concordant, where both the exposed and unexposed individuals do not develop the disease.

249
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:37,530
Okay, so here we've got y j is our notation I'm going to use.

250
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:45,000
And you know what? I'm just about to call. I'm still getting over that RSV infection, although it's been since before Fallbrook.

251
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,160
But one of these days.

252
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:23,839
You've probably seen in the news, but RSV is much worse and well, I don't know if it's worse in children or if there's just a lot more cases,

253
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,079
but you've probably seen like a lot of the children's hospitals are filling them.

254
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,330
But there's also a good amount of data showing that it's worse in adults as well.

255
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:37,940
Probably because we went a few years without getting exposed is my what I would support.

256
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,890
And so your immunity drops down and then when you get it where normally, you know,

257
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,860
you just get very much like somebody like me might not get symptoms like a cold, right?

258
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:57,600
You get much more sick and it causes a lot of inflammation that bronchioles and that tends to stick around for a year.

259
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,950
That seems to be an extended period of time, in my opinion. Okay.

260
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,089
Okay. So our notation,

261
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:14,510
right is why I j where I is going to refer to the disease status of the exposed subject and j refers to the disease status of the unexposed subject.

262
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,920
So the data from that table, this kind of two by two table here can be summarized.

263
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,780
So this force freedom can be summarized into a two by two table.

264
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,350
Right? We're putting unexposed and exposed individuals here.

265
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:45,829
And so in this example, like if we look at this for 33, y01 is the number of matched pairs in which the exposed subject becomes a case, right?

266
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,940
And the unexposed subject does not become a case.

267
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:56,120
So these are type one, is that right?

268
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:06,920
Yeah. We're sorry right here. Those are our type two individuals.

269
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:19,299
Top three individuals reading OC zero one OC to estimate the effect of the exposure on the disease.

270
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:26,560
We're going to use a metal pencil estimate where each stratum of the match, pair of which each pair represents one stratum.

271
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,390
So we end up with this formula right here.

272
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:47,810
So here, just to kind of point out why we're not introducing any bias if we don't control for that matched factor we get the relative rate

273
00:33:47,810 --> 00:34:01,970
of the of the relative risk of the crude is y one dot over y dot dot over y dot one over y dot dot which is equal to y 1.5.1,

274
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,690
which is equal to the relative risk of the metal handle.

275
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:17,110
So that's why we end up not introducing any bias if we don't adjust for that matching factor in a cohort study generally it's that,

276
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:22,580
you know, so what's happening here is that the margins of the matched table become the cells of the crude table.

277
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:36,330
So that's why but we still should not ignore the match as it generally will increase precision if you do not ignore the match in a cohort study from.

278
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:44,510
Okay, so kind of another way of thinking this is what we've done is we fixed the ratio of unexposed exposed subjects, right?

279
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:50,210
So it eliminates any association between the matching variable and exposure.

280
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:58,709
Wow. So this is just kind of going over the risk difference, right?

281
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,710
And the formulas and what we see is the same with the risk, right?

282
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:08,100
The relative risk. The risk difference is equal to the risk difference of the crude.

283
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:21,810
All right. So we will take a break, but the by break and then also work on the in class activity.

284
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:30,270
So let's start back up in. Well, let's aim for 15 minutes and see how people are doing in 15 minutes.

285
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,360
Can you justify the citizens? This provision.

286
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:43,850
She? Okay.

287
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:56,630
Okay. Um. I said, What are you doing?

288
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:14,890
The first. Yes.

289
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,800
That was extremely close.

290
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:45,960
Relationships. What?

291
00:37:53,670 --> 00:38:10,210
Thank you for the treat. So.

292
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:24,280
Just like. It makes it harder.

293
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:37,080
I just want to get a of you and you think to.

294
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:55,799
What is that mean? So as you look really forward, becoming one of them is for Casey.

295
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:02,410
I just don't know which one. I'm not surprised based on this one.

296
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:20,520
You may have to go through a lot of things.

297
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,930
KEITH Oh, my God. You're all for that. That's all.

298
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:44,640
I think that's one, honestly. I'm looking for someone out there that we let your mother.

299
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:58,700
My name. I was going to grab a.

300
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:05,050
So. So this is based on a whole.

301
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:20,320
Are you going to take the revolution so that freedom the same way are you going to do?

302
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:34,740
A. So when you look at the website, which is not to be seen, it was put together and it's like this time.

303
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:47,550
On the other hand, there was a little bit. I'm.

304
00:40:48,210 --> 00:41:05,530
I was going to. Treasurer Wayne Swan.

305
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:24,740
It comes as everything should here or actually isn't one of.

306
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,490
It's a disease. You can change it to be anything you want.

307
00:41:39,630 --> 00:42:03,740
So it's okay. And why? Changing world times 100 times, which means I haven't.

308
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:22,520
Long term exposure. So it's just.

309
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:17,790
So people feel like it's.

310
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:35,970
For an excuse to go back to this part of the. Yeah.

311
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:44,690
Oh, Lord. Like most.

312
00:43:46,730 --> 00:44:05,150
I work with the best, closest careers in years and with one most.

313
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:13,730
I'm sorry, because when I ask why there is no actual association.

314
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:17,600
Yeah, it's just.

315
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:32,150
Oh, and she had a problem.

316
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:44,560
That's the closest thing to a science fiction class with newer people lives in the way and the version that, like, works best for you.

317
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:49,840
And then go with that one. Yes, but don't try to use all the color.

318
00:44:49,840 --> 00:45:04,150
This person was best for you. I was like, why don't people keep your are and you have to like, it's what it says in the things you want.

319
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:12,480
But yeah, I think one of those of times. Here.

320
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:21,370
Anything else? Blueberry, banana, walnut? No, I'm really concerned about two types of pumpkin.

321
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,510
I think there's a reason for that. These are weekends. I.

322
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,650
Yeah. We know how you justify this, you know?

323
00:45:52,930 --> 00:46:04,200
Yeah. I read the whole thing. I.

324
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:13,720
Really? Oh, that's the problem. Yeah.

325
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:32,980
So I heard that you don't have the power to make your own work.

326
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:43,310
So if you're going to leave your home, you know, just want to say we're going to focus.

327
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:59,540
But. Just keep your eyes on the direction.

328
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:14,470
Oh, but just forgive me for whatever this one is.

329
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,690
I think that's correct.

330
00:47:25,850 --> 00:48:02,940
If that's true. There's.

331
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:15,000
Okay. Yeah.

332
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:18,070
This is really something that, you know.

333
00:48:18,370 --> 00:49:02,820
Yeah, it's kind of. Yeah.

334
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:13,600
Like for me, like. Yeah, you're right.

335
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:20,050
I mean, think it's just.

336
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:33,580
So that's what I.

337
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,020
Justin Bieber, right? Yeah. So initially because of all.

338
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:55,610
Because I'm watching with more. So is.

339
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:05,450
So yeah, that's something that is like, um.

340
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:12,320
This is one of. Because it's just.

341
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:21,220
It's just. Went over all with them.

342
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:24,960
Yeah, exactly. And.

343
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:41,620
Sure. Go to.

344
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,850
Yeah. And 30.

345
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:58,970
That's what. So to imagine this.

346
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:12,120
I do acknowledge that.

347
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:18,040
That's a disproportionate statement that.

348
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:45,550
She issued. It's part of.

349
00:52:51,780 --> 00:53:09,140
Oh. Give your bachelor party everything.

350
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:19,290
It's like if I want to go. Like American.

351
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:30,630
The only real way to.

352
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:59,350
It's. We're going to work on something just like just like came up.

353
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:05,410
That's right. But if you.

354
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:18,880
I don't remember anything about that one.

355
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:35,860
Yeah. That's what I was.

356
00:54:50,050 --> 00:55:18,340
How likely? There's nothing like.

357
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:34,020
So I was going. Anyway.

358
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:41,180
It's. Specifically. All right.

359
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:50,090
So we'll start going over this. So the risk in the unexposed just right here is 30 over 100, which is equal to 0.30.

360
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:58,460
Persons for starting first in the unexposed is here 17 over 100 which is equal to 0.17.

361
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:06,950
The match to air is going to be 30 over 17, right from this margin, which is 1.76.

362
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:15,490
And here we created the table and they calculated the crude, the air, which is also equal to 1.76.

363
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:22,520
Right. And so the crude estimate is not confounded by the matching variables.

364
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:28,690
The reason for this lack of bias is that by fixing the ratio of unexposed exposed subjects across greater

365
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:34,880
matching eliminates any association in the total sample between the matching variable and the exposure status.

366
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:39,350
So that the matching variable is not the confounder is study the longer.

367
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:52,030
So there you go. Remember this, this is a fixed ratio match, right?

368
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,750
There are over five years. Yeah, there are over five years.

369
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:03,870
You. We should actually add that to the key, because I smell the key right now.

370
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,880
Okay. All right.

371
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:22,800
Now, so for variable ratio matching, the number of unexposed subjects varies for exposed subjects in a cohort study.

372
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:31,750
This might arise out of designers on the team. Earlier or more often it's due to missing data on some subjects.

373
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:34,110
Right? So you lose some of those matches.

374
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:43,710
So this is not going to necessarily eliminate the confounding due to matching variables in the in the crude analysis.

375
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:50,880
And that's because you may still have an association after matching between the exposure and the matching variables.

376
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:58,799
And that's because what we see is the ratio of unexposed exposed subjects may vary across the levels of the matching variables.

377
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,500
Right, because we've got that variable ratio in there.

378
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:10,290
And so in that case, the relative risk and the crude relative risk is not going to be equal to the medal handle relative risk,

379
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:20,580
meaning that when you do variable ratio matching either purposely or you're forced into it because you're missing data,

380
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:25,620
you definitely then need to adjust for that matching factor.

381
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:30,300
We want you anyways, but just kind of remember that otherwise sure your estimate would be bias.

382
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:40,680
So for matched density analysis, match sets tend to be unique in that case.

383
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:47,759
Remember density analysis for selecting like a controller at the same time as a case,

384
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:53,820
right as each subject is likely contributed a different amount of person time.

385
00:58:55,380 --> 00:59:03,000
So even though the ratio of unexposed to exposed individuals might be the same, the person times are not fixed and so they're going to be variable.

386
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:12,060
And so then in that case as well, you're not going to be eliminating confounding due to the match variables in the in the crude analysis from.

387
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:18,470
So summary on matching and cohort studies.

388
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:25,910
Failure to address matching in an analysis of a cohort study typically reduces precision.

389
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:34,090
So this sorry is also just true generally for first and foremost, not just for like if you're doing a nested case control study.

390
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:43,730
So if you're doing a person any study with person time, you need to make sure that you're adjusting for that matched variable.

391
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:52,850
All right. So summary matching in cohort studies, failure to address matching in the analysis of cohort studies typically reduces precision.

392
00:59:53,420 --> 01:00:06,980
Right? Failure to address matching in the analysis of variable ratio or density matched designs may introduce bias as well, right?

393
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,530
So that's matching in cohort study.

394
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:17,890
So we've done case control studies, we've done cohort studies, we have some of the same issues and cross-sectional studies and cohort studies,

395
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:23,840
but not all this control depending on what you're looking at. I'm going to go into that right now for this class.

396
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:29,450
So we'll just focus on case control studies and cohort studies. All right.

397
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:36,770
So over matching. So over matching is when you have a loss of statistical efficiency due to matching.

398
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:45,410
So in case control studies, it's most likely to occur when the variable that you're matching on is not a risk factor for the disease,

399
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:50,690
but is strongly associated with the exposure status in the base population.

400
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:56,540
And we saw some examples of that before with like particularly with friend matches, right.

401
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:03,200
We so in the case control studies, if the matched variable is not taken into account,

402
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:08,899
the estimate will be biased even if the matching variable is not a risk factor.

403
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:17,630
And also an example of that. And you know, in a moment in cohort studies, it's difficult to predict when matching will be counterproductive.

404
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:25,400
All right. So here's an example of over matching and a case control study.

405
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:32,090
So we're looking at the relationship between antipsychotic drugs and the incidence of tardive.

406
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:37,520
This can be easy to do. I did not say that properly.

407
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:44,059
And you decide to match on psychiatric diagnosis.

408
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:54,470
But here we've got the base population where we have people who are schizophrenic and then other we're looking at that IDR,

409
01:01:54,650 --> 01:02:06,740
an IDR of 2.02.0 and we see that our crude is equal to our straight specific measures for schizophrenic or other diagnosis.

410
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:12,050
So is there confounding by diagnosis in this population?

411
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:21,130
No. Right. Okay.

412
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:27,820
So now we have our unmatched population based case control study.

413
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:33,730
We got 150 cases in 150 randomly selected controls.

414
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:39,219
And we see we get here's our odds ratio once again at 2.0, 2.0.

415
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:43,630
And the crude is equal to the street specific odds ratios.

416
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:55,010
Right. And here is our odds ratios up here.

417
01:02:55,730 --> 01:03:04,920
Okay. Now we're going to match on a diagnosis, right?

418
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:14,500
And because we have national diagnosis, diagnosis is going to become associated with the disease status here.

419
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:21,140
Right. And this matching on diagnosis is going to introduce a bias.

420
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:29,660
And so we can see that here in this treatment specific are still 2.0. But now when we look at this crude odds ratio is 1.57, right.

421
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:39,050
So it's biased compared to here the original data or the perfectly selected non matched case control study.

422
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:47,420
So the crude estimate now becomes biased and requires that we stratify in order to get an unbiased estimate.

423
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,290
And then by stratifying we're actually losing precision.

424
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:55,440
So we can see that here by looking at our confidence interval, right?

425
01:03:55,460 --> 01:04:03,440
So we go 1.25 to 3.9 here, but here we're 1.11 to 3.60.

426
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:09,380
So a bit of a loss in the precision that.

427
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:13,630
Consumption is very widespread.

428
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:27,420
So stratification is kind of always well, unless you're reducing variability, kind of always results in the loss of precision.

429
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:40,000
All right. So special concerns with over matching neighborhood concern, controls are going to be a concern worth over matching.

430
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:46,870
And the reason for that is that you may be matching on a bunch of different factors.

431
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:51,699
Right. Not, you know, you're thinking neighborhood, but of course, there are a lot of things about our neighborhoods that we live in.

432
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:55,180
And so you might be kind of inadvertently, roughly matching on.

433
01:04:55,450 --> 01:05:03,400
Yes, I could be matching on cultural factors, including matching on environmental exposures, etc.

434
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:12,370
And then parental controls are always another big concern with over matching with the groups like Toxic Shock Syndrome, right?

435
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:19,689
We have different controls. You might be matching on a number of lifestyle characteristics.

436
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:21,660
I think in the toxic shock syndrome right there,

437
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:27,580
they were more likely to use tampons and then more likely like if a friend did that toxic shock syndrome.

438
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:30,549
So they were more likely to have exposure and in particular, you know,

439
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:34,990
because they would talk about what product they were using, then they would be more likely to use the same product.

440
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:42,040
Right? So, so there you're just making your controls a lot more similar to your cases in regards to the exposure.

441
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:52,240
So over matching in case control versus cohort studies, if a variable is not a risk factor or is a weak risk factor for the disease,

442
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:58,120
but it's associated with exposure status in the base population.

443
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:03,790
Right. That's where we're going to see over matching.

444
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:11,830
Right. So in in a case control study, it's going to make the variable a confounder.

445
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:18,610
And so consequently controlling for the confounder in the analysis is going to reduce statistical efficiency.

446
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:27,430
And then just remember, the stronger that that that relationship between the variable and the exposure,

447
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:30,730
the greater the loss and efficiency that you're going to have.

448
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:41,079
And remember, it's been making it a confounder because it's inducing an association between the matching variable and the disease.

449
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,750
Right. But disease occurrence or disease status.

450
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:54,580
So in a cohort study we've got, if a variable is not a risk factor or it's a weak risk factor for the disease,

451
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:57,370
but it's not associated with the exposure status in the base population.

452
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:13,420
So for fixed ratio matching, right, it doesn't it's not going to introduce that that association between the matched variable and the disease.

453
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:18,850
Right. And so we don't we're not going to see bias in that effect estimate there.

454
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:28,240
In fact, it's going to eliminate the association between the exposure status and the matching variable in the overall sample.

455
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:39,070
So the matched variable does not become a confounder. So controlling for it does not reduce efficiency in the study.

456
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:58,780
So you can get situations where you're over matching and you're reducing statistical efficiency in cohort studies, right?

457
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:07,810
That's if that's the case, even when the variable is a confounder in the source population,

458
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:14,170
it's most likely to occur when the bias resulting from the matching variable and source population as is towards the null.

459
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:21,040
And so an example of where we might see a loss in statistical efficiency is here,

460
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:31,750
where the either R crude is 1.57 and the IDR handles 2.0 or the R crude 0.64 in the IDR manual cancel 0.50.

461
01:08:32,230 --> 01:08:36,610
Remember, it's a little bit harder to predict in cohort studies what's going to happen.

462
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:47,440
You know, if you with matching them with over matching. So controlling for non matching variables, we've got two options.

463
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:54,430
One option is you can ignore the match set. So once again, this is only really an option if it's not a unique match.

464
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,400
Right? Then control for all the potential confounders, including the variables that you matched upon.

465
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:09,399
This can be statistically inefficient and maybe particularly problematic with caliper matching, right?

466
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:17,740
Because we want to really kind of we want to keep that match that there because we will have residual confounding potentially with the caliper match.

467
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:24,850
You can also perform a conditional logistic regression.

468
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:29,680
Generally speaking though, if you know you're going to want to control for something and you don't like it,

469
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:39,790
at least in a case control study and you don't necessarily want information on the effect of that exposure,

470
01:09:40,570 --> 01:09:46,900
right, then you would be best off generally depending if you just go ahead and match on that.

471
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:49,900
On that factor, it will increase statistical efficiency.

472
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:57,660
Of course, matching on that kind of different thing can cause you to lose a lot in a lot of cases, you know, can make it harder to find a match.

473
01:09:57,670 --> 01:10:08,700
And so there's always a bit of a balance there. But like, if it's something simple, like sex, you don't want to not map, like,

474
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:11,920
unless you really need to look at the effect of sex, like in a case control study.

475
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:16,180
Right. You would want to go ahead and match on on sex, right?

476
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:21,579
Almost on that category rather than just for efficiency sake,

477
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:27,550
rather than do the math and then later adjust your sex to include that in your condition.

478
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:31,600
Logistic regression. Yes. I just want to say this.

479
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:37,930
Count the difference between that and categorical matching and suggests that problem has more.

480
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:48,820
Yes or no, plus or minus. You can still get I mean, with a category match if you're doing something like H, right.

481
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:56,680
You're you can still get residual confounding obviously as well particularly strongly associated with your.

482
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:02,970
So this. Why is it particularly problematic?

483
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:13,450
This call for matching is always anonymous.

484
01:11:15,530 --> 01:11:23,420
Precise match category matching can also be a not precise match, but it may be an exact match or fairly exact match.

485
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:28,040
I'm super nonsmoker. All right.

486
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,290
But some categories do leave residual good health.

487
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:36,470
Right? If I knew the category of. And I see this all the time.

488
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:44,720
Oh, no. But, you know, I my my category that I use is, you know, adults 18 to 65.

489
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:49,959
I mean, like, you know, there's probably a lot of residual confounding by age there.

490
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:53,120
And just because that's a super broad category. Right.

491
01:11:53,780 --> 01:12:05,660
So. So matching and cost matching is typically going to add cost to data collection,

492
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:13,880
and that's because you're going to have to collect information from particular controls that you don't use because they don't match to a case.

493
01:12:17,690 --> 01:12:30,340
The exception to that is when the matching factor helps you to identify the controls and makes it easier to collect data on them.

494
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:34,520
So an example of that would be diagnosis or neighborhood, right?

495
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:37,430
That can actually reduce or reduce the cost of the study.

496
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:49,370
So however, matching can introduce statistical efficiency, thereby reducing the necessary sample size for the same level of precision.

497
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:49,970
Right.

498
01:12:49,980 --> 01:13:01,010
So even though matching may cost a bit more to find that control, you would in the end need a smaller study to have the same statistical efficiency.

499
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:05,450
Right. And so you will save money overall.

500
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:14,959
So situations where matching is most likely to be a cost efficient is when you're matching on a confounder that has many categories,

501
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:23,770
something like occupation. The cost per subject of collecting additional data after matching is high,

502
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:30,690
or if there's a limited supply of index cases in the source or base population which this.

503
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:42,250
All right so in summary matching givers for cohort and take control studies in both design for that was whether

504
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:48,840
you're doing a cohort or case control you need to follow up with analytic matched analytic designs or methods,

505
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:53,110
sorry, that are going to take the matching into account.

506
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:59,110
However, if you don't do that or if you see a study that does not do that, which I see quite often,

507
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:09,970
that's, I mean, it's like pretty much every source to lab paper with utilization right now.

508
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:17,379
Like they often will match 1 to 1, you read it and then they completely break the match and ignore the fact that it was matched.

509
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:27,880
Right. So ignoring the matching variable introduces a bias in case control studies and sometimes in a cohort study,

510
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:34,350
and it's going to reduce the statistical precision in a cohort study.

511
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:41,830
Generally, the major advantage of matching is really to gain statistical efficiency in the effect estimation.

512
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:49,180
Remember that kind of example for case control studies, although we think of it as a way to control confounding, right.

513
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:52,360
We matched and we still saw some residual confounding there.

514
01:14:52,360 --> 01:15:02,860
It's really tough to narrow that confidence interval. But matching can result in a loss of statistical efficiency if we are over matching,

515
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:13,790
so generally do not match on a variable that is neither a known risk factor or nor a mechanism for reducing study costs.

516
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:17,320
Basically you have to have a very good reason for matching on that factor.

517
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:26,110
In case control studies, matching is going to preclude estimation of the effect of on disease occurrence.

518
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,690
That's not true in cohort studies.

519
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:39,230
Remember, don't match why I said this earlier actually, but do not match on a variable if it is affected by the exposure status, if it's a mediator.

520
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:48,600
I don't want to match on mediators. And with matching, there's always going to be a tradeoff between statistical efficiency and the cost.

521
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:51,880
But that matching induces in your study design.

522
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:59,620
And so here is an example of a study.

523
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:04,300
I used to always think I would never do a match, but we would do these big cohort studies.

524
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:15,520
But I participated in those. It was people looking at preexisting dengue virus antibody levels in severe or non-severe

525
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:22,270
secondary cases and comparing to match controls drawn randomly from the pediatric dengue cohort.

526
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:27,610
In this particular example, your matching five controls were matched to each case,

527
01:16:27,610 --> 01:16:35,200
although in the supplement there's a number of a number of different matching ratios anywhere from 1 to 7, I think.

528
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:42,850
And the controls were of the same sex and age. Had evidence of a prior dengue infection.

529
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:46,959
Provided a blood sample within 1 to 2 months of the case.

530
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:50,410
Was pre infection samples over like matching on time there.

531
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:55,950
But they were control because they were not the case that year.

532
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:03,640
So this ended up being kind of a very unique match. And so it was, you know, essential not to break that match.

533
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:08,930
And in analyzing the data here, then interesting that, like I said, I never thought I would do match.

534
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:16,870
Now I've done a bunch of match studies. We also did one to look at pneumonia following influenza infection,

535
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:24,939
because it's like kind of a given that everybody accepts that this happens, but actually like the time period has not really been known.

536
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:33,310
Like how for how long is somebody at risk for developing pneumonia following influenza infection?

537
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:38,829
And really, that's kind of the strength of that association was not known as well.

538
01:17:38,830 --> 01:17:46,480
So we did a study on that. This study right here was actually the first study to show in humans that antibody dependent enhancement occurs,

539
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:55,750
which is a process whereby the antibodies that you produce in response to the dengue virus then put you at risk for developing severe disease.

540
01:17:57,180 --> 01:18:01,600
It's very important for developing a vaccine to dengue, right.

541
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,990
Because we don't want to induce antibody dependent enhancement.

542
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:15,790
All right. So propensity scores, propensity scores are used to match individuals or units with a similar distribution of confounders,

543
01:18:16,030 --> 01:18:25,180
factors that predict treatment. So by units, we might match villages or towns or schools, you know, all sorts of different groups.

544
01:18:26,890 --> 01:18:34,200
So that the difference in outcomes give outcomes gives is more likely to give an unbiased estimate of the effect, right?

545
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:42,460
So we're trying to make the kind of the groups for comparing us and what is possible steps in a propensity score based analysis.

546
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:44,680
We're going to select our covariates of interest.

547
01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:51,460
So our confounders are factors that are going to predict treatment or whether or not that group receives that treatment.

548
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:57,129
We'll calculate a propensity score that's typically done using logistic regression.

549
01:18:57,130 --> 01:19:01,630
But certainly here there are different methods that we're going to match on propensity scores.

550
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:07,660
You can also stratify important propensity score issues I, PTW or covariate adjustment,

551
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:11,590
and you do a balance check to make sure that your groups are not similar.

552
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:15,640
Right. And then you will estimate the treatment effect.

553
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:23,320
So for propensity score matching, you will see nearest neighbor.

554
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:29,140
So it relies on an algorithm which selects a treated participant at random and sequentially moves to the list

555
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:33,820
of participants and matches the exposed individual unit with the closest match from the comparison group.

556
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:37,420
Kind of I'm greedy, similar to that greedy that I showed earlier.

557
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:44,020
And then you've got an optimal match with the algorithm minimizes the overall distance across all the different matched groups.

558
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:52,150
So not necessarily matching an individual or unit to the to the most similar individual you unit.

559
01:19:55,420 --> 01:20:06,640
So here's an example of from a paper looking at phone or on treatment or intervention.

560
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:12,010
So they were looking at, well,

561
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:18,429
basically the background is an available randomized trial so are cities failed to improve

562
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:24,460
hospital mortality compared with on pump in coronary artery bypass grafting CABG.

563
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:31,810
However, in randomized controlled trials, one of the problem was that, you know,

564
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:42,160
they were both participants were highly selected and were at at low risk of mortality

565
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:46,090
compared to kind of the general population where these treatments would be used.

566
01:20:47,170 --> 01:20:54,880
So the question kind of remained about whether off pump can provide survival benefit in high risk patients in real world practice.

567
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:08,150
So the design was to implement a propensity score matching to compare hospital mortality after outcome versus on pump in high risk patients.

568
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:11,780
So here we are using just a scoring system that I actually know nothing about,

569
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:21,360
said high risk patient with somebody with a score of six or over undergoing isolated first time CABG using the Bristol Heart Institute database.

570
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:26,120
So they're doing a retrospective study here, right?

571
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:34,309
So they have a total of 3444 patients with preoperative your score of over equal to over six.

572
01:21:34,310 --> 01:21:44,389
So these are those high risk patients right underwent isolated first time CABG from 1996 to 2004 team at a single

573
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:55,880
institution in Bristol so that's from that database is from all was used in 1678 patients and was used in 71,754 patients.

574
01:21:56,750 --> 01:22:00,130
Right. So this is a observational study, obviously, right.

575
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:06,230
Because these people are not being randomized 2 to 4 on par.

576
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:15,020
So what type of study design is this? Using a database.

577
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:25,220
Yep. It's a retrospective cohort study. All right.

578
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:33,770
So they do a propensity score calculation and they select 20 confounders for hospital mortality to compare between the two groups.

579
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:42,890
They estimate the propensity score for AF pump by logistic regression using linear terms, interaction and stratification by your surgery.

580
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:51,049
So then they they then created matched pairs using caliper matching.

581
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:58,190
So within 0.2 standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score without replacement,

582
01:22:58,190 --> 01:23:07,040
meaning they're not putting people back rate those controls and they ended up matching 1199 pairs.

583
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:10,250
So obviously not not not everybody had match rate.

584
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:20,690
They then look at this as the preoperative confounders distribution in the original and matched samples.

585
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:24,290
So here we have our off pump original or on pump original.

586
01:23:24,530 --> 01:23:30,590
There are a lot more people, so they are losing a good number of people in their matching strategy.

587
01:23:33,710 --> 01:23:41,810
So they've got age here, just, you know, different female sex, whatever.

588
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:45,350
And YJ is these things that they're concerned about being different.

589
01:23:46,850 --> 01:23:49,489
And then now they've got their match samples.

590
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:54,770
And what you'll notice is it's making those two groups much more similar in regards to these two these factors.

591
01:23:56,870 --> 01:24:01,700
So they then do a balance check. So after matching the troops, we're comparable for all confounders.

592
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:08,870
So here is our alcohol group. And like Green, our group and the darker green here.

593
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:15,680
And these kind of not filled in boxes are all of the individuals that we are losing from the analysis.

594
01:24:16,610 --> 01:24:23,270
Right. But what you can see here visually. Right, is they're they're quite similar and they're doing the same thing here,

595
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:32,380
looking at covariate balance to try to make sure the groups are now similar.

596
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:36,800
So this is a mirrored histogram, right? Just kind of a visual inspection of that.

597
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:41,600
This apparently is called a log plot.

598
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:47,280
Not sure why. All right.

599
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:56,100
So in the original sample, our pump was not significantly associated with reduced mortality.

600
01:24:57,090 --> 01:25:02,910
That was also clear here in a fully adjusted logistic model.

601
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:07,690
Right. So we cross one here.

602
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:11,970
So this is kind of the original logistic and logistic model.

603
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:21,180
Here we had a conditional logistic regression, a robust logistic, and then a mixed effects models as well.

604
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:27,300
And what you can see is that in all three of these models, now that we've used propensity score matching,

605
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:35,640
it is significantly associated with reduced in-hospital mortality.

606
01:25:37,950 --> 01:25:42,719
I think this paper is available. I mean, it's clearly available online,

607
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:49,120
but I'm with it should be in the section when you're curious if you want to go through and look at how they did these different,

608
01:25:50,430 --> 01:26:00,830
uh, these different regressions. But.

609
01:26:08,610 --> 01:26:19,850
You just can't. You just want to say. That you just said you should just go and put it in the logistic regression.

610
01:26:22,570 --> 01:26:29,380
And you see a lot of propensity score matching in. Like in our cities and stuff.

611
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:38,960
Which designs, you know, particularly when you're randomizing locations for group level interventions, you'll see a lot of it.

612
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:49,420
So like what always comes to mind for me is although like the wash trials in like particularly across Africa,

613
01:26:49,420 --> 01:26:55,910
there's a lot of propensities for mashing goes on there and you don't have to experience.

614
01:26:57,710 --> 01:27:03,770
In a perverse. There's probably going to still be some residual confounding.

615
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:11,650
So Yahoo! Generally. Then we're looking for at least another two years to improve elections.

616
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:21,690
We should be thinking of that as well. In a study like this for your life costing a lot of sample.

617
01:27:21,690 --> 01:27:24,700
What's the argument for propensity score matching over if you.

618
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:39,360
I'm thinking that you'd probably be better off without me. It's a bit slow, but yeah, people will be better off if I can get you.

619
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:49,639
Although I think it depends a little bit on the distribution,

620
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:55,730
I guess maybe I shouldn't think that people have a propensity for like totally unrepresentative something in any way is going to.

621
01:27:56,210 --> 01:28:03,260
Yeah, I would throw things off. Yeah. So. Three.

622
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:12,040
All right. So that said, are there any more questions about matching? Otherwise, we are done a little bit early, 10 minutes early.
