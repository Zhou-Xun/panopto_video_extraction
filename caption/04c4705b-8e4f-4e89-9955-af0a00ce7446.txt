1
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:20,950
Very warm today where I'll be finishing up a small lecture on week two.

2
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:36,040
So we have a small lecture on Asian synergies and populations and the science to go over the practice problem that the three from last week.

3
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:44,440
So for that and of course the answers to the practice set after class today.

4
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,440
And once we're done with that, there should be time for you to probably study one.

5
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,870
So get in your groups and work on that.

6
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:07,150
And then next week, just so that everyone's clear, we're going to be starting a new unit on pedigree analysis.

7
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:15,970
For Tuesday, we have three coordinated lectures for you to listen to.

8
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:29,140
Not long, and there will be a quiz based on the on the recorded lectures that is due on Tuesday by 830 next week.

9
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:41,540
Okay. And then before we go ahead and get started, so problems that one will be you work on it in your groups.

10
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,420
I think everyone should be in a group now.

11
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:56,470
And also some groups like we have people in out of class, but everyone else should be in three and then there should be one submission for a group.

12
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:05,050
And it'd be great if you can if you can do the submission through canvas, if you can type it and upload,

13
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:15,400
upload on unlike the assignments and set up so that one person from each group can do the submission.

14
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,850
Okay. So any question about that? Okay.

15
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,390
Okay. Okay.

16
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:35,890
So today, this short lecture. On human variation.

17
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:48,040
So so last time we talked about snips or variations of the human genome that happens at a single base.

18
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:55,300
And we talked about how we can have different yields, different forms of those snips.

19
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:05,760
But we didn't really talk about what we didn't talk about yet is how common those lives are and how common.

20
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:11,980
So we've been an individual and then how common across populations when we're comparing populations.

21
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,890
And then we will introduce another kind of idea,

22
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:27,310
like a sort of a classification of those variants of those single, single variants based on how common they are.

23
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,210
So today.

24
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:40,390
So the learning objectives for today's lectures to define what steps are and what single nucleotide variants are, what we would call their variants.

25
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:49,630
And then you describe how mutation history contributes to frequency differences in these across major geographic populations.

26
00:03:52,410 --> 00:04:02,970
Okay. So we've established that we're the seventh variation that we're focusing on today is related to a single phase difference.

27
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,770
So that's why it's called single nucleotide polymorphisms.

28
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,910
Now snips are commonly we use that term to refer to common variants.

29
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:21,120
So those are variants where you have both, where you have you see two versions of the snips and two o'neills.

30
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,800
One is sort of the major elope that most people have.

31
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,940
And then you have the minor or the not so common.

32
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,390
Allium And that not so common. Leo You observe at least 1% of the population.

33
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:46,890
And then from genetic studies, we know that approximately we have a snip as one in every 300 base pairs.

34
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:58,350
So when you go on the cluster genome, you see these very valuable sites, one in every 300 base pairs and then between any two people.

35
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:06,120
This difference, it comes to approximately one snip, one variance, over 1000 base pairs.

36
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,970
So recent estimates of sequence is about 4 to 5 millions.

37
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,960
And that would vary depending on what population you're looking at.

38
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,940
And the definition of population can vary.

39
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:33,389
It could be like us, and it may be African-Americans versus European-Americans, and it could refer to actually Europe,

40
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:39,960
or it could be referring to different populations within the same geographic area, like like, say, Michigan.

41
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:49,380
So these are those. So when we look across these, we approximately have 4 to 5 million snips.

42
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,510
So these are common variants where you have the the less common form of this thing

43
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:02,430
or the less common a Leo You would observe at least 1% in 1% of the population.

44
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,370
Now the other on the other hand, we have three variants.

45
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:16,319
So this is when the less frequent version or LDA is seen in less than 1% of the population.

46
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:26,160
And that's why we call it rare variants. Now, the issue is that we there are many more rare variants across the genome,

47
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:35,160
but many more compared to many more compared to the common variants or the snips.

48
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:47,550
But they're not observed as often. So if we look at clusters through, there could be I don't know if rare variants are sort of unique.

49
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:58,319
So each person could have a variation at a different site and but the other person next to you would not have that variation.

50
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:07,980
But if we pool like all the variants and every individual is carrying in this room, then we would have a lot more rare variants.

51
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,630
But they're each unique to each individual, so they're kind of private.

52
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:18,840
They can be private to an individual, to families, to groups, to populations.

53
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:28,870
So so they're not they're they're more there's more of them, but they're not common because not everyone would have the same mutation.

54
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:35,250
Variation. Is that clear or does anyone have questions about that?

55
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:50,739
And then the like. You notice here that we used a cutoff point of 1% and that can vary.

56
00:07:50,740 --> 00:08:03,100
It's not like well defined in the literature. Some would define it as point 5% frequency at which we would classify something as rare or less common.

57
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:12,230
Okay. Any questions? So.

58
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:23,990
So this this plot shows the number of snaps that we had back from 2010 when we first started doing genetic studies.

59
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,660
And this is coming from the hep map that our have that projects.

60
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,720
I don't know is anyone familiar with that?

61
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:45,070
You know what? So so this this project aimed to kind of describe the genetic variants of peoples from people from different ancestries.

62
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:53,659
So the idea was to collect genetic data from people who are kind of representative

63
00:08:53,660 --> 00:09:01,399
of a European ancestry or people who are representative of Japanese people,

64
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:08,910
representative of Nigeria. And then we would look at the number of genetic and then we would look at the number of genetic variants.

65
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:14,209
So genotype those people and then do some focused sequencing.

66
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:23,260
So look at every single base for specific four parts of the genome and then compare the number of variants across these.

67
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:29,720
So the idea is to kind of compare across these different populations and project compare variants.

68
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:41,720
So here is W refers to American South West, see, use, Europeans and so on.

69
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:56,809
I believe that the yeah the why our eyes for Nigeria and then LW case for Kenyan we see if I have them all and have

70
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:05,300
them all but some but so Mexican the idea is that it's collected individuals from from 11 global populations.

71
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:15,230
So to to me two things that we can kind of get from this plot here.

72
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,390
So the first thing is that as you have small sample sizes,

73
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:28,700
you're not really capturing a lot of the snap, a lot of the snips or the the variable sides.

74
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,819
But as the sample size increases,

75
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:43,610
you're you're able to to find a lot more snips and that kind of gain and even and snips kind of tapers off once you have a big enough sample size.

76
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,780
Everyone that has about 1% because my friends are like 1%.

77
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,990
You would probably have captured at least one person with that.

78
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,170
So you you kind of have a good representation of snips.

79
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:04,409
Now, the other thing that you noticed from this plot is that those three green lines representing people from Kenya,

80
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:15,480
South African American ancestry, and in Nigeria, they have a lot more common snips than these other populations.

81
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,920
Does anyone have a sense of why that's the case?

82
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,760
So we'll talk about it as we like.

83
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,980
And then following slides. But I. So.

84
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,370
Yeah, we'll just leave it at that. Okay.

85
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:47,140
So. So in addition to looking at snips.

86
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:56,840
They also this project sequenced about 100,000 faces from specific regions of the human genome,

87
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:02,330
so that those were coming from about 700 samples from ten global regions.

88
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:10,730
This is went back when we were not able to sequence the whole genome, so they would choose specific regions and sequence them.

89
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:19,010
And what they found was that 99% of the variants were seen in less than 1% of the people.

90
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:27,889
So that means that we have a lot of variants that are not very common across those people.

91
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,310
So this is touching upon that.

92
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:40,310
The idea of having rare variants that there are plant, there's plenty of them and then of variants in less than 1% of the people.

93
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,910
40% were found in only one population.

94
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:54,620
So this is talking about how those rare variants are tend to be unique, so unique to an individual or they can be to a certain population.

95
00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:01,670
So they're not really you don't see them carried over to different populations.

96
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,770
And again in terms of looking at individuals many variants where private to individual so on the one

97
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:17,490
person you would so you'd have this certain variation at a certain place that is unique to you,

98
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:24,750
not to the person, another person even from your same population.

99
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:32,370
And then 77 of those variants were new. So that was based on estimates back then.

100
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:47,400
So when compared to that, to compare to databases of commonly found variants, this have map project identified a lot more variants so 77% where you.

101
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:59,760
So going back to the idea of how we saw that,

102
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:10,640
the fact that individuals of African ancestry have a lot more common variants and something you probably are somewhat familiar with,

103
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:25,530
is that how we believe evolutionarily that humans kind of evolutionary stuff moved out of Africa about how to move out

104
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:36,270
of Africa about 100 to 90000 years ago and then moved across Europe and from that to different regions in the world.

105
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:52,530
So we do believe that Africans are or individuals of African ancestry or African ancestry is older, really, versus these newer populations.

106
00:14:53,640 --> 00:15:07,170
And what that translates to is that if you have if you have a variation that is an older population, then that variation had time to kind of.

107
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,270
Kind of transmit to transmit ancestry.

108
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:18,070
So move down to two and move down across generations.

109
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:24,129
So that's why we see a lot more variation in individuals of African ancestry,

110
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:38,170
a lot of more common variants and individuals of African ancestry compared to, say, a more ancestry, young population.

111
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:52,960
Is that clear? Or so those common variance are typically not that not as serious or do not have a strong effect on say,

112
00:15:53,080 --> 00:16:02,410
protein function has rare variance and if there's no selection pressure on them, so they tend to be transmitted across populations.

113
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:14,620
And then so so starting in Africa where you would have a certain level of patients as individuals

114
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:20,950
move out of Africa and not all of that variance got carried over because it's only certain,

115
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:30,430
certain people with certain variation kind of move out of Africa and carry parts of that variation with them.

116
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:44,110
So that's why compared to individuals of Africa, those newer populations have variation that's only a subsample say of variation from African.

117
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,630
Now. So that's in terms of common variance.

118
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:59,870
So we just we talked about how common variants tend to be more common in populations that are older ancestrally.

119
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:12,620
So what about rare variations? So rare variations are mutations or changes in the genome that kind of happened more recently.

120
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:18,650
And so they did not have time to kind of spread across the population.

121
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,850
So that's why we see them less often.

122
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,580
And they did not have time to just be propagated to future generations.

123
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:39,580
And these, as we talked about, these rare variants tend to be isolated or private due to pockets of populations.

124
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:51,879
And then one thing about so one thing about real variants is that they there's roughly equal amounts of rare variants across population,

125
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,690
regardless of populations, ancestral age.

126
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:02,620
So that's a that's important to note that unlike common variants on rare

127
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:12,640
variants or those that have sort of happened recently or they are about equal,

128
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:17,140
there's about equal amounts of them regardless of ancestral age.

129
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,700
So any question about. Okay.

130
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:35,099
So so let's look at looking at this, this sort of wider plot showing the proportion of shares and unshared.

131
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:41,340
So private variants comparing African-Americans and European-Americans populations.

132
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:52,200
So this bar here is for the common variance that we're defined and a cutoff point of 0.5%.

133
00:18:52,200 --> 00:19:01,980
And this bar here shows where variance so confirming to what we were saying individuals of.

134
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:10,770
So the vast majority of coming variants are shared across ethnic populations.

135
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:18,840
So they had these are older variants that had time to propagate and so that you would see them here and there.

136
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:26,880
That's why they're coming. So they are shared between Europeans, European Americans and an African American.

137
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:41,490
So that's the 76.5%. And in addition to that, we talked about how common variants there's more of them in individuals of of older population.

138
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:50,170
So you see here that African-Americans have an additional 23% variation that is just unique to them.

139
00:19:51,940 --> 00:20:01,270
And in contrast, Europeans Americans have a smaller percentage of common variants that is just unique to them.

140
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,440
So again, this the view. Just think about the map.

141
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:17,479
Some people from Africa kind of migrated out, carried over some of the variation and that kind of you see it now in European and other populations.

142
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,129
But there's a certain variation that kind of stayed in Africa and never made it out.

143
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:29,420
And that's like the unique variance of to for individuals of African American ancestry.

144
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:36,530
Mind you, these are like looking at African African-Americans, some kind of overlapping African ancestry with African American women.

145
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,430
We know that these are not like super homogeneous groups.

146
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:47,780
Like we know African-Americans are like an admixture group of Europeans and of inclusion of European ancestry and African ancestry.

147
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:52,820
But this is what this is what the data was then.

148
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:00,640
Any questions? Okay.

149
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:10,020
And then looking at rare variants. We see what we talked about, where most of them are private.

150
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,790
So a very small percentage is shared between those two groups.

151
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:32,430
So about 8.9%. And in roughly equal parts, equal and equal percentages of fair variance are seen in African-Americans versus European-Americans.

152
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:38,880
So they do have roughly the same amount of rare, unique variance, but they're not overlapping.

153
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,110
Clear. Clarification, final question.

154
00:21:54,490 --> 00:22:03,490
Okay. So so this idea that what we talked about so far is variation across populations.

155
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,880
So what about variation within an individual?

156
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:25,730
So the what we know about variation at the individual level comes or at least this data here comes from the first paper on top met.

157
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:34,299
So talking about is this kind of precision medicine medicine effort from the National Institute for Health,

158
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:41,920
Lung and Blood Diseases where they basically reach out to big cohorts or not kind of reached out,

159
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:48,489
but they worked with big cohorts that have big epidemiological studies or some case control,

160
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:54,510
but preexisting studies or cohorts that have a lot of information on people.

161
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:59,740
So there's a lot of information on disease and on exposures and things like that,

162
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:07,780
and they work with them on sequencing the human genome of those of the participants in those studies.

163
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,189
And the idea was to get good representation.

164
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:18,400
So they tried to reach out to cohorts of individuals of different ancestry.

165
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:26,710
So so I think now the estimate is about 100,000 people.

166
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,790
They keep adding more cohorts.

167
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:36,240
And data from those data.

168
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:45,780
It's not just genotyping data sequencing data. So we know every single piece of those of those individuals genomes.

169
00:23:46,950 --> 00:24:00,010
So as you can see here, for this set of data on about 50,000 individuals, we had approximately 40% Europeans, 32% African.

170
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,170
Some representation of others, Hispanic populations,

171
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:13,650
Asians and then individuals who did not really fit in any of those ancestry, self-reported ancestry.

172
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:28,030
Categories. So looking into the genome of those 50,000 individuals, we found 400 million common and rare variants.

173
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,080
So a lot more variation than we thought we had.

174
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:39,800
Basically, every one in every seven base experiences could be a varying site.

175
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:48,880
If you look if you can if you combine rare and common variants, then one in every seven base could vary.

176
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:54,370
And then majority of those 400 million variants.

177
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:57,940
So 97% were there. So they were not common.

178
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,739
And among those rare variants, 48% were singletons.

179
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:09,130
And so singletons refers to a rare variant that is found in only one person.

180
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:20,510
Yeah. So you would look at this data and see one varying site and you would actually have just one person has the dif,

181
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:28,040
like everyone say has a C and you have one person actually just have a different base at that site.

182
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:43,680
So one out of 50,000 individuals. So looking at that from this paper here we have the total number of variants and then the

183
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:50,760
percentage of that of those variants that was singleton or just occurring in a single person.

184
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:58,440
So those are the 400 million variants that we that were reported.

185
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:08,580
And I'm out out of those, the 380 million there are rare or single nucleotide variants.

186
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:17,530
And then of those, you see that about half of them were just in one individual.

187
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:24,340
So you would not you would have, as I said, one person carrying that mutation or that difference.

188
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:29,680
And then looking at those,

189
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:39,069
if we look at the percentages of those variants in the Singleton column and how they match with the coding variant variation.

190
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:48,670
So, so remember what we talked about earlier in class, how we have synonymous variation.

191
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:58,390
So variation in the genome sequence that does not change the amino acids strongly affect the protein.

192
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:03,580
And you see here that 43% were synonymous.

193
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:12,620
And then as you kind of get into more deleterious mutations or mutations that would have a stronger effect on the protein,

194
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:18,709
you would have higher percentage of singleton, so 48% for non synonymous.

195
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,490
So variance that would actually change the amino acids.

196
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:35,240
So change the protein structure stop variance, 54% frame shift which which can strongly affect the protein 60%.

197
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:48,110
So what that means is that if you have a very a variant that can strongly affect your protein or have a strong influence on function,

198
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:54,830
then it's likely to stay a singleton and not be kind of propagated across generations.

199
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:13,219
Yeah. Think makes sense. And then another finding from that study is that potential loss of protein function variants were found in 95% of genes.

200
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:23,900
So in every individual's and every gene, that could be a variation that kind of results result in a loss of function.

201
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:37,370
But that does not necessarily mean that you would have that affects your biological biology because you remember you have another copy of the gene.

202
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:42,319
There could be another mechanism by which the body can work around that mutation,

203
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:50,690
and you don't end up seeing kind of a detrimental effect for for this kind of mutation.

204
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:57,950
It could be in a gene that doesn't have a strong biological function or kind of relevance.

205
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:13,390
And then in the last slide, looking at within individuals, we see that about 3.7 million.

206
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:17,620
There are 3.7 million variants within each individual.

207
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:26,140
And the vast majority of them is our real variants.

208
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:43,730
And then you see here again that as you get into more deleterious effects on the biology and the biology on gene function,

209
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:47,720
you would see less and less of those variants.

210
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:55,240
Any questions about that? We'll check in.

211
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:20,500
And then another piece of findings from the study that each individual has about 3500 singleton variance and 2.5 potentially cause loss of function,

212
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,230
but not necessarily translate to detrimental effect.

213
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:40,690
Just because you could have a different working copy that kind of covers for the potential mutation or just it could be not relevant function.

214
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:48,420
Any questions? So why is it so easy?

215
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,670
So if you think of questions in email, reach out.

216
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:16,870
Okay. So I guess we'll go over the third question.

217
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:19,190
The Chi Square, the hard D Weinberg.

218
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:34,420
Now, when you get into your groups and see if you have to finish any last, last, last, last minute calculations, we can go more.

219
00:31:45,530 --> 00:32:02,390
Just to get the answer to the question.

220
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:14,560
Yes, I would like to know. Yes, I like the senators to just to say that we are ready to go.

221
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:33,050
So just to add that she just wanted to tell us how she would like to see what's what we're actually going to see like that.

222
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:38,620
Yeah. Did you guys just know?

223
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:50,740
I thought it was. Yeah, it does. But I think I think I saw it because I was like, oh, my word.

224
00:32:51,300 --> 00:33:04,630
What I just said it was for one thing is that I didn't want to discuss with us.

225
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:13,100
It's just like we started this one time.

226
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:24,800
I might have something this easy and there was going to be one word was It's not okay.

227
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:30,920
Yeah, yeah.

228
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:50,390
I haven't looked at it from a reasonable thing.

229
00:33:50,390 --> 00:34:06,040
So it's probably the third degree turn on that experience.

230
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:12,460
Yeah. I'm wondering if you do some sports.

231
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:21,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's true. I don't think either way.

232
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,650
Does anyone need more time for their questions?

233
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:30,679
Yeah, I think it's like we just said.

234
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,840
It's fine, but you don't know.

235
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:44,960
So this is a question where researchers are interested in knowing the relationship between two steps in disease Y and woman.

236
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,620
And they did a case control study.

237
00:34:48,770 --> 00:35:02,420
So they recruited cases. They chose cases, having the disease controls, not having the disease and genotype them at snip one and step two.

238
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:10,070
So I guess the hypothesis is that it's either one that is associated with the disease or it's two.

239
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:20,120
So the first question, without doing any calculation, does it appear that any of the snips are associated with disease y in which one?

240
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:33,100
So what do you guys think? We thought probably snapped too.

241
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:37,450
Especially if you have the double t type.

242
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:50,430
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So. So for that, we will look at the number of cases and controls and relevance to the different types.

243
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:58,920
So here you can see that they're approximately very similar across the case controls.

244
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:08,700
But first step to you notice that you have the number of cases vary by the genotype.

245
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,870
So here you have less cases compared to controls.

246
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:22,140
And then as you kind of gain more of the T earlier, you are having more cases compared to the controls.

247
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:34,770
So it's kind of like a two point. We know that it's two and then it's likely that it's the TLR that's kind of associated with disease y.

248
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:40,880
Now the question. Okay.

249
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:52,440
So for each snap is the control group in hard to one word program and then it's the case group and hard to find when you.

250
00:36:53,630 --> 00:37:00,320
So I know it's a lot of cancelations, but we were able to agree.

251
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:06,590
Was everyone able to go through the calculations shows.

252
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:22,950
So you would have to calculate the the expected compared to the observed for the controls or the cases for the controls and for the cases.

253
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,180
So it's like for chi square tests.

254
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,340
Yeah. For for chi squared testing.

255
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:40,310
And the idea is that when you do a case control study and it's a rare disease, so the controls are not likely to be similar to the cases.

256
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:47,540
Then you would have controls in how hard you Weinberg equilibrium.

257
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:54,650
And then the case is if the snap is associated with the disease, that's when you would see hardly one very disequilibrium.

258
00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:01,040
So that means it is associated with it's not randomly being kind of carried over,

259
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,510
but it's associated with the disease because you've selected cases that have the disease.

260
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:22,730
So. So. So what did you guys get for the controls for step one was it was in an equilibrium or disequilibrium.

261
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:32,720
Yeah, we got equilibrium and our number was like around 2.57.

262
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:42,170
Yeah. Yeah. So that's the chi, the overall chi statistic.

263
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:49,370
And it's significantly smaller than the the critical value of 3.84.

264
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:56,850
So we, we cannot reject the null and then all is that they are and how to one them.

265
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:01,520
What about the cases for that one which is you can.

266
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:16,290
Yeah. We also got it that they were all chi square around 2.8.

267
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:21,180
Yeah. Yeah, that's correct. That's what I have too. So 22.8.

268
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,459
Overall Chi Square still less than the 3.84.

269
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,280
So you do not reject them all. Controls and snip to.

270
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:59,010
Yeah. We also found that that was in equilibrium at 0.428, 0.4 and 2.43 years, which are.

271
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,680
But no.

272
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:24,150
And I guess you probably guessed that the cases are where you have the disequilibrium and I have the chi square of 14.878, so larger than the 3.84.

273
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:35,730
So we do reject the null and the values frequency or that this values in this number and disequilibrium.

274
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:46,650
Okay. And then their conclusions basically kind of confirmed what you did choose from just looking at the numbers.

275
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,639
And these are additional problems. We're not going to go over them.

276
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:56,430
But the answer to that should be in the keel, posted after class if you want to look at it.

00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:14,790
So make sure to look over it if you had any trouble doing the calculations or anything.
