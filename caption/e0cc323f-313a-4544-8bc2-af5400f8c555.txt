1
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:26,460
Recording in progress. Okay.

2
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:34,210
So. Good morning, everyone. First of all, a couple of logistics issues.

3
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:42,400
So I reviewed your poll on the possible dates for the final exam and you are kind of split between the two.

4
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,860
So I decided we'll do both. There will be a separate version for each day.

5
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,410
So you are free to choose whichever one you want.

6
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,080
Uh uh. But of course, choose only one of them.

7
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:01,480
And, uh. And I will be there for both in-person.

8
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,070
Uh, then, uh, so I checked with the calendar, uh,

9
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:17,230
with the academic calendar and the end of classes before the Thanksgiving recess is actually at 5 p.m.

10
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:26,440
So that leaves an opportunity for, uh, another lecture on Thursday that still falls, uh, into the regular time.

11
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:34,690
So, uh, since I said we won't have a lecture, then I'll make it optional and I'll go over some problems.

12
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:42,940
Homeworks two and three. And, uh, some topics that I think would be interesting to.

13
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,930
Expose you to. And you are most welcome to send me suggestions ahead of when?

14
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,510
Wednesday. Uh, the 23rd.

15
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,720
Right. That's the lecture. Time and I will then change the topics accordingly.

16
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:07,610
So if nothing comes from you, I will be choosing the topics. Okay.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,310
So and for today. So last time we.

18
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:23,370
Basically for the first part of the lecture, we were looking at multivariate versions of convergence,

19
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:33,840
and this is essentially prepares us to eventually formulate the multivariate central limit theorem and the law of large numbers.

20
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,960
So we still need another technical device to be able to do that.

21
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:46,829
The Kramer device and the we will probably look at it today if we have time.

22
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:56,700
Towards the end of the lecture, they, uh, we looked at, so we had a brief overview of what complex numbers are,

23
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:09,020
though we're not going into this theory deeply, but we needed just because as an object, the characteristic function is yeah.

24
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,450
Sure. That's due Wednesday.

25
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:29,250
Okay. I'll send an announcement that's due Wednesday. Let's see what I wrote.

26
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,470
There's no point giving your homework right before.

27
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,840
With Thanksgiving in the. Do you?

28
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,490
Yeah. So the homework says it's due November 23rd.

29
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:03,100
So this is what it is. Okay then.

30
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:09,280
So we looked at what complex numbers are and so we are.

31
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:16,270
So in this course we are not getting into the specific machinery around those numbers.

32
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:23,800
Uh, because the machinery as we discussed it, was that, uh, so we transfer, uh.

33
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:33,430
So we make this integral transfer, which is what's the characteristic function is we solve the problem in the transport for.

34
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:40,850
Transform space, and then we need to come back by inverting the transform.

35
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:54,260
So without the knowledge of the machinery around the complex numbers and the functions on the complex plane, so we won't be able to do the transfer.

36
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:03,650
But uh, so the, uh, the thing we're doing in this course is this simply tables for most common

37
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:11,000
distributions and multivariate normal will be one of the most useful in this respect.

38
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,050
So we'll just.

39
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:24,549
So we'll do a characteristic function of a certain probabilistic object, and then we'll just look in the table what the limit corresponds to.

40
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,840
That's going to be the approach. So we won't be inverting it by hand.

41
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:39,790
Uh, and so towards the end of the last lecture, we gave a definition for the characteristic function.

42
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:51,850
So the notation will be phi. And for a the variable x.

43
00:05:52,890 --> 00:06:04,410
Uh, it depends. And they are given t and this is an expected value of e to i g x.

44
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:12,390
Right. And because there is an eye there, it's generally a complex number.

45
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,490
We'll talk about the properties of characteristic functions today.

46
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:32,909
And so for symmetry, we will show that, uh, as a note that for symmetric distribution, it's actually not, uh, a function of the complex plane.

47
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,660
It's just a real number and real function.

48
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:51,110
Okay. So the thing that makes, uh, characteristic function that's most useful and this is why we're using them is,

49
00:06:51,110 --> 00:07:00,230
uh, for establishing limits in terms of a weak distribution for the variable.

50
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:12,590
And there is a very nice theorem that we will improve again because we are not getting into the specific the machinery of characteristic functions.

51
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:22,940
There's a living theorem that says that we can actually study the weak convergence using characteristic functions.

52
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,890
And there will be two versions of this theorem.

53
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:37,530
So the first version is so in both cases, it's about it's an.

54
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:45,180
That's a sequence of random variables from one generally to infinity.

55
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,930
Uh. Sequence.

56
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:02,040
Of the variables. And we will distinguish two.

57
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:20,870
The formulations for the serum. So one is that it is known and is kind of less useful in the utilitarian sense that we are using it.

58
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,880
Um, it is now. That's.

59
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,180
This sequence has elements. It is a leap.

60
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:42,300
The Virgin's. Limits.

61
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,480
And this is the random variable x.

62
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,260
Okay. So we know that Xand is going weekly.

63
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:02,720
Uh. So that there is a limit to this convergence.

64
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:10,030
Then we know that it is and has a characteristic function.

65
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,800
I am.

66
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:31,130
This sense I'm using this way is when you single in a generic form, it means different things, but usually it's some characteristic of the variable.

67
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,790
Yes. In this particular case, it means has a characteristic function.

68
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:57,520
And since it's known that, uh, there is a limit, uh, so that limit also has a characteristic function.

69
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:08,800
So we discussed last time that the characteristic functions exist for any random variable, regardless of what type this random variable is.

70
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:16,960
So it's just a notation in terms of the second line and third line.

71
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:25,420
And so. These things.

72
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,400
So these are the conditions of the theorem.

73
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:50,300
Our equivalent to sai and of g converging in the calculus sense complex available talk a sense to of t for any t and uniform t.

74
00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:03,600
It's just another way to save energy. Okay.

75
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:18,260
So that's one equivalence. And so if you pay attention to how it's formulated, that's not very useful in terms of the goal that I declare.

76
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:23,130
The characteristic functions will be serving as an instrument, uh,

77
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:29,900
because it's not because the goal was to find weak limits for certain random variables.

78
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,990
And here the thing starts with already in existing limits, right?

79
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:46,640
So these more useful? We don't know. If.

80
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:52,100
It's and has a limit on what that limit is.

81
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:22,540
If it exists. So this this sentence is actually outside of the conditions of the theater.

82
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:28,030
And, of course, it just describes the situation where the theater will be most useful.

83
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:34,240
Right. The conditions start now. So I have a sequence and.

84
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:43,780
That. As some characteristic functions of t.

85
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,040
This is what I know. I don't know anything else.

86
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:56,530
I want to find out if Sam has a minute. And then so I do have that.

87
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:09,940
So when I look at fire of tea, I find that it has a limit as and goes to infinity to some function of tea.

88
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,320
At this point, I don't know if this is the characteristic function or not.

89
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:26,200
I just found the limits of a complex, valued function.

90
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,570
These points. I do not know.

91
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,860
It is a characteristic function.

92
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:58,600
And this, by the way, a beautiful theorem that gives a necessary and sufficient condition for some function to be a characteristic function.

93
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,300
Well, my last chance for, for that matter, what probability generating function?

94
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:13,790
It's a theorem. Very beautiful result, but we won't go over it.

95
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:20,610
So maybe I'll put it in the. Optional lecture on the 23rd.

96
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,640
Okay. And so now comes the.

97
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:37,150
Statements of what we want to prove of the theorem, what we are not going to prove it.

98
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,590
It's just the statement of the fear. So first.

99
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,460
So it follows that Sam has a week limit.

100
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:02,640
When the variable x and seconds fi is a characteristic function of x.

101
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:29,070
And so that gives us the recipe of how to go about finding, uh, we convergence limits of sequences of random variables.

102
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:35,790
So what it takes is taking the characteristic function of the elements of the sequence,

103
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,320
then finding the limit as m goes to infinity of those characteristic functions,

104
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:47,070
and then coming back to the world of the random variables, uh, by the Levy Theorem.

105
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,480
Uh, so that limit of characteristic functions exists.

106
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:57,540
It is a characteristic function of the limiting random variable and that the variable also exists.

107
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:12,510
Okay. So this is without proof. Okay.

108
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:21,180
So now that prepares us to consider various limiting statements and gives us the instruments.

109
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:32,550
But before we do that, so we need to familiarize ourselves with the properties of characteristic functions.

110
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:42,110
And so we need the, uh, a couple of functions that will serve as limits.

111
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,760
Okay. So we'll start with a nonrandom.

112
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:14,400
Yes. Right. That means that the probability that X is equal to some constancy is one.

113
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:26,310
Okay. So now what is a characteristic function?

114
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:37,380
So go by definition. So it's supposed to be e e to i, g and x is equal to C with probability one.

115
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:44,330
In that case, right? Nothing is random under the expectation.

116
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,500
So it's just e to a t.

117
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:57,990
C. K. So we see that form for the Fae.

118
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:04,050
Then we know that the round, the variable behind that, if we invert that transform,

119
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:12,030
which we are not doing, but we just notice that the inverse that is unique is these are not random acts.

120
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:21,120
So if I have. So if we have x m.

121
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,860
Um. Having some characteristic function.

122
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,520
Fi in t and we find.

123
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:39,800
That this fae end of t is end goes to infinity.

124
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:48,440
Uh, those 2et in some context, see, then what does that mean?

125
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,620
So then this would mean that it's.

126
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,240
And there was weekly constancy by the Navy theory.

127
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:18,550
And moreover. So last time we looked at the special case facts converging weekly to counsel them, that was implying a stronger version of convergence.

128
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,360
That is actually girls in probability to that constant.

129
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:31,800
Right. So this is what would be happening to consistency, right?

130
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:45,520
So if you want to study consistency using characteristic functions, uh, so you have you interpret and as an estimate of your parameter of interest,

131
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:50,560
so you find the characteristic function of that estimate find its limits.

132
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:59,450
Uh, and then if that limit has this form, then you'll know that your estimate is consistent for C.

133
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,860
So if X is an estimate.

134
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,080
Then this would mean that it's in his.

135
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:23,570
Insistence. Fauci.

136
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:40,370
Has the truth arrived to that? So this language consistent for us does not necessarily mean that exam is consistent for.

137
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:46,530
Uh, the because they have maybe a disconnect between the, uh.

138
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,600
The parameters of your model and the estimates. Right.

139
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:57,100
So, for example, if you have. Growth data, right?

140
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,240
You estimate the probability within the interval by a constant that will be equal to.

141
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,650
Arbitrary value of the function in that interval.

142
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:20,180
Um, anyway, so I didn't want to confuse you, but, uh, so just in case you have a mis specified model,

143
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:26,809
you typically have estimates that don't go to true parameters, but they do go somewhere, right?

144
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:30,590
And that somewhere is what they estimate is consistent for.

145
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,480
So I'm using that language to be general here.

146
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:47,880
Okay. That's that's one property and one function for a table to check against as we find limits.

147
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,180
And another one, uh, that's most common is normal distribution.

148
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,650
So I have ADCs in the univariate situation.

149
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:15,860
So I have a distributor that's normal with something new and sigma squared.

150
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:23,390
And then this has a characteristic function for you of t.

151
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:29,510
It has the form e to i t new.

152
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:36,380
Minus T squared. Sigma squared over two.

153
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:52,930
Now you can find it using a definition of characteristic function and just doing integration there.

154
00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:06,330
And the hint, uh. To prove.

155
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:16,760
This thing is dead. So use integral minus infinity to infinity.

156
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,620
F of x. D x where f is normal.

157
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,160
PDF. And that is, of course, equal to one.

158
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:41,249
Right then. So the five t will be integral -1780 to infinity.

159
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:46,480
You need to i t x. If affects the x.

160
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,920
This is just an explicit form for the expectation.

161
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,660
E e to. It's right where it says normal.

162
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,830
This is a normal PDF.

163
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:18,040
Right and because these are normal pdf has is an exponent, right with a linear quadratic part and it's multiplied by another exponent.

164
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:23,049
So you can arrange terms and recognize under the integral that you actually have

165
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:29,470
an integral over the normal pdf with some new notation for its parameters.

166
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,430
But it has to be one that gives you a quick result.

167
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:38,050
That's that's this one, of course if you start taking in the girls.

168
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:45,280
In a straight form and not using the these facts.

169
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:54,950
So the derivation will take a lot longer. Okay, then what else?

170
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:02,160
So that would be the most common distributions. Then.

171
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:14,970
So using the. The Mueller.

172
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:31,710
Formula. We have that fi s t is actually equal to expectation.

173
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:42,310
Cosine to x plus i times the expectation.

174
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:56,440
15 years. And then if the distribution of X is symmetric.

175
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,530
Then. So we is a symmetric function of x, which is the sine.

176
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:30,940
Well. It's technically not symmetric, but that's plus or minus, right?

177
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:39,000
I would just say that I expect that the value. All of the signs.

178
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:55,930
G x is going to be zero. Cosine of x is going to be positive for positive and negative for negative x and then signs will switch,

179
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:04,569
but they will do that in a synchronous fashion. So the integral will actually have positive and negative values.

180
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:10,390
Totally cancel out if it's multiplied by a symmetric, uh, pdf.

181
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:23,079
And then the result will be zero and the consequences that symmetric random variables will not have the conflicts of the imaginary path.

182
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:32,750
Right. The one with the I. So that would mean that fi x of t for such variables.

183
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:47,070
Is a real function. Real value the function. Yeah.

184
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:51,770
We can check if this is true because we have the normal distribution of the rate.

185
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:55,720
Uh. Somewhere.

186
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:08,710
So there it is. So the normal distribution, let's see if I have normal with the zero mean it will be symmetric around zero, right?

187
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:14,240
And then if new is zero, then the eye goes away.

188
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:18,100
Right. So I'll just have a real valid function.

189
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:32,200
So X is. I'm not. Zero seven squared.

190
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:41,810
See. We'll have a. To New April zero because we use zero.

191
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:55,600
Okay then. So another very useful property that we already had advertised on as an appetizer is how?

192
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:02,480
The characteristic functions of convolutions look like.

193
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:14,070
Uh, so if I have X and Y when the variables and we consider.

194
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:21,100
X plus Y. They have the characteristic function of X plus Y.

195
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,830
She? What is it?

196
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:32,430
So it's an expected value of e i t and then I have x plus y.

197
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:39,470
Because of the properties of the exponents. I will have that.

198
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:48,980
Let's say X is independent of Y, right? Otherwise it's not all that useful.

199
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:59,460
So then I will have expectation of the product offering the variable cycle to the product, the expectations.

200
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,559
You too. I t y right.

201
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:15,650
And this guy is the characteristic function of x. And this guy is the characteristic function of Y by definition.

202
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:20,140
So we have that for five x plus y is actually.

203
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:31,430
Three X times five Y. So we can generalize these results to sequences.

204
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:45,470
See, consider. It's an.

205
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:59,180
A sequence of idea variables. Okay.

206
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:12,550
So what happens then is that the characteristic function of X and is actually the characteristic function of x y of x one.

207
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:19,560
Right. And is equal to some phi. Then.

208
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:30,550
Uh, so my characteristic function of a sum k from one to infinity x and.

209
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:37,220
Well, let's do not to infinity. So at the end.

210
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:51,850
So that's going to be a product I will have in terms of that product and each one will be the same will be the function five.

211
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:58,190
So that's five taken to the power of. In this case.

212
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:10,670
Right. So we already know how to deal with this some, uh, over independent observations.

213
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:18,080
Right. So that prepares us well for the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem and the sample need.

214
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:25,790
So they all have something like this. And a lot of other statistics are of this form.

215
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,590
So we just take the characteristic function to the power and look for the limit as it goes to things.

216
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:39,290
This is what we will do when we can see the law of large numbers in the Central Theorem.

217
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:54,139
Uh, we, uh, can also extend this resolve to stochastic processes because if you, uh, pretend that X case and increments of some stochastic process,

218
00:32:54,140 --> 00:33:01,220
then the process value at some point in time is going to be the sum of its increments from zero until that time.

219
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,240
So it will have a form like this.

220
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:17,030
And if your time is discrete, then this would be, uh, a characteristic function for the value of the process of the point.

221
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:27,490
In time and. So, uh, and it can be generalized to, uh, nondescript time as well.

222
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:32,520
We're not going there. Okay.

223
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:45,850
So what else? Because it's the moment generating functions is actually a special case of characteristic function.

224
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:54,230
All of a sudden our demand they and so we can find moments using characteristic functions.

225
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:07,410
AX using. Characteristic functions.

226
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:24,020
How does that work? So we know that moments, let's say K.

227
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,890
So they are expected to the values of X taken to power.

228
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,390
Now, of course, they don't always exist.

229
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:42,510
So if we know, for example, that it is X is a cachet distribution, then moments won't exist in the mean rules exist.

230
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:58,840
But if they do exist and I do have a characteristic function, then I can take a derivative of the characteristic function and evaluate it.

231
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,940
Zero. So this is a mutation for. Derivative of all the key.

232
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,670
Of the characteristic function of G. Over they are to.

233
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:28,650
And so if we do that.

234
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:33,430
And differentiate under the expectation symbol.

235
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:45,160
So what I will have some differentiating e to i t x right over t and I have i x.

236
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:56,320
It's just the case isn't next to t when I differentiate this fall on the k station to be coming down right.

237
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:01,850
And if I differentiate K times it will be coming down k times.

238
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:10,660
So I will have i2kx to k and a derivative does not change the exponent.

239
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:20,799
And this will be. And if I'm evaluating it, it's typical zero.

240
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,580
I first differentiate than I said t equal to zero.

241
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:30,740
So that gives me I took the expectation of.

242
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:38,809
It's K and e to I it's t when t zero.

243
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:44,630
That's just the one. So that's it, right? Then this thing is moments.

244
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:59,020
Right. So, you know, they are the moments, uh, derivatives of characteristic function with arguments set to zero divided by I took.

245
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,210
Right. And you also know that this is going to be a real number.

246
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,620
So we will have the units in general.

247
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:18,670
But because you are dividing by today, so that will give you the real number, which is what the moment is.

248
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:37,220
So Taylor expansion. Of Phi Phi Phi.

249
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:44,930
Again, we are not getting into the theory of the complex functions of complex variables and complex value functions.

250
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:51,810
Uh, but you can take it for granted that the theory is pretty similar to real.

251
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:59,090
Uh. Calculus and the Taylor expansion works in the same way.

252
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:05,040
So. And you can write a tale of an expansion for it.

253
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:11,020
They will borrow the Taylor expansion of the exponent.

254
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:23,380
We'll take into account that's the argument is actually I times X.

255
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:32,580
K factorial and then fi k zero.

256
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:38,590
Plus. So this is.

257
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:48,310
Simple from calculus. The small. Oh. Of whatever, let's say.

258
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:10,330
These are some things. That satisfies the property.

259
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,220
We will go to zero. Is this thing go somewhere?

260
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:24,300
It's a generic notation. Right, so on.

261
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:33,280
In this form, it means that this is a term they're being divided by this argument,

262
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,810
absolute value of t two and it will go to zero as n goes to infinity.

263
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,060
So all of this thing.

264
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:56,020
Means that if I divide it. Buy the argument.

265
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:59,270
It's going to go to zero as there is to 50.

266
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:07,379
A definition of this symbol. That's just in case you did not have it in calculus.

267
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:14,130
This there's a big oh that would mean that it goes to a constant that's not equal to zero.

268
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,820
There's a small. It's equal to zero.

269
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:28,910
Okay. And, uh, so then, uh, because I know how these derivatives look like.

270
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:51,990
So I know that they're equal to. I took. And then so we, uh, expand the characteristic function into a Taylor expansion and we find that,

271
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:59,820
uh, uh, let's see, in terms of it exists, then that means that the first that moments will exist.

272
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:09,700
So and exists in the moment, if an end moment exists.

273
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,730
And that would mean that all the previous ones exist as well.

274
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:19,680
So that's equivalent to. I.

275
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,370
Of all the ones all the way to the end derivatives.

276
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:43,880
So they exist in zero. Okay.

277
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:50,120
So then, uh, just for your information, so we're not going to use it.

278
00:41:51,670 --> 00:42:05,270
Uh, I will give you an inverse formula. So suppose I have x x.

279
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:13,980
That's the PDF. Random variable ads.

280
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,590
And they have a characteristic function. Five x.

281
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:24,870
That corresponds to X. The.

282
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:32,280
So this pdf. So this is inverse inverse transform.

283
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,100
So that seemed to go from minus infinity to infinity.

284
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,970
E minus i t x.

285
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,880
Packs of t. The T.

286
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:55,000
So at first glance, if you are not trying to capture details, it looks similar to the transform itself.

287
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:05,980
So for the transform itself. So there's no minus here and there is a pdf of X instead of the PHI.

288
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:16,500
And so you can also do the difference between.

289
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:24,470
Yes. X. Why?

290
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:30,790
And if it's a fix, there's another version of this universe transformed.

291
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:40,310
So this is going to be the growth minus infinity to infinity, minus X.

292
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,570
Minus e. I. T y.

293
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:53,460
She? X of t d t.

294
00:43:55,540 --> 00:44:02,320
Right. So the transform itself is an integral over X and it's a function of they are given T.

295
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:08,500
The inverse transform is an integral over T and it's back the function of x right.

296
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:19,660
But at this point, if it did not have complex variable calculus and functions of complex variables, you wouldn't know how to take these integrals.

297
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:25,840
It's not like you do it in calculus. There are interesting things there.

298
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:32,590
The contours, special points, all sort of stuff on the complex plane.

299
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:37,890
So we're not getting into it. Okay.

300
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:47,610
So this was the instruments. Right. So we now get to use them and we'll start with the weak law of large numbers.

301
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:06,500
Yeah. It's typically abbreviated w.

302
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:10,310
L. L m. Okay.

303
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:15,140
So what is it about? It's about the sample mean.

304
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,780
Sample mean is one of and some of my.

305
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:31,810
For one an x by. Right where I.

306
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:37,890
Or independent identically distributed spread the variables.

307
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:44,870
And that simple means the girls to the junior.

308
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:59,510
Which means that one of and some of I from one and it goes goes and ability to expect it to be.

309
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:04,370
Let's say a black swan. And we'll call that new.

310
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:17,560
Right. So what are the instruments? So we are first of all, we have a convolution here.

311
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:21,710
Right. Because we have some AI from 1 to 3, unlike.

312
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:32,270
Uh, then we have convergence and probability while the characteristic functions give us, uh, uh, weak convergence.

313
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:38,070
So we are basically using, uh, this type of argument.

314
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:48,260
Right. Uh, so we want to show that our characteristic function goes to, uh, one for a constant, and that constant is equal to new.

315
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:59,149
And so then from weak convergence, we can, uh, deduce the convergence in probability,

316
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:04,850
and then, uh, this will be the proof of the we call off large numbers.

317
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:10,090
We will also use the tail extension. So tools.

318
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:17,160
So it's and the girls and from ability to ex.

319
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:25,250
Characteristic functions. Um.

320
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:31,180
These implying. The ax is not random.

321
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:41,540
This would imply that x and those in probability to see.

322
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:52,270
I have one overhand right. And.

323
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:01,490
Okay. That's. That's just. It's also using and the Taylor expansion.

324
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:23,990
So prove. So in accordance with the recipe that is implied by the Navy's theorem formulation.

325
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:42,000
Be. So we are considering the expected value, but considering the characteristic function of one over and of the sample mean sum of I for one and x.

326
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,670
Right. So I need to bring one of em. Uh.

327
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:57,210
Into the. It's I.

328
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:07,940
So that's some. One, two, and it's equal.

329
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:15,940
And so this is my view. It's a right this time applying the ladies recipe.

330
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:28,240
So these will mean that and we have for the ID so my new exercise and still idea and the variable.

331
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:41,040
When the variables so we had when considering the convolutions that this needs to be taken to a power.

332
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:52,440
The fi is the one of access and the argument will be till the end because a divided x ii by m right?

333
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:57,110
So it's e to i t my new x high rate and the new excise.

334
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,720
So what m? So my t gets divided by m.

335
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:12,540
Okay. So then I have expanded into a Taylor series and it will take the first two terms.

336
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:21,840
Uh, so the one and the first derivative evaluated at zero times the argument which is still valid.

337
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:28,860
Uh, plus something of smaller order of magnitude.

338
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,900
Then to Europe where this has taken and.

339
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:56,889
So they. This is equal to one +50 times t and taken to power.

340
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:12,040
And then plus I will have this all times and and so all will go to zero when uh, divided by one over.

341
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,850
And so if I do it, times in it will go.

342
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:27,390
Two zero. It's. At a slower pace, rates will be over one.

343
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:32,070
This is just something that will go to zero as it goes to infinity.

344
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:41,630
120. Right.

345
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:50,600
And then I'll look at this thing and recognize that this is a healer limits.

346
00:51:54,180 --> 00:52:05,970
Another beautiful result in mathematics, namely that the limit of one plus x and two and is actually e2x.

347
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:29,610
This goes to infinity. So this thing will go as and goes to infinity.

348
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:43,830
To E to whatever is next to the M in brackets and next to the and I have a product of five prime of zero times D.

349
00:52:53,020 --> 00:53:02,130
So it's E. So high five prime zero.

350
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:10,070
Times t. Okay, then.

351
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:22,540
This is equal. So because of the relationship between moments and derivatives of the function phi.

352
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:33,310
The five prime. Zero.

353
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:40,320
So that's. It's one.

354
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:55,870
Some may have missed the eyes somewhere later.

355
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:09,090
So it's I. [INAUDIBLE] explain those new times to you.

356
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:29,060
And this is a characteristic function of a constant. Constant equal to new rates.

357
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:34,830
So then as a result I have that my sample mean.

358
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:51,230
Girls Weekly. To a constant and random random variable is in goes to infinity.

359
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:55,370
And this in turn means that the sample mean.

360
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:04,180
Bill's improbability to me. This is what we.

361
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:11,020
Intended to prove. Okay.

362
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:19,660
So we'll have a five minute break and then look at the another arguments like this.

363
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:40,840
Right. So I'll correct the idea because I noticed that I lost the eye somewhere.

364
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:53,390
Yeah. Whatever.

365
00:55:54,230 --> 00:56:00,160
Wednesday. Right. Wednesday? Yeah, 23rd. Okay, I'll correct that.

366
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:42,820
Thursday. Wednesday. Okay.

367
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:08,450
Okay. Um. So consider so you have an integral right.

368
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:16,890
Right. So you have a definition. Right. So E.

369
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:21,010
Oh, yeah, that's right.

370
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:27,560
He's supposed to go to. That's right from the conventions.

371
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:32,890
So that easement across from minus infinity to A.G.

372
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:41,220
Right. And you can represent it as an integral from minus A to a as the integral outside.

373
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:47,940
Sorry. The.

374
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:53,760
My to say to a great. So for this one.

375
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:58,730
And they they will both go to zero, but for different reasons.

376
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:10,300
So your f is bound. It's. So you just made Eurasian bison by constant flights.

377
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:14,280
So F is. So you can see.

378
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:19,540
Right. So you will take that far outside of each of the two girls.

379
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:26,180
Uh, one of them will have to go over the tails of the distribution of a PDF.

380
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:45,760
So this guy will be integral over the tails of the PDF and integral over PDF as one that you do from minus infinity to infinity.

381
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:52,370
That means that integral over the tails will go to zero as you expand the.

382
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:59,090
Right. And this one will. You can measure Isaac by the soup.

383
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:08,470
The Super Bowl, go to zero. Right.

384
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:11,980
So the soup for the for the first one and the.

385
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:17,790
Normalization condition would mean that this day will go to zero.

386
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:27,280
Right. And so you will certainly convert this to a difference, right?

387
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:34,850
To show that the goal. 208.

388
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:49,220
Yes. It's not equal. Yeah. So you take heed to the difference between these two?

389
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:54,350
Yes. You need to show that it goes to zero.

390
00:59:54,440 --> 01:00:12,420
This is how it goes. Yeah.

391
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:22,940
This is just the recognition that this type of condition can be a definition simply of a human entanglement with which is a discrete random variable.

392
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:29,760
It's just by definition, you need to spell out.

393
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:36,500
How this is related to a definition of free movement.

394
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:44,250
The goal. Because your excel discipline function is played by the conditions of the problem.

395
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:50,580
But it's then a similar argument when you take this difference.

396
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:57,030
It's about the rhythm. Integral, not necessarily the difference.

397
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:02,109
Solve the problem. Three You can just look at this. One, interpret it.

398
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:08,340
This is. Some some that between the two of the blue sons and the missing is certainly an integral.

399
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:13,760
It has a limit. It will be squeezed in equal to the limit.

400
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:32,250
And the limit is this integral. Because you multiply by em.

401
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:44,820
Right. So if this guy goes to zero, uh, as it goes to infinity, then ten times this one is only guaranteed to go to zero.

402
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:58,220
Okay. So. So you have.

403
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:01,860
Let's see. Oh, this one over here. Right. What does that mean?

404
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:07,770
That's. That's something. Such that.

405
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:16,730
If you divide something by the arguments, it will go to zero as in the US to infinity.

406
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:26,380
The thing is actually in something. He goes to zero is in goes to infinity.

407
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:35,190
Right. So when I multiply by and I have it, it will just go to zero.

408
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,510
But without. And being mentioned.

409
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:47,150
So it's just. It's like this. Because this is by definition something that goes to zero.

410
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:57,110
Those two incidents. Right. So the only one available is something divided by these girls.

411
01:02:57,110 --> 01:03:01,880
201 is just something that goes to zero.

412
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:17,010
It's a different something. I mean, in the end, this notation is just to spare you some words that you would have to say.

413
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:26,710
Right. Because you would have to to use to say that these when when multiplied by M goes to zero.

414
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:29,710
And this says the same thing.

415
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:40,030
So if you don't like the old notation, you would have to say that this is something that goes to zero one multiplied by M.

416
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:48,390
Right. And this is just something that goes to zero, because it's already been multiplied by.

417
01:03:56,650 --> 01:04:00,990
Okay. Shall we continue?

418
01:04:04,190 --> 01:04:07,640
So I corrected where I lost the eye. Uh.

419
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:11,760
Right. So that's. That's. Here in.

420
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:22,610
Up there. Now should look correct and let me know if I still have.

421
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:33,620
Any misprints. And what we want to do is repeat this argument.

422
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:45,050
So the first argument of this type was focused on the first term of the Taylor expansion, right?

423
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:53,420
So the logic of the central limit theorem is essentially a similar argument with we will focus on the second term.

424
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:58,760
And in order not to deal with the first one, we need it to be zero.

425
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:05,890
And that's done by saying that the mean value of whatever random variable we're considering is zero.

426
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:13,610
So then prime will be equal to zero and it will disappear.

427
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:26,080
And so the and this is what the normalization condition will do as well as the.

428
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:34,230
Sample mean? So you had an.

429
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:43,260
So this is sample mean. Mine the.

430
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:48,390
So that would make the meaning of my run the variable.

431
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:54,450
When I apply the Taylor expansion argument then it will be zero, right?

432
01:05:54,450 --> 01:06:03,749
I'm subtracting the mean and then it's going to go to weakly now to a non degenerate.

433
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:11,280
Then the variable not a constant but a normal with mean zero and variance sigma squared.

434
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:24,250
So prove. So my new ex.

435
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:32,250
We'll be. Um.

436
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:37,010
X minus new. And.

437
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:55,300
Has a mean of zero. So then I will consider Phi Square or the Van Times.

438
01:06:57,170 --> 01:07:11,150
And. So one of the.

439
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:15,750
And some of I for one two and.

440
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:22,650
U x i. Right. So this type of construct.

441
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:36,110
And from this point on, their argument is pretty similar to what we have for the law of large numbers.

442
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:47,690
But I will keep two terms of the Taylor expansion. So instead of an it's the square or the van that's getting there.

443
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:52,559
Right. So I have square the van in the numerator and denominator.

444
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:56,730
So that would give me one over square of the van. Uh.

445
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:08,219
Wow. So we'll have the double prime evaluated at zero times, one half times the square of the argument,

446
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:15,840
which is, uh, t squared over and the whole thing taken to n plus.

447
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:30,010
Something that goes to zero. Actually.

448
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:38,930
One of em, right? Then.

449
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:46,550
So this guy is equal to three times the mean value of my new x.

450
01:08:52,430 --> 01:09:00,230
That's easily any I and because I center that this is equal to zero so I won't have this term.

451
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:06,880
So then I'm having the, uh, EULA, uh, limit.

452
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:12,880
Uh, now, just with a different, uh. Efficient.

453
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:20,080
So this will go. Is and goes to infinity.

454
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:49,549
To. And I need to do the price of the Frye double prime is I square that times the second moment and

455
01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:54,830
the second moment for a sense this centered around the variable would just be Sigma Square,

456
01:09:54,980 --> 01:10:04,480
right. And I square is going to be equal to minus one V and I will have, uh,

457
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:13,280
and because of the first term disappearing, I will not have the, uh, um, the I part to the exponent.

458
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:21,379
I will just have the exponent associated with the second term, which is what minus uh,

459
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:31,040
from the I squared, then sigma squared, then one half and then t squared.

460
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,950
So if I collect all the terms and this is.

461
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:50,470
Characteristic functions. Of a normal random variable would mean zero one sigma squared.

462
01:10:51,720 --> 01:11:05,530
So by the Levy Theorem. This is what we wanted to prove.

463
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:10,470
Namely, that's the square with the van.

464
01:11:17,050 --> 01:11:20,130
The sample mean minus the mean.

465
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:29,770
There was weekly to random variable x that has the normal distribution zero sigma squared.

466
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:59,440
Okay. So in this context, so we basically establish two classical results for something that's uh, uh, scalar value of random variable.

467
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:10,510
Uh, but we also have similar statements for the multivariate, uh, version of the central limit theorem, in which case the,

468
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:17,530
instead of the Sigma Square, we will have a modern multivariate normal distribution with some covariance.

469
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:22,090
And uh, so same for the law of large numbers.

470
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:38,950
So it will be, um, a similar statement except that my x I am x will be vector value at random variables e and in order to do that, we will actually.

471
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:48,070
Reduce. The multivariate.

472
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:03,160
Who's. Of C to.

473
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:15,810
To you knew variants. And the thing that does that is the so-called cream, the device.

474
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:30,330
Don't confuse the second guy with the wild rights with the E.

475
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:39,850
So that's not the wild. Then the test, that's equivalent to a likelihood ratio.

476
01:13:40,690 --> 01:13:50,000
So this is a different guy. And we will have it in the next lecture after Thanksgiving.

477
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:53,990
Right. And optional war lecture.

478
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:02,690
That's Wednesday. November 23rd.

479
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:09,040
Correct the announcements because I said Thursday that.

480
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:18,380
Okay. That's it for today. So if I don't see you at the lecture, I wish you a happy Thanksgiving.
