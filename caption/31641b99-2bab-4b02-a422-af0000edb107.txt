1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:04,320
Listen to. Oh, I finally finished watching it last night.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,510
I at our podcasts just go to 52 and they talk.

3
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,600
You start with that history about me.

4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,600
You know what I mean? You know the stories we've heard before. Straight from the beginning.

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,830
So it just. She starts from the womb. So it takes a long time.

6
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:43,140
So I think that's all I heard was that I think the whole interview about going back and forth, which is interesting.

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:51,930
Like, I like listening to it, but for the reflection, they don't start talking about predictions of perfection.

8
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,860
That's what I heard before.

9
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:04,430
So in a way you're going to like because I was wondering how I would ask you to push the final paper until the end?

10
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,780
I don't know. Like, worth a while.

11
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:17,310
Yeah. And like I said, science is one of my other are other guys are, you know.

12
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,529
Oh, that would be great. So she said she started with 14.

13
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:36,750
So because of that one, I think I can I can now I'm okay to focus on this one, but I know that literally.

14
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:48,930
So if one is writing papers, is the paper you have eating disorders and throw them out, I guess.

15
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,610
But that wouldn't happen right now.

16
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,560
Actually, I already wrote it.

17
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,669
Yeah, I'm not as worried about that. But I know eating disorder.

18
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,149
You actually, I think it's like, yeah, that's what I'm like.

19
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,530
I'm a focus on our attention and all of this, you know? So you can't really like.

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That one has to be like, I actually want to do it.

21
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:25,670
And I like that one's an interesting one. Oh, yeah.

22
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:36,990
And I think that it's like it's really, it's good for buyers enough to.

23
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,140
Oh, my God, we're really different.

24
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:48,420
Yeah. How do you live with you guys?

25
00:02:48,630 --> 00:03:02,970
That's really funny. Was probably my favorite. Yeah, I think that my lab is actually going to do the job with them to start school.

26
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:25,200
So, you know, I think also I think that I will be speaking on exactly how it turns out.

27
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,820
I mean, know this is all part of that.

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:58,680
You know, I think it's kind of like over my shoulder, like I think it's kind of like, oh, yeah, we're going for what I should do.

29
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,250
Okay. It must be a lot of deadlines coming up people are working on right now, huh?

30
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,770
What sort of papers do you have? People are getting it done.

31
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,239
So today we're going to talk about the second part of lifestyle modification.

32
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,890
And I gave you a couple of readings.

33
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:29,160
One was based on the standard of care center, a medical practice for obesity and diabetes that the American Diabetes Association.

34
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:35,040
And they talk a fair bit about the look ahead study, which we're going to talk about today.

35
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:45,959
And I also put in an in your reading assignment for today and then analysis on top intuitive eating and mindful eating.

36
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,090
And we won't get to that discussion today. I'll I'll bring that up again on Monday.

37
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:59,750
So today we're just going to focus on the lifestyle modification in regard to recommendations for physical action.

38
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:09,030
Look ahead, study and then I'll talk a little bit about what exercise does in regard to insulin sensitivity.

39
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,330
Okay. So here's the learning objectives for today.

40
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:19,260
Describe physical activity guidelines for children, adults, older adults and people who are pregnant.

41
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,760
I'd be able to provide examples as to how exercise has immediate and long term benefits.

42
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,120
Explain the importance of non exercise physical activity.

43
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:44,010
These are this is activity that is just everyday movement that you would expend energy and it's significant as you'll see.

44
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:51,930
Describe the importance of exercise and insulin sensitivity and an intensive lifestyle interventions.

45
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:58,049
And I got a three slice from Jeff Horowitz to explain this relationship and then

46
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,700
finally describe the experimental design and outcomes of the Lookahead study.

47
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:13,290
And then I will also mention after that a little bit about whether or not these lifestyle interventions increase the risk of of eating disorders.

48
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:20,260
Okay. Physical activity. First of all, when we talk about physical activity, we talk about MCS.

49
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:28,640
This is the unit of activity and the units for an activity are based on oxygen consumption.

50
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:34,310
So you're looking at oxygen consumption as a readout for energy expenditure.

51
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:46,580
So for one unit, one metabolic equivalent or one net, you're talking about energy that you would expand at rest.

52
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,310
This would be equivalent to the energy at the resting metabolic rate.

53
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:58,700
So approximately 3.1 milliliters per kilogram per minute equals one mat.

54
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:07,580
And then as you increase your activity level, depending again on oxygen consumption and that level increases.

55
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,640
So what do we consider moderate our physical activity?

56
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:19,890
It's something that is equivalent to 3 to 5.9 metabolic equivalents.

57
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:23,750
And again, this is this is relevant to oxygen consumption.

58
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:30,630
Vigorous physical activity is when you exceed that 6% threshold.

59
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:39,480
And most of the time we're talking about aerobic activity when we're talking about net units.

60
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:45,570
Okay. So what do I mean by moderate or modest physical activity?

61
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:58,110
So walking is an example. Any kind of activity or things you might do around the house, housework that would increase your heart rate.

62
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:07,120
It might cause you to break a sweat, but you could still talk to someone and not be breathless while you're engaged in that activity.

63
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,590
That's what would be considered moderate physical activity.

64
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:18,450
Once you get to a higher level, you exceed that six net threshold.

65
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:23,490
You're talking about activities that would leave you breathless where you couldn't carry on a conversation

66
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,830
and that would have you have a limited ability to carry on that activity for a very long time.

67
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:41,060
So in 2018, physical activity guidelines for Americans came out.

68
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:48,200
And what I'm giving you first here is the physical activity guidelines for adults.

69
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:58,070
And I've mentioned this before. The minimum physical activity level that you should be engaged in is 150 minutes per week.

70
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,730
And again, this is that that moderate physical activity level.

71
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,870
Or the requirement in terms of time is about half that.

72
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:12,020
If you engage in vigorous physical activity, it's going to have the same physiologic effect.

73
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:24,330
In other words. And in addition to that, resistance training and the resistance training is a couple of times a week involving major muscle groups.

74
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:30,730
So compound type exercises where you are engaging a large muscle groups,

75
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:38,770
a compound exercise might be something like a deadlift or some other type of activity where you're

76
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:43,270
engaging major muscle groups in the lower body and it could include the upper body as well.

77
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,159
And in terms of the number of exercises,

78
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:57,630
you're talking about eight different movements and the recommendation is three different sets with a 8 to 10 repetitions of that particular exercise.

79
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,850
So that's those are the recommendations for minimum physical activity.

80
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:12,370
And as you'll see, most Americans don't achieve this level of flexibility unless you.

81
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,580
Yeah. What is the eight movements? Eight different types of exercises.

82
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,510
So for each movement is 8 to 10 reps?

83
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,930
Yes. Plus $0.03.

84
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:33,490
Yes, I see. Yeah. And you would you would adjust this according to your ability.

85
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:38,740
So if you are somebody who is able bodied,

86
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:43,270
you could you could design a program around that recommendation that would include

87
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,630
a lots of different things that would be done in traditional strength training.

88
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:53,919
If you were somebody who had less capability, if you are older or you had some type of a physical limitation,

89
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:03,400
you could adapt a physical activity program so that everyone could engage at this level of physical activity or strength training.

90
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,140
Do what you can, in other words.

91
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:20,220
So in terms of the level of physical activity that you would need to gain to engage in to improve a variety of health outcomes,

92
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,920
like improve your delivery,

93
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:35,550
your blood pressure, increase insulin sensitivity, improve body composition and so on, that the recommendations are a bit higher.

94
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:47,880
So moderate intensity exercise 150 to 300 minutes per week, meeting again, that moderate intensity level based on that metabolic equivalence.

95
00:11:49,830 --> 00:12:00,600
But the important thing to remember is previous recommendations said, oh, we're only going to count activities that last 10 minutes or more.

96
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:08,580
Well, that's not true. It's any amount of physical activity would be included in this recommendation.

97
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:18,030
So here's an example. What do you count as physical activity? There's four different people who have been monitored with an accelerometer.

98
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:28,380
And this particular diagram, and you have different things within the table within each of these graphs.

99
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,130
And the first thing here is the physical activity level.

100
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,780
This is the total energy expenditure divided by their basal metabolic rate.

101
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,260
So these are people that were closely monitored with an accelerometer and they're looking at their

102
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,740
physical activity and their energy expenditure and cals per minute and during the time of the day.

103
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,970
And the dash line represents that threshold of three metabolic equivalents.

104
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,620
And as you can see in terms of the different levels of physical activity,

105
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:12,440
this person was relatively inactive compared to some of these other individuals.

106
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,180
So here's here's an individual whose physical activity level was exceeded, too.

107
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:23,480
That's again, the total energy expenditure divided by the basal metabolic rate.

108
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:31,620
And as the number of the amount of minutes spent above 3 minutes was about 160.

109
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:46,410
There that the time in minutes in which they had an extended period of time, 10 minutes or more or 3 minutes are listed here for 337 minutes.

110
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:57,540
And there were two discrete bouts of what appears to be this individual engaging in significant physical activity at this higher level.

111
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,200
Okay. So we're counting everything.

112
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,540
Here's an individual with what has a physical activity of 1.9.

113
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,349
And there there entered the amount of time that they spent.

114
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:18,450
And about 3 minutes is more that this other individual and their activity has broken up throughout the day.

115
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:25,350
And you can see that their physical activity peaks throughout the day and it crosses this threshold.

116
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,140
And then you have another example of an individual who has maybe,

117
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:41,759
maybe one out of five exercise somewhere in here where their physical activity adds up to a

118
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,710
physical activity level of 2.8 because they were active throughout that particular time period.

119
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:57,180
So the point of this is that physical activity includes anything that gets your energy expenditure above that three best level,

120
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:04,770
and it's all considered to be important. So those are those are recommendations for adults.

121
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:09,450
What about kids? All our kids, the young children.

122
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:14,450
We're talking about 3 to 5 year olds. They should be active throughout the day.

123
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:24,480
So they should be provided with environments involved in social engagement and opportunities to engage in physical activity.

124
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:30,210
Now, you don't have to tell a child at this age that they need to be physically active, they're going to be physically active,

125
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:38,160
and you need to provide them with opportunities for active play and a lot of different activities.

126
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:47,790
So introducing kids at this young age to different types of activities, supports, different types of social events are just important,

127
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:53,610
really important for not only their physical health, but for their their social interaction, their social development.

128
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:12,010
So for school aged children, 6 to 17 years of age want them to engage into at least 60 minutes per day of moderate or vigorous physical activity.

129
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:20,140
So this could come in the form of organized sports or less organized physical activity events.

130
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,889
And with this age group, you would all also want to include exercise that would include strength training.

131
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,280
And the requirement here is at least three times per week.

132
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:41,290
At this particular age, it's important to build lean tissue, especially muscle, mass and bone.

133
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:48,970
And included in this recommendation is bone strengthening exercises or weight bearing types of activities.

134
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:56,160
Walking would be considered, running would be considered a weight bearing activity, jumping rope.

135
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,860
All of these are examples of bone strengthening activities.

136
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:09,080
So yeah, kneecap. Yeah. I've heard that like, like younger children shouldn't be like weightlifting because I mean, nature stuff.

137
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:21,250
Yeah. So, you know, in terms of structured strength training, in terms of lifting weights, I believe that the threshold is around 13 or 14.

138
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,390
You don't want somebody younger than that age engaging in those types of activities,

139
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:31,600
but they can engage in strength training that doesn't involve lifting heavy weights, push ups.

140
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:40,629
They can do exercise against gravity, engage in all kinds of different muscle or strength building activities without having to lift.

141
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:51,180
Heavy lift. So the guidelines for older adults are very similar.

142
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:56,719
150 minutes per week of this moderate intensity physical activity.

143
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:05,670
And we're talking again about aerobic exercise. And the emphasis is placed on a multi-component type of exercise.

144
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:10,170
So we're talking about not only aerobic, moderate physical activity,

145
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,900
strength training type exercises, but we're talking about balanced type of exercises.

146
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,720
I'll show you an example of this in a minute.

147
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:30,230
And in order to have somebody who is at advanced stage engaged in these types of activities, you need to first assess their ability level,

148
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:41,230
what can they do and make adjustments and start them out slowly such that they can achieve this goal of 150 minutes per week appropriately.

149
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,440
You're not starting them out too fast. You're giving them something that they enjoy.

150
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,970
You're giving them goals that they can sustain over a long period of time.

151
00:18:53,250 --> 00:19:00,330
If somebody has a chronic condition in which they have to limit that activity, let's say they have osteoarthritis.

152
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:01,440
Well,

153
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:14,850
you can make adjustments for that such that they're not engaging activities that can cause pain or further cause problems with a particular movement.

154
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:23,310
So if somebody has knee osteoarthritis, you would probably want to make adjustments for that individual to meet these types of goals.

155
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:32,219
Strengthening the joint is really important in helping somebody maintain a certain quality of life with osteoarthritis,

156
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,940
but you don't want someone to engage in activities as painful.

157
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,360
Yeah. You see some of the older adults in, you know, whatever.

158
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:44,350
Yeah.

159
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:55,240
So that's a, that's an adjustment that can be made if you have issues with weight bearing joints and if you have membership to the fitness center,

160
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,630
you know, costs money. You have to have a certain income to be able to do this.

161
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:08,560
And that's that's an adjustment that you can make. And yeah, that's another example of adapting physical activity to meet somebody needs.

162
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:16,940
So in terms of during pregnancy and postpartum period.

163
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,980
Same same recommendation, 150 minutes of physical activity per week.

164
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:32,010
You should spread this throughout the week. I continue if somebody is engaged in vigorous physical activity,

165
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:37,410
let's say they're a runner or they engage in some other types of activities, let them continue.

166
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:44,849
This is something that they've done throughout their lives and they should be encouraged to continue.

167
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:54,989
And but with under the guidance of a health care professional to make sure that their their progress in terms of

168
00:20:54,990 --> 00:21:02,010
their pregnancy is is on track and that there are no problems associated with that physical activity in this.

169
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:06,660
Notice how weight lifting is mentioned in this recommendation.

170
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:14,430
And during pregnancy, some women are some people who are pregnant are advised not to lift heavy weights.

171
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:22,430
Push. Yes. You don't want to increase interest for thoracic pressure.

172
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:29,959
Okay. So here are some examples. So this this woman here in the corner is engaging in a balance activity.

173
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,930
So she's on a belt, on a Swiss ball, and she's trying to set her weights, extending her arms.

174
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,570
And this would be considered a balanced approach.

175
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:46,970
And then for somebody who has greater balance capacity, they might be able to balance on one foot for a certain period of time.

176
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:52,310
Yoga would be another example of a balanced type of activity that you can engage in.

177
00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:04,520
So that type of exercise can be very effective and approving somebody's balance as they age, which becomes really, really important.

178
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:10,430
When you get older, you lose muscle mass through a process called sarcopenia.

179
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:21,260
And to prevent fat loss of muscle mass, you need to engage and use aerobic exercise and strength training, but exercises that improve your balance.

180
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,870
And that's just one example. Sure. Here's a woman who is exercising.

181
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:31,100
She's running. She's staying hydrated, which is really important during pregnancy.

182
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,940
So this is something that should be monitored during pregnancy.

183
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:44,510
Here is a woman in a wheelchair doing strength training exercises with exercise bands.

184
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:52,310
So that activity, the strength training group that can be done without the use of weights for kids.

185
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,840
Here you have kids jumping rope.

186
00:22:54,020 --> 00:23:00,709
This is an example of a weight bearing exercise that can build bones and not have to tell kids that they should jump around.

187
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:06,260
They're going to jump around all by themselves. But you can structure this activity and make it fun if you have them do it together as a group.

188
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:16,750
And then for people who are more advanced, such as people who are your age, you can incorporate strength training and balance type of training with.

189
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,770
In this example, this is a kettlebell exercise.

190
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:31,969
So in this particular exercise, the goal here is to keep your trunk flat and then to hold the way in one arm and stay balanced.

191
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,380
And it's harder than it looks.

192
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:44,810
And two, if you extend your arm only down to the floor and bring your foot back by holding a relatively light weight, maybe 25 or £30.

193
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,980
This is an example of a balance group that also builds strength.

194
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,850
I'm going to do this. Yeah. Okay. Taylor.

195
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,120
Christina. Great. Yeah. Maria you had a comment or question?

196
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:05,580
Yeah, I had a comment that, um, from my experience with pediatric patients, the vast majority of them are active on their own.

197
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:14,940
But I have come across cases where we have like a child way above the 95th percentile,

198
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:23,040
several standard deviations, where they may not be active at all and the weight does not help.

199
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:31,350
So it's one of those cases where you need to start small again to kind of encourage and build on because their body is not healthy.

200
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:36,900
Okay. So what could you do to encourage that child to engage in more physical activity?

201
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:47,100
So typically I've come across some kiddos that are completely against starting a sport because of bias,

202
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:52,890
because of, you know, being made fun of because they are out of breath, because they don't feel good.

203
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:57,000
Um, so we can start with chores around the house.

204
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:02,790
They can start walking with their parents or older siblings, typically engaging the family.

205
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:07,679
More doctor allows the kid to start doing some activities and then build some

206
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,549
strength and then feel confident and start doing other activities at school.

207
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:14,700
PE And then sports. Right?

208
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:21,900
Right. So they're engaging activities that they can do and and in a safe environment

209
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,020
where they're not going to be teased or picked on because of their body size.

210
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:36,220
So those are some good examples. So how are we doing in regard to the minimum physical activity guidelines?

211
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:46,710
Not so good. This is from that same the physical activity guidelines for Americans publication and came out 2018.

212
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:51,990
So this is the percentage of adults now who met the guidelines.

213
00:25:52,500 --> 00:26:00,520
And so between 2028 and 2016, less than certainly less than 30%.

214
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,690
More like mid-twenties, 26% of men.

215
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:09,330
And in 2016, about 20% of women are meeting these guidelines.

216
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:16,050
So we're way below where we need to be. How about children?

217
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:21,930
Well, we're not doing much better in terms of children meeting these minimum guidelines.

218
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:28,290
So you have boys and girls. And this is the percent meeting, the minimum guidelines again.

219
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:35,920
And we've got about 34, 30% for boys and maybe 12 or 13% for girls.

220
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:45,490
So in general, people in the United States are not meeting the minimum guidelines for physical activity.

221
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,040
So this is where we are. We can do a lot better.

222
00:26:53,750 --> 00:27:01,880
And there are many, many benefits to improving your cardiorespiratory fitness and health.

223
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,670
If you engage in these types of activities.

224
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:17,060
So over the long term, if you follow these recommendations, it can reduce your blood pressure, which can have long lasting benefits if you continue.

225
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:26,940
You can increase glucose disposal and enhance insulin sensitivity and skeletal muscle.

226
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,510
This effect can be short lived.

227
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:43,660
So in terms of somebody who has elevated blood lipids or somebody who has to be overweight or have obesity and who has excess blood lipids.

228
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:52,980
This compromises insulin sensitivity. If you if they engage in physical activity, they can improve insulin sensitivity.

229
00:27:53,250 --> 00:28:03,570
This is a short lived effect. But if you combine exercise and loss of adipose tissue, this can significantly improve these responses.

230
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,560
And I'll have a few slides at the end that kind of covers that in more detail.

231
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:22,750
So as you become more physically fit through aerobic activity, it decreases demands on your heart in terms of oxygen,

232
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:30,520
and the ability of your heart to more becomes more efficient in delivering blood to the tissues.

233
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,640
And tissues can now more efficiently extract oxygen from the blood.

234
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:43,630
And this makes any kind of movement easier to achieve.

235
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:53,960
So we talked a bit about how and a feel and one was one of the factors released by the endothelial cells and the vasculature.

236
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:58,250
And this plays an important role in the dilation.

237
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:02,090
Well, this response improves with exercise.

238
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:15,979
And as you engage in aerobic exercise and physical activity, it is said that it improves your ability to extract oxygen from your blood.

239
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,590
And this occurs in response to a number of things,

240
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:28,100
some of which include an increase in capillary density within the muscle and an increase in the number of mitochondria within that muscle as well.

241
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,480
Short term effects. You'll sleep better if you engage in just 30 minutes a day.

242
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:47,580
And in terms of we talk about how systemic inflammation is a problem for a number of cardiometabolic risk factors,

243
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,870
engaging in physical activity can reduce this.

244
00:29:54,340 --> 00:30:01,750
And the first adipose tissue bed that would respond to physical activity is within the visceral compartment.

245
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:06,160
Remember, this is the short term storage site for excess triglycerides,

246
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:16,840
and this turnover of lipids were occur more rapidly within this particular tissue that are adipose tissue, but then subcutaneous.

247
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,910
And this is associated with improvements in cardiometabolic health.

248
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:29,140
So I already talked about aerobic exercise.

249
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:35,860
What about people who are engaging in lifestyle modification for weight loss and resistance training?

250
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:42,370
So when anybody loses weight, they're going to lose mostly adipose tissue,

251
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:52,450
but they can also lose some lean tissue in the form of skeletal muscle and bone as well to prevent or to reduce the losses that can occur.

252
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:57,880
Strength training is really important here in maintaining the muscle and bone mass.

253
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:05,700
So this is really important in terms of preventing that from occurring.

254
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:10,680
It occurs more rapidly in people at advanced age, even without weight loss.

255
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:18,240
So strength training is really important in maintaining lean mass in the form of skeletal muscle and bone mass throughout your life.

256
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:30,270
So what about some other forms of vigorous exercise that you may have heard about?

257
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:38,600
So high intensity interval training. There's really no standard definition for this form of exercise,

258
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:46,859
which is essentially intermittent bouts of vigorous activity and then a period of rest at low intensity,

259
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:51,990
or you're just catching your breath and then resting and getting ready for the next interval.

260
00:31:53,340 --> 00:32:03,540
This can be very effective in lifestyle modification in terms of reducing body fat percentage and improving health outcomes.

261
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:13,589
And this in a structured format is been shown to achieve these goals improving health outcomes,

262
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:19,830
reducing body fat percentage and structured high intensity interval sessions.

263
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:29,260
However. Unsupervised, high intensity interval training sessions haven't shown as much benefit.

264
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:29,819
In other words,

265
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:37,980
when you compare Type II activities versus the regular endurance activity where you're going for a longer period of time at a lower intensity.

266
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:42,440
There doesn't appear to be the same benefit. Why do you think that is?

267
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,790
Maria, maybe the self-imposed level of difficulty.

268
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:52,730
Yes. These are hard, high intensity interval training is difficult and challenging.

269
00:32:53,180 --> 00:33:00,800
You would not attempt to do this more than two or three times a week, three times max, because, yes, it's very challenging.

270
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:06,080
Need more time to recover and get more muscle soreness associated with this type of activity.

271
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,160
And when you're by yourself, you don't have the same motivation.

272
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:15,140
You don't have a lot of people to compete against or some coach to push you along.

273
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,750
Yes. Christina said he sees me through the unsupervised.

274
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:30,120
Were the subject still getting over six months or they're not quite getting over over over the six months where the

275
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:36,239
supervised and yes they were both you know they were they were getting they were achieving the sixth best threshold.

276
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,660
But it was not as vigorous as in the structured activity for and in terms of I don't

277
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:48,030
remember the details in terms of whether or not there are fewer bouts of kids,

278
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:52,330
but I imagine that there may have been. Yeah.

279
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,220
But does it help with like sports performance?

280
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,560
Yes, absolutely.

281
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:05,370
So if you do want to like improve, let's say like you're running time, you would make it clear that, yes, it can help your health out.

282
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:13,500
Yeah, it would improve it. It can improve your maximal your peak oxygen uptake, certainly.

283
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:21,330
But then again, there are limits. You've got 2 to 3, 2 to 3 sessions a week, no more than three, again, because of recovery.

284
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:31,890
So, yes, they're effective. Yes, they take less time, but they're more difficult and more challenging and require more time for recovery.

285
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:39,480
So here's kind of a summary of the short and long term benefits of physical activity.

286
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:43,019
So there are immediate benefits of a single bout of exercise.

287
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:48,910
You sleep better. It gets your mind off your issues.

288
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:55,540
When you exercise, there's less anxiety and depression associated with your life.

289
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:59,650
You feel better. It improves.

290
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:06,490
It lowers. You can lower your blood pressure immediately once you engage in physical activity.

291
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,790
And then there's the long term benefits. So.

292
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:20,180
In regard to aging. It reduces the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease and and depression.

293
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:25,970
In terms of heart health, there's a lower risk of heart disease and type two diabetes.

294
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:37,850
It has been shown to prevent certain types of cancers of the bladder, breast, colon, endometrium, esophagus, kidney, lung and stomach.

295
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:45,980
It can help you lose a certain amount of fat to reduce your body weight and and prevents weight gain.

296
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:55,400
It strengthens bone and it can enhance your balance and coordination, which become more and more important as you get older.

297
00:35:55,610 --> 00:36:00,980
You lose the capacity to balance yourself in daily activities.

298
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:07,640
So that's structured physical activity or leisure time physical activity.

299
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:17,210
What about the physical activity that you might engage in with everyday life, such as your your occupation?

300
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,309
Well, there's some data from some older studies that were conducted,

301
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:33,040
and this is kind of a review paper that looks at occupational physical activity behaviors.

302
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:40,910
And long term, in this case, in this portion, a of this graph is a long term relative incidence of myocardial infarction.

303
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:49,639
So in this particular graph, you have middle aged men who sit many more hours per week and obtain less physical activity,

304
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,060
had a greater premature cardio myocardial risk.

305
00:36:53,990 --> 00:37:01,520
So this graph refers to drivers and conductors of busses within the United Kingdom.

306
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:09,889
So these individuals were followed throughout their lives and the drivers which had their driving shift and they would

307
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:17,750
pretty much sit the entire time and that the conductors would collect tickets from people who would ride the bus,

308
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:26,270
which meant that in the UK, in London you had double decker busses and they'd have to climb the stairs in order to get the tickets.

309
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:34,129
So they were very active throughout the day. And just by following these individuals through the course of their life,

310
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:40,370
it was found that the conductors had a lower set time and more physical activity and

311
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:46,610
had a relatively lower incidence of myocardial infarction compared to the drivers.

312
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:56,720
What about women? So in this particular graph, we're looking at sit time low, medium and high.

313
00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:07,820
I don't remember the time in which they considered these different time points, but you see the same pattern here with higher time spent sitting.

314
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:18,320
In this case, we're seeing a higher relative risk of cardiovascular disease mortality and fatal myocardial infarction occurring.

315
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,600
And in regard to just non exercise physical activity.

316
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:33,259
And of course see again we're looking at little intermediate or relatively much

317
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:39,620
non exercise physical activity showing you that this this is not leisure time.

318
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:44,090
Physical activity, again, reduces the risk of coronary artery disease.

319
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,590
In this case, it's middle aged men.

320
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:58,270
And then we're looking at a portion of this figure mortality relative to risk of the 70 to 82 year old adults in regard to physical activity

321
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:10,440
level and people who are engaged in the highest level of physical activity here had the lowest relative mortality in the age individual.

322
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:16,480
So maintaining physical activity at the advanced age increases the lifespan.

323
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:28,040
Okay. So the next slide shows you a relative contribution in terms of the energy expenditure from structured

324
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:39,320
leisure time activity and resting metabolic rate and the summary concept of food and non exercise activity.

325
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:47,690
So comparison of exercise physiology and inactivity physiology in relation to energy expenditure.

326
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:55,490
So here's a regular exercise are here. So the black area of the pie chart represents the basal metabolic rate.

327
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:05,600
Then you have the next biggest area which is the non exercise thermogenesis for non exercise energy thermogenesis.

328
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:15,500
So this is the need and it occupies the next largest portion of the energy expenditure if somebody has during a day.

329
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:22,040
That red pie. A piece of the pie chart is exercise, structured exercise.

330
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:28,070
And then the last piece here is the thermic effect of food from the great hatched part.

331
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:37,430
So here's a regular exercise, or here's somebody who is energy deficient and they're not getting this bit of energy expenditure,

332
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,120
reducing their total energy expenditure.

333
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:48,110
But in relation to everything else, it appears that this is a relatively small bit of their daily energy expenditure.

334
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:54,070
Let's look at taking exercise out, structured exercise out of this.

335
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:06,280
So when you do that, you see that this nonet this need accounts for a great deal of the energy expenditure throughout the day.

336
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:18,350
If you have someone in the next diagram here who is not engaging in this type of activity, they're not expending energy.

337
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:22,910
And this would represent what would occur when you're sitting here expending very little energy,

338
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:27,140
a little bit above the resting metabolic rate, but not nearly as much.

339
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:35,810
So this non structured physical activity is really important.

340
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,390
It adds up to a lot.

341
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:48,410
And this last bit of this figure shows you the relation between or the contribution of exercise and need to the total energy expenditure.

342
00:41:49,250 --> 00:42:00,260
So on the Y axis we have weekly activity energy expenditure and on the x axis you have low need, intermediate needs and high need.

343
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:08,060
And then you have somebody who has lots of non structured exercise activity.

344
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:18,020
And then you add in that recommendation of 30 minutes a day, five times a week, and their energy expenditure increases of somebody sedentary.

345
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:22,549
But look at the proportion of energy expenditure from just the exercise.

346
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:34,520
It's a little bit more, but not a whole lot. Let's say you increase to 60 minutes a day, you walk 60 minutes a day, and this gives you a bit more.

347
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:43,000
But in relation to the amount of energy you expend during daily activities, it still represents a minor portion of the total energy expenditure.

348
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:50,690
And finally, you have somebody who's running five miles a day, seven days a week,

349
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:57,740
35 miles, and this gives you a greater increase in total energy expenditure.

350
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:04,730
But the net still occupies quite a bit of their total weekly energy expenditure.

351
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:09,610
And then here you have a comparison where somebody has a higher,

352
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:19,100
very high need and that energy expenditure is very significant in terms of total calories burned from being physically active.

353
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:28,909
So the message here is if there are ways you can engage in physical activity to meet these structured guidelines, great.

354
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:37,240
But the time that you spend not being active is also for not having leisure time structured physical activity, I should say.

355
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:39,860
It's also important and significant as well.

356
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:54,260
So now I'm going to start to talk about lifestyle, lifestyle intervention leading up to the Look Head study.

357
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,180
And this has to do with the importance of combining the two.

358
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:03,650
Exercise and calorie restriction and lifestyle interventions.

359
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:13,040
And again, we're talking about studies, recommendations from studies that were done in people who may have had overweight or who

360
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:20,600
had obesity and perhaps they had diabetes and other types of cardio metabolic issues.

361
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:34,610
The most effective way to achieve this goal of a 7% weight loss to improve cardiometabolic health combines both of these types of activities,

362
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:46,310
physical activity and color disruption. And in particular, the physical activity can't prevent weight gain after achieving a particular goal.

363
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:55,760
And if someone becomes less physically active after achieving that goal, this can lead to significant weight gain.

364
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:04,610
All right. So let's look at a study in which these ideas were put into practice.

365
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:12,350
There was the study done a number of years ago called the Look Ahead clinical trial.

366
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:20,900
And in this study, you had thousands of people all over the details in a minute here who had diabetes,

367
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:25,220
who had an average BMI of I believe it was 30 for both men and women.

368
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:39,310
And they were in this particular study, they wanted to see if this lifestyle intervention could, in terms of cardiovascular mortality,

369
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:49,700
could reduce cardiovascular mortality through this intensive lifestyle intervention aimed at producing and maintaining that 7% weight loss.

370
00:45:51,470 --> 00:46:01,910
So the primary outcome in this intervention was to determine at the incident rate of first post randomization occurrence of a composite outcome,

371
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:07,550
including cardiovascular death, either a myocardial infarction or a stroke,

372
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:14,270
nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke or hospitalization for angina.

373
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:21,500
So this is a primary outcome. And the duration in which that they followed this group was incredible.

374
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:32,959
13 and a half years of follow up. And this was the plan to do follow them up for this period of time and provide this intensive lifestyle

375
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:40,790
support compared with the standard of care at the time of the Diabetes Support and Education Program.

376
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:47,600
So they had these individuals in two different groups, and so that was a primary outcome.

377
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:54,020
The other outcomes that they assessed were all cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, risk factors,

378
00:46:54,290 --> 00:47:02,570
cost and effectiveness of the plans in terms of the health care costs associated with the utilization of health care services,

379
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:14,780
general health, diabetes control, complications, whether or not they required hospitalization and then quality of life and psychological outcomes.

380
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:21,800
So two different groups intensive lifestyle intervention, diabetes support and education.

381
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:31,760
The first group, or I should say the first period of this intervention was six months long.

382
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:37,520
And this is a time where there was lots of contact with the individuals enrolled in this group,

383
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:45,860
and they have three group sessions per month and one individual session with a health care professional.

384
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:53,580
And they set their goal to lose 10% of their body weight with the total study goals.

385
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:58,860
The group of the whole entire group. To achieve a 7% or more weight loss.

386
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:11,490
They did this by combining reducing caloric intake and reducing the amount of fat in their diet through various methods or meal replacements,

387
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:19,440
menu plans, and engaging in physical activity to increase above the level that they were currently achieving.

388
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:26,550
So in this particular study, they added another 25 minutes of physical activity, 175 minutes per week.

389
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:36,300
And they monitored these individuals and most of them engaged in looking at their choice of physical activity,

390
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:41,850
a thousand, 10,000 steps a day, approximately in about five, five miles per day.

391
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:50,370
So the next phase of the study, 7 to 12 months, there was reduced contact.

392
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,950
So there's fewer group sessions.

393
00:48:52,950 --> 00:49:02,460
They're still having that one individual session per month, and they wanted to have at least three sessions per month during this particular phase.

394
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,800
And then they monitored these individuals for their ability to achieve their weight loss goal.

395
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:15,450
If they achieved their weight loss goals, they would they would go into the maintenance phase.

396
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:25,530
If they didn't, they would continue with the the interventions to lose their weight below 10%.

397
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:34,560
And then so there are three after that. After that 12 month period, they had three or four meetings per year to promote retention.

398
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:46,050
They had during these types of meetings, they had education sessions, sessions on diet exercise, and it also provided a form of social support.

399
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,320
So people are moving, are meeting together,

400
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:55,680
they're engaged in the same type of activities and they're supporting one another, which is really important.

401
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,980
So this is the baseline characteristics.

402
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:06,020
So about 60% of the participants were women.

403
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,620
We had about 2500 in each group.

404
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:18,229
There were about 59 years of age of about 15% of them were insulin users.

405
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:26,300
So they had to take insulin as well as possibly two or three other types of drugs to control their blood glucose levels.

406
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:32,560
They had a mean BMI of about 36.

407
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:37,780
They weighed about 100 kilograms. Here's their baseline waist circumference.

408
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:47,350
113, 114 centimeters. And then about 15% of them had a prior cardiovascular event.

409
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:53,170
So this is a high risk group that they're putting into this intervention.

410
00:50:57,070 --> 00:51:02,710
So they had annual clinical visits and looking at weight.

411
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:12,940
They measured their blood pressure. They took blood samples to measure their glucose levels, their hemoglobin, A1 C, their blood lipids.

412
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:27,190
They did some fitness testing on a treadmill at baseline in form of a sub maximal exercise tested them so I one year for.

413
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:35,590
And in terms of the medical care and administration of medications, they didn't control this.

414
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:45,169
So they had. Each individual had a primary care physician who was responsible for their medication and

415
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:50,630
making sure that they were adequately taken care of in regard to their health issues.

416
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:54,410
There were 16 different sites that were used in this study.

417
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,340
So this was a massive intervention.

418
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:12,780
So what happened after four years? So after four years, you can see this is the percent for weight change from baseline percent.

419
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:22,680
So now 8.6% in terms of the whole group, in terms of their change from baseline in regards to their weight status.

420
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,280
And as time went on, they gain some of this weight back.

421
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:38,160
But we have about 5%, close to 5% weight loss each year for it with the intensive lifestyle intervention group shown in red.

422
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:43,650
And then the blue line represents the Diabetes Support Education Group.

423
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:52,510
Their reduction and their total weight is around 1% at this particular time, significantly different here at four years.

424
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:58,050
What happened to their glucose homeostasis?

425
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:07,560
Well, literally there is a relatively large drop in hemoglobin A1 C for the intensive lifestyle intervention group.

426
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:17,940
And as they gain some of that weight back, the present hemoglobin, 20% went up a little bit, quite a bit.

427
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:26,820
But it's still statistically significant from the control group, the Diabetes Support Education Group.

428
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:33,460
When you're looking at measurement, blood pressure here, systolic blood pressure,

429
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:45,370
both groups improved intensive lifestyle intervention group improved more significantly than the Diabetes Support Education Group.

430
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:53,020
We still see a significant difference. And then they looked at other things.

431
00:53:53,020 --> 00:54:02,950
And this particular example here, they're looking at whether or not they needed to have antihypertensive medication.

432
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:11,960
And they are comparing two different groups here where there's no you said baseline and baseline use.

433
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:18,319
So here the years here in this particular column and then you have people in

434
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:24,110
the different intervention groups and here's the baseline in terms of no use.

435
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:38,600
And as time went on, we see some changes occurring in that there are a decrease in the number of people now and that the support group,

436
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:44,000
or I guess I should say that after the first two years or three years,

437
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:51,079
I should say that the no baseline use group had a fewer lower percentage of people

438
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:55,190
who required the use of hypotensive drugs to control their blood pressure.

439
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,400
And then at four years that did not statistically different.

440
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:15,650
And people who had a baseline use in both groups, you see an increase in the individuals who needed to have this hypertensive medications.

441
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:26,690
So you had fewer people now who were requiring more medication who started out with

442
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:31,340
the baseline use for hypertensive medication to control their blood pressure.

443
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:42,010
So in terms of not antihypertensive medication requirement or the intensive lifestyle intervention that

444
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:46,940
did a better job at controlling their blood pressure without medication or a need for medication.

445
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:54,800
The next graph shows you what happens to their HDL cholesterol.

446
00:55:55,580 --> 00:56:06,379
So with an intensive lifestyle intervention group up at one year stay at elevated with the Diabetes Support Education Group,

447
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:12,530
it also increased, but it was significantly lower than what you saw in the intensive lifestyle intensive group.

448
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:19,930
And here's the summary. What happened after four years.

449
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:29,410
So it was the intervention was effective in promoting weight loss and improving fitness through years of follow up.

450
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:39,610
So I didn't show you graphs on their Bobek fitness, which improved significantly in the intensive lifestyle and intervention group.

451
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:48,280
We also had improvements and sustained improvements in glycemic control, systolic blood pressure and HDL cholesterol.

452
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:53,220
And you had other improvements that I didn't show you yet.

453
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:58,740
They produced reductions in urinary incontinence, sleep apnea.

454
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:07,240
So I mentioned earlier when we talked about obstructive sleep apnea, the SLEEPYHEAD study, this was an offshoot of this study.

455
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:13,470
So they're monitoring the sleep apnea events in this cohort as well.

456
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:22,380
So reduction and depression, improvements in quality of life and physical functioning and mobility.

457
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:26,820
So that's a four year follow up. What happened after ten years?

458
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:35,470
So. This is a graph of four different graph showing you what happens to this group after ten years.

459
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:40,360
So we have in the a portion of the graph.

460
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:48,229
Wait, the red line is the in this case it's the control group or the Diabetes Support Education Group.

461
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:49,940
And the blue line is the intervention group.

462
00:57:50,570 --> 00:58:01,270
So they lost a certain percentage, 8.6%, and then they bring some weight back and they're still significantly lower than the control group.

463
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:06,440
In terms of physical fitness there.

464
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:15,290
They also have an improvement in their physical fitness compared to the control group, but noticeably goes down after a year or two.

465
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:26,480
And I'll explain why that is here in a minute. Waist circumference measure of visceral adiposity not really a change in the control group.

466
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:30,800
We see a significant reduction in the intervention group.

467
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:36,560
It goes back up as they gain some weight back, but it's still less than what you see in the control group.

468
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:45,049
And then for Glycated hemoglobin, you see a big difference initially the first year, but after ten years, they're still different.

469
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:58,220
But the people in the intervention there, their glycated human hemoglobin goes up and it goes up to almost a level that they had it at baseline.

470
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:03,919
And so these people are ten years older. They went from they started out at about 58 years of age.

471
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:12,140
Now they're 68 years of age. And during this particular time you see these improvements in Glycated hemoglobin.

472
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:19,759
And in addition to what's shown here, there was less need for that patient to control their diabetes.

473
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:29,690
So there was a significantly lower number of people in the intervention group who required medication to control their glucose.

474
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:36,080
So they were significantly people were dropping off their diabetes medication.

475
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:48,860
So we see this drop in physical fitness and kind of an increase in weight in these individuals after ten years.

476
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:49,670
What happened?

477
00:59:50,850 --> 01:00:02,640
So here's a graph showing you factors that predict successful weight loss with a focus here on what's happening in terms of the initial weight loss.

478
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,200
So this is the entire group.

479
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:18,270
If we split this out into people who achieve less than this 5%, we find out that these are the people who had a tendency to gain some of the weight.

480
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:19,740
A lot of them did.

481
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:32,370
And the ones who who only lost around three or 4% of their body weight, their ability to maintain this weight loss was less reduced.

482
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:42,210
But there were some that were able to, you know, a 15% to 19 or 15% were able to continue losing weight through the first eight years.

483
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:48,800
Compared to the individuals who had a greater success with their weight loss.

484
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:53,030
10% more. Some of them gained their weight back.

485
01:00:53,660 --> 01:01:01,730
Some of them gained some of their weight back. Others were able to maintain this weight loss path.

486
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:12,740
So you had here in terms of 35% people who were able to meet these weight loss goals, the first part.

487
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:19,370
And then 65% difference here being the amount of weight that they lost in one year.

488
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:24,120
10% or more. They're more successful at keeping weight off.

489
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:28,790
Less than 5%. Only 35% were able to keep it.

490
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:34,700
Why? What's that relates back to physical activity.

491
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:47,900
So if we look at physical activity in regard to the percent reduction in their initial weight in people in this intensive lifestyle group,

492
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:57,200
we find that people who were engaged in more physical activity on a weekly basis were the ones who were able to lose more weight.

493
01:01:58,070 --> 01:02:02,010
So this is physical activity, increased physical activity.

494
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:08,600
In the intensive lifestyle intervention, participants sustained weight loss after eight years,

495
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:18,140
and the ones that are engaged in the highest level of physical activity were able to reduce more of their body weight during this particular time.

496
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:26,390
So this is a 9.4 fold greater difference in meeting the weight loss goals compared to people in the lowest quartile.

497
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:32,810
So it was exercise that played a significant role in helping these individuals lose

498
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:37,370
the amount of weight that they were aiming for in this lifestyle intervention.

499
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:46,800
So in your follow up. With an intensive lifestyle intervention to improve glycemic control,

500
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:53,490
a reduction in their need for medication to control their blood glucose and their blood pressure.

501
01:02:54,510 --> 01:03:02,940
There was an improvement in their obstructive sleep apnea symptoms, fewer HIIT events and improved quality of life,

502
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:11,850
reduce a reduction in the incidence and prevalence of depression, and some had a remission of their Type two diabetes.

503
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:20,680
So the immediate again indication for preventing. So here's the summary at 9.6 years and 16.7 years.

504
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:24,819
So at this 9.6 year follow up,

505
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:32,230
they ended the study and they ended the study because they couldn't achieve their primary outcome or they didn't find a difference.

506
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:37,389
And that was the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

507
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:43,720
There was not a different significant difference in the total group in regard to this primary outcome.

508
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:51,970
So this is the reason why they ended the study a little bit early, but there were positive effects of the intervention that I mentioned earlier.

509
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:56,980
So this study is still going on. So they're still collecting data from this group.

510
01:03:58,030 --> 01:04:11,470
And most recently they came up with data from a 16.7 year follow up and compared the intensive lifestyle intervention versus the control group.

511
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:16,900
Still no difference in all cause mortality that the p value here is .11.

512
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:25,770
There was no difference in specific mortality in terms of the primary outcome of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

513
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:32,880
However, for those individuals who were able to achieve that 10% weight loss school,

514
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:40,080
they had a reduced mortality compared to the Diabetes Support Education Group.

515
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:46,860
So perhaps as time goes on, we'll see a greater difference in these groups.

516
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:54,480
Again, they started out with 58, 58. This would probably mean that these individuals are well into their seventies.

517
01:04:54,780 --> 01:05:00,270
As time goes on, we'll see how the intervention affect the longevity.

518
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:09,000
So this is the basis for that recommendation that I showed you from the American Diabetes

519
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:15,390
Association in regard to the management of overweight and obesity and diabetes.

520
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:20,250
This is the basis for that recommendation, I think.

521
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:28,500
All right. So so why is exercise and weight loss combined?

522
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:34,649
Why are they why are they used together? So here is a study.

523
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:37,320
And I got the next three slides from Jeff Horowitz.

524
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:46,260
And in this particular slide, we're looking at the effects of just weight loss only on insulin sensitivity.

525
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:52,830
And in this particular study, we're talking about this this goal, the 7% weight loss goals.

526
01:05:53,430 --> 01:06:02,909
And we're seeing after the weight loss with just the changes in their dietary intake, we're seeing here now an increase in insulin sensitivity.

527
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:10,860
And we're talking about the ability of the muscle now to take up because of the better clearance of glucose less.

528
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:16,170
And when we combine that to weight loss and exercise.

529
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:28,910
We see the same kind of effect. We see greater insulin sensitivity, but we don't get much in terms of an improvement versus just weight loss alone.

530
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:43,490
And if you look at other studies where they compare on subjects who are lean or who have obesity or have high diabetes,

531
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:55,760
and you look at an exercise intervention alone without weight loss, we don't see very much of an increase in insulin sensitivity.

532
01:06:56,090 --> 01:07:03,350
So the yellow bars in this case, we're looking at insulin sensitivity before the intervention.

533
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:09,980
The blue bars represent what happens after training physical activity.

534
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:14,570
Following that, the recommendations, recommendations for physical activity.

535
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:20,330
We see a little bit of a change in terms of insulin sensitivity, but it's not significant.

536
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:27,470
The people with obesity and people who have diabetes. The error bars are overlapping here.

537
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:34,730
And here's another graph that shows you this relationship.

538
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:43,700
Another study we're looking at exercise training without weight loss, often found to have no effect and insulin sensitivity.

539
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:50,090
So in this particular structured trial, we're looking at three months of exercise training program.

540
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:54,370
And they're engaging in vigorous physical activity.

541
01:07:54,670 --> 01:08:02,110
They're engaging in 40 minute sessions where they're achieving oxygen uptake 50% of their maximal oxygen uptake.

542
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:09,070
Six days per week, no weight loss. And there's no difference here in regard to their insulin sensitivity.

543
01:08:12,570 --> 01:08:19,920
Then they add a 10% weight loss in another group where they do the same type of physical activity.

544
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:24,240
That's when we see an improvement in insulin sensitivity.

545
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:30,330
So why does that occur? It has to do with some of the things we've already talked about.

546
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:36,540
We talked about how having excess lipids in your blood can affect insulin sensitivity.

547
01:08:36,930 --> 01:08:47,550
Remember the diagrams I showed you on set of eyes and other types of lipids that are deposited topically in skeletal muscle?

548
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:58,110
Well, with with weight loss, you have a greater capacity to safely store triglycerides into subcutaneous adipose tissue.

549
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:03,180
That lowers the levels of free fatty acids. That happens.

550
01:09:03,690 --> 01:09:09,210
We have less interference with the machinery that affect insulin sensitivity.

551
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:17,700
So this is why you see the combination of the two use for lifestyle interventions,

552
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:25,979
exercise and weight loss, because they've worked very well together in terms of insulin sensitivity.

553
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:34,050
It's that that weight loss that's really important in terms of improving the responses in within the muscle.

554
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:39,330
Yeah. Skinny, doesn't this contradict slide 41, though, that we just looked over?

555
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:44,480
This one. Yeah. Yeah. And we say this one did it.

556
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:50,730
Weight loss and exercise didn't improve insulin sensitivity, but on the other side.

557
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:55,339
So in this one. Okay, we're talking. Oh, I see what you're saying.

558
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:59,240
This one weight loss diet only and then weight loss and exercise training.

559
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:03,890
Yeah. Here we have just exercise training. No, the next one.

560
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:10,600
Ah yeah. The red bar. Wouldn't that, wouldn't that be training in weight loss.

561
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:20,960
Our exercise and we also be the red bar, right? So this is just training, no weight loss, exercise plus weight loss.

562
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:24,180
Right. And wasn't side 41 on the right.

563
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:28,250
Exercise and weight loss. This one is just weight loss only.

564
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:31,820
There's no training only. Right. The one on the right here.

565
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:37,760
Yeah. So these are these are different with a weight loss versus weight loss and exercise training.

566
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:46,570
So it's not different there and then it is different in size for. So there's no comparison preparing with training.

567
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:50,979
And in the other case, you're comparing just weight loss with and without training.

568
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:54,190
And the other case, it's training with and without weight loss.

569
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:59,180
Does that makes it the baseline changes. Yeah. So here's the two.

570
01:10:59,410 --> 01:11:08,170
That's okay because weight loss here's weight loss. With exercise training different there's an improvement in both, right?

571
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:13,910
Yes. And. Here we're looking at just exercise.

572
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:17,810
No difference here. We're looking at just exercise.

573
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:22,430
No difference. When we add the weight loss to the exercise, that's when there's an improvement.

574
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:34,140
Yeah. Okay.

575
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,460
But you see that? Okay.

576
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:49,120
So. We'll get to the question of does intentional weight loss increase the prevalence of eating disorders?

577
01:11:49,570 --> 01:11:54,040
And this is a question that has been around for a very long time.

578
01:11:55,200 --> 01:12:05,130
And if you look at cross-sectional studies, is there a correlation between intentional and intentional caloric restriction and eating disorders?

579
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:16,860
So some of the earlier studies done before 1995 showed that there was these associations between calorie restriction and eating disorders.

580
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:24,900
But these are cross-sectional studies. Remember, we're not talking about longitudinal studies where we have a structured program and you follow

581
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:31,830
people for a designated period of time in which you had an intensive lifestyle intervention.

582
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:38,660
So. What's the relationship direction?

583
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:48,200
Another words. Did the intentional weight loss cause that that intention caused the eating disorder?

584
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:52,580
That's the question to be addressed in these next couple of slides here.

585
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:59,750
In order to answer that question, you need to look at randomized controlled trials.

586
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:07,450
So you need to look at a prospective cohort where people are enrolled in these lifestyle

587
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:13,390
intervention studies and you follow them and you monitor them for eating disorders.

588
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:18,460
The other thing that I'm going to add here is that if you have somebody who has

589
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:23,590
an eating disorder or you expect to suspect that they have an eating disorder,

590
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:31,570
you would probably not put them into a lifestyle intensive lifestyle program because of that.

591
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:38,120
So that that would be a game stopper for those individuals.

592
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:41,390
You would not have them engage in these types of activities. Right.

593
01:13:42,970 --> 01:13:47,530
The people in this trial and the Look Ahead study were screened for eating disorders.

594
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:51,160
We're talking about people who were 58 years old.

595
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:54,610
They had diabetes. They had weighed about 100 kilograms.

596
01:13:55,750 --> 01:14:06,200
They engaged in the study. And we'll look at whether or not that caused a significant increase in eating disorder.

597
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:12,160
So. So you need a perspective study to answer that question to determine whether or

598
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:18,940
not intentional weight loss with appropriate controls causes an eating disorder.

599
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:28,920
So in this particular graph, looking at binge eating behavior and weight loss outcomes in individuals with type two diabetes,

600
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:42,040
this is a four year time point. So you're looking at a subgroup of people in this study who had binge eating behavior during this time period.

601
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:49,930
So at one year, we see a cumulative hazard of 0.04 for both groups, and they're very similar.

602
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:56,230
And as time goes on, there's not a statistical difference here.

603
01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:01,930
But the P value was 0.06 in terms of being cheating behavior in this group.

604
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:10,810
So we're seeing in both groups an increase in binge eating behavior and in these interventions.

605
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:16,370
But there's not a difference within this time period. Statistically significant.

606
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:22,500
What about some other studies that you can do with the calorie study?

607
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:27,840
Could you go over the calorie study? And Dave Burgess, classic, 30 seconds.

608
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:42,060
So in a calorie study. We were looking at whether or not a structured weight loss program resulted in eating disorder symptoms.

609
01:15:42,990 --> 01:15:44,640
So here's the calorie trial.

610
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:52,680
It's a 12 month period of intentional dietary restriction and they want to know if this was associated with an increase in eating disorder symptoms.

611
01:15:54,060 --> 01:16:02,280
So they had 48 overweight adults randomly assigned to four treatment arms over 12 months,

612
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:12,870
a 25% calorie restriction or 12% calorie restriction, and a 12.5% increase in energy expenditure with structured exercise.

613
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:18,330
And then a low calorie diet or a healthy diet, no calorie restriction.

614
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:26,430
So they're following all of these groups prospectively over this time period to see if there's a difference in eating disorder symptoms.

615
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:37,160
Here are the main outcomes. But the primary outcome any symptoms, mood, dietary restraint, body weight and energy balance or the results?

616
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:45,410
So all three dietary restriction arms were associated were associated with an increased energy restraint and negative energy balance,

617
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:51,620
but not associated with eating disorder symptoms or other harmful psychological effects.

618
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:57,230
Participants in the three calorie restriction arms lost significant amounts of body weight,

619
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:03,020
and the psychological and behavioral effects were maintained during a six month follow.

620
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:10,290
So the conclusion based on this particular study was that these results did not support the

621
01:17:10,290 --> 01:17:16,410
hypothesis that calorie restriction causes increased eating disorder symptoms in overweight adults,

622
01:17:16,710 --> 01:17:22,470
and the general calorie restriction had either a benign or beneficial psychological and behavioral effects.

623
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:33,920
So what about some other studies? Here are six other studies where they followed the same type of a model for their respective studies,

624
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:43,430
looking at intentional weight loss and monitoring the participants for eating disorder symptoms caused by a calorie restriction.

625
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:53,389
And each of these different studies were not seeing an increase in eating disorder symptoms.

626
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:58,640
And in some of these groups, they were done in people who have preexisting eating disorder behaviors.

627
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:13,030
Okay. We're at the end of time. So that's that is the basis for the recommendations for weight loss and exercise.

628
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:20,680
We'll look ahead, study and talk previously about the diabetes prevention program.

629
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:25,660
Very effective if you can achieve the goals, but not everybody can.

630
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:31,810
Best case scenario. You have less than 50%.

631
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:36,579
So were talking about the diabetes prevention trial, 38% could achieve that weight loss goal.

632
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:42,250
Even even if they gain some weight back, they have fewer incidents of diabetes.

633
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:49,090
So we're talking about a minority of people who can achieve these goals and have the benefit.

634
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:54,400
So what else can you do? What else can you do for these people?

635
01:18:54,850 --> 01:19:00,040
Diet and exercise. Well, diet exercise is the kind of the foundation of all lifestyle intervention,

636
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:04,540
are all types of interventions for people who are at high risk for metabolic disease.

637
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:14,830
The next thing we're going to talk about is drugs. Pharmacologic treatments for to induce weight loss to improve cardiometabolic health.

638
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:26,560
And there is a recent trial that everybody's been talking about, excited about a new drug and a paper for your reading for next week.

639
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:33,600
Yeah, well, we have a quiz for this weekend as well as next.

640
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:38,500
Yes. So you'll have 13 so you can drop your three lowest and you have ten per year.

641
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:47,710
Okay. Now, will the final be the the sections after the midterm or after the midterm?

642
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:52,810
Yes. Thank you. All right. I will see you next week.
