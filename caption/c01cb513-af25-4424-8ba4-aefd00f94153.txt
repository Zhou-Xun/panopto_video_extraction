1
00:00:02,573 --> 00:00:07,342
No, no. Hey.

2
00:00:07,343 --> 00:00:12,603
Good morning, everybody. Welcome to class. And I am excited today to talk to you about disability.

3
00:00:12,623 --> 00:00:15,682
So this is my passion. This is Michele's passion.

4
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:21,383
And I'm pleased to actually introduce you to Michelle Meade, who is joining us as a guest speaker.

5
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:26,783
We're going to do something a little bit different today. We won't have a formal lecture format for Michelle.

6
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:35,543
I'm going to engage her in dialog. We're going to have a kind of a conversation throughout some some slides, and I'll draw on her expertize.

7
00:00:35,543 --> 00:00:37,853
And that's pretty shared with you as well.

8
00:00:38,393 --> 00:00:46,493
And so Michelle is in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and she's professor there is being here as well.

9
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:49,883
I think as long as I have an understanding. Okay.

10
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:53,633
So just so I can hit some 25. Okay. We're just about the same time.

11
00:00:54,203 --> 00:00:57,233
And you have a background in rehabilitation psychology.

12
00:00:57,893 --> 00:01:03,053
Can you tell us a little bit more about your history, your background, how you got into what you're doing now?

13
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:14,333
I'm trying to think about your background. I was an EMT throughout high school and college.

14
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:19,523
One of the things I saw was people who would go back and look at them again.

15
00:01:19,523 --> 00:01:27,023
And so the idea of what health management was was always important to me.

16
00:01:27,983 --> 00:01:36,863
So what do you mean by health management? And so I said I would do think how people what behaviors people do or don't do

17
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:40,913
that will lead to various health outcomes and then how they deal with that.

18
00:01:41,273 --> 00:01:48,803
And so for people with chronic conditions or impairments, what are the additional challenges and barriers?

19
00:01:48,803 --> 00:01:53,623
And so from you know, I know you've talked with your mom.

20
00:01:53,633 --> 00:02:02,423
My mom had asthma and so it was sitting her, oh, yes, I'll clean the oven if you're not going to help when you do all these sprays.

21
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:07,463
So the parent guilt there or just the knowing people are, you know,

22
00:02:07,553 --> 00:02:16,013
doing things that aren't necessarily healthy for a variety of reasons and then having various friends with disability in college.

23
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:21,833
And so I went into graduate school in psychology.

24
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:26,013
I went clinical to allow me bigger options rather than just research.

25
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,533
And I went health because of the whole idea of that.

26
00:02:29,603 --> 00:02:37,943
What we do and behavior is, what, 80% of our health, you know, how we interact in our environment, what choices we make.

27
00:02:38,843 --> 00:02:49,883
And then from there, I found rehabilitation and which is specifically working with individuals with generally physical disabilities,

28
00:02:49,883 --> 00:03:00,863
but it can be broader than that. And that really because of that, help me better understand my friends and the challenges they dealt with.

29
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:08,483
One of the things I really like about rehab psychology is that in health, like it was always about what the individual did,

30
00:03:08,783 --> 00:03:15,203
the choices, the back pain, the behavior, the you can do more, and the very individual focus with rehab.

31
00:03:15,503 --> 00:03:25,843
It recognizes the environmental factors and the role of the both the people around you and the access to resources, which I didn't see in the others.

32
00:03:25,853 --> 00:03:30,983
And so a big part of being a rehabilitation psychologist is thinking about

33
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:35,963
the impact of structures in the environment and responsibility for advocacy,

34
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:39,173
which fits. And that's super cool. Yeah.

35
00:03:40,193 --> 00:03:46,793
And then Michelle is a big champion for disability education and awareness and practice at the University of Michigan campus.

36
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:52,643
So she developed this. She founded the Center for Disability Health and Wellness at the University of Michigan.

37
00:03:52,643 --> 00:04:00,163
So it's really, you know, really trying to build an awareness of disability on campus in terms of specifically in health care.

38
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:07,403
Right, and trying to get systems to change. And so one of the frustrations is that we do the great research.

39
00:04:07,613 --> 00:04:13,653
I mean, Michigan is full of that plastic researchers and then I see them at the conferences.

40
00:04:14,603 --> 00:04:21,443
But how do we get our clinical practice and what we do to pick up those and integrate them?

41
00:04:21,713 --> 00:04:27,922
And how do we get our systems to change to be more relevant specifically for individuals with

42
00:04:27,923 --> 00:04:33,953
disability that they don't consider that they have a criminal environment is very much addressed.

43
00:04:33,953 --> 00:04:40,043
And by that I mean that how people think about disability, that they don't just think about disability.

44
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:45,323
I do want to talk about Dr. Ghailani. Good Morning America.

45
00:04:45,323 --> 00:04:55,462
His disability is an inability, but it really is thinking that disability means that there are different challenges

46
00:04:55,463 --> 00:05:02,602
and that in order to be able to have the same opportunities and accomplish things,

47
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:06,143
you need to make accommodations. And so how do we think about.

48
00:05:06,493 --> 00:05:14,683
Building a health care system, which helps those end, given that most of our patients have either a temporary or permanent disability.

49
00:05:15,553 --> 00:05:21,673
And so some of it is a shift from the medical model to either a more social model or thinking about,

50
00:05:22,063 --> 00:05:28,423
you know, from a research perspective, the ICF and the Wonder Woman we're going to get into.

51
00:05:29,443 --> 00:05:32,773
Overview. But yes, that's perfect. Yeah. All right.

52
00:05:32,803 --> 00:05:35,893
Thank you. Well, that sets the stage for what we're going to be talking about.

53
00:05:35,893 --> 00:05:41,143
So we today are going to be talking about what I hope to get you'll get out of

54
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:44,863
this is to understand that disability is not a characteristic of a person,

55
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:50,323
but is actually socially created by our physical and social environments.

56
00:05:51,193 --> 00:05:57,703
As Michel mentioned, we're going to be reviewing the ICF, the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health,

57
00:05:57,703 --> 00:06:04,183
which is developed by the World Health Organization as a framework to understand disability as a process.

58
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:13,753
We are also going to be talking in length about aging with disability versus aging into disability and some of the concepts around that.

59
00:06:15,823 --> 00:06:20,802
So what do we mean by disability? So this is a definition coming from the CDC,

60
00:06:20,803 --> 00:06:27,792
which is disability is any condition of the body or mind that makes it more difficult for

61
00:06:27,793 --> 00:06:32,923
the person with the condition to do activities and interact with the world around them.

62
00:06:34,063 --> 00:06:41,893
This is a good starting definition, but I have issues with it which we will elaborate upon as we get through the next couple of slides.

63
00:06:42,853 --> 00:06:52,243
But the key thing to be conscious of here is that it's disability is related to a condition that makes it more difficult.

64
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:57,433
The difficult is the key word here in terms of difficulty doing things because of a condition.

65
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:04,083
So we think about potentially disabling conditions.

66
00:07:04,503 --> 00:07:10,172
They are different categories of conditions that are physical conditions such as multiple sclerosis,

67
00:07:10,173 --> 00:07:16,503
which is what my mum had a spinal cord injury, which is what I primarily work with you primarily from this and.

68
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:28,233
Okay. And spinal bifida I'm not familiar with so much was so before different it's a it's a congenital condition based on the.

69
00:07:28,923 --> 00:07:39,003
Okay now is the specific chemical that which caused the neural tube not completely to glow fully.

70
00:07:39,103 --> 00:07:47,903
Right. Yeah. Um, which is like why, you know, between two and two completely closed.

71
00:07:48,723 --> 00:07:54,793
And so it actually impacts not only physical, but also there's a lot of cognitive impairment, which is quite a bit.

72
00:07:55,533 --> 00:08:03,993
Right. Right. So then those are the physical components. But then, as I said, there's intellectual or conditions such as Down's syndrome or autism,

73
00:08:04,743 --> 00:08:13,743
which are considered to be developmental conditions in terms of the fact that they may shape more milestones of growth and development,

74
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,603
both physically and intellectually.

75
00:08:16,203 --> 00:08:24,183
And then there's also sensory conditions, so not physical movement related disabilities or potentially disabilities,

76
00:08:24,753 --> 00:08:29,853
but things in terms of having low vision, difficulty seeing and having hearing loss.

77
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:36,123
And then there are cognitive disabilities and psychiatric disorders, the serious mental illnesses.

78
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:41,043
Okay. So tell us more about those other two. So cognitive is should also be added to this list.

79
00:08:41,253 --> 00:08:48,332
Right. So cognitive disabilities are where you have impairment with thinking or being able to put that together.

80
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:52,023
That can be acquired something like a traumatic brain injury or a stroke.

81
00:08:53,013 --> 00:09:00,333
And so the way your brain works is different. It can be considered something like autism and ADHD and neurotypical.

82
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:05,223
Is it different from intellectual? It's a lot.

83
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:10,922
Some ideas now referred to in the cognitive rather than the intellectual and

84
00:09:10,923 --> 00:09:16,473
developmental disabilities tend to be more specific to congenital conditions.

85
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:25,022
And so that definitely overlaps between cognitive disabilities indeed, and also physical disabilities,

86
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:37,083
because generally not just one that is going on and then serious mental illness will be things like schizophrenia, like bipolar disorder.

87
00:09:38,373 --> 00:09:49,053
So like severe depression that impact your ability to relate to people and their mental health challenges.

88
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:55,563
And I think, you know, when you think about the disabling conditions and we're going to talk about it more.

89
00:09:56,103 --> 00:10:00,513
One of the the visible ones are often easier for folks to understand.

90
00:10:00,903 --> 00:10:07,683
And so when you think about spinal cord injury, yeah, it's something happened to the spinal cord injury.

91
00:10:07,923 --> 00:10:09,153
The individual can't walk.

92
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:17,583
You probably don't think about well, they may not be able to use it at all and bladder the same way and then they need to use a wheelchair.

93
00:10:18,273 --> 00:10:20,523
People can see that. They can get that.

94
00:10:20,523 --> 00:10:29,493
The folks I work with generally don't have a problem getting disability, getting accommodations, or maybe not getting an accommodation.

95
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:37,802
But for people that say, Oh, you need a ramp or you need where, it's a lot harder for folks to understand pain,

96
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:47,792
it's a lot harder for people to understand that you are not able to control your emotions or that you're seeing or experiencing

97
00:10:47,793 --> 00:10:54,932
things that other people are in or that your brain doesn't work and you can't follow through with problem solving.

98
00:10:54,933 --> 00:11:05,373
And so, you know, the disabling conditions that the visible versus invisible becomes a huge factor in terms of,

99
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:10,593
I think, how people understand it and how they're willing to accommodate.

100
00:11:11,163 --> 00:11:14,873
You know, that's a really great point. Okay.

101
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:18,393
So just a quick overview of population trends in disability.

102
00:11:18,393 --> 00:11:25,442
So about one in four, 25% of American adults have a disability of one form or another.

103
00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:29,313
So this is the largest it the largest minority group.

104
00:11:30,603 --> 00:11:36,273
It's essentially, you know, people are operating with disability in the United States and we don't really think about it.

105
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:42,323
The most common type of disability is a functional disability in terms of mobility, disabilities,

106
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:49,953
or difficulty moving about, difficulty walking, having to use a mobility device such as a wheelchair or a cane or walker.

107
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:55,383
Disability is not distributed equally equitably in society.

108
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:59,253
It's more common in women, individuals with lower socioeconomic status.

109
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:07,203
And racial, ethnic minorities. And importantly for this particular class, disability increases markedly with age.

110
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:14,603
So a third of adults over the age of 65 report some kind of disability, according to the census.

111
00:12:14,613 --> 00:12:19,533
Now, the census now has these questions. In the American Community Survey that ask about disability.

112
00:12:20,103 --> 00:12:25,053
So we're getting much more better much better metrics now and understanding disability in the population.

113
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:29,672
It did not used to be something that was actually measured or it's very difficult to

114
00:12:29,673 --> 00:12:33,903
get information on the population with disability because we don't ask about it.

115
00:12:33,913 --> 00:12:41,432
We just really have not really identified the, you know, measures to include and there is the American Community Survey,

116
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:44,613
which is integrated into some of the public health surveys.

117
00:12:44,613 --> 00:12:52,383
That's the one that is kind of standardized. But the questions become confusing because it's you can't can you climb steps?

118
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:57,333
Well, can you not because you can't walk or because you can't breathe.

119
00:12:58,563 --> 00:13:05,343
You know, if you have asthma, what so can you not balance your checkbook?

120
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:12,483
Because the cognitive issues and the sensory issue and so that the factors that go in

121
00:13:12,483 --> 00:13:17,673
to those functional outcomes make it confusing to track and then make accommodations.

122
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:21,153
We found this very confusing and problematic with children.

123
00:13:21,513 --> 00:13:28,023
And so while groups can look at specific diagnostic populations such as Down's Syndrome,

124
00:13:28,023 --> 00:13:34,743
which they found had 10 to 34 times higher rate of deaths from COVID,

125
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:41,193
that they couldn't look across disability because hospitals don't regularly collect that information.

126
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:51,632
That was a huge problem. And COVID that people with disabilities were actually being hard hit by COVID because they tend to live in congregate

127
00:13:51,633 --> 00:14:00,653
care settings and didn't have the ability to and were much more at risk because of the requirement to actually,

128
00:14:00,663 --> 00:14:08,013
if you need a sometimes need a caregiver to help you in your home. So that's putting you at risk in terms of contact and not being able to isolate.

129
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:12,453
And then higher rates of secondary conditions such as diabetes.

130
00:14:12,873 --> 00:14:17,013
Yeah. People with disability in the pandemic.

131
00:14:18,243 --> 00:14:22,743
You know, we're talking about how they are in a wheelchair having to use their wheelchair all the time.

132
00:14:22,743 --> 00:14:26,312
And they had to, you know, you couldn't keep your hands clean. You it was hard.

133
00:14:26,313 --> 00:14:28,262
It was hard to be able to keep your hands clean,

134
00:14:28,263 --> 00:14:34,983
to be protected in ways that people who don't have disabilities didn't have to actually navigate to the same extent.

135
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:38,403
But as Michelle said, we just didn't have there was not data.

136
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:43,313
No one was collecting data to use public transportation and public transportation, of course,

137
00:14:43,893 --> 00:14:49,862
for non-emergency reasons that when they were afraid to go to the hospital because they

138
00:14:49,863 --> 00:14:55,563
would be afraid of getting their resources for care or something that they had taken away or

139
00:14:55,563 --> 00:15:01,293
that their the attitudinal environment and the biases are such that people and this is have

140
00:15:01,563 --> 00:15:07,773
happened that providers said your life doesn't have the same quality as someone else's,

141
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:13,453
based on my opinion. And so we're going to remove the care.

142
00:15:13,473 --> 00:15:20,403
You know, we're not going to let you have this. And plus, then folks in many places bring in caregivers.

143
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:31,433
And those are the ones who knew that to help them calm down, how to help turn them, how to help interpret what they said.

144
00:15:31,483 --> 00:15:37,473
And so going to the hospital for individuals with disabilities is a very scary thing.

145
00:15:38,193 --> 00:15:41,943
Right. And so the pandemic just markedly made that clear.

146
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:46,943
So they were there. That was a big issue. There still is, I think, a culture of death.

147
00:15:48,243 --> 00:15:54,452
So just in general, in terms of the fact that we've talked about how we've got this cohort of baby boomers coming through and as they age,

148
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:58,383
the proportion of older adults in the U.S. is going to be much greater.

149
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:04,773
And, you know, that has implications for understanding disability, because 20% of older adults have vision problems,

150
00:16:05,223 --> 00:16:09,213
a third have mobility limitations, and a third have hearing impairment.

151
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:14,373
So disability will become a more important issue as we see the aging of the population.

152
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:21,213
And it's interesting, though, because older adults don't necessarily consider themselves disabled.

153
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,993
They just expect, I'm older, I can't do that.

154
00:16:24,993 --> 00:16:28,023
And that's a natural consequence thing.

155
00:16:28,143 --> 00:16:35,132
And therefore, they don't think about either what protections they have under the Americans with Disabilities Rights Act

156
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:41,763
or the Fair Housing Act or other type of regulations that they don't identify and think about community.

157
00:16:42,573 --> 00:16:51,483
They don't ask for an accommodation, and they become embarrassed because they can't hear about their impairments rather than,

158
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:57,423
you know, what we find is that younger individuals with a disability are more likely to connect.

159
00:16:57,663 --> 00:17:04,053
They're more likely. You know, figure out how do I live with this and how do I live well with this?

160
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:11,882
Where whether in hearing impairment or spinal cord injury, I get an older adult in as well.

161
00:17:11,883 --> 00:17:19,833
At least I live my life. And so a much different type of approach and expectation on society.

162
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:31,263
Any questions at this point? Lexi, when you said like when they say like, well, at least I live my life,

163
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:40,413
is that like the attitude if they have that injury when they're older or is that the attitude even if they get the injury?

164
00:17:40,763 --> 00:17:46,553
You know, that's the attitude when you hear like for spinal cord injury,

165
00:17:46,553 --> 00:17:56,903
you actually have at least traumatic spinal cord injury at this point to like the one is always young males, you know,

166
00:17:56,903 --> 00:18:07,523
who as a result behavior 110 on a motorcycle like makes sense drinking and driving driving off a bridge

167
00:18:08,183 --> 00:18:17,633
you know there is behaviors increased risk of spinal cord injury those individuals you know it's and then

168
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:26,153
there's cars that which everyone but unsafe driving is more likely when you're young but the older adults

169
00:18:26,153 --> 00:18:35,573
then are getting a spinal cord injury and after having spinal stenosis and after that becoming more frail.

170
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:43,103
And so they get incomplete. They're they may fall off their porch or they may drop and they can get a spinal cord injury.

171
00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:52,093
Or what you hear with the older group is they look at the the ten year old with the spinal cord injury,

172
00:18:52,143 --> 00:18:55,913
the 21, and they're like, well, at least I live my life.

173
00:18:55,913 --> 00:19:06,943
I was able to do X, Y or Z. And there may be some regret that, well, I was waiting till after I retired to go on vacations to do X or Y,

174
00:19:06,953 --> 00:19:14,903
but I had the opportunity to do, you know, to get married, to have kids, because they the the once again,

175
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:19,403
they're also falling into this mindset that if you're have a disability,

176
00:19:19,403 --> 00:19:30,743
that you can't that you can't live a normal life where folks who become injured younger just adjust, especially.

177
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:34,253
I mean, a lot of it depends on how much support you have in your environment.

178
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:39,593
What is your attitude with the family? What is your school system? Are you integrated back into normal classes?

179
00:19:39,893 --> 00:19:44,213
Are people saying, Yeah, you got to still do the test? Yep, I'm still expecting that from you.

180
00:19:44,263 --> 00:19:46,643
Yup. We're going to that this class.

181
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:55,343
Of course you're going to go on that field trip and know that it's you know, there's more sense of, yeah, I deserve to be part of this.

182
00:19:56,633 --> 00:20:03,743
And people are and they can from all levels of ability, you know,

183
00:20:03,743 --> 00:20:12,503
from from who are so ability to folks with ventilator dependent quadriplegia and what they need to get there

184
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:20,533
may be different but the expectation is that they should be able to get that they should be employed,

185
00:20:20,603 --> 00:20:24,833
that there should be systems set up versus I think the older group is like,

186
00:20:25,163 --> 00:20:30,293
I don't want to ask too much or I can't really expect much of other people.

187
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:36,713
So I think that speaks also to what we've been talking about, about older adults being kind of pushed to the margins in society.

188
00:20:37,013 --> 00:20:39,473
But I do think that the baby boomers coming through,

189
00:20:39,923 --> 00:20:44,363
they might expect different things from society if they get a spinal cord injury at the age of 65.

190
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:49,043
I mean, they might say, all right, I'm going to need accommodations to continue to go golfing.

191
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:56,783
And it's really interesting, though, because some of that is better than privilege and a sense of individualism,

192
00:20:57,263 --> 00:21:03,863
you know, of what am I supposed to do and pick myself up by my bootstraps to do and to accomplish?

193
00:21:04,193 --> 00:21:15,293
And what should people in society do for me, or what should society do to allow me and people like me to be part of it?

194
00:21:16,493 --> 00:21:21,833
And there is know definite differences there with regard to.

195
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:31,373
No, I would never say no. I would never you know, I would ask this, but not in this in terms of the expectations related to accommodation.

196
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:40,933
So we're going to talk a little bit more about this idea of aging with disability versus aging into disability.

197
00:21:41,923 --> 00:21:46,423
This is a somewhat a bifurcation that may be artificial or may be useful.

198
00:21:47,293 --> 00:21:51,553
This is driven and this is something that's come to the attention of policymakers more recently,

199
00:21:51,553 --> 00:21:56,713
because there is increasingly a growing number of people who have had a disability early in life,

200
00:21:56,773 --> 00:22:02,143
who are now living longer than ever and being able to live into later life and become old.

201
00:22:02,953 --> 00:22:06,073
This is a new phenomenon, relatively speaking.

202
00:22:06,943 --> 00:22:11,083
This is something that area agencies on aging, for example, have been concerned about,

203
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:18,493
that they're not prepared to address that the needs of older adults who are actually being living with disability for a very long time,

204
00:22:18,823 --> 00:22:24,042
and how that might be distinct from the needs of people who are aging into disability,

205
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:28,153
like becoming disabled later in life and arthritis or other conditions.

206
00:22:28,183 --> 00:22:32,143
And if I can just add, the health care system isn't able to deal with it either.

207
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:40,153
And so, for example, palsy, which is one of the most common physical disabilities or disabling conditions,

208
00:22:40,153 --> 00:22:47,263
which is, you know, specifically diagnosed based on impairments under the age of five from birth trauma or from.

209
00:22:47,493 --> 00:22:56,072
Other events. That was very much people who didn't die or live in the nursing home.

210
00:22:56,073 --> 00:23:06,543
And so there is just beginning to be studies and research around aging was trained on policy and these individuals cannot find adult doctors.

211
00:23:06,663 --> 00:23:13,622
Cardiologists do not know how to take care of them or the field surgeons do not know how to deal with them that they

212
00:23:13,623 --> 00:23:23,163
are and many still are staying with pediatric rehab or pediatricians because they have no training and no health care.

213
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:33,003
There's a limited number of health care providers who are prepared to deal with these childhood conditions.

214
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:38,402
Now, I want to just I know, C.J., you had some questions in the perusal document,

215
00:23:38,403 --> 00:23:43,033
which are really good about, you know, if a physician is trained in cardiology, what is it?

216
00:23:43,113 --> 00:23:47,193
Why can't they not treat someone with cerebral palsy who has a cardiology problem?

217
00:23:47,823 --> 00:23:49,083
They should be able to,

218
00:23:49,173 --> 00:24:01,243
but they often there's often a misattribution of all problems to the diagnosis of history by palsy or spinal cord injury or such.

219
00:24:01,263 --> 00:24:07,713
There may be a lack of understanding about, so what are the actual abilities there?

220
00:24:08,103 --> 00:24:18,573
And for most conditions, there's a huge range of, you know, functional ability that the individual has and then what is the history?

221
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:24,843
But a lot of times it is the the mindset and the idea that this person is very complex.

222
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:30,693
They're going to take a long time. I'm not going to be able to build for it and then more likely than public insurance.

223
00:24:30,963 --> 00:24:35,612
And so it's not worth my while either to find out. I don't feel capable.

224
00:24:35,613 --> 00:24:41,373
I don't feel confident. They're not going to understand anyway. They are not in charge of their own health.

225
00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:46,473
They probably live in a nursing home. Folks with disabilities can't live independently.

226
00:24:47,373 --> 00:24:55,403
And so there's I think my perspective is that a lot of the unwillingness or a

227
00:24:55,413 --> 00:25:04,142
perceived lack of empathy for providers in doing this is an additional one,

228
00:25:04,143 --> 00:25:08,612
although there may be some specific when you think about something like spinal cord injury.

229
00:25:08,613 --> 00:25:15,783
In fact, we found disparities are differences in your residents with regard to the knowledge about how to treat,

230
00:25:16,263 --> 00:25:21,843
you know, one of the key things that leads well from spinal cord injury into the air.

231
00:25:22,413 --> 00:25:29,013
They get hospitalized skin issues uitenhage urinary tract are the two primary and pulmonary.

232
00:25:29,643 --> 00:25:35,853
But one of the big things is autonomic infrastructure and so you have part of it.

233
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:44,213
So there is what that is. So their blood pressure goes through the roof and so they can start out, you know,

234
00:25:44,313 --> 00:25:51,323
but basically because of the firm pain or there's something going on in their body that has to be addressed.

235
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:53,492
And this can be there's a wrinkle in their genes.

236
00:25:53,493 --> 00:25:58,893
It could be that they broke their arm three days ago and they're not aware of it because they can't feel that part of the body.

237
00:25:59,163 --> 00:26:07,322
It could be that their bladder is to fall. And so there's, you know, basic guidelines in terms of how to deal with it.

238
00:26:07,323 --> 00:26:17,583
And so there is a condition, specific type of information and training, which is important to have to be able to provide appropriate type of things.

239
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:20,943
And so if you are thinking cardiology and you think about, okay, what type of tests,

240
00:26:21,363 --> 00:26:25,172
you then have to do the extra level about, okay, what is that likely to cause?

241
00:26:25,173 --> 00:26:34,413
Can they actually do these behaviors or such? And so there's added layers of complexity that comes with the care,

242
00:26:35,043 --> 00:26:45,803
with both maintaining health and then managing chronic conditions as well as impairment in how much disability?

243
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:55,553
Okay, sorry, make me a name when we get into that into the medical education that we get.

244
00:26:55,773 --> 00:27:04,563
All right. I know it's a great question, but I think we're just beginning to track it.

245
00:27:04,563 --> 00:27:09,362
We're just beginning to make inroads in terms of getting disability into the medical curriculum.

246
00:27:09,363 --> 00:27:18,213
There may be a day or two. There's so much that put in there and that that folks have to know.

247
00:27:19,293 --> 00:27:24,543
And then the complexity. And so there has been work arounds for years.

248
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:34,973
Let's that's to a special special certificate program with working with folks with developmental disabilities are doing that we're trying but

249
00:27:34,983 --> 00:27:45,783
it's once again as a marginalized population of this is not that different or people don't really have to know or there's a lot of biases.

250
00:27:45,993 --> 00:27:49,613
You know, it's not. Once again,

251
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:59,122
simply the high paying type of service in some conditions I think are so rare that there's

252
00:27:59,123 --> 00:28:05,243
not like I have several people that I know in my life with disabilities in general.

253
00:28:05,723 --> 00:28:14,753
And so, for example, one has had a million. So she went to the emergency room a while back and they, you know, it is like cardiologists and stuff.

254
00:28:15,143 --> 00:28:20,932
And she had diabetes and there are like so many co-morbidities that I think that they

255
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:25,283
did try to use their training to address the situation the best that they could.

256
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:29,153
But like she has so many different things going on that, you know,

257
00:28:29,153 --> 00:28:36,443
it's as theoretical it is for someone trained in one specialty to address all the different interactions that are going on there.

258
00:28:36,563 --> 00:28:41,483
And our health care system is becoming more and more separate and people don't have time to talk.

259
00:28:41,593 --> 00:28:49,393
Yeah, yeah, there are unknown there because, like, I just I have a really different perspective.

260
00:28:49,393 --> 00:28:54,353
Okay. I feel like at least like at, um, because we're like a tertiary care center.

261
00:28:54,743 --> 00:29:04,612
We get, we have, we have a disproportionate amount like exposure to rare diseases because we just see more than you would like so far,

262
00:29:04,613 --> 00:29:12,143
like in the U.S. or something that you were conditioned to. Um, and I think we do get training, I mean, we do learn about all this stuff.

263
00:29:12,143 --> 00:29:18,503
And I find most of my training in disability has come from seeing people in the context of like other specialties.

264
00:29:18,503 --> 00:29:26,703
So I've seen downs, patients been through in my profession, you know, I like seeing CP patients, um,

265
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:35,423
cerebral palsy patients like on a liver service and so like, I guess, and then how do they deal with them?

266
00:29:36,323 --> 00:29:39,413
I mean, as a liver patient as, you know, be patient.

267
00:29:39,503 --> 00:29:46,072
And some of that's okay. Some of that's not because you know I've had my fellow for did you come in

268
00:29:46,073 --> 00:29:50,513
and they never consult their final billing doctor who is in the same system,

269
00:29:50,753 --> 00:29:58,163
who provided the many different conditions. And that may be one thing, but then they may not also listen to the patient.

270
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:07,733
And so one of the pieces here is how do we recognize people's expertize in managing their own health,

271
00:30:08,363 --> 00:30:15,803
in what they've learned about the condition and working with multiple specialists and integrate that into what's going on?

272
00:30:15,803 --> 00:30:19,913
Or do we start and do the same test all over again? Or do we?

273
00:30:20,303 --> 00:30:25,672
You know, when I think about my spinal cord in patients of any service, it's like,

274
00:30:25,673 --> 00:30:28,883
okay, do they have someone in there who's going to go in every 2 hours?

275
00:30:29,483 --> 00:30:32,423
Yeah. All right. Yeah, I know who's doing their power management.

276
00:30:32,693 --> 00:30:40,853
I guess, like if you're not consulting their, like, primary provider who has, like, expense in spinal injury, like, that's just that's just bad care.

277
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:46,403
But I think that like but I think that the majority of medical students would agree with that.

278
00:30:46,403 --> 00:30:52,583
And I think that, like as an air physician, like, I knows I only know so much, but like there's a big help.

279
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:59,272
Like I consult, like if I have like a spinal cord patient, I'm going to consult neurology in addition to treating them as best as I can.

280
00:30:59,273 --> 00:31:03,413
And I would and I would be providing them poor care if I were to like reach out and have that said.

281
00:31:03,413 --> 00:31:09,113
Exactly. That's kind of how. But do we think that we have to reach out?

282
00:31:09,263 --> 00:31:14,693
One of the things that has come up is, for example,

283
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:20,903
many individuals with disabilities are never checked for sexually transmitted disease because of obstructing the sexual.

284
00:31:21,293 --> 00:31:31,733
And so the biases and where people come in, you know, what they what the physician brings to the table, you know, influences their assessment.

285
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:39,952
And I well, I really hope and I'm really glad to hear that this is the that things are changing and that

286
00:31:39,953 --> 00:31:44,863
people are talking and that there are different things that this is telling them about.

287
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:52,342
And, you know, we if we can't do it here at the University of Michigan, they're definitely not going to do it and other places.

288
00:31:52,343 --> 00:32:00,173
So that we really do have to develop the best we can, best develop what we think needs to happen.

289
00:32:01,343 --> 00:32:05,603
And C.J. is going to go and do this change. And I think it's going to be great.

290
00:32:06,623 --> 00:32:08,303
But we have to think as well. Like what?

291
00:32:08,383 --> 00:32:14,513
What kind of disability education are we getting in public health as Amy, you're taking a course on disability.

292
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:24,593
So in epidemiology, there's not a chorus on disability. I sprinkle disability into my classes whenever I can.

293
00:32:25,523 --> 00:32:33,503
But if we think that we're sending a whole workforce out there, we're with a growing number of people who are aging with disabilities and a number of,

294
00:32:33,653 --> 00:32:36,743
you know, growing number of older adults who are going to have disabilities.

295
00:32:37,043 --> 00:32:42,413
And we do not give them any disability specific training. That's absolutely terrible.

296
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:50,933
Currently, only half of the US public health schools offer courses with any disability content in terms in addition.

297
00:32:51,023 --> 00:32:54,592
So Nash and I have always talked about trying to develop a disability,

298
00:32:54,593 --> 00:33:02,033
an epidemiology of disability course in the University of Michigan so that something that hopefully will be coming.

299
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:07,222
But there really needs to be, you know, an educational component to this, just as there is in medical schools.

300
00:33:07,223 --> 00:33:11,573
But public health is far behind that. In addition,

301
00:33:13,073 --> 00:33:20,543
students with disabilities are very are common in actually the University of Michigan has one of the largest number of students with disabilities.

302
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:27,382
And this is a data that's coming from the services for students with disabilities.

303
00:33:27,383 --> 00:33:32,753
And about 12% of graduate students at the University of Michigan have a disability.

304
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:36,833
So it's a large population in our you know, in our students.

305
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:44,543
But we also don't really address it in terms of education, but also accommodations and understanding visible and invisible disabilities.

306
00:33:44,693 --> 00:33:48,263
The other piece here is that there are still people afraid to say anything.

307
00:33:48,803 --> 00:33:58,253
You know, I think there's an increasing recognition of the importance of individualized education plans in elementary and secondary schools.

308
00:33:58,513 --> 00:34:02,723
There's the sense of sometimes people go to college and they don't want to bring those.

309
00:34:02,723 --> 00:34:10,943
They don't want to leave that identity. They don't want to admit. And so they don't have the pieces in place that they need to do their best.

310
00:34:12,023 --> 00:34:18,083
And some of that is because of the attitude that we have to be competitive, that we have to be the best possible.

311
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:21,803
Some of the biases of the people around you.

312
00:34:22,613 --> 00:34:31,463
I know you know, one of the I am one of my roles is as the chair of the Disability Resource Group for Michigan Medicine.

313
00:34:31,823 --> 00:34:37,123
And while we have 12% of students with disability, we have 3% of faculty who.

314
00:34:37,483 --> 00:34:45,703
Having a disability and not that we think that she asked for a rate, but because it is not okay,

315
00:34:45,823 --> 00:34:52,602
but because of how they are going to be seen about the opportunities provided for them within the

316
00:34:52,603 --> 00:34:58,813
setting because of the lack of accommodations and the lack of just understanding about what this means.

317
00:34:59,653 --> 00:35:00,193
Exactly.

318
00:35:00,203 --> 00:35:08,833
So this is a study done by advanced University of Michigan of all graduate student experiences with disability accommodations came out in May 2020.

319
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:12,433
I put the actual report and the resources for this week's reading.

320
00:35:12,773 --> 00:35:16,873
Exactly what you're saying, Michelle. It's like the idea that better come here.

321
00:35:16,873 --> 00:35:21,883
I don't want I don't think people I don't think faculty actually want to accommodate me.

322
00:35:21,883 --> 00:35:26,993
I don't they've got some attitudes, but they also think, you know, come on, you got to come here.

323
00:35:26,993 --> 00:35:31,753
And grad school should be hard. So don't expect it to be don't don't ask for any help.

324
00:35:31,753 --> 00:35:38,323
Don't ask for accommodations. So that's definitely, you know, prevalent in terms of the experience of students with disabilities.

325
00:35:43,383 --> 00:35:46,743
Okay. We're going to get into some technical details just about how we might actually measure

326
00:35:46,743 --> 00:35:50,613
disability from understanding disability from a population health perspective.

327
00:35:51,753 --> 00:35:52,723
So, you know,

328
00:35:52,803 --> 00:36:02,313
many of the national surveys collect data on disability by asking questions about difficulty with things like movement and activities of daily living,

329
00:36:02,313 --> 00:36:07,892
which are either these self-care activities like bathing and dressing or instrumental activities of daily living,

330
00:36:07,893 --> 00:36:15,693
which are more complex activities like managing your finances, going grocery shopping, preparing a meal at home.

331
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:18,713
So we'll talk a little bit about how these things are measured.

332
00:36:18,723 --> 00:36:23,223
So I'm going to pull on two different surveys that we've used here to understand aging.

333
00:36:23,253 --> 00:36:31,592
The first is the health and retirement study. And so the interviewer on the phone or in person with the respondent asks this question We need to

334
00:36:31,593 --> 00:36:37,263
understand difficulties people may have with various activities because of a health or physical problem.

335
00:36:37,623 --> 00:36:40,293
Again, this is very similar to the CDC definition.

336
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:45,963
Please tell me whether you have any difficulty doing each of the everyday activities that I read to you.

337
00:36:47,013 --> 00:36:50,373
So this is the next question because of a health problem.

338
00:36:50,703 --> 00:36:54,213
Do you have any difficulty with walking several blocks?

339
00:36:55,543 --> 00:37:01,873
The answers are yes or no. These are the the numbers of people that respond on these different categories.

340
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:07,873
You can see most people say, no, I don't have any difficulty. About 6000 say yes.

341
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:15,343
About 200 say I can't do that. In about 180 say I don't do that.

342
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:20,243
I don't go off walking several blocks. And 90 people say, I just I don't know if I have.

343
00:37:20,713 --> 00:37:27,583
So if you were to create a measure of disability from this respondents who has a disability and who does not.

344
00:37:29,683 --> 00:37:36,703
So presumably people who say, yes, I had difficulty walking would say, okay, they probably have a mobility disability.

345
00:37:37,483 --> 00:37:40,513
I can't do that. People can't walk several blocks.

346
00:37:41,613 --> 00:37:48,373
And maybe that's because they have a disability, or maybe it's because they don't have a sidewalk outside their front door.

347
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:54,633
Well, and that's a health problem. But once again, it's the interaction between those.

348
00:37:55,063 --> 00:38:03,163
And so, yes, I could go if I had a sidewalk outside my front door in which I would be afraid of falling.

349
00:38:04,273 --> 00:38:08,863
Right. And do you identify yourself as having a health problem to be able to respond to this?

350
00:38:08,863 --> 00:38:15,193
And, you know, there's a certain amount of cognitive processing has to go on here for people that don't do this.

351
00:38:15,283 --> 00:38:18,883
I don't go for a walk in several blocks. Is that a disability?

352
00:38:18,943 --> 00:38:22,813
Is that difficulty or is that just because they don't they just don't do that?

353
00:38:22,953 --> 00:38:26,653
They they take the bus everywhere. They drive everywhere.

354
00:38:27,493 --> 00:38:29,443
People that don't know me,

355
00:38:29,503 --> 00:38:36,073
that's a group that we should assign is being having trouble with mobility because they don't even know if they can do that.

356
00:38:36,413 --> 00:38:43,153
But but that's very confusing. So if you're trying to work with these data and create a measure of disability based on difficulty,

357
00:38:43,843 --> 00:38:49,123
you have to start making some choices about how you would want to pass this out.

358
00:38:49,873 --> 00:38:58,303
Lisa I feel so this question very similar to the paper that we were talking about last week about the physical limitations in the challenges,

359
00:38:59,413 --> 00:39:02,473
and they add one score to their life.

360
00:39:03,273 --> 00:39:11,433
Limitations of the law. If they have, yes. But now it brings in other limitations because I don't know there are other options there.

361
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,763
Exactly. Confusing. Yeah, no. Great point.

362
00:39:18,003 --> 00:39:21,063
What about this one? This is a question is it's because of a health problem.

363
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:26,883
Do you have any difficulty with pulling or pushing large objects, objects like a living room chair?

364
00:39:28,803 --> 00:39:34,563
So what if you are someone who, you know, is not sort of most people say no for people say, I can't do that.

365
00:39:35,263 --> 00:39:38,343
I don't know. People say that I don't push my living room chair around that much.

366
00:39:40,173 --> 00:39:44,913
I don't know. It raises all sorts of questions.

367
00:39:44,913 --> 00:39:49,713
And should you be able to do that? Should you be able to push your living room chair around?

368
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:53,733
What is that picking up? Doesn't depend on what your living room chairs.

369
00:39:57,333 --> 00:40:02,643
I mean, then that you think about how the gender correspond with that kind of thing.

370
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:10,923
Exactly. All right. This question is about the self-care activities of daily living because of a health problem.

371
00:40:10,933 --> 00:40:13,323
Do you have any difficulty with bathing or showering?

372
00:40:13,803 --> 00:40:20,493
I want to say that people who have difficulty with bathing, that is the most important predictor of nursing home admission.

373
00:40:21,153 --> 00:40:25,913
So once you get to the point, you can't actually bathe yourself. It means that you are actually, you know,

374
00:40:26,073 --> 00:40:29,672
needing care to the point that you will need to be in an institution that's being

375
00:40:29,673 --> 00:40:34,053
in some of the the data that's been shown where you have to have a caregiver,

376
00:40:34,323 --> 00:40:44,583
24 hour caregiver, a regular, reliable caregiver at home, be that a spouse, a child or someone who's paid.

377
00:40:45,903 --> 00:40:51,272
Right. Exactly. And not everybody. And that's very difficult to get. So what do we see in terms of resources?

378
00:40:51,273 --> 00:40:57,063
This is a smaller subset because not everybody is asked this question. If you say, you know, difficulty walking, you know, other things,

379
00:40:57,063 --> 00:41:01,323
they don't ask you if you have difficulty bathing because it's assumption that you can do that, too.

380
00:41:02,823 --> 00:41:07,833
Most people don't have any difficulty with it. Some say, well, yes, I have difficulty.

381
00:41:08,973 --> 00:41:12,723
55 people say, I can't do that. I can't be myself. So you would assume.

382
00:41:13,353 --> 00:41:18,603
Yes, that's difficulty. That's extreme difficulty. A lot of people say, I don't do that.

383
00:41:18,603 --> 00:41:27,393
I don't I don't bathe. Would you what would you would you put that in as also difficulty?

384
00:41:29,413 --> 00:41:40,382
Or nine people say, I don't know. What would you say? In my work.

385
00:41:40,383 --> 00:41:46,053
When I use this, I think if someone says I don't do that, I don't bathe, it means that they can't.

386
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:50,193
So I put them in the unable to do.

387
00:41:50,913 --> 00:41:55,683
And then someone says, I don't know if I can bathe. I also put them in there saying they have difficulty.

388
00:41:57,093 --> 00:42:00,723
But I don't do that. Questions about mobility, for example.

389
00:42:01,863 --> 00:42:08,253
So you have to be like it's you have to be just explaining clear about how you're coating these responses.

390
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:16,783
Because they don't do that because they don't want to admit that they are not able to do that anymore.

391
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:20,403
Right. That's what I'm thinking. Yeah.

392
00:42:21,633 --> 00:42:25,573
Pretend to be strong. Yeah.

393
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:30,322
Or just being afraid of falling and able to get into the bathtub anymore.

394
00:42:30,323 --> 00:42:33,893
Because you'd rather not do that.

395
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:41,782
Yeah. Right. And so the bathing and showering is, as you said, they could be secondary to just.

396
00:42:41,783 --> 00:42:50,453
I can't read your bathroom. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing, cause because when they designed this questionnaire, they have the option of yes.

397
00:42:50,753 --> 00:42:55,223
And they also have the option of can do. Now, what does this tend to me?

398
00:42:55,283 --> 00:42:59,743
Maybe it means that I am not accessible to all this source.

399
00:42:59,753 --> 00:43:07,563
I cannot find a place to invest or take a shower or I don't have a living like in your own house.

400
00:43:07,883 --> 00:43:11,353
I don't have much here in my life, you know, maybe I just assume that.

401
00:43:11,403 --> 00:43:18,143
Yeah. Do you think it's like are they are we missing people, though?

402
00:43:18,443 --> 00:43:22,703
You said if you say you can walk, but you don't even get this question.

403
00:43:23,303 --> 00:43:27,133
You can walk several blocks. Yeah, it's a good it's a good point.

404
00:43:27,143 --> 00:43:33,833
Right. You know, because there are both upper and lower body issues and a lot of these questions don't so much assess.

405
00:43:34,253 --> 00:43:39,413
Well, the more in depth why they do the upper, they include more upper body.

406
00:43:39,443 --> 00:43:43,223
Can I hold anything? Can I dress myself? Can I do buttons?

407
00:43:43,223 --> 00:43:48,172
Can I, you know, do I have problems with my arms, hands or shoulders versus the other, you know,

408
00:43:48,173 --> 00:43:54,983
a lot of them in the lower body or use different parts of the body or different sequencing events.

409
00:43:55,553 --> 00:44:02,063
Right. So you're right, you know, being skipped out just because you say I can walk several blocks, no problem, you may still have trouble meeting.

410
00:44:06,153 --> 00:44:11,163
And what about this one? Do you have any difficulty preparing a hot meal because of a health problem?

411
00:44:12,663 --> 00:44:17,643
Most people say no. Some say yes and they say, I can't do that.

412
00:44:17,853 --> 00:44:21,153
Preparing a hot meal. I don't do that.

413
00:44:23,073 --> 00:44:27,663
I don't like hot food. My mom's adaptogen.

414
00:44:27,693 --> 00:44:31,673
She can't control herself. So she's not preparing any hot meals.

415
00:44:31,683 --> 00:44:37,323
Right. Or if you just, you know, a division of labor in your house and your husband makes all the meals.

416
00:44:37,473 --> 00:44:40,563
I don't do that. I don't. I don't. I don't know.

417
00:44:43,203 --> 00:44:49,083
We're going to get into this a little bit more later. But, you know, how much complexity is there into preparing a hot meal?

418
00:44:49,203 --> 00:44:57,693
There's a lot of complexity if you are trying to cut things up, cook things, deal with hot stoves, pots and pans.

419
00:44:58,383 --> 00:45:03,753
What if you're just putting something in the microwave, a frozen dish in the microwave and heating it up and it gets hot?

420
00:45:04,893 --> 00:45:09,122
And so that's where we can think about accommodations like things older people

421
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:13,233
who are having trouble making meals can still prepare a hot meal at home.

422
00:45:13,413 --> 00:45:17,013
They have a microwave oven and can access frozen meals.

423
00:45:17,493 --> 00:45:24,333
But it also is the issue of interpretation. And the cutting of that is going to mean different things to different people.

424
00:45:24,843 --> 00:45:30,433
Absolutely. Exactly. Great point. Okay.

425
00:45:30,643 --> 00:45:34,423
The last one is shopping for groceries, which is the same issue. I don't do that.

426
00:45:34,693 --> 00:45:38,863
I know other people doing it for me potentially, or I can't do it.

427
00:45:39,913 --> 00:45:44,173
I want to contrast this with another study that's collecting data on disability.

428
00:45:44,383 --> 00:45:46,782
The National Health and Aging Trends Study, which we've talked about,

429
00:45:46,783 --> 00:45:52,423
which is sort of it's a survey of people who are on Medicare beneficiaries, those aged 65 and older.

430
00:45:53,323 --> 00:45:59,843
This is an annual survey. So each year of every two years, this one started in 2011, but people are followed every year.

431
00:45:59,863 --> 00:46:06,613
So you get a little bit more data points. The way they go about asking about disability is entirely different,

432
00:46:07,093 --> 00:46:14,653
partly because Freedman was the one who developed these questions and she is an expert in disability and what then sort of the dynamics of it.

433
00:46:15,223 --> 00:46:19,903
So they start off, for example, about this question about grocery shopping is wrong.

434
00:46:19,993 --> 00:46:24,883
Ask you about shopping for groceries. What how is your shopping done?

435
00:46:25,003 --> 00:46:28,003
How do you do your shopping? That's the first question.

436
00:46:28,153 --> 00:46:31,783
How not can you do it? How much difficulty do you do it?

437
00:46:32,353 --> 00:46:38,653
You know, do you do it by yourself? Does someone else always do it for you so that you get that figured out right from the start?

438
00:46:39,073 --> 00:46:43,123
And then what's the reason that someone else does your shopping?

439
00:46:43,693 --> 00:46:47,143
Is it because of your health problem or some other reason?

440
00:46:47,143 --> 00:46:51,823
Like, you know, someone else wanted to do it? I pay someone else when that's figured out.

441
00:46:52,663 --> 00:46:58,483
Then people who have say it's because of a health problem that I do not do my grocery shopping.

442
00:46:59,443 --> 00:47:06,043
Then they're asked how much difficulty to have shopping for groceries or personal items by yourself in the last month.

443
00:47:07,693 --> 00:47:11,323
And you'll see that it's not a yes or no answer. It's a gradient.

444
00:47:11,323 --> 00:47:14,053
So people can say none of those a lot.

445
00:47:14,533 --> 00:47:22,213
And then the survey goes on to ask a whole lot of questions about how people use different assistive devices to,

446
00:47:22,633 --> 00:47:25,923
you know, get to get around inside the store.

447
00:47:25,933 --> 00:47:28,783
Do they use one of those grocery carts that's automated?

448
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:36,703
Do they have someone helping them in the store so that they can build a whole picture of the complexity about whether someone says,

449
00:47:37,273 --> 00:47:47,383
I don't have any difficulty, even though they might be having to use a wheelchair or they are blind or other factors that they can use accommodations.

450
00:47:47,383 --> 00:47:55,663
If they have help, if they have someone to drive them to the grocery store, they can still say, no, I don't have any difficulty.

451
00:47:56,653 --> 00:47:59,643
So the complexities of that is captured better in this survey.

452
00:47:59,653 --> 00:48:05,953
It makes analyzing it far more complicated because you do have to kind of correct this complexity in the measures.

453
00:48:08,503 --> 00:48:13,183
But I do think it's it's important. Okay. I'm going to skip a little bit further ahead.

454
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:14,653
We've talked about this before,

455
00:48:14,653 --> 00:48:23,052
and I've struggled with some of the the social determinants of health and the inequities by disability in terms of educational attainment.

456
00:48:23,053 --> 00:48:29,353
So people who have a disability earlier in life compared to people who age without disability,

457
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:35,023
much less likely to go on to college than people without disability.

458
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:45,223
They are at much lower employment rates over adulthood across their working life compared to people who don't have disabilities.

459
00:48:46,663 --> 00:48:52,453
And when jobs are scarce through periods of unemployment like the recession that happened in the early eighties,

460
00:48:52,873 --> 00:48:58,783
people with disability are for are the ones who are more likely to be unemployed when jobs are scarce,

461
00:48:59,053 --> 00:49:03,043
the people with disability don't don't have them. They're also more likely to be single.

462
00:49:03,883 --> 00:49:08,893
And they're less that's right. They're less likely to be married. So they have fewer supports.

463
00:49:08,893 --> 00:49:10,422
And as a result of this,

464
00:49:10,423 --> 00:49:18,943
there's this divergence that happens in annual household income across the life course here by people with and without disability.

465
00:49:19,933 --> 00:49:23,473
This is some of the reason why people have argued that there should be a dichotomy

466
00:49:23,473 --> 00:49:27,403
in thinking about aging with disability and aging without disability or aging into

467
00:49:27,403 --> 00:49:31,782
disability is that the life experiences of people who are living have lived a much

468
00:49:31,783 --> 00:49:36,523
longer time when disability shape their risks and increased risk for health outcomes.

469
00:49:37,693 --> 00:49:41,653
And this is what we see in sort of mid-to-late life in these two different groups.

470
00:49:41,653 --> 00:49:47,493
Aging with disability and aging without the people with disabilities have had them for a long period of time.

471
00:49:47,893 --> 00:49:54,373
If they reach mid-to-late life, they're more likely to have heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, psychiatric problems.

472
00:49:54,823 --> 00:50:01,573
So they have this sort of comorbidity burden. And so they're both higher levels and they occur earlier in life.

473
00:50:02,743 --> 00:50:13,033
And so what you find is even with disabilities that are considered static or that are considered like spinal cord injury, get injured.

474
00:50:13,393 --> 00:50:20,773
But the the decline in functioning happens a lot sooner than someone without.

475
00:50:22,213 --> 00:50:25,932
So even once they get back to whatever level they were in the half.

476
00:50:25,933 --> 00:50:35,403
So that and that's what we've been finding when we look across disability groups, when we look at if we look at severe disabilities,

477
00:50:35,413 --> 00:50:45,373
when we look at physical disabilities and that you have individuals with who are getting older when they're living with the conditions,

478
00:50:45,823 --> 00:50:49,722
experiencing them at higher rates and earlier onset.

479
00:50:49,723 --> 00:50:52,953
And this goes across. Yeah. Great point.

480
00:50:58,193 --> 00:51:03,323
Okay. So the A.D. is actually one of the most comprehensive pieces of civil rights legislation that actually

481
00:51:03,323 --> 00:51:07,493
guarantees people with disabilities should have the same opportunities to access health care,

482
00:51:07,853 --> 00:51:15,443
rehabilitation, support, education and employment. Whether that's actually playing out or not is debatable,

483
00:51:15,443 --> 00:51:21,383
but the work that we have done shows that we're not for the lower income and their lower employment rates.

484
00:51:21,713 --> 00:51:27,773
Americans aging with disability would in fact be in the same have the same health as those without disability.

485
00:51:28,943 --> 00:51:38,543
So what do I even say is a better definition of disability? This is my take is disability is not is not a condition that's due to the person,

486
00:51:38,873 --> 00:51:45,413
but it's a condition of the physical and social environment that makes it more difficult for the person to do certain activities.

487
00:51:46,013 --> 00:51:50,003
So it's really the way we structure our opportunities, the way we structure our society.

488
00:51:50,003 --> 00:51:56,543
But the built environment, the health care environment, the social environment, opportunities for education, access to employment.

489
00:51:57,263 --> 00:52:02,583
And so I think this is actually one of the best definitions of disability, which is from a sociologist side.

490
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:11,153
Nagi From 1965, disability is in fact the expression, a physical or mental limitation in a social context.

491
00:52:12,743 --> 00:52:18,352
And one of the ways to think about this and to understand the dynamics and the expression of a physical or

492
00:52:18,353 --> 00:52:23,933
mental limitation in a social context is the international classification of functioning disability and health.

493
00:52:24,563 --> 00:52:28,723
So it's called ICF for Short, developed by the World Health Organization.

494
00:52:28,733 --> 00:52:32,092
It's a framework. It's not perfect, it's a framework.

495
00:52:32,093 --> 00:52:39,443
It's not a model. It's just an idea to wrap your head around different elements and it's used across the world.

496
00:52:40,403 --> 00:52:47,543
So that's the system of this. The framework says because of the health condition or disease or disorder,

497
00:52:47,903 --> 00:52:53,843
there are there are implications at the level of the body in terms of impairments and structures,

498
00:52:54,473 --> 00:52:59,452
at the level of in terms of activities that the person can do and at the level

499
00:52:59,453 --> 00:53:06,203
of society in terms of participation in social life and restrictions in that.

500
00:53:06,713 --> 00:53:17,963
So, for example, somebody with arthritis could then have pain and weakness in their legs, which can cause them to have trouble walking several blocks,

501
00:53:18,323 --> 00:53:25,133
which limits their ability to engage with their friends and interact with their social network.

502
00:53:26,063 --> 00:53:32,203
That's the kind of sequence that this does. We talked a little bit about spinal cord injury.

503
00:53:32,213 --> 00:53:35,153
I'm going to talk a little bit more about hearing impairment here.

504
00:53:35,453 --> 00:53:45,863
So hearing impairment is a very common relatively common impairment and affects about one in three adults between the ages of 65 and 74.

505
00:53:46,913 --> 00:53:52,133
We'll talk more about this next week when we have our lecture on sensory impairments.

506
00:53:52,673 --> 00:53:54,303
But if we think about what this process,

507
00:53:54,323 --> 00:54:02,123
how the framework can be used to understand this so a health condition may or may not have caused an impairment in hearing,

508
00:54:03,023 --> 00:54:08,603
which could have implications for activities such as.

509
00:54:10,733 --> 00:54:19,463
What's an activity of the hearing impaired to have? I thought, well, the social isolation and so connecting, spending time with friends,

510
00:54:20,513 --> 00:54:33,383
they often say that the folks with visual impairments get disconnected from things where folks with hearing impairment get disconnected from people.

511
00:54:34,073 --> 00:54:38,692
So that's where I think it kind of bypasses this middle section, the middle thing,

512
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:46,043
so that the consequences of hearing impairment are really manifested in terms of social activities and social participation.

513
00:54:47,063 --> 00:54:54,433
Lisa I was just thinking. He's not dead.

514
00:54:55,853 --> 00:55:02,373
Think you will be less likely to want to talk to other people because you are afraid that you,

515
00:55:02,723 --> 00:55:07,953
when they talk back, you will not be able to hear clearly and we ask others to repeat.

516
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,413
And then would you and not be.

517
00:55:10,443 --> 00:55:18,713
So I think that's the worries and and so that you just reduce the frequency of their speaking and then that kind of like social isolation.

518
00:55:19,403 --> 00:55:23,783
Yeah. That's very it's interesting. Not sure that you want to add anything.

519
00:55:26,753 --> 00:55:31,943
I mean, I'm thinking about like the heart condition, the.

520
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:40,293
Sometimes it is like that is just like a physiological.

521
00:55:44,683 --> 00:55:52,003
Conditions. It's not like a health condition.

522
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:59,793
There are genetic factors. There are the increased vulnerability or that just comes with deafness.

523
00:56:01,123 --> 00:56:05,533
Right. So this part is is not necessarily required.

524
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:13,843
Okay. But you know how all the health retirements, regressions or enhance is because of a health problem?

525
00:56:13,933 --> 00:56:18,433
Yeah. So it's a question of disentangling health from function.

526
00:56:22,233 --> 00:56:29,493
And then but the most important part about the ICF is that it's got this attention to environmental factors and personal

527
00:56:29,493 --> 00:56:37,293
factors so that this process of impairments leading to a disability to participation restrictions can be modified,

528
00:56:37,593 --> 00:56:43,713
can be changed by environmental factors, which are things such as products and technology,

529
00:56:43,923 --> 00:56:50,163
such as hearing aids, wheelchairs, social supports, caregivers and relationships,

530
00:56:50,823 --> 00:56:55,533
attitudes and stereotypes that could be negative but could be also supportive and positive,

531
00:56:56,133 --> 00:57:03,903
as well as larger services and policies and then natural and human made environments than individual personal factors or things like adaptation.

532
00:57:03,903 --> 00:57:07,542
Doing something differently that I have done many,

533
00:57:07,543 --> 00:57:13,773
many times in my life and having to adapt and do it differently because of an ongoing activity limitation or impairment.

534
00:57:14,463 --> 00:57:20,253
So this is what makes it really, really useful and we'll go through some of the examples with respect to hearing.

535
00:57:20,763 --> 00:57:23,613
So we talked a little bit about this is that, you know,

536
00:57:23,613 --> 00:57:30,003
people with a hearing impairment may continue to be fully engaged and participate in society and experience

537
00:57:30,003 --> 00:57:38,163
no restrictions in participation if they have things like hearing aids and if their implant implants,

538
00:57:38,583 --> 00:57:47,733
if they go to a movie and then at the theater and it has closed captioning, if there is some kind of other system in place,

539
00:57:48,123 --> 00:57:54,543
if there is learned ASL and they have a sign language interpreter, if they, you know,

540
00:57:55,393 --> 00:58:00,693
depending on the age, you know, if they've developed their skills of their delivery.

541
00:58:02,073 --> 00:58:08,853
So if there's card interpretation and if they if there is and usually if they call and ask for it.

542
00:58:09,303 --> 00:58:13,803
And so this is, I think, some of the overlap with personal factors.

543
00:58:14,283 --> 00:58:25,503
Does the individual not only have the confidence to they have the cognitive ability to do that, to plan ahead, to ask someone for an accommodation.

544
00:58:26,973 --> 00:58:33,873
Yeah, that's all dynamically related. So it shows that that's kind of the dynamism in this process of disability.

545
00:58:35,433 --> 00:58:40,633
Okay. I want to just bring your attention to the model that adaptation that Michelle did.

546
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:45,363
So we've got the ICF piece here with the personal factors and environmental factors,

547
00:58:45,663 --> 00:58:49,653
but then she draws specifically attention to access to health care.

548
00:58:50,373 --> 00:58:53,672
So what drew you to made this modification to the ICF?

549
00:58:53,673 --> 00:58:59,883
And so it's really that the interaction because it's not a one size fits all,

550
00:58:59,883 --> 00:59:09,813
someone with a physical disability with many different types of environmental factors and accommodations, someone with different health literacy,

551
00:59:10,083 --> 00:59:18,452
you know, is going to have different types of needs in terms of in terms of information to manage

552
00:59:18,453 --> 00:59:24,423
their health and then thinking about other models of what really influences health care.

553
00:59:24,753 --> 00:59:32,852
And so it was trying to put all the pieces together in terms of thinking about quality of care and thinking about health care disparities,

554
00:59:32,853 --> 00:59:43,233
experience, you know, integrating models of from the IOM and health care disparities for individuals from racially marginalized populations and

555
00:59:43,563 --> 00:59:51,643
their lack of access to health care because they have to think about that or because the hours of what's going on there,

556
00:59:51,663 --> 00:59:57,512
because the language is in Spanish and this is what's putting the pieces together and

557
00:59:57,513 --> 01:00:04,863
thinking about really how our responsibility as a health care system has to change.

558
01:00:04,863 --> 01:00:13,473
Because if we can do that, we can improve the functioning and participation of individuals with these various types of impairments.

559
01:00:14,073 --> 01:00:26,253
But if we don't and and one of the biggest things is that we have sorry, the health care system has the capacity to do this things proactively.

560
01:00:26,733 --> 01:00:31,802
If we can't keep asking individuals to keep making the change to the five busses,

561
01:00:31,803 --> 01:00:38,763
to wait 3 hours in the rain for the right bus to come along, that has that is accessible.

562
01:00:39,123 --> 01:00:42,423
We have to create the systems that allow people in the door.

563
01:00:43,563 --> 01:00:50,073
And that is one of the key things that will make a difference in terms of addressing health care disparities.

564
01:00:50,073 --> 01:00:59,073
We can't keep speaking to someone in English if they speak Spanish and not if we expect them to get information that can influence that.

565
01:00:59,073 --> 01:01:09,003
How we need to do stuff differently. I think that was one of the key pieces here that our responsibility as health care systems, as public health.

566
01:01:12,173 --> 01:01:18,563
Well, thank you, Michelle. I think we're about time. Anyone have any less questions for Michelle?

567
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:30,212
I have some resources for you that I've made available for you that you can dig in to learn more about the Center for Disability,

568
01:01:30,213 --> 01:01:34,383
Health and Wellness and some other resources. But I think this has been tremendous.

569
01:01:34,383 --> 01:01:38,583
Thank you so much for joining us. We really appreciate their engagement with us.

570
01:01:39,033 --> 01:01:49,263
For those who may be interested, the Center for Disability Health and Wellness has monthly meetings on the third Monday at 9:00.

571
01:01:49,353 --> 01:01:52,623
We have a disability commission in October.

572
01:01:52,623 --> 01:01:57,513
We generally do an MLK Day symposium on that day.

573
01:01:58,293 --> 01:02:04,172
We have open office hours. I think those are the second Thursday at ten, which especially, you know,

574
01:02:04,173 --> 01:02:10,293
a lot of we're getting more students and student groups just want the opportunity to brainstorm and to talk,

575
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:15,993
to talk about projects, to receive information and support. And then, you know, we're hiring for various positions.

576
01:02:15,993 --> 01:02:17,672
I was just telling you about that.

577
01:02:17,673 --> 01:02:25,173
I'm looking for graduate students to help me with writing papers and they need to have health care disparities and some management.

578
01:02:26,193 --> 01:02:29,373
And then we also have other different things.

579
01:02:29,373 --> 01:02:32,733
So please keep us in mind a lot of different opportunities.

580
01:02:32,733 --> 01:02:35,853
So, yeah, absolutely. All right. Thanks, Michel.

581
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,852
All right. We'll take a short break.

582
01:02:39,853 --> 01:02:45,453
Coming up break and then we'll hear from Josh and we'll talk about more about aging with disability.

583
01:02:45,813 --> 01:02:49,163
All right. We have.

584
01:02:56,633 --> 01:03:01,323
But what. What are the key issues being?

585
01:03:01,433 --> 01:03:12,333
Guess. In the meantime, take care.

586
01:03:12,453 --> 01:03:28,553
All right. Great. Thank you. You're going to want to download this.

587
01:03:32,853 --> 01:03:40,663
I probably need to switch gears here for you. Okay.

588
01:06:25,813 --> 01:06:38,943
I can understand speaker well. Oh, right.

589
01:06:46,063 --> 01:06:51,503
Think this is a little.

590
01:06:57,533 --> 01:07:01,663
Thank you for reminding me of this.

591
01:07:01,703 --> 01:07:06,283
And. You can't lose this October.

592
01:07:11,313 --> 01:07:16,203
This use is going very quickly. Whatever is.

593
01:07:19,803 --> 01:07:27,243
Well, high school or something for someone who was so slow at their college and to our schools.

594
01:07:27,393 --> 01:07:33,443
And it's just like. I can use my friends from high school.

595
01:07:37,163 --> 01:07:40,523
Lessons for the other day. And it was 20 years.

596
01:07:42,323 --> 01:07:55,943
Between. And then when you get to be like 50 and you realize, you know, 50 years goes by, really just speeds up.

597
01:07:57,483 --> 01:08:03,233
Enjoy every moment. Yeah.

598
01:08:03,233 --> 01:08:08,153
It's funny accessory. So, like, it's November soon and. But I do.

599
01:08:08,153 --> 01:08:17,153
I feel like students at this time of year get to be really, really, you know, really worn down and just kind of, you know, they're.

600
01:08:21,713 --> 01:08:25,823
Nice break. Coming up soon. And Thanksgiving and then.

601
01:08:38,883 --> 01:08:52,843
That. Yeah. I would love to be in over in July.

602
01:08:59,733 --> 01:09:15,953
And you have. This. Oh, my goodness.

603
01:09:31,303 --> 01:09:41,883
James. And I read the study before, you never get a quality side.

604
01:09:42,093 --> 01:09:45,403
So to me, that is pretty good.

605
01:09:54,803 --> 01:09:59,173
I know some people who have their best quality qualities.

606
01:09:59,243 --> 01:10:06,563
So I feel, I mean, take longer. That's absolutely true.

607
01:10:06,923 --> 01:10:13,743
Yeah. Yeah. I had a student sound graduate and she didn't call it.

608
01:10:13,783 --> 01:10:17,883
It was 24, 33. Then the pandemic hit.

609
01:10:17,883 --> 01:10:23,383
So she wasn't able to do what she had proposed. So she ended up just talking to people.

610
01:10:24,843 --> 01:10:28,323
To gather data so that works are managed.

611
01:10:29,223 --> 01:10:33,393
But it does take quite a bit of time to do the complete analysis.

612
01:10:35,203 --> 01:10:43,523
I'm confused with the sample size dimension here because I have the pictures and I feel like it's a big sample for me.

613
01:10:44,993 --> 01:10:56,233
Yeah. Know it's a very different expectation for a sample. The. Researchers are just going so much deeper with each person who's.

614
01:11:01,443 --> 01:11:08,723
So the the the belief in qualitative research is it's not the number of people that you interview.

615
01:11:08,733 --> 01:11:13,743
It's actually whether you interview and interview people until you start.

616
01:11:14,483 --> 01:11:23,503
More so that depending on how long that takes me, typically, I know.

617
01:11:23,513 --> 01:11:28,603
I know Jessica Finley, her work. She does. Eight years ago.

618
01:11:28,903 --> 01:11:34,533
Hundreds. But some of the smaller groups of like 20 to 40.

619
01:11:36,383 --> 01:11:39,542
Really? You're after more. It's not about the number.

620
01:11:39,543 --> 01:11:45,453
It's you're after the knowledge and the richness of this detail when you stop hearing things that remove.

621
01:11:45,933 --> 01:11:56,403
That's why it's called like a theoretical situation. From the simple science unproven to justify.

622
01:11:58,293 --> 01:12:03,803
Representative for China. So you're not after generalizability?

623
01:12:04,163 --> 01:12:09,442
It's not it's a completely different perspective that you're not trying to generalize.

624
01:12:09,443 --> 01:12:14,783
You're just trying to understand in depth. So it's it's just it's a different paradigm.

625
01:12:17,183 --> 01:12:24,923
And then the real challenge and the real benefit is when you can bring those two quantitative and qualitative methods together to inform.

626
01:12:27,313 --> 01:12:35,173
So the mixed methods where you can take your quality of research, the in-depth things you're getting and say, Oh, I want to understand that.

627
01:12:35,353 --> 01:12:38,743
That's the question I want to understand, or that's what the relationships are.

628
01:12:39,043 --> 01:12:46,183
Let me go and investigate those in a large national study and see, you know, how that actually plays itself.

629
01:12:47,073 --> 01:12:52,592
In 485, or you can take quantitative results.

630
01:12:52,593 --> 01:12:57,303
You're getting in a large survey and then do in depth and say use that.

631
01:12:57,573 --> 01:13:04,052
The findings from your quantitative survey to conduct a qualitative study to say, why did we find this?

632
01:13:04,053 --> 01:13:08,463
What are the reasons why? We saw an association between loneliness and dementia?

633
01:13:10,933 --> 01:13:14,623
Yeah. It's a great. It's very, very rich. Um, it is.

634
01:13:15,883 --> 01:13:21,703
It's not something that, again, though, I think we're taught very well here in public health in terms of expanding.

635
01:13:23,773 --> 01:13:27,883
But anyway, after that, sorry to delay the passenger with you.

636
01:13:27,883 --> 01:13:33,253
And thank you so much for speaking about this very important picture by Ivan Walton.

637
01:13:35,113 --> 01:13:42,673
I'm presenting this paper which focused on growing older individuals with a physical disability in their early adulthood.

638
01:13:43,093 --> 01:13:47,653
Now they propose a new, most successful agent paradigm for these individuals.

639
01:13:49,183 --> 01:13:55,303
And as we have now, that there are differences between aging or disability into disability.

640
01:13:55,663 --> 01:13:58,903
But I want to describe a little bit more here.

641
01:13:59,893 --> 01:14:07,113
Aging to Disability focuses on individuals who have acquired their physical disabilities in their early adulthood.

642
01:14:08,113 --> 01:14:14,893
It's often like their age 40. This population is growing with unique health care.

643
01:14:15,223 --> 01:14:22,003
For example, around 30 to 30% individuals with spinal cord injury are aged over 65.

644
01:14:22,003 --> 01:14:22,333
Now,

645
01:14:22,603 --> 01:14:32,653
because of the demographic transition to aging and the advancement of medical health care that improves survivorship for these individuals by listing

646
01:14:32,653 --> 01:14:38,292
day of acquiring physical disability acquired in early adulthood has been

647
01:14:38,293 --> 01:14:43,273
associated with early onset of multiple chronic disease and premature deaths.

648
01:14:43,513 --> 01:14:49,243
So this population has unique health care, has unique health care needs,

649
01:14:50,083 --> 01:14:55,512
and this population that would be more likely to be poor because the unemployment

650
01:14:55,513 --> 01:15:00,813
rate is high for this population and they were more likely to be unmarried,

651
01:15:01,513 --> 01:15:11,503
decide not to have children because some of them may be afraid to impose psychological burden or caring burden to later a couple to their spouse.

652
01:15:11,503 --> 01:15:18,973
And some of them may even be afraid to pass some genetic variant to their next generations so they decide not to have the children.

653
01:15:21,133 --> 01:15:26,712
However, existing studies of our success for aging models are generally excluded.

654
01:15:26,713 --> 01:15:35,613
Individuals who are aging with disability and more focus on aging individuals who are aging to disability, which means they seem to,

655
01:15:35,893 --> 01:15:44,173
which represents a population who did not have physical disability in their early adulthood but develop the physical disability in later life.

656
01:15:44,683 --> 01:15:53,623
And for this population, success for aging generally means delay or prevention of disability or multiple, multiple chronic disease.

657
01:15:53,923 --> 01:15:54,793
L-A one two.

658
01:15:54,793 --> 01:16:02,893
For this population, only one to maintain independence in their daily activities and maintain a high level physical and cognitive function.

659
01:16:03,193 --> 01:16:07,932
But these concepts are meaningless for individuals who are aging with disability

660
01:16:07,933 --> 01:16:12,943
because they already develop or acquire physical disability or early adulthood.

661
01:16:13,273 --> 01:16:20,683
And these concepts are somewhat under debate because it represents everything, has a sense of Apple ism,

662
01:16:20,893 --> 01:16:26,112
which means they put individuals with a physical disability or result chronic

663
01:16:26,113 --> 01:16:30,183
disease in the higher place compared to those with physical disabilities.

664
01:16:30,823 --> 01:16:40,543
And so far there is a lack of study that focus on success for aging paradigm among individuals who are aging with disabilities.

665
01:16:40,843 --> 01:16:51,343
So this study and to examine the concept of successful aging from the perspective of people who had lived with visual impairment for decades.

666
01:16:53,383 --> 01:17:05,293
This study includes 39 individuals with an average with a read with age from 4845 to 80 and the mean age of 62.

667
01:17:05,713 --> 01:17:13,122
This individuals were self-reported a diagnosis of this following any of these following disease

668
01:17:13,123 --> 01:17:18,963
and they generally have lived with these physical disabilities for an average of 21 years.

669
01:17:19,873 --> 01:17:25,633
They were recruited from urban and rural areas, from 13 states in the United States.

670
01:17:25,873 --> 01:17:31,393
And this study is carried over five years. From 2009 to 2014.

671
01:17:32,803 --> 01:17:36,493
They conducted a qualitative analysis or 80 violinists,

672
01:17:36,493 --> 01:17:46,753
49 individuals into a nine focus group was each group consist of 4 to 8 individuals and focus group discussion means they recruit these individuals,

673
01:17:47,263 --> 01:17:54,643
although they were interviewee, but the interviewer will precisely know nothing and ask for perceptions for all these interviewees.

674
01:17:55,423 --> 01:18:05,383
This this interview is has two modes 100% white will tell it full because they feel that individuals may be more likely to participate.

675
01:18:06,573 --> 01:18:12,973
If they have, the interviewer will telephone because they have functional limitations to access to the

676
01:18:13,243 --> 01:18:19,182
interview place and the further questions they provide to questions in neutral language.

677
01:18:19,183 --> 01:18:26,353
So the interviewee may feel these questions are free of bias in they will be more likely to talk about their feelings.

678
01:18:26,653 --> 01:18:33,613
They ask questions such as like what does it mean to you to age successfully with long term physical disability?

679
01:18:33,943 --> 01:18:37,512
Or what resources do you have now to help you age?

680
01:18:37,513 --> 01:18:42,463
Well, and we conduct qualitative analysis.

681
01:18:42,463 --> 01:18:48,943
So generally we have two independent coders that read the transcript generated from the interview,

682
01:18:49,273 --> 01:18:53,533
and they call it again and again so that they won't generate any new,

683
01:18:53,653 --> 01:19:00,343
different stuff between these two independent coders in the stop and cleaned and write off the result.

684
01:19:01,213 --> 01:19:10,003
So generally in this study they provided for concepts of successful aging among individuals for aging with disability.

685
01:19:10,783 --> 01:19:16,333
The results are provided in Green Box and that provide a little bit of their discussion

686
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:22,303
based on their comparison bias that comes up generated from aging into disabilities.

687
01:19:22,513 --> 01:19:27,883
So neither the author and I will take the responsibility for ability that I

688
01:19:27,883 --> 01:19:32,983
put in the white box here because they were provided in a discussion section.

689
01:19:33,433 --> 01:19:42,283
And the results about the first concept is the resilience and adaption for aging into disability

690
01:19:42,733 --> 01:19:49,273
resilience adaptations means resilience adaptations are quite similar between these two populations,

691
01:19:49,723 --> 01:19:52,243
and both of them means they will.

692
01:19:53,533 --> 01:20:02,083
They will on unachievable goals and reconstruct their goal systems because they know they were older or they have physical disabilities.

693
01:20:02,083 --> 01:20:09,112
So there are some goals they cannot achieve anymore, and they are some of the models for aging into disability.

694
01:20:09,113 --> 01:20:17,383
It also allows for the persistence of chronic medical conditions, which is similar in the concept here for aging with disability.

695
01:20:17,623 --> 01:20:22,493
But aging was this a. She also focuses on emotional.

696
01:20:23,183 --> 01:20:29,393
Emotional four, also focusing on the psychological resilience that these individual want to maintain,

697
01:20:29,693 --> 01:20:36,713
that emotional state they are afraid of and active in chronic moods associated with their physical disabilities.

698
01:20:37,013 --> 01:20:46,673
And they also emphasize only ability to adapt to unpredictable poos associated with physical disabilities because it's inevitable.

699
01:20:48,993 --> 01:20:54,993
And the second concept is autonomy. There is a big difference between these two populations.

700
01:20:55,233 --> 01:21:01,653
For aging into disability, autonomy generally represents independence in their daily activities.

701
01:21:01,953 --> 01:21:10,173
But for aging with disability, they are more focused on the ability to participate in making choices such as their caregiving chores,

702
01:21:10,413 --> 01:21:19,653
their housing, their housing decisions. But it's also require assistance and negotiations with their caregivers because they cannot do it alone.

703
01:21:19,953 --> 01:21:25,383
So autonomy for aging with disability is somewhat about assisted autonomy.

704
01:21:25,563 --> 01:21:36,843
It's different from the independence. And the concept is social connectedness for social connection among individuals who are aging into disability.

705
01:21:37,113 --> 01:21:42,673
It provides social engagement and community community participation, as we talked about last week.

706
01:21:42,963 --> 01:21:44,973
But for aging with disability,

707
01:21:45,633 --> 01:21:54,563
they are social connection with their family or caregivers are generally felt with caregiving and opportunities to espouse care.

708
01:21:55,233 --> 01:22:01,352
And they also they also mention that they want to interact with people also with this physical disability,

709
01:22:01,353 --> 01:22:08,013
because it provides outside a sense of kinship where they could provide emotional support from their peers.

710
01:22:08,433 --> 01:22:14,493
But it can be ambivalent about something because some people provide another opinions.

711
01:22:14,493 --> 01:22:20,012
They are they could not we don't want to interact with people has the same physical

712
01:22:20,013 --> 01:22:24,573
disability because they don't want to admit they have such a kind of physical disability.

713
01:22:24,873 --> 01:22:28,563
But they also admit that this situation improves their getting older.

714
01:22:31,263 --> 01:22:35,793
And the last concept is physical health for aging into disability.

715
01:22:35,793 --> 01:22:42,423
Physical health generally means they want to avoid the disease onsets or reduce the mobility limitation.

716
01:22:42,603 --> 01:22:47,883
But it's unrealistic for aging with disability, for aging with disability.

717
01:22:47,943 --> 01:22:51,753
They know that the additional functionality decline is inevitable.

718
01:22:52,023 --> 01:22:57,363
So they focus more on the prevention, the impacts of the functional decline.

719
01:22:57,633 --> 01:23:02,702
And we want to so that they can maintain participation in their value activities,

720
01:23:02,703 --> 01:23:08,103
even in the absence and even in the process of least functional decline.

721
01:23:08,433 --> 01:23:16,683
But they also mention that they like to have more access to appropriate health care, such as knowledgeable primary physicians.

722
01:23:16,683 --> 01:23:24,813
As we talk about as we talked before, that this physician has no such training to deal with their physical disabilities,

723
01:23:24,813 --> 01:23:32,583
as well as those secondary health conditions such as chronic fatigue, depression and hearing loss among these individuals.

724
01:23:34,803 --> 01:23:43,143
So contract. The major contribution of this study is they propose a paradigm for success, for aging with disability,

725
01:23:43,533 --> 01:23:49,233
and they focus on psychological resilience, psychological adaptability and flexibility.

726
01:23:49,563 --> 01:23:53,313
Autonomy, especially assisted autonomy for this population.

727
01:23:53,613 --> 01:24:00,993
They also emphasis on their social and communication properties of patients with people with or without disability.

728
01:24:01,563 --> 01:24:04,382
In the last two is the accessibility of medical care,

729
01:24:04,383 --> 01:24:12,003
with emphasis on managing their secondary health conditions and provide effective compensation for functional impairment.

730
01:24:13,563 --> 01:24:21,962
They are three three strands of this paper. The first one is they claim that they have a larger sample size compared to existing

731
01:24:21,963 --> 01:24:26,973
studies that generally include individuals under was a sample size under 20.

732
01:24:27,423 --> 01:24:36,573
Now they have a enroll individuals from certain states from a geographic type which was a geographic

733
01:24:36,573 --> 01:24:42,423
diverse sample compared to existing studies that generally enrolled individuals in a single state.

734
01:24:42,753 --> 01:24:50,793
And the last one is they focus on a growing part of their representative population with a physical disability acquired in early adulthood.

735
01:24:52,143 --> 01:25:02,103
Bowlby also have three limitations. The first one is this study is carried over five years from 2009 to 24 2014.

736
01:25:02,343 --> 01:25:09,903
So there could be a measure of time, in fact, over this period, which means the findings they provided may change over time.

737
01:25:09,903 --> 01:25:17,253
So it may not be applicable to the current to individuals in current in recent years.

738
01:25:18,243 --> 01:25:25,673
And the second one is they have interviewed this makes more for individuals who are attend the interview in person.

739
01:25:25,713 --> 01:25:31,743
They will be less likely to talk about their true feelings or opinions about assistance for aging.

740
01:25:32,223 --> 01:25:36,692
The third one is a measure confounding is that although they recruit individuals

741
01:25:36,693 --> 01:25:41,703
from certain issues such as but they cannot deal with the unmeasured confounding,

742
01:25:41,703 --> 01:25:50,013
which is the geographic regions, which means individuals from certain states may have different opinions compared to individuals in the other states,

743
01:25:50,343 --> 01:25:53,283
and they cannot measure, they cannot control.

744
01:25:53,283 --> 01:26:01,983
Further confounding was the physical disease that individuals has because they enrolled individuals with different physical disease.

745
01:26:03,783 --> 01:26:06,603
So I provide three discussion questions here.

746
01:26:06,933 --> 01:26:15,363
The first one is Given the limitation of this study, if you are the author, how would you carry out this study, either quantitative or qualitative?

747
01:26:15,693 --> 01:26:24,903
And the second one is do the the perspective of successful aging with physical disability may vary across certain demographic groups,

748
01:26:24,903 --> 01:26:30,303
such as men versus women, black versus white or older adult versus middle aged adults.

749
01:26:31,143 --> 01:26:36,693
In the last question has to be the perspective. Perspective as assessed for aging may change over time.

750
01:26:37,413 --> 01:26:51,293
Does it include? So anyone done qualitative research couldn't have done before?

751
01:26:51,803 --> 01:26:59,933
Yeah. And but I mostly was responsible for interviewing that part about the semi-structured question.

752
01:27:01,103 --> 01:27:04,583
How many participants were in your study? And we just have ten.

753
01:27:05,763 --> 01:27:08,773
Right. Now.

754
01:27:08,773 --> 01:27:14,073
She and I did sort of. Go ahead. I'm sorry. I'm doing the identification interviews for study.

755
01:27:14,973 --> 01:27:20,203
And when you say the ID, we're going through the transcripts and taking out any identifying information.

756
01:27:20,233 --> 01:27:24,073
Yeah. And how many participants are in your so far?

757
01:27:24,073 --> 01:27:27,853
70. 70. Wow. That's a.

758
01:27:32,203 --> 01:27:42,613
That notion. I did a study over the summer, which was focus groups and in-depth interviews, and we had a total of 24.

759
01:27:45,573 --> 01:27:49,802
So it's a very different kind of research to do how to do research.

760
01:27:49,803 --> 01:27:52,743
And it's great that I think people are trying to do it more,

761
01:27:52,743 --> 01:27:57,963
but it does allow you to go to these like really in-depth understanding of an issue, but you don't.

762
01:27:58,683 --> 01:28:06,903
The paradigm is that you don't worry about things like generalizability or confounding or all the other things that we're taught in epidemiology.

763
01:28:07,083 --> 01:28:10,583
Those things don't apply. I don't know.

764
01:28:10,593 --> 01:28:12,873
Let's see. Is that part of what you're learning as well?

765
01:28:13,503 --> 01:28:21,963
Yeah, it was interesting going into it because I actually jumped on from another study from from the same lab.

766
01:28:22,413 --> 01:28:28,653
And so they're like, Can you do this? The ID, I was like, I've never done any sort of qualitative stuff.

767
01:28:28,863 --> 01:28:36,993
Like, Oh, it's okay, you'll learn as you go. And yeah, and so I was, it's been interesting to go and learn.

768
01:28:36,993 --> 01:28:42,993
And so I'm asking questions. We're still going through the interview process.

769
01:28:43,003 --> 01:28:52,332
But yeah, I'm definitely going to be asking questions about that. Yeah, I mean, and it's very rich, rich data and the analysis is very complicated.

770
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:55,723
The whole analysis process is very different from quantitative analysis.

771
01:28:56,983 --> 01:29:05,233
And even when you have a limited knowledge or understanding about a domain and that quantitative research would have

772
01:29:05,233 --> 01:29:16,243
been attributed to that frame and to build that model so that you can start to do more quantitative reasoning.

773
01:29:16,243 --> 01:29:21,732
Yeah, right. Right. So then we think about even mixed results, mixed methods,

774
01:29:21,733 --> 01:29:26,413
where we integrated quantitative and qualitative research to address a single research question,

775
01:29:26,893 --> 01:29:32,923
where the qualitative research can identify the questions to be asked and they can be investigated in our larger study.

776
01:29:33,433 --> 01:29:40,693
And we have a larger study that's doing a quantitative survey for us, and it's coming out with some relationships between loneliness and dementia.

777
01:29:40,693 --> 01:29:45,672
But we don't know why that exists. We're not able to even know how long the variables in the survey.

778
01:29:45,673 --> 01:29:51,023
And so you can really get into the process by which that relationship unfolds in quality.

779
01:29:52,453 --> 01:29:56,433
So that's some of the benefits. Yeah.

780
01:29:56,443 --> 01:29:56,922
So I mean,

781
01:29:56,923 --> 01:30:04,873
I think this study was was particularly well-suited for the qualitative research because it was trying to figure out what is successful aging mean,

782
01:30:05,113 --> 01:30:12,022
what is the paradigm for people. Okay.

783
01:30:12,023 --> 01:30:16,643
Well, we I think these are amazing questions.

784
01:30:16,643 --> 01:30:24,803
And I would I would like to do is say let's get into small groups for about ten, 12 minutes, groups of about three or four.

785
01:30:25,403 --> 01:30:32,243
And let's focus on the second question. What is the perspective of successful aging across demographic groups?

786
01:30:32,243 --> 01:30:33,893
Does it does it vary?

787
01:30:34,763 --> 01:30:40,253
You can also pick up the other questions as well, if you like, but I'd be curious to hear, you know, the outcome of that discussion.

788
01:30:40,673 --> 01:30:46,373
So we'll take about 10 minutes to just go through, gather and share your ideas about about that perspective.

789
01:30:47,483 --> 01:31:07,603
And thank you. And that was. Yeah.

790
01:31:08,643 --> 01:31:12,873
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

791
01:31:13,333 --> 01:31:19,413
But I think I've heard a lot of discussion about the fact that.

792
01:31:22,193 --> 01:31:28,823
You know, my whole life, I don't know what satisfies our Asian views.

793
01:31:28,973 --> 01:31:35,813
Life is like that. I'm afraid that I won't be successful.

794
01:31:35,993 --> 01:31:44,623
I philosophy is that I need to have more access to healthcare and foundations and a glass ceiling.

795
01:31:45,663 --> 01:31:56,632
So if I'm just a like people, I think maybe I wouldn't have too many diseases.

796
01:31:56,633 --> 01:32:07,193
But if I didn't like to hear maybe not all that good having their house on house care and sense, how do you feel?

797
01:32:07,703 --> 01:32:10,813
And I'll see if I can influence my life.

798
01:32:11,543 --> 01:32:19,762
I saw somebody else some older in my age.

799
01:32:19,763 --> 01:32:25,993
I think as they age, I might have some more open vision.

800
01:32:27,563 --> 01:32:30,643
Yeah, sure. Do you feel like they really provide the raise?

801
01:32:32,333 --> 01:32:38,042
Okay, fine. Find. And maybe I ought to go there.

802
01:32:38,043 --> 01:32:54,923
And I think in terms of the current state of older Americans, there is like a physical understanding of games, more respect from people.

803
01:32:56,063 --> 01:33:01,193
If you don't have resources like.

804
01:33:03,243 --> 01:33:17,553
There's also social resources. So younger people, maybe a little age as long as you multitask.

805
01:33:18,123 --> 01:33:21,153
It doesn't matter how many.

806
01:33:21,153 --> 01:33:25,293
So it's like you all have different deprivation and these three factors.

807
01:33:25,493 --> 01:33:33,563
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I love, you know, I hear you just kind of thing.

808
01:33:33,743 --> 01:33:37,103
Since then year the new counsel asked us to have a hard.

809
01:33:37,733 --> 01:33:45,472
Yeah I had only that because it's really interesting because things like that I saw a lot of pressure on politicians.

810
01:33:45,473 --> 01:33:49,853
This deal more happened and even sometimes does not exist.

811
01:33:49,943 --> 01:33:55,823
We trust we it in China we have this kind of like of things zero.

812
01:33:55,913 --> 01:34:06,793
I just I don't want to do this or like if you work that because your colleagues said you attend, but there is also a sentence.

813
01:34:07,193 --> 01:34:10,753
But it's okay. It's like a difference.

814
01:34:10,773 --> 01:34:22,583
Yeah. So I imagine that trying to do something for this kind of people, things that are, you know, in trouble to see how we can do that.

815
01:34:23,543 --> 01:34:26,623
So I don't. I mean.

816
01:34:28,283 --> 01:34:36,403
Yeah, if you. I don't. Why are you going to this place you want to be like.

817
01:34:39,043 --> 01:34:44,703
He is Chinese, right? It's like it's I mean, but yeah.

818
01:34:44,713 --> 01:34:48,513
But I think for get comfortable. Yeah.

819
01:34:49,513 --> 01:34:53,323
So you have to stay like that and more.

820
01:34:53,513 --> 01:35:02,113
Yeah. There's different issues with this. It's a taxation process in the area.

821
01:35:03,763 --> 01:35:13,083
These. Yeah. And supply problems is when I was younger I have been, you know.

822
01:35:14,813 --> 01:35:17,933
Because sometimes it's like. I see. It's only. It's.

823
01:35:18,843 --> 01:35:25,183
They want to do that, especially after I don't know, I don't have jobs either.

824
01:35:26,223 --> 01:35:30,393
It was interesting. You have to plan because it's your family, right?

825
01:35:30,693 --> 01:35:38,933
Yeah. Yeah. Well, now I hear you like.

826
01:35:39,623 --> 01:35:44,843
Oh, yeah, I like to go straight.

827
01:35:45,323 --> 01:36:01,593
I mean, yeah, I like I think, like now we have like, I believe it was even a year ago and I dream or, you know, and they were the experience that.

828
01:36:05,003 --> 01:36:10,733
I think that we can maybe there's like a big industry in the country or yeah,

829
01:36:11,573 --> 01:36:26,163
there's also like this industry around the you that on December two at the same time you are close friends.

830
01:36:26,173 --> 01:36:33,023
I you could consider this like one theater with an entire of.

831
01:36:37,763 --> 01:36:44,403
Because they knew he was here. He still has the guts to say that.

832
01:36:44,703 --> 01:37:01,113
I think some of them, yeah. So there's a lot of people who are saying so it's just a few things I would say just because you know your daily.

833
01:37:01,203 --> 01:37:09,163
Yeah yeah yeah I like how your standards how you decide on your body.

834
01:37:09,173 --> 01:37:16,553
So I. So it's kind of like this meditation is not important anymore.

835
01:37:16,983 --> 01:37:27,653
Right. Do you think if you look at the they just or if it's not opened up like this.

836
01:37:27,863 --> 01:37:32,463
Yeah. I wonder, like I'm in here forever.

837
01:37:33,033 --> 01:37:40,343
And it's a very similar to that one that I have.

838
01:37:41,753 --> 01:37:56,932
Right. I mean, it's just, you know, workplace environment is like I'm just I'm not sure,

839
01:37:56,933 --> 01:38:09,123
like and that's one of my but in my family, I have a lot of friends like my grandma all the way here.

840
01:38:09,123 --> 01:38:19,192
So definitely educated. I don't want people to think that you are not supposed to be a property financier.

841
01:38:19,193 --> 01:38:25,493
I don't want to. And I don't want to feel like making.

842
01:38:26,293 --> 01:38:30,903
Okay. All right.

843
01:38:31,093 --> 01:38:36,203
I think it would be good for my different guys to like to have, like, a sense of humor.

844
01:38:36,593 --> 01:38:45,023
Yeah. So sometimes I think that maybe our age are sort of in Washington, sort of like a strong habit.

845
01:38:45,023 --> 01:38:48,053
I just know that to be true. Yeah. Yeah.

846
01:38:48,653 --> 01:38:53,063
Yeah. And like. Yeah.

847
01:38:53,873 --> 01:38:57,053
I think that once they're successful. Yeah.

848
01:38:57,053 --> 01:39:01,133
So if you're younger, you do more like last year hearing.

849
01:39:01,453 --> 01:39:04,762
Yeah. I was, like, thinking about that.

850
01:39:04,763 --> 01:39:14,323
And most of my peers have gone to driving or inspired me to have more percentage of.

851
01:39:14,353 --> 01:39:24,203
Yeah. So the thing is that this is something that we are not in the U.S. or so like the power

852
01:39:24,203 --> 01:39:32,213
of your parents would have made you perhaps less control over what is acceptable.

853
01:39:34,073 --> 01:39:37,402
Their. Yes. Yeah. And then cautious.

854
01:39:37,403 --> 01:39:45,023
It can also be explained. Like these are environments that you already are affecting.

855
01:39:46,403 --> 01:39:53,783
So, for example, I like to think like for the U.S., it's like whether the U.S.

856
01:39:54,083 --> 01:39:58,343
Rates and what are the differences between racial groups.

857
01:39:59,303 --> 01:40:16,683
And I like to be within different. And so she's married to a divorcee in the U.S. for much longer.

858
01:40:16,803 --> 01:40:21,303
People with disabilities, man.

859
01:40:21,643 --> 01:40:29,023
But also because younger, sometimes more focused means they're going to reinterpret the stereotype.

860
01:40:31,633 --> 01:40:36,663
Because sometimes you're right, despite the fact that is.

861
01:40:36,673 --> 01:40:40,973
And we might wonder whether he is if he is.

862
01:40:42,113 --> 01:40:51,213
Unless you specialize in houses like that, for example, you know, I don't know if I remember.

863
01:40:52,603 --> 01:40:56,172
It's like, yeah, it was quite interesting to me,

864
01:40:56,173 --> 01:41:05,643
like the different scenarios and how they all may feel that they were planning to do more because I was so mentally retarded that long time.

865
01:41:07,333 --> 01:41:17,053
And I think that's a given that you're wondering is it a personal relationship to make sure for people to know that they are?

866
01:41:17,913 --> 01:41:23,113
So we wrap up our time restrictions and share some ideas.

867
01:41:24,043 --> 01:41:29,923
I like your grandfather's really comfortable. Oh, yes. I hope I can do this, obviously.

868
01:41:30,013 --> 01:41:36,073
But I think it's great. And I think it's pretty.

869
01:41:37,093 --> 01:41:40,543
Is. Yeah. Okay.

870
01:41:43,153 --> 01:41:48,103
Yeah. So, yeah.

871
01:41:48,493 --> 01:41:59,103
So, like, I think it's one of those, you know, it becomes easier to get more done when you're young and as you get older,

872
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:05,473
like I would hoping that, that, that you were making yourself closer in time.

873
01:42:06,283 --> 01:42:11,543
So give me a few more days that enjoy the life of today.

874
01:42:15,003 --> 01:42:19,153
All righty. Shall we gather again and share some ideas?

875
01:42:20,053 --> 01:42:25,363
I've heard some great conversations. It's nice to see you guys interacting.

876
01:42:25,843 --> 01:42:30,753
The conversations are so great. All right.

877
01:42:30,763 --> 01:42:35,693
So. So let's start with the group at the back.

878
01:42:35,713 --> 01:42:46,033
What did you guys talk about? Yeah, well, I guess the second question you talked about how.

879
01:42:48,193 --> 01:42:54,243
In the readings that the survivors have almost gotten to the concept of intersectionality,

880
01:42:54,243 --> 01:43:01,003
you your identity in all of these spheres influences how you perceive disability or perceived access.

881
01:43:02,063 --> 01:43:07,823
So I think we should run up like this young woman and have a specific idea of like what your care is,

882
01:43:07,823 --> 01:43:11,453
but an elderly black man might have a different idea.

883
01:43:12,743 --> 01:43:18,013
It like the present reading with it almost got there and it kind of didn't quite get there.

884
01:43:18,023 --> 01:43:25,853
And I think it's just all agreed that if we're going to have something that needs to be considered in addition to these other conditions.

885
01:43:29,013 --> 01:43:35,033
What's happening now is we want to see. Those factors influence people's perception about.

886
01:43:35,913 --> 01:43:43,333
A sensible agent of this idea maybe would just like to see whether despite the huge and persistent.

887
01:43:43,563 --> 01:43:49,783
This is between these groups so that we can figure out the reasons behind them or to see what it ultimately.

888
01:43:51,893 --> 01:43:55,313
I think that will be a good follow up study. Great.

889
01:43:55,463 --> 01:43:58,702
Yeah, very interesting. Really good point about intersectionality.

890
01:43:58,703 --> 01:44:04,103
I think it's it is slowly moving into the disability sphere, but it's slow.

891
01:44:04,283 --> 01:44:12,773
But I absolutely agree it's going to be there. All right, Mickey and Lynn, what did you talk about and come up with?

892
01:44:13,523 --> 01:44:20,933
We're talking about the more things, the intersectionality and then also both before say,

893
01:44:20,963 --> 01:44:26,453
like your age as your cohort able to and then how your perspective changes over time.

894
01:44:26,903 --> 01:44:30,063
Both of those things probably interact as well because when you're young.

895
01:44:32,673 --> 01:44:36,333
Especially if you've got a disability, you know, early onset.

896
01:44:36,543 --> 01:44:43,653
You just want to be involved as much as you can, whatever do with your peers and be doing the same thing and fit in.

897
01:44:44,103 --> 01:44:53,703
And then maybe when you get older, that might change a little bit to more of like instead of focusing on how much I fit in my peers,

898
01:44:53,703 --> 01:45:00,543
like how well am I able to meet my own expectations in terms of functionality and like how I feel?

899
01:45:01,173 --> 01:45:04,373
And it becomes more, I don't know, this is. I guess maybe.

900
01:45:06,633 --> 01:45:09,773
So. Is the band focusing on others?

901
01:45:10,503 --> 01:45:17,183
Interesting. Interesting. C.J. and Josh.

902
01:45:19,913 --> 01:45:28,042
So this sounds a lot like how your peer groups will affect you when you're aging and like your definition and

903
01:45:28,043 --> 01:45:35,993
our perception of what is sense a successful aging and especially with somebody with physical disabilities.

904
01:45:36,323 --> 01:45:41,633
If you see somebody with disability, they age successfully or they just age.

905
01:45:41,993 --> 01:45:46,282
Maybe we don't use the word successfully here and they just age.

906
01:45:46,283 --> 01:45:49,103
And you would think that is a successful aging.

907
01:45:49,413 --> 01:46:01,023
But if somebody like it's like sometimes it's also could be unconsciousness and because for some reason or for some gender and those.
