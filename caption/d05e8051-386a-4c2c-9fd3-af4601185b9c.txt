1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,920
All right. Welcome back, everybody. We're clipping along through the semester now.

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,690
We're actually on to our last session related to noise specifically.

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,370
And then we're going to have our laboratory session and then we'll shift into some of the other physical hazards.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:24,269
But today, as I've kind of previewed in past lectures, we're going to focus in specifically on hearing protection devices,

5
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:31,290
not because they're the most important or first line of defense against excessive noise exposure, but because they're often misused.

6
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:38,339
And they are the most sort of complicated and unreliable, let's say, way to protect workers hearing.

7
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:45,480
So we'll we'll get into that in more detail shortly. So, you know, the competencies for today are basically understanding, well,

8
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:52,949
what are sort of the considerations I need to have with regards to hearing protection use and then sorry.

9
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,330
So I'm talking. Okay. I was like, am I hearing things?

10
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,490
It does happen from time to time. And then we're going to talk about the different types of hearing protectors.

11
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:08,160
And as I said before, and some of you may have seen me walk in with my giant IKEA bag here, we're going to try some on and see what we think.

12
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:17,340
First, though, and hopefully everybody is aware, I think I heard some mumblings in the back of the room about your noise exposure assignment here.

13
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,500
So I'm curious for those of you who have completed it, which hopefully is everybody,

14
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:32,490
I just like to get a ballpark sense of what kind of exposure levels we were all coming up with anybody willing to to share their GW, for instance.

15
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,060
Maybe I should put it a different way. So maybe a show of hands.

16
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:48,610
Those of you who had to be over 70. Okay, that's some of you.

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,020
How about 75? Okay, 80.

18
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,329
Okay. So, I mean, the good news, I don't see any hands.

19
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:07,239
So that means from a risk of hearing loss, you know, the risk of hearing loss with a chronic exposure of 40 years daily of 80 decibels or less,

20
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,430
we're really not expecting to see much in the way of hearing loss now.

21
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:16,170
I will say, of course, you're all in graduate school. This is not maybe a typical time in your life.

22
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,710
You may go on to do something much noisier or maybe even much quieter than what you're doing now.

23
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:29,620
But that's good news. Again, just in terms of kind of the contemporary period here, not really yielding any risk of of hearing loss.

24
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,800
I'm curious, anybody willing to share what the noisiest activity was that they monitored during their session?

25
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,360
Yeah. Please turn. I have, like, a SoulCycle file.

26
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,820
Okay. And they like class music. Very loud. Yes.

27
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,960
And I noticed on my assignment that like I.

28
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,860
I couldn't take the measurement inside the time itself because they don't allow time.

29
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,760
So I took it like right before I started. Right after where I'm standing right outside the room.

30
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:02,560
Okay. And it came out to like, I think my highest one was like 78.3, which is pretty loud, but it was probably higher.

31
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,950
Sure, much higher when I was like ashamed or like with the speakers.

32
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,919
Yeah. Thank you for sharing that. I will say, you know, from my own experience looking at the literature and looking at the popular press,

33
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,530
I feel like cycling exercise activities in gyms are some of the noisiest activities.

34
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,870
And I don't know why instructors feel the need to just sort of blast their participants with music.

35
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:28,659
But this is, I think, not an uncommon phenomenon. In fact, I've seen some measurements in the literature, and of course,

36
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,229
we always have to be skeptical of measurements, make sure they're made in the same way.

37
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:38,560
But sort of measurements, I would say, look like they were made correctly up in the 95, 100 decibel range.

38
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,660
So again, you know, if you do this for a few minutes a day, it's not going be any risk of hearing loss.

39
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,690
But if you're the instructor and you're in there day in and day out doing this,

40
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:52,240
that's not the kind of occupation that we would normally think of as an at risk worker, but they absolutely could.

41
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,730
All right. Other interesting or high noise levels that you measured?

42
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:06,759
I mean, I was in the hockey game, but it was the first day that I was the last last week.

43
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:18,940
So I was ready to make sure. So I got the app and it was measuring just for curiousity and it was high but not that much.

44
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:26,829
I mean, meanwhile, the, the play was just normal, no goals or anything.

45
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:34,750
It was like like 60, 60 players between 60 and 70 or less.

46
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,290
When there was a goal there, there was a peak like a 119.

47
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,600
Oh, okay. Yes. Bit of a jump. Yeah, yeah.

48
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,850
But of course it was just a few seconds.

49
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,810
Sure. Then it went down again.

50
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,870
But it was noisy because 70 or 75.

51
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,020
It is noisy, but it wasn't too much. Really.

52
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:08,640
Okay, good. And of course, one thing to keep in mind, as Velma said, you know, there there may be brief periods of pretty high levels, 119.

53
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:16,870
It's really, really high. You know, our inclination is to say, well, it was just for a short period, probably no risk of hearing loss for an attendee.

54
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,609
If you go to a game occasionally, I would totally risk, I would totally agree, no risk of hearing loss.

55
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,730
But on the flip side, if you think about it, as we've talked about,

56
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:32,709
a short period of time at a very high level can average out to the same way as a much longer exposure at a lower level.

57
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,820
So we shouldn't dismiss those exposures that are a couple of seconds in duration.

58
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,600
Again, you know, no no real risk of immediate harm from those.

59
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,640
It's not really until we get up to somewhere between 125 and 130 decibel point,

60
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,229
where we start to shift from a more chronic risk of hearing loss to a more acute

61
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,920
risk of hearing loss where we might actually get acoustic trauma you know,

62
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,180
blow out an eardrum, just articulate are middle ear bones those are all bad things.

63
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:04,330
So we're not going to see that at 119. But still pretty amazing that you can see a level like that at a hockey game.

64
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,170
I'll also say for a number of years now, I feel like there's been a running competition among not hockey arenas but

65
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,729
football stadiums in the US trying to identify who's got the loudest stadium.

66
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:19,000
So it's like a competition to see who can be loudest.

67
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,999
And if you see photos of how they take these, it's like, Oh my God.

68
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,380
So you know, if you wanted to do this right, you'd have a measurement device in the middle of the field with no immediate noise sources.

69
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:34,120
So you could kind of measure the true stadium noise. But if you look, there's always people like screaming directly into the microphone.

70
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,840
It's like, that's not really a rigorous scientific trial that you're conducting there.

71
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,370
The other point, though, is like, is this really something we want to compete over?

72
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,609
And it's not good to me. But, you know, I'm a public health nerd.

73
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:52,250
What do I know? Any other interesting activities or high levels that people experienced?

74
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:59,989
Yeah, really interesting. I thought I went to a movie and I thought that the movie would be higher than the restaurant that I went to afterwards.

75
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:05,420
But the restaurant was higher. Oh, interesting. And the movie was allowed was like about a symphony.

76
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:12,470
So it was like loud music. Okay. I realized, like, maybe it's because there's not a lot of ambient noise in the movie.

77
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,490
The purpose is to hear what they're saying. And there's not.

78
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,750
Yeah, no background noise with in a restaurant. There's so many different noises coming through.

79
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:27,170
Yeah, very good. So, you know, one environment the movie is, as you say, designed to convey information to you,

80
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,650
the restaurants, just a bunch of people in there chatting in the kitchen and everything working.

81
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,280
I will say, I don't know how much of a phenomenon this is now,

82
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,589
because I haven't been in the theater regularly for for a couple of years, but sort of pre-pandemic,

83
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:45,140
there was this notion or this idea that especially during the trailers that play at the start of a movie,

84
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:51,140
that they crank up the volume like another 5 to 10 decibels because they know people are talking and, you know, settling into their seats.

85
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:57,250
But they really want to get your attention. It's like, you know, another just terrible way that we expose people to noise.

86
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,470
It's absolutely unnecessary. Great example.

87
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:08,680
The one other thing I'll mention, so I got a question from a couple of you about, gosh, do I need to know the dose to compute a way?

88
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,030
And if you have the dose, you can certainly computer, too.

89
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:17,839
But for those of you who didn't have a dose, we talked about how to compute and the Q in class and I said, you know,

90
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,870
if you want to compute in the queue over any period of time, you measured 2 hours, 4 hours, 24 hours, whatever.

91
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,310
You can just divide by the total measurement duration that you had there.

92
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,930
The two of you, a equation looks virtually identical, except in the case of the two of you,

93
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:39,650
A regardless of how long the actual measurement was, we divide by 8 hours, so we're basically normalizing to an eight hour day.

94
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,340
So, you know,

95
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:49,220
that was an opportunity maybe to think about some of the equations we've talked over and figure out how to apply them in a slightly new fashion.

96
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,990
Okay. So let's do a quick exercise again.

97
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:59,390
We'll get you all talking here. So I want you to break into your usual groups or mix it up and find somebody new.

98
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:05,750
But I want you to think about hearing protectors, the topic of today's lecture, and I'd like you to think of in your group,

99
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,389
ideally at least four different requirements that you think OSHA should put on

100
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:15,830
an employer that is requiring the use of hearing protectors in their facility.

101
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,529
So in other words, if you've got a regulatory agency,

102
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:26,450
what are the kinds of things they should be requiring employers or work facilities to do in order to use screen protectors correctly?

103
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,950
So, again, let's take a couple of minutes. Just break up amongst yourselves and we'll come back and see what you came up with.

104
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,068
Turkey. And.

105
00:09:45,324 --> 00:09:50,453
So it seems like conversation is waning a little bit, and I'd love to hear what you all came up with.

106
00:09:50,454 --> 00:09:53,994
And I'm sure each group probably has a similar set of requirements.

107
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:58,934
But what are some of the things you think OSHA should require? Yeah.

108
00:09:59,074 --> 00:10:02,343
Got multiple options of production. Okay.

109
00:10:02,344 --> 00:10:05,494
So. Meaning different. Different types of models, that kind of thing.

110
00:10:05,524 --> 00:10:09,154
Okay. Very good. So in the back? Yeah. Oh, fantastic. Fit testing.

111
00:10:09,154 --> 00:10:15,334
Okay. So the idea that we don't just give people protectors, but we actually measure them and see how well they work when they're very excellent.

112
00:10:16,144 --> 00:10:20,574
What else? Yeah. Just training and general training.

113
00:10:20,584 --> 00:10:27,004
Right. So we've, we've talked and we will continue to talk about how hearing protectors almost uniquely among the different

114
00:10:27,004 --> 00:10:32,763
types of protection that are out there and which there are many can be the hardest to wear correctly.

115
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:34,444
And that's something we don't recognize.

116
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:41,824
And if we're expecting people to know without good training how to wear hearing protectors, we're going to be disappointed, frankly.

117
00:10:42,034 --> 00:10:46,084
Now, fit testing is a great way to confirm that they're actually wearing it correctly,

118
00:10:46,084 --> 00:10:50,404
but if they're not trained, we can sort of assume at least some fraction are not going to wear it correctly.

119
00:10:51,514 --> 00:10:51,934
What else?

120
00:10:53,844 --> 00:11:03,764
Definitely there's a this goes into the training piece, but I've heard coaches before that equate earbuds to I guess the most productive earbuds.

121
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:09,134
So even just the acknowledgment that it's not just something you're putting in here to sort of I don't know.

122
00:11:09,194 --> 00:11:13,994
It's you know, that's a great point. In fact, I have a slide on that towards the end of today's talk.

123
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:22,664
But you're absolutely right. So this misperception that things are hearing, protectors that actually aren't earbuds is one of them.

124
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:27,254
You know, cotton balls. I've seen people put all sorts of things in their ears.

125
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:33,614
In fact, I was in a police firing range in Seattle and a couple of the cops were using bullets as hearing protection.

126
00:11:33,974 --> 00:11:37,514
Wow. This is just like where do you even begin with?

127
00:11:39,404 --> 00:11:43,574
So again, if people can wear them wrong or choose the wrong product, at least some fraction of them will.

128
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:48,074
Great. What else do we have to think about with regards to hearing protectors?

129
00:11:53,674 --> 00:12:00,994
Yeah. He has to be able to not be burdensome in the respect that the interrupts their behavior or work ability.

130
00:12:01,474 --> 00:12:07,593
Sure. So like any type of protective equipment, we want this to be the least sort of burdensome, an invasive approach.

131
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:14,494
Possible. So that's that's a great point. That's something that comes in on the selection side up front when we're figuring out what's being offered,

132
00:12:14,494 --> 00:12:19,564
but also something we probably need to monitor over time. I've worked with worksites who, for instance,

133
00:12:19,924 --> 00:12:25,714
didn't have an eye protection requirement and then put in some new equipment and suddenly needed eye protection.

134
00:12:25,714 --> 00:12:29,134
And the protectors they had been using didn't really work with eye protection.

135
00:12:29,134 --> 00:12:33,144
So, you know, we need to revisit and sort of ask, well, this stuff used to work.

136
00:12:33,154 --> 00:12:35,374
Is it still working just as well for the workers?

137
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:43,804
I'm thinking of one other thing that we absolutely have to do with regards to hearing protectors, any any other ideas.

138
00:12:45,824 --> 00:12:49,674
It doesn't have to be the one thing. Yeah. Or wear them. Okay.

139
00:12:49,694 --> 00:12:54,254
Two things. Yeah, that's a great point. So enforcement is key.

140
00:12:54,404 --> 00:12:58,004
This is not just a suggestion. You know, if we think the workers are at risk,

141
00:12:58,004 --> 00:13:04,904
we need to make sure that they understand and have access to hearing protection and they actually wear it when they need to.

142
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:10,334
So that's that's a piece of it. I guess the second question would be, well, how do we know when they need to wear it?

143
00:13:11,414 --> 00:13:17,594
And that's a question for the whole group. I mean, you put it on the you know, what what data points do we need to know?

144
00:13:18,974 --> 00:13:25,744
Do we need very protection or not? I believe we'll deal with that later.

145
00:13:26,824 --> 00:13:29,924
So ideas on what that data might be? No. To make sure.

146
00:13:30,094 --> 00:13:37,534
Yeah, absolutely. If we don't know how loud it is, we have no idea if we even need hearing protection, much less how much hearing protection we need.

147
00:13:37,544 --> 00:13:43,684
So that may not be an exhaustive list, but I think what you guys have come up with plus noise measurements is a pretty good start.

148
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:53,224
So with regards to hearing protection devices, OSHA does require and all the state OSHA's require as well that for instance,

149
00:13:53,224 --> 00:14:01,264
these have to be provided to employees at no cost. So you can't charge employees for any protective equipment that they have to wear on the job.

150
00:14:01,624 --> 00:14:04,714
Now, there is exceptions to this. So, for instance,

151
00:14:04,714 --> 00:14:08,673
I was at a shipyard a couple of years ago and they had a bunch of vending machines

152
00:14:08,674 --> 00:14:12,874
right outside the entrance to the shipyard that had a ton of PPE for sale,

153
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:18,514
not for free. So if you needed safety glasses, if you wanted different types of hearing protection, you can buy them.

154
00:14:18,844 --> 00:14:23,374
The way they got away with that is they provided a basic selection for free.

155
00:14:23,674 --> 00:14:28,354
And then if you decide, I like that, I want to try a different one, then you could opt to pay more.

156
00:14:28,354 --> 00:14:35,074
But critically, they always had access to at least some in a variety of different types of free hearing protectors.

157
00:14:36,004 --> 00:14:45,303
Again, there's also this notion of a selection. So OSHA, as I mentioned earlier, entered the free ones that they offer to ship out.

158
00:14:45,304 --> 00:14:51,694
It's still up to the standards that are required for nature, for their detection devices or everything else.

159
00:14:52,444 --> 00:14:59,103
Yeah. So to be clear, any type of protection, you know, respiratory eye hearing protection,

160
00:14:59,104 --> 00:15:03,634
whatever that's offered by an employer in a workplace needs to be sufficient to protect

161
00:15:03,634 --> 00:15:08,584
the workers in all cases so they can't have the stuff that's for sale be really cheap.

162
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:12,604
Shoddy stuff that's not going to do the job at all has to be sufficiently protective.

163
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:17,554
So when it comes to a selection I mentioned already, OSHA says too.

164
00:15:17,674 --> 00:15:23,254
Naish says at least four different types of hearing protectors is kind of the bare

165
00:15:23,254 --> 00:15:27,033
minimum that you need to make sure that everybody can find one that works for them.

166
00:15:27,034 --> 00:15:30,274
And you'll you'll get a sense of that when we start trying them on in a minute.

167
00:15:31,054 --> 00:15:34,923
It's also the employer's job to ensure adequate attenuation.

168
00:15:34,924 --> 00:15:39,484
So again, to come to Andrew's point, you can't just give them any old type A hearing protection.

169
00:15:39,484 --> 00:15:46,444
The employer is responsible for figuring out, well, how much protection do they need, how many decibels of reduction do they need?

170
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:53,793
And that's the type of product that I have to provide here. And then lastly, as Oren said, we need to ensure that they're being used.

171
00:15:53,794 --> 00:15:57,544
And this is something that employers routinely overlook.

172
00:15:57,544 --> 00:16:03,814
So most employers have use of personal protective equipment as essentially an expectation of work.

173
00:16:03,814 --> 00:16:13,234
It's a job requirement. And so if someone's not wearing their protection, you as an employer typically have the right to to give them,

174
00:16:13,234 --> 00:16:17,254
for instance, a verbal warning or a written warning, a suspension and termination.

175
00:16:17,704 --> 00:16:22,954
And that's kind of a standard gradient of different kind of punitive measures.

176
00:16:23,434 --> 00:16:28,294
So I've seen many employers who are like, Gosh, we ask and we ask and we encourage people to wear them.

177
00:16:28,294 --> 00:16:34,564
It's like you don't encourage, you tell. And if people can't wear them, you know, they're making you liable for their hearing loss.

178
00:16:34,564 --> 00:16:37,764
You should get them out of your workforce. This is not a good environment for them.

179
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:42,873
You can't allow them to harm themselves because they're refusing. Again, this this expectation of employment.

180
00:16:42,874 --> 00:16:48,424
So enforcement is huge, but again, kind of an under-recognized tool that employers have.

181
00:16:49,594 --> 00:16:55,294
So when it comes to when people have to wear hearing protection, we've already touched on this, I think, two lectures ago.

182
00:16:55,294 --> 00:17:01,804
But just to reiterate, OSHA, again, a little bit squirrely between their permissible exposure limit and their action level.

183
00:17:02,284 --> 00:17:05,994
So you have to make hearing protection available to workers if they have a T,

184
00:17:06,394 --> 00:17:13,263
a at or above 85 decibels workers who have already had a standard threshold shift.

185
00:17:13,264 --> 00:17:19,444
So they've already experienced a noise induced hearing loss or who haven't already gotten their baseline audiogram.

186
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:25,414
And remember, according to OSHA, the employer can take up up to a year to do that if they're using a mobile provider.

187
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:30,274
So those workers have to wear hearing protection at or above 85 decibels.

188
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:35,644
Everybody else only has to wear them at a time of 90 decibels or more.

189
00:17:35,644 --> 00:17:38,914
So again, we've got that kind of gray area between 85 and 90.

190
00:17:39,364 --> 00:17:42,824
I don't know about you, but if I were in a workforce, I probably wouldn't know.

191
00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:46,504
Well, has this individual having to assess that individual have their baseline?

192
00:17:46,504 --> 00:17:49,864
Audiogram You're certainly not going to know that as you're just wandering around the plant.

193
00:17:50,644 --> 00:17:53,914
So I much prefer and encourage that.

194
00:17:53,914 --> 00:18:01,593
The idea that niche and HGH and again, virtually every non-U.S. regulatory agency in the world has endorsed,

195
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:04,444
which is if you've got people at or above,

196
00:18:04,504 --> 00:18:12,514
85 decibels, is the way they should be in hearing protection and should also be trying to put into place noise controls, as we talked about last week.

197
00:18:13,984 --> 00:18:19,713
So when it comes to hearing protectors and I think I mentioned this in a prior lecture, but if it is repeating.

198
00:18:19,714 --> 00:18:23,814
So these really should be. Considered a temporary fix.

199
00:18:24,054 --> 00:18:30,863
They're designed to be a Band-Aid until you can actually fix the noise problem or if you can document, hey,

200
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:35,574
you know, we've tried X, Y and Z to bring the noise levels down and none of those controls were feasible.

201
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:40,734
So we're relying on these because we've sort of demonstrated that there's nothing else that will do the job.

202
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:46,824
These are not intended to be the first line of defense, which unfortunately is how they get treated in many companies.

203
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:56,184
I'll also say there is an emphasis that gets put on the protector that provides the most attenuation possible,

204
00:18:56,574 --> 00:19:01,613
and we'll talk about how that's measured in a little while. But attenuation, again, is basically just the noise reduction.

205
00:19:01,614 --> 00:19:08,214
How much or how many decibels is that protector blocking when it's in or on the worker's ear?

206
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:17,334
And so it's often not an industrial hygienist or an NHS professional who's doing the ordering of the earplugs.

207
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:21,534
For instance, it might be an accountant and an accountant might look and say, Gosh,

208
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:26,593
these two projectors seem to offer the same amount of protection, but one of them is half the price.

209
00:19:26,594 --> 00:19:31,224
So I'm going to go with the one that's half the price. Failing to recognize that, you know,

210
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:36,924
those two products aren't created equally and the second product might actually be the better choice, as we'll talk about in a minute.

211
00:19:38,304 --> 00:19:42,084
But beyond price, there are absolutely other things we need to consider.

212
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:47,174
So we need to account for the fact that most workers don't work in a vacuum of silence.

213
00:19:47,184 --> 00:19:50,364
They need to actually talk to people and they need to be able to hear people.

214
00:19:50,874 --> 00:19:55,103
So our goal is not to cut people off from the world by blocking all sound.

215
00:19:55,104 --> 00:19:59,454
We just want to bring the sound down to a safe level. As we heard earlier,

216
00:19:59,454 --> 00:20:06,173
we also want to account for things like convenience and ease of use and are the types of protectors

217
00:20:06,174 --> 00:20:11,094
we're providing appropriate for these workers who are working in very dirty or very hot conditions,

218
00:20:11,094 --> 00:20:16,794
which we'll talk about. We need to think about compatibility with other types of protective equipment.

219
00:20:16,794 --> 00:20:19,074
As I said, particularly if you're using earmuffs.

220
00:20:19,674 --> 00:20:27,534
Earmuffs and safety glasses can get along, but they often don't because the safety glasses basically break the seal of the ear.

221
00:20:27,744 --> 00:20:33,824
So we don't want to put person a person at risk of an eye injury because we're protecting their ears or vice versa.

222
00:20:33,874 --> 00:20:34,764
We need to do this. Right.

223
00:20:36,024 --> 00:20:43,104
And then again, environmental conditions, things like heat, when all of these things may make some types of protectors better than others,

224
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:48,773
I would kind of distill this down to what I call the forces of hearing protection.

225
00:20:48,774 --> 00:20:57,593
So comfort is perhaps first and foremost, I would say kudos to this father for putting his kid in hearing protectors.

226
00:20:57,594 --> 00:21:03,264
That doesn't look very comfortable, though. This child has no agency and no choice, so they're forced to wear it.

227
00:21:03,264 --> 00:21:08,664
But workers do, and they will choose not to wear uncomfortable devices and conveniences.

228
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:17,364
Number two, if I've got a task that I do every 30 minutes or something and I'm just running into a room and running back out and doing this task,

229
00:21:17,724 --> 00:21:22,013
I'm not going to put on a hearing protector if it takes me like 60 seconds to put that hearing protector on.

230
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:26,964
And it's something that can go on really quickly. Communications, as I said, is critical.

231
00:21:26,964 --> 00:21:31,283
So we want to make sure that people are reduced to a safe level of sound,

232
00:21:31,284 --> 00:21:36,234
but still able to hear and still able to communicate with their boss, their coworker, whatever.

233
00:21:37,284 --> 00:21:41,604
And then cost is another one. And so I already sort of alluded to financial cost.

234
00:21:42,444 --> 00:21:46,884
I mean, there are types of hearing protectors on the market that can cost $150 a pair.

235
00:21:47,794 --> 00:21:52,044
That's a lot of money to spend on a worker, especially if you have a transient workforce,

236
00:21:52,794 --> 00:22:01,044
especially when you could put them in a maybe a foam earplugs like we'll look at for $0.02 in air, but there's also social cost.

237
00:22:01,044 --> 00:22:07,254
And so I've I have talked to employers who were like, we just can't get our workers to wear the earplugs that we're providing.

238
00:22:07,254 --> 00:22:11,123
And, you know, I'll go out and it's a construction company. I'm like, Well, the earplugs are pink.

239
00:22:11,124 --> 00:22:18,294
I don't know if you've thought about that. And it shouldn't make a difference, but it does with sort of a high machismo workforce,

240
00:22:18,294 --> 00:22:23,964
you know, they just don't find those to be socially acceptable. Let's try, you know, camouflage or something else ridiculous like that.

241
00:22:23,964 --> 00:22:27,293
Again, not thoughts we should be having to have in 2022.

242
00:22:27,294 --> 00:22:31,254
But this kind of stuff is is very much still an issue out in the workplace.

243
00:22:32,454 --> 00:22:38,004
So when it comes to types of hearing protectors, there's really five main types that we've got to deal with.

244
00:22:38,004 --> 00:22:39,473
And that's a good thing.

245
00:22:39,474 --> 00:22:47,064
Again, the more sort of diversity we have in the offerings, the more likely we are to find one that works for every single one of our workers.

246
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:52,794
So the five types are foam, and that's kind of the classic earplug.

247
00:22:52,794 --> 00:22:57,353
This is one of the oldest earplugs on the market. People call them soup cans.

248
00:22:57,354 --> 00:23:00,684
They come up with all sorts of different names, but it's a foam product.

249
00:23:01,284 --> 00:23:07,134
We've got pre molded, which consists of a portion and interior portion of the plug that actually blocks

250
00:23:07,134 --> 00:23:11,484
sound and then some sort of a stem that you actually use to insert the device.

251
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:17,363
We've got what are called semi-auto inserts or banded canal caps or ear canal caps.

252
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:21,644
They've got all sorts of names. That's kind of a combination of an earplug and an.

253
00:23:21,714 --> 00:23:23,904
Here, Muff, and we'll talk about those more in a minute.

254
00:23:24,534 --> 00:23:30,804
And then we've got earmuffs, of course, which we have now strewn across the floor in the far side of the classroom.

255
00:23:31,734 --> 00:23:37,284
Have you guys grabbed those and try them on shortly? And then finally, we've got custom molded earplugs.

256
00:23:37,314 --> 00:23:41,094
Now, I mentioned there are devices out there that cost $150 a pair.

257
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:45,144
That's typically the custom molded earplugs are the most expensive available.

258
00:23:46,284 --> 00:23:51,353
Very expensive. I mean, as protective equipment goes, that's a huge investment on the part of the employer.

259
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:58,694
But we'll talk about how the there are other advantages to those types of very expensive products, other things to think about.

260
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:08,484
So there are so-called non-linear devices out there, non-linear meaning they don't perform equally well across a range of noise exposures.

261
00:24:08,484 --> 00:24:16,704
In other words, by design, they block less sound at lower noise exposures and more sound as the sound gets louder.

262
00:24:16,854 --> 00:24:24,504
So that's pretty cool technology. And then there's also electronic amplifying now earmuffs and earplugs out there that

263
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:28,653
have circuitry built into them where essentially and depending on the product,

264
00:24:28,654 --> 00:24:36,054
the level can vary a little bit, but somewhere between 82 and 83 decibels, if you're below that as a sound pressure level in your environment,

265
00:24:36,354 --> 00:24:41,604
these devices will actually amplify the sound around you and kind of act like a hearing aid.

266
00:24:42,054 --> 00:24:48,234
And then when you hit typically 80 or 83 decibels, that active part drops out and they become a passive protector.

267
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:52,043
The idea here is, gosh, I don't have to take my protectors out.

268
00:24:52,044 --> 00:24:55,164
Now, if there's a brief period of less noise,

269
00:24:55,824 --> 00:25:03,264
because my protectors are going to amplify that and let me communicate so I don't have to be taking my plugs or my my muffs in and out all day.

270
00:25:05,154 --> 00:25:07,974
Let's not bother with Paul everywhere here. I will just ask.

271
00:25:08,154 --> 00:25:17,724
So if if I were to ask you as I am, how many makes and models of hearing protectors do you think are out there on the market?

272
00:25:18,624 --> 00:25:24,263
What kind of estimate might you come up with? Understanding you have zero basis for this.

273
00:25:24,264 --> 00:25:27,864
Now you could just throw out a number, you know, way you could be wrong.

274
00:25:29,304 --> 00:25:33,214
Any ideas? 25,000.

275
00:25:33,484 --> 00:25:37,134
25,000. All right, go big. I like it anyway.

276
00:25:37,214 --> 00:25:40,234
You think more than 25,000, 500.

277
00:25:40,474 --> 00:25:43,504
500. Okay, we've got now two ends of the spectrum here.

278
00:25:44,174 --> 00:25:48,614
Other other ideas. All right.

279
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:49,874
Well, that's a pretty good bounding range.

280
00:25:49,904 --> 00:25:57,553
It turns out the actual answer changes a little bit as manufacturers come and go, but it's actually somewhere around 350 or so.

281
00:25:57,554 --> 00:26:00,734
So 25,000 would be awesome then.

282
00:26:00,734 --> 00:26:03,824
We would never have a problem finding one that fits everybody.

283
00:26:04,094 --> 00:26:08,234
Of course, the challenge is if there were 25,000 on the market, you know,

284
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:13,303
I as an employer, I'm not going to sort of have an inventory of 25,000 different products.

285
00:26:13,304 --> 00:26:18,494
I need to find a few for 810 that I can stock for my workforce.

286
00:26:18,974 --> 00:26:21,703
But again, the bigger the denominator there we have to choose from,

287
00:26:21,704 --> 00:26:25,574
the more diversity and the more likely we are to come up with one that works for our workers.

288
00:26:26,894 --> 00:26:35,324
Okay, so let's move into interactive mode now. I've got three boxes of hearing protectors over here, so why don't you guys just formalize?

289
00:26:35,324 --> 00:26:41,804
We got through you collages, we grab floor mats, you can grab bag mats, but they're all the same, I assure you.

290
00:26:42,224 --> 00:26:46,904
But grab one of each of those types of hearing protectors we're going to run through and try them all.

291
00:26:53,614 --> 00:27:09,684
I think. I guess I just hope that you're there.

292
00:27:14,014 --> 00:27:21,154
And as you're moving along, you can see from our diminishing pile of earmuffs here that there are just a ton of us on the market.

293
00:27:21,864 --> 00:27:29,683
We're taking what you want to be. Yes, these. Sorry.

294
00:27:29,684 --> 00:27:33,254
You can see logistics is not my forte here. We've got a huge bottleneck.

295
00:27:33,254 --> 00:27:43,393
I apologize. And maybe I should say this upfront.

296
00:27:43,394 --> 00:27:49,064
The earplugs are yours. I need the earmuffs back. So. So apologies on that.

297
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:57,444
But, yes, I will also say if if any of you, over the course of your degrees here, ever need hearing protection, I'm your guy.

298
00:27:57,464 --> 00:28:02,774
I've got, like, 70,000 earplugs sitting in my lab, and I would love nothing more than to protect your ears if I could.

299
00:28:07,034 --> 00:28:12,914
Rick, how common is it for me to look like I care?

300
00:28:12,914 --> 00:28:19,154
Because I remember in the actually over 30 hours of general infrastructure that you talk about.

301
00:28:20,684 --> 00:28:23,954
Yeah, but I've not heard so far yet in the program.

302
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:27,044
Anyone, actually. Yeah, that's a good question.

303
00:28:27,824 --> 00:28:35,774
So while you guys are taking your seat again, Andy has raised a great question here around sort of maintenance and care for hearing protection.

304
00:28:36,254 --> 00:28:41,844
That is absolutely a required part of OSHA hearing conservation training for workers.

305
00:28:42,194 --> 00:28:46,994
So the idea here is and we'll go through this for each different type of protector,

306
00:28:47,414 --> 00:28:52,303
but if you give a worker any type of protective device, they need to know how to clean it.

307
00:28:52,304 --> 00:28:58,544
So they're not wearing something that's filthy or potentially going to give them an infection or a rash or something like that.

308
00:28:59,024 --> 00:29:00,434
So these have all been cleaned.

309
00:29:00,914 --> 00:29:07,723
There are, believe it or not, there are wipes made specifically for earmuffs, cups like you see here that are non alcohol.

310
00:29:07,724 --> 00:29:13,334
So they don't drive them out of track then. So that's standard practice should be standard practice everywhere.

311
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:17,713
Definitely standard of practice in class here. But yeah, Andy, that is a great point.

312
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:22,814
So anytime you give people a respirator or safety glasses, whatever,

313
00:29:23,324 --> 00:29:27,674
they need to know how to wear it correctly and they need to know how to take care of it. Great question.

314
00:29:28,304 --> 00:29:31,654
Okay. So, you know, the one thing I forgot to do was grab a pair for myself.

315
00:29:31,664 --> 00:29:40,544
So let me get one of each. So let's go ahead and grab the classic foam earplug here.

316
00:29:41,234 --> 00:29:46,364
And I'll point out, I've given you two different varieties. Again, there's 350 of these things to choose from.

317
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:50,984
We've got one that's connected by a cord and the other that's not so.

318
00:29:51,464 --> 00:29:55,814
I'm going to just choose randomly here. The one that is not connected by a cord.

319
00:29:56,474 --> 00:30:04,724
Cords, though, can be super helpful. So if you imagine having a loose pair of earplugs floating around in your pocket, you know,

320
00:30:04,874 --> 00:30:11,203
fishing for them when you need them or looking in your tool kit or, you know, somewhere else that's super convenient.

321
00:30:11,204 --> 00:30:18,014
You're probably going to go through a lot of these, whereas the corded product you just wear around your neck whenever you need it, it's right there.

322
00:30:18,494 --> 00:30:22,064
So you might ask, Well, gosh, why aren't all earplugs corded?

323
00:30:22,184 --> 00:30:28,334
Well, I'm glad you asked, because if you think about a worker wearing an earplug with a cord dangling on it,

324
00:30:28,334 --> 00:30:33,464
who's working there, heavy equipment, that earplug could get sucked into the machine by the cord.

325
00:30:33,854 --> 00:30:37,394
Maybe the worker gets sucked into the machine too. That would be the worst case scenario.

326
00:30:38,234 --> 00:30:44,804
Or any time again, you've got moving components or people are moving around quite a bit and that earplug cord can snag on things.

327
00:30:45,164 --> 00:30:51,104
And again, it's I like cords for convenience, but they're not for every application.

328
00:30:52,184 --> 00:31:00,164
So let me have you all do the following. I'm going to play just a sound, a white noise sound here in the classroom.

329
00:31:00,554 --> 00:31:03,523
And I'd like you just to put your earplugs on while the sound is playing.

330
00:31:03,524 --> 00:31:08,404
And I just want you to kind of perceive what the sound sounds like as you put the devices on.

331
00:31:08,414 --> 00:31:23,124
So let's go ahead and do that. It looks like people didn't quite.

332
00:31:30,354 --> 00:31:37,074
Okay. So thoughts on how the sound changed, if at all, when you put the earplug on an.

333
00:31:37,434 --> 00:31:41,244
Uncomfortable, uncomfortable. Okay. Other thoughts?

334
00:31:41,244 --> 00:31:44,543
I mean, and I will say, no matter what I hand out in this class and believe me,

335
00:31:44,544 --> 00:31:50,693
I've tried like 50 different models, there's always someone who's the first hand to say, I hate this implant.

336
00:31:50,694 --> 00:31:54,564
It's uncomfortable, it's painful. So uncomfortable. Not surprising.

337
00:31:54,564 --> 00:31:58,254
In fact, some fraction of you who didn't raise your hand about that probably agree.

338
00:31:58,254 --> 00:32:06,174
I wouldn't wear this. This is really uncomfortable. What other thoughts did you have that I don't think it helped with the sound too much.

339
00:32:06,204 --> 00:32:13,464
Okay. Yeah. So there are types of earplugs called musician's earplugs or flat attenuation

340
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:17,664
earplugs that are truly designed not to change the character of the sound,

341
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:27,053
but just to make it quieter. Most industrial or occupational hearing protectors don't have, let's say, equal attenuation at all frequencies.

342
00:32:27,054 --> 00:32:31,404
And so the sound should get somewhat distorted. Actually, when you put these on, you're wearing them.

343
00:32:31,404 --> 00:32:36,143
Right. But a key and something we would want to train workers on is if you put a

344
00:32:36,144 --> 00:32:40,553
device on a hearing protector in your ears and the sound doesn't change at all,

345
00:32:40,554 --> 00:32:43,554
that's not the protector for you or you're wearing it incorrectly.

346
00:32:43,824 --> 00:32:47,664
Either way, when we put something in our ears, the sound should get quieter one way or another.

347
00:32:48,804 --> 00:32:57,834
That's a great observation. Kristen Jordan, did you I want you to say I agree that I think because they kind of like inflated all the way in my ears.

348
00:32:57,864 --> 00:33:01,464
Yeah, that was it for other people. I wear like earplugs like this.

349
00:33:01,464 --> 00:33:07,274
Too bad, because I was. Are I okay? I like.

350
00:33:07,284 --> 00:33:10,763
No, it'll hold them in my ear. Sure. Yeah.

351
00:33:10,764 --> 00:33:14,544
And so let's let's unpack that a little bit. So I noticed like the first row here,

352
00:33:14,544 --> 00:33:18,504
which are all industrial hygiene students were doing something that many of you towards the

353
00:33:18,504 --> 00:33:22,433
back of the room wouldn't know to do because there's no reason you'd ever know to do this.

354
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:28,914
But let's we'll just jump ahead here to how to actually properly insert an earplug.

355
00:33:28,914 --> 00:33:35,423
And so there's four steps to where, you know, cord or cordless to wear a foam earplug correctly.

356
00:33:35,424 --> 00:33:43,124
So again, it seems simple, but as I said earlier, if people can get this wrong and it's easy to get wrong, some fraction of people are going to.

357
00:33:43,134 --> 00:33:46,704
So the four steps here are first, we want to roll the earplug down.

358
00:33:47,244 --> 00:33:54,113
And so, I mean, we roll it down long ways along its long axis and we get it to be as tight of a cylinder as we possibly can.

359
00:33:54,114 --> 00:33:58,074
So that's step one. Step two here is the one that you would never know.

360
00:33:58,794 --> 00:34:05,304
But the guidance here is you actually reach around behind your head with the opposite hand and you pull up and back on your ear.

361
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:08,354
And the reason for that is your ear canal has a natural bend in it.

362
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:13,254
And when you pull up on your pin, you straighten that bend out and it will be easier to insert this.

363
00:34:13,854 --> 00:34:16,374
The third thing is, of course, we have to push the ear plug in.

364
00:34:16,374 --> 00:34:20,874
And the fourth thing, as Jordan was saying, is we have to wait until this foam expands.

365
00:34:21,744 --> 00:34:24,563
So, you know, to go through the four steps, I've got my rule down.

366
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:35,724
I reach up, pull, reach behind, pull up and back on my ear, slide the hearing protector in, and then I'm going to hold it in place while it expands.

367
00:34:36,264 --> 00:34:41,574
And as I'm talking and as you guys have got this protector expanding your ear,

368
00:34:41,574 --> 00:34:45,264
you should start to notice the character of sound changes a bit in that ear.

369
00:34:45,504 --> 00:34:50,214
Even if the sound doesn't change, you'll start to note, Oh, you know, I'm feeling this pressure in my ear.

370
00:34:50,604 --> 00:34:56,304
Basically, as the foam earplug is getting a grip, for lack of a better word, on your ear canal.

371
00:34:56,754 --> 00:35:00,924
And so depending on the type of foam, these are slow recovery foam earplugs.

372
00:35:01,404 --> 00:35:06,054
These can take between 30 seconds all the way up to 60 seconds to fully expand.

373
00:35:06,864 --> 00:35:12,594
Now, as some of you notice, if you put it in and you don't wait for it to expand all the way, you may feel like,

374
00:35:13,074 --> 00:35:17,483
especially when you first put it in, it's not doing anything well, it's not locking up your whole ear canal.

375
00:35:17,484 --> 00:35:20,514
It's only blocking a portion of it, and all the sound is escaping around that.

376
00:35:20,874 --> 00:35:24,714
But again, you should notice with a properly fit earplug, well inserted,

377
00:35:25,014 --> 00:35:32,094
that you now feel this pressure on your ear canal, but you can also perceive a change in the sound.

378
00:35:32,754 --> 00:35:38,933
So I'm going to have you guys repeat that on your other ear, and I'm going to play this sound again.

379
00:35:38,934 --> 00:35:45,834
And I just want to see if you notice a difference with the four step insertion process compared to the one that you did originally.

380
00:35:45,834 --> 00:35:49,764
So let's go ahead again. That's right.

381
00:35:50,484 --> 00:36:02,454
Let's. What?

382
00:36:14,204 --> 00:36:19,484
All right, so keeping those in, assuming you can hear me, what are your perceptions now,

383
00:36:19,484 --> 00:36:23,204
especially for those of you who didn't know to reach out and behind your head?

384
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:27,914
Does it sound different? Does it feel like it's seeded differently than it was before?

385
00:36:27,944 --> 00:36:31,124
Do you still hate it? Is it still uncomfortable? Thoughts?

386
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:35,404
No, no, it's about uncomfortable. They're definitely better.

387
00:36:35,774 --> 00:36:39,404
I think I've done it, but now I can feel the difference of experience.

388
00:36:40,004 --> 00:36:43,374
So it's like my left. Your head is definitely on more pressure. Sure.

389
00:36:43,394 --> 00:36:48,554
Locking myself in the right place. I didn't feel immediately right. And this is something that comes with practice, too.

390
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:53,774
So, you know, the more you do this, if you've been trained correctly, the better seeding you're going to get over time.

391
00:36:53,894 --> 00:36:59,354
This one is not especially well fitted in my right ear, and I could probably do a better job if I tried it again.

392
00:36:59,774 --> 00:37:03,284
But while you've got your hearing protectors in now, I'll play you this music clip.

393
00:37:03,284 --> 00:37:07,314
And I just want you to sort of think of how the music sounds to you and.

394
00:37:10,044 --> 00:37:24,674
Nirvana, of course. So how did that sound to you with the hearing protectors in.

395
00:37:27,524 --> 00:37:32,654
Yeah. More low, like kind of lower hurts more bass and bass.

396
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:36,614
Not so much treble the Jordan. It's, like, not as crisp like the notes are.

397
00:37:37,034 --> 00:37:39,374
Yeah. So let me play it again.

398
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:44,984
And while it's playing, let me have you remove the hearing protector so you can sort of really get an immediate sense of that.

399
00:37:50,094 --> 00:37:57,284
I'll be. So what you are noticing?

400
00:37:57,284 --> 00:38:00,704
It absolutely is correct. Foam earplugs especially.

401
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:05,354
But all earplugs to some extent tend to block higher frequencies, more than low frequency.

402
00:38:05,374 --> 00:38:10,603
So when you put these in and you go into an environment, it can often sound like you're in a, you know,

403
00:38:10,604 --> 00:38:14,894
a late night bar or something where all you're hearing is bass and the treble is not so distinct.

404
00:38:15,254 --> 00:38:18,073
So that's just a feature of how these products are designed.

405
00:38:18,074 --> 00:38:24,013
It's not a flaw, per se, but these are not necessarily ear plugs that you're going to get to go enjoy a concert with,

406
00:38:24,014 --> 00:38:28,754
because, again, you're getting that distortion. And I bring this up because there are these musicians.

407
00:38:28,754 --> 00:38:30,794
Ear plugs are flat attenuation earplugs.

408
00:38:31,124 --> 00:38:36,013
They're designed to lower the noise, but lower it equally across the frequency so you don't get that distortion.

409
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:41,384
And you hear the bass just as sort of clearly as you did without the hearing protection.

410
00:38:42,074 --> 00:38:47,564
Hearing protection on excuse me. So let's just talk about foam earplugs a little bit more.

411
00:38:48,044 --> 00:38:51,734
Again, these are called roll down earplugs by some folks.

412
00:38:51,734 --> 00:38:55,873
And the idea here is basically we're rolling down this slow recovery foam.

413
00:38:55,874 --> 00:39:01,574
We're putting it in our ears. It's expanding. It's creating basically a pressure seal against our ears.

414
00:39:01,994 --> 00:39:05,684
Now, there are some pros to these particular products.

415
00:39:06,074 --> 00:39:12,433
Some people find these to be incredibly comfortable, and we'll wear them all day long and not think twice about it.

416
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:16,274
Others, as we heard Anderson say, not not such being fans totally expected.

417
00:39:17,144 --> 00:39:21,974
You know, this gets marketed as a pro by manufacturers, like they're disposable.

418
00:39:22,334 --> 00:39:28,513
Like, well, from a sustainability perspective, if you've got your workforce going through three or four pairs of these a day,

419
00:39:28,514 --> 00:39:31,574
which I have seen happen, that's creating a huge amount of waste.

420
00:39:32,354 --> 00:39:37,874
But if you've got workers who are working in very filthy environments and they're hearing protectors get dirty again,

421
00:39:37,874 --> 00:39:42,134
they can discard them and get a fresh pair, that can be a real advantage there.

422
00:39:42,824 --> 00:39:45,343
Now, the disadvantages to these types of protectors,

423
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:52,364
they are the very hardest type of hearing protector and maybe type of protection period to wear correctly.

424
00:39:52,364 --> 00:39:52,634
Again,

425
00:39:52,634 --> 00:40:01,543
that that for steps that we need to do but most people would never do unless you prompted them to really make a huge difference in their filter.

426
00:40:01,544 --> 00:40:07,544
You get also a highlight. You are touching the part, the foam that goes into your ear.

427
00:40:07,544 --> 00:40:10,964
So if you are a sewage worker or some other worker, you know,

428
00:40:10,964 --> 00:40:17,714
if you're a cement worker and your hands are really dirty or maybe had infectious material on that, you don't want to be putting that in your ear.

429
00:40:17,984 --> 00:40:26,353
I will say there has never been a recorded case of an ear infection stemming from a hearing protector in the published literature,

430
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:35,984
but still, you know. GROSS I'll also say not all ear canals can be fit by the standard foam earplugs that we just tried on.

431
00:40:35,984 --> 00:40:43,693
So I will tell you, when I was working in Washington state, I did a lot of work with the logging industry, and it was a primarily male industry.

432
00:40:43,694 --> 00:40:47,444
And like the shortest person was about seven feet tall, just huge people.

433
00:40:47,774 --> 00:40:51,794
And they would take an uncompressed foam earplug and just pop it in and out of their ear.

434
00:40:51,794 --> 00:40:55,514
Their ear canal was like this big. So this is never going to do the trick for them.

435
00:40:55,934 --> 00:41:01,544
On the flip side, I have seen many people of more petite stature who have really tiny ear canals,

436
00:41:01,544 --> 00:41:05,504
and no matter how much you roll this down, you're never going to get it small enough to get it into their ear.

437
00:41:06,074 --> 00:41:10,664
So these are one size fits most, but not one size fits all.

438
00:41:11,774 --> 00:41:14,624
One other thing that makes these very appealing to, again,

439
00:41:14,624 --> 00:41:20,714
the people who purchase ear plugs is the way that we measure attenuation in the United States, which we'll talk about later.

440
00:41:21,014 --> 00:41:24,644
These come up with the highest possible attenuation.

441
00:41:24,644 --> 00:41:30,284
So if worn correctly and tested in a laboratory environment, we'll go into all this a little bit more detail.

442
00:41:31,064 --> 00:41:33,674
These can block the most sound of any type of protection,

443
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:39,644
but they're so hard to wear that you're not guaranteed that your workers are actually going to get that degree of protection.

444
00:41:41,234 --> 00:41:46,424
So any any questions or comments, thoughts about these foam earplugs.

445
00:41:51,654 --> 00:41:58,854
And the four step method, whatever Tom Moore at that point is many times before firing ranges or whatever.

446
00:41:58,884 --> 00:42:03,084
Sure. And nobody told me to do this. And it makes a difference, right?

447
00:42:03,474 --> 00:42:05,543
I mean, if you try it on first and then try it on.

448
00:42:05,544 --> 00:42:10,574
Right, as we all did again, some of you may have done this before and you and you'd been trained properly.

449
00:42:10,574 --> 00:42:13,793
You didn't know this difference. But it does make a huge difference.

450
00:42:13,794 --> 00:42:18,173
And I'll say, like, if you were buying these on the consumer market,

451
00:42:18,174 --> 00:42:22,914
if you just went out and bought yourself a hearing protector, how would you know to do that four step rule?

452
00:42:22,924 --> 00:42:28,554
I mean, is it on the packaging? It actually is on the corded one.

453
00:42:29,064 --> 00:42:35,183
It's not on the one without cords. So, you know, you are all a very educated crowd.

454
00:42:35,184 --> 00:42:38,664
You're not really a representative cross-section of America intellectually.

455
00:42:38,664 --> 00:42:43,673
But, you know, I think most of you probably miss the fact that there's this silly little but

456
00:42:43,674 --> 00:42:47,514
actually pretty useful diagram on the packaging here for how to wear them correctly.

457
00:42:48,504 --> 00:42:54,264
And if it wasn't, there it is on the box typically where where you as a worker would go to get your hearing protector.

458
00:42:55,464 --> 00:43:00,834
Okay. So let's switch gears now and we'll focus now on the tri flange earplug.

459
00:43:00,834 --> 00:43:06,683
So what we have here is, as I said, a pre molded earplugs.

460
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:10,254
If you open this up again, these come in corded. They also come cordless.

461
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:16,494
And the difference here is basically now we've got, as I mentioned earlier,

462
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:24,084
we've got some material on the end that we stick in their ear that provides attenuation and we've got this plastic stand that we actually hold on to.

463
00:43:24,774 --> 00:43:33,204
So let's do the same thing with these ear plugs. I'm going to play the the white noise and let me have you do the the insertion

464
00:43:33,204 --> 00:43:38,454
technique and sort of see how the sound changes as you put these on each.

465
00:44:03,614 --> 00:44:24,714
But more. Okay. That that first time I got the second earplug in right as the sound cut off.

466
00:44:24,714 --> 00:44:29,574
And I was like, Damn, these were really well, I can't hear anything anymore. So you can take yourself out with these two.

467
00:44:30,474 --> 00:44:37,284
So thoughts about these once you got them in, did you notice the sound changing when you got these installed?

468
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:43,134
How did it feel compared to the phone? How many of you thought they blacks more sound maybe than the phone did?

469
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:53,724
And I'll raise my hand because that was true for me and everybody else think that these blacks less or anybody feel like they were exactly the same.

470
00:44:54,894 --> 00:45:00,744
I'm sorry. Okay. Yeah. So, again, the convenience factor, you know, if I said,

471
00:45:00,804 --> 00:45:05,544
why do you got to run into this room and get your hearing protection on right now and you can't even get the bag open?

472
00:45:06,174 --> 00:45:09,834
That's not very convenient or you can't get the cord dealt with and so forth.

473
00:45:11,004 --> 00:45:14,783
So question for you, how many of you liked the feel of this?

474
00:45:14,784 --> 00:45:18,504
Better than the phone and here plug, you know, I'll raise my hand to. That's true for me.

475
00:45:18,534 --> 00:45:22,794
Okay. So about half of you again, totally expected mixed results here.

476
00:45:22,794 --> 00:45:28,734
Some of you, if you were workers, would try this on and be like, wow, where was this ten years ago when people were working?

477
00:45:28,734 --> 00:45:30,803
We making you wear something super uncomfortable?

478
00:45:30,804 --> 00:45:35,454
And others would say, I cannot imagine wearing this for any amount of time during the day because it's horrible.

479
00:45:36,084 --> 00:45:42,534
So I'll say with regards to pre molded earplugs, there's a bunch of different shapes and styles of these.

480
00:45:43,044 --> 00:45:46,613
You know, the nice thing about these, again, there's no roll down needed.

481
00:45:46,614 --> 00:45:48,054
So once you've got it in your ear,

482
00:45:48,054 --> 00:45:54,384
you don't have to stand there and hold it in place while it expands because it's seated essentially not by pressure,

483
00:45:54,804 --> 00:46:00,504
but just by sealing your ear canal. There's a pneumatic seal there, good things about them.

484
00:46:00,504 --> 00:46:06,944
So these tend to be much easier to insert. We basically have three of the four steps that we have to do for foam, but we don't do it again.

485
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:11,543
Stand there and wait for the foam to expand. These also come in different sizes.

486
00:46:11,544 --> 00:46:17,664
So these will typically be a small, medium, large. Increasingly, foam plugs are coming with that same sizing option.

487
00:46:17,664 --> 00:46:18,714
That's all good news.

488
00:46:20,124 --> 00:46:26,994
If I've got workers who are working in a very dirty environment, again, they don't touch the part of the earplug that goes into their ear canal.

489
00:46:26,994 --> 00:46:33,323
So it's okay to use these with dirty hands. These are also disposable, if you like.

490
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:38,844
But I've had workers wear these for weeks on end with no sort of apparent degradation at all.

491
00:46:39,114 --> 00:46:46,614
I'd say a couple of months of these. It's probably time for a new pair because the material will start to sort of degrade and deform.

492
00:46:48,174 --> 00:46:51,504
You know, I should have said about foam earplugs, those are disposable.

493
00:46:51,504 --> 00:46:55,463
You can wear those for up to a week or two. I actually had a worker.

494
00:46:55,464 --> 00:46:58,704
This is one of the most horrible things I've seen in the workplace. So of course, I'm going to share it.

495
00:46:59,844 --> 00:47:04,584
This this person was like, oh, yeah, I got one of your plugs here, digs him out of his pocket.

496
00:47:04,584 --> 00:47:12,584
They are just encrusted with earwax and it pops him in his mouth and it sucks that earwax on it looks like he was like, who praise you on that?

497
00:47:12,594 --> 00:47:17,814
That's the worst thing I've ever heard. Earwax is not infectious.

498
00:47:17,814 --> 00:47:20,874
It's just gross. But it's not going to hurt you.

499
00:47:21,294 --> 00:47:24,864
But just do it. Get a new pair. Hey, it's fine. There are $0.02.

500
00:47:25,284 --> 00:47:32,244
And the other thing I'll mention here, and these do come in a bunch of different shapes and styles, I find that this kind,

501
00:47:32,244 --> 00:47:36,773
with the rounded flanges on the end, like the lower right corner, tend to be much more comfortable.

502
00:47:36,774 --> 00:47:39,804
There's the Christmas tree variety, as you can see here.

503
00:47:40,164 --> 00:47:45,953
And some of them may have three flanges, some of them may have four. But these look that look more like a threaded screw,

504
00:47:45,954 --> 00:47:52,194
I think tends to put a little more pressure on a smaller area in your ear canal, and that can get more uncomfortable faster.

505
00:47:52,554 --> 00:47:58,673
But again, that's a personal preference. I've certainly known people who were like, Oh yeah, this is the only thing I wear now.

506
00:47:58,674 --> 00:48:07,974
Bad things about this type of product. Some people, due to the shape and geometry of their ear canal, will not be able to get a good fit with these.

507
00:48:07,974 --> 00:48:12,293
Again, they're kind of depending on that pneumatic seal against a part of your ear canal.

508
00:48:12,294 --> 00:48:20,334
If you if your ear canal is shaped irregularly or you have sort of a pocket or a little channel in your ear canal,

509
00:48:20,334 --> 00:48:26,484
the sounds just going to go right around the protector. That's not good. And again, some people find these to be terrifically uncomfortable.

510
00:48:26,574 --> 00:48:33,593
As I said, this is one of my favorite kinds, but that's just me. And compared to foam earplugs, the way we test ear plugs,

511
00:48:33,594 --> 00:48:40,404
these tend to have sort of on the lower to maybe moderate end of the attenuation scale, which we'll talk about in a little bit.

512
00:48:41,964 --> 00:48:47,394
Similarly, inserts I ran out of. So we're not going to we're not going to focus on trying those on.

513
00:48:47,394 --> 00:48:55,074
But I'll make a few comments about these. So, you know, a pair of foam ear plugs might be $0.02 a pair if you buy them in bulk.

514
00:48:55,494 --> 00:48:58,854
These pre molded might be like $0.30 a pair if you buy them in bulk.

515
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:03,234
Semi-formal inserts here are more on the order of like 5 to $6.

516
00:49:03,894 --> 00:49:07,494
So they're they're more expensive. The idea here is, again,

517
00:49:07,494 --> 00:49:11,453
they've got a band that provides some pressure and then on the end of the band is

518
00:49:11,454 --> 00:49:17,124
basically a little ear tip and that gets pressed into your ear canal by the pressure.

519
00:49:17,274 --> 00:49:23,034
Of the band. So I have run into, I'll say less folks who really like these.

520
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:26,723
They're great for intermittent noise because you literally just pop them on and pop

521
00:49:26,724 --> 00:49:29,904
them back off and they just live around your neck when you're not wearing them.

522
00:49:30,414 --> 00:49:35,724
You can actually put the band below your neck or behind your head, depending on your preference.

523
00:49:36,564 --> 00:49:41,814
And again, you're not touching the part that goes in your ear here. So dirty hands is not an issue with these.

524
00:49:42,894 --> 00:49:48,444
I will say these, I think, tend to be the hardest type of protector to get a good seal on.

525
00:49:49,164 --> 00:49:53,723
I mean, especially with a tapered tip like this, it's just really hard to get it seated.

526
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:58,013
Right. Other people will complain are the band is like squeezing on my head.

527
00:49:58,014 --> 00:50:04,404
It's forcing these things into my brain that's not very comfortable. And then what I think is the absolute worst about these.

528
00:50:04,404 --> 00:50:10,134
So if you've ever had something in your ears and maybe you can simulate it here a little bit with that with the corded earplug,

529
00:50:10,614 --> 00:50:15,144
but the band typically gets worn behind your head, so it's resting basically against your collar.

530
00:50:15,144 --> 00:50:21,383
Every time you move your head back and forth, the band slides on your collar and all that sound gets transmitted in your ear.

531
00:50:21,384 --> 00:50:24,773
So all you hear all day is the sound of your hearing protector rubbing.

532
00:50:24,774 --> 00:50:26,994
And course that drives me insane.

533
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:35,394
Again, it's not a hard drive for me, but a lot of folks just object to that and it's not comfortable or kind of tenable to wear that.

534
00:50:36,234 --> 00:50:40,044
But for folks who love these, great, you know, this is the right protector for them.

535
00:50:40,524 --> 00:50:45,144
And again, these tend to be on the lower to moderate end of the attenuation scale.

536
00:50:45,864 --> 00:50:49,694
All right. Now, everybody should have a pair of earmuffs except in here.

537
00:50:50,164 --> 00:50:54,803
I'm sorry. So last thing to come to your maps and let's do the same thing.

538
00:50:54,804 --> 00:51:00,174
I'll play the sound, and you can all put the earmuffs on and sort of perceive how the sound changes.

539
00:51:13,034 --> 00:51:16,304
And then maybe I'll play it again and you can take them off while it's playing.

540
00:51:27,434 --> 00:51:35,264
All right. So thoughts on these at least seem to provide more protection than the phones, more than either the prior two, you think?

541
00:51:35,414 --> 00:51:40,544
Okay, I'm getting some head nods on that. Anybody think these provided less for them?

542
00:51:41,144 --> 00:51:43,564
I will say my my ear pieces on my glasses.

543
00:51:43,574 --> 00:51:49,664
I never think of them as sticking out very far, but I could definitely sense that there was a break in the seal of the argument for me.

544
00:51:49,994 --> 00:51:53,084
So these actually didn't feel like they provided as much as the premotor.

545
00:51:53,094 --> 00:51:58,724
But again, that's that's me. That's my my personal condition. This is why it's so critical to provide a selection.

546
00:51:59,624 --> 00:52:03,763
Now, everybody, just hold your earmuffs up so folks can see them.

547
00:52:03,764 --> 00:52:07,484
You will see there are you know, there's like 350 types of hearing protectors on the market.

548
00:52:07,484 --> 00:52:11,294
And I feel like 349 of them are earmuffs. There's so many different kinds.

549
00:52:11,594 --> 00:52:15,614
There's high visibility like Andy has here in in the back.

550
00:52:15,764 --> 00:52:23,414
So sorry, I'm blanking on your name. Jenna. Yes. And Jenna has in fact, too, there are times that are relatively low profile.

551
00:52:23,414 --> 00:52:29,734
They had a smaller ear cup. So if you're trying to get into tight spaces, you don't have a huge ear cut bumping into things.

552
00:52:30,104 --> 00:52:36,854
There are several here. In fact, I'll just grab a pair right here that have bands that are actually designed not to go over your head but

553
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:45,164
sort of be low profile behind your head to Burnley has a pair that has an American radio built into it.

554
00:52:45,164 --> 00:52:48,524
And so here, if your workers have a horrible job.

555
00:52:49,874 --> 00:52:58,034
Yeah, and, and you want them to be able to listen to music or you want them to be able to listen to their radio, they can put in that sound.

556
00:52:59,054 --> 00:53:07,784
Burnley's also actually have electronic amplification so she can adjust the sort of input volume there.

557
00:53:08,234 --> 00:53:12,193
And you can see there's two microphones on the exterior there.

558
00:53:12,194 --> 00:53:18,704
They're listening for sound. So she can basically tune the sound and make it louder when the ambient sound is quieter.

559
00:53:18,704 --> 00:53:20,354
So they're acting like the hearing aid.

560
00:53:20,594 --> 00:53:28,004
And again, they're going to cut out at about 83 decibels if anybody else got an amplifying pinger like there's a black pair floating around,

561
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:31,904
maybe somewhere in the back, that is. Yeah, I've lost track.

562
00:53:34,274 --> 00:53:39,284
I think those are just. Oh, no, those, those are amplifying as well. So, you know, you can get radio access.

563
00:53:39,464 --> 00:53:44,773
A big concern for people in sort of production management positions is not going to be on the

564
00:53:44,774 --> 00:53:49,964
radio all day long and I can't be taking my earmuffs on and off every time I'm on the radio.

565
00:53:49,964 --> 00:53:55,513
So again, if you just put the radio directly into the earmuffs and the speakers in there play the radio

566
00:53:55,514 --> 00:54:00,854
at a safe volume while your ears are protected from the ambient sound that's outstanding.

567
00:54:01,514 --> 00:54:08,804
So lots of different options with earmuffs. These can tend to cost, you know, between, say, 12 and $15 if you buy them in bulk.

568
00:54:09,284 --> 00:54:15,984
The electronic amplifying ones can be much, much more expensive than that, you know, $100 plus, you know,

569
00:54:16,004 --> 00:54:20,024
if you want to trade earmuffs with your neighbor and see if their pair is more comfortable, that's totally cool.

570
00:54:21,164 --> 00:54:26,834
So just kind of, again, reiterating with the earmuffs here, these are the absolute easiest to use.

571
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:31,914
So it's it's sort of difficult to wear an earmuffs incorrectly if it's, you know,

572
00:54:31,934 --> 00:54:36,343
if it's on and your ear is obviously not covered and this is not working correctly.

573
00:54:36,344 --> 00:54:41,894
If your ear is covered with the exception of glasses, you can sort of assume they're getting a good seal.

574
00:54:43,034 --> 00:54:45,284
These again, are great for intermittent noise.

575
00:54:45,284 --> 00:54:50,923
If you just have a pair lying around and you know you're running into a noisy area, you put them on takes, you know, a moment.

576
00:54:50,924 --> 00:54:57,104
There's none of the reaching up and behind your head stuff and then you take them off just as fast they were usable.

577
00:54:57,104 --> 00:55:01,904
These can last for months and if you have a pair you really like, you can actually order replacement cushions.

578
00:55:01,904 --> 00:55:10,334
These will break down eventually. And as I said, some of these can have amplification and maybe also communication ability in there.

579
00:55:10,334 --> 00:55:15,103
Jordan, do you have a question? Yeah, because I know goggles modified for glasses.

580
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:21,944
Are there any earmuffs that are modified? So there's a couple of ways to get around that.

581
00:55:21,954 --> 00:55:28,093
So one is to try to get safety glasses that have very slender or narrow earpieces so they sort of slip,

582
00:55:28,094 --> 00:55:33,254
they fit flush against your head and the cushion doesn't have to deform as much to accommodate them.

583
00:55:33,614 --> 00:55:42,644
That's maybe the easiest fix. There are setups that actually have earmuffs with safety glasses attached to them, and they're totally Rube Goldberg.

584
00:55:42,644 --> 00:55:47,414
They break immediately, but you can buy them if you want them. And it is a possibility.

585
00:55:47,774 --> 00:55:52,603
There's also hardhat setups that will have built in your mouse and built in eyeglasses.

586
00:55:52,604 --> 00:56:01,574
Those tend to work a little bit better. But again, if you've got somebody who really needs a pair of eyeglasses that have very thick earpieces,

587
00:56:01,814 --> 00:56:05,804
earmuffs are just probably not the right option for that particular individual.

588
00:56:06,014 --> 00:56:12,134
Good question. Bad things about earmuffs so they can be super comfortable to wear again.

589
00:56:12,134 --> 00:56:18,134
They're easy to put on and take off. But if you're working on a road crew in Louisiana in the middle of the summer,

590
00:56:18,614 --> 00:56:22,843
near hot asphalt, it's going to be like 7 million degrees inside these things.

591
00:56:22,844 --> 00:56:25,694
In 100% humidity. They will be very, very uncomfortable.

592
00:56:26,124 --> 00:56:32,184
The other hand, if you're working in like North Dakota in the winter where the wind is constantly blowing, these can be great.

593
00:56:32,194 --> 00:56:41,064
Not only you protecting your ears, but keeping them warm too. These also tend to have kind of on the moderate to high level of attenuation.

594
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:50,184
I'll also highlight here. So I don't mean to pick on Bose, but they were sort of the leaders into the market of active noise canceling headsets,

595
00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:58,524
which are very commonly used in aviation, both for for pilots, for instance, who have commercial grade, but also people flying around on airplanes.

596
00:56:58,854 --> 00:57:02,424
If they have enough money, they may have a pair of active noise cancellation headsets.

597
00:57:02,994 --> 00:57:07,103
These are not okay in the workplace, is hearing protection not because they don't work,

598
00:57:07,104 --> 00:57:14,664
but because the way we test hearing protection in the United States was set back in 1979 before this stuff existed.

599
00:57:15,294 --> 00:57:19,254
So literally the reason we can't use this for hearing protection is the test we use

600
00:57:19,254 --> 00:57:23,544
to sort of validate how well hearing protectors work can handle this technology.

601
00:57:24,324 --> 00:57:32,364
And as I think I mentioned previously, and I'm sure I mentioned this there the EPA Office of Noise Abatement and Control NAC,

602
00:57:32,784 --> 00:57:35,934
which was in place from 1971 to 1981,

603
00:57:36,264 --> 00:57:42,684
is the office that actually passed that noise reduction standard for how we measure these things in the laboratory.

604
00:57:42,984 --> 00:57:49,704
And then they were defunded by the Reagan administration in 1981 and one of their very first sort of executive acts.

605
00:57:50,274 --> 00:57:56,183
And so it's very interesting because the law is still on the books and EPA had a half

606
00:57:56,184 --> 00:58:01,104
time employee working in the Office of Noise Abatement and Control for like 30 years.

607
00:58:01,104 --> 00:58:04,494
And I met this guy at a conference and he was easily 140 years old.

608
00:58:05,844 --> 00:58:11,004
And he's like, any day now we're going to get this revised standard through. And then, of course, he died because 140.

609
00:58:11,004 --> 00:58:20,934
And so we're still stuck with this 1979 standard. So this is just sort of a case study in and bureaucratic resistance to change, I suppose.

610
00:58:21,654 --> 00:58:26,094
Now, if the EPA were to refund their Office of Noise Abatement and Control and actually stamp it,

611
00:58:26,874 --> 00:58:29,634
I think this would be one of the first things they would do is let's come up with

612
00:58:29,634 --> 00:58:33,264
a test for hearing protectors that actually accounts for modern technology,

613
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:39,474
but we're not there yet. And then the last thing I'll mention here, and I don't have any of these too to hand out,

614
00:58:40,134 --> 00:58:44,453
but custom molded earplugs are a little bit of a different beast.

615
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:46,374
So these create a pressure seal,

616
00:58:46,614 --> 00:58:53,484
and the way they're created is essentially you get a trained technician who squirts some medical grade silicone into your ear,

617
00:58:53,994 --> 00:59:00,384
and then they let it cure in there. And then when they pull that silicone out, it is in the shape of your ear canal.

618
00:59:00,684 --> 00:59:05,574
And it can be, you know, cleaned up a little bit. So it doesn't just look like a glob of silicone in your ear.

619
00:59:05,874 --> 00:59:11,544
And they can do fancy things, like, for instance, drilling a port through the hearing protector.

620
00:59:11,544 --> 00:59:15,984
And you might think, well, why would I ever put a hole to my hearing protector? That's kind of defeating the purpose.

621
00:59:16,284 --> 00:59:22,884
True. But if you then have a filter that you can put into that hole and maybe a range of filters,

622
00:59:22,884 --> 00:59:27,924
so at least one manufacturer does this and they sell three or four different types of filters,

623
00:59:28,194 --> 00:59:32,034
meaning you can customize the amount of protection you get from this device.

624
00:59:32,034 --> 00:59:39,924
You put in the green filter that's letting the most sound in. You put in the red filter, that's like stopping as much sound as we possibly can.

625
00:59:40,434 --> 00:59:46,644
So pretty cool devices. Again, they're expensive, but they're really well received by employees.

626
00:59:46,644 --> 00:59:49,973
So an employee, when you hand them a two cent pair of earplugs is like, Oh,

627
00:59:49,974 --> 00:59:53,304
God, thanks for going out of your way to protect my hearing, which is $0.02.

628
00:59:54,024 --> 01:00:01,524
But when you hand them a pair of hundred and $50 protectors and you inform them, nobody else can use this, this is totally customized to you.

629
01:00:02,454 --> 01:00:06,984
People tend to also find that these are more comfortable and sort of more,

630
01:00:06,984 --> 01:00:10,554
you know, wear it and forget it type operation than some of the other protectors.

631
01:00:10,884 --> 01:00:16,343
Employees love that. So this may not be well, it is absolutely not the cheapest type of protector.

632
01:00:16,344 --> 01:00:21,324
It's often the most expensive. But in the long run, if people actually wear it and they like it,

633
01:00:21,654 --> 01:00:27,053
it may in fact be the cheapest compared to throwing out four sets of foam earplugs every day.

634
01:00:27,054 --> 01:00:34,704
And it's kind of good, which I just want to confirm, because shortly after work the foam was not yours.

635
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:39,714
Started hurting thanks to the noise start your ears started hurting.

636
01:00:40,044 --> 01:00:46,584
Hurting. Okay. Years later, as the noise from airplanes started appearing and I do interesting.

637
01:00:47,034 --> 01:00:53,394
So with foam earplugs when you insert them you are creating a bit of a pressure seal inside.

638
01:00:53,394 --> 01:01:01,824
If you you're the earplugs out very quickly you might get some deformation of your eardrum, which can be temporarily quite painful.

639
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:05,123
This should resolve very quickly, but that's a great point.

640
01:01:05,124 --> 01:01:10,794
Again, another issue with that type of device that you might not find with others, you certainly wouldn't find it in your mouth, for instance.

641
01:01:11,514 --> 01:01:15,864
But yeah, let me know if that doesn't go away soon. That's not expected.

642
01:01:15,864 --> 01:01:20,244
Let's put it that way. Tell me the question.

643
01:01:20,244 --> 01:01:25,854
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, that's the material have. It's medical grade silicone.

644
01:01:25,924 --> 01:01:29,344
So it's the same type of thing. They would make other sort of prosthetics out of.

645
01:01:29,464 --> 01:01:33,814
So it's not going to bother your skin. It is hypoallergenic.

646
01:01:35,464 --> 01:01:39,034
There's a reason they cost $150 a pair. They put a lot of money into that.

647
01:01:39,334 --> 01:01:42,393
The other thing is, of course, you want somebody trained doing this.

648
01:01:42,394 --> 01:01:48,664
So I went to a plant. They're like, Oh yeah, we have these DIY, custom molded ear plugs that we bought a kit for.

649
01:01:48,664 --> 01:01:51,963
And I was like, Well, what kind of training do you got? They're like, Well, there's instructions.

650
01:01:51,964 --> 01:01:56,254
Like written instructions are like, Oh my God, because you are squirting stuff into someone's ear canal.

651
01:01:56,254 --> 01:02:01,684
And if that silicone were to harden in contact with the eardrum, that would be exquisitely painful.

652
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:10,054
So, you know, a well-trained filter is going to put a dam in essentially to make sure the silicone doesn't go in too far into your ear.

653
01:02:10,984 --> 01:02:14,374
Another just random factoid since we're on the topic.

654
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:17,734
And so remember your ear canal has a bend.

655
01:02:18,214 --> 01:02:24,334
So for commercial applications, they will put silicone in up until that bend and then they put a dam in.

656
01:02:24,904 --> 01:02:28,964
If you're in the military where you've got these super extreme exposures, they actually want to go there.

657
01:02:29,044 --> 01:02:35,974
In fact, a small second bend in your ear canal and they will go super deep and almost everybody throws up when they get this stuff,

658
01:02:35,974 --> 01:02:44,283
put it super deep into their ear canal. Just again, if you're ever offered a deep, custom molded earplug fitting,

659
01:02:44,284 --> 01:02:47,824
just think about the possible ramifications you will throw up almost certainly.

660
01:02:48,934 --> 01:02:55,294
And then again, when we compare these to the other types of devices, these are sort of in the moderate range of attenuation.

661
01:02:57,154 --> 01:03:01,294
So let me just cover this one last slide and then we'll take a break. And it were a few minutes over here.

662
01:03:02,284 --> 01:03:12,244
If you are in extreme levels of noise, you might not be sufficiently protected with just in earplug or in your mouth.

663
01:03:12,694 --> 01:03:20,054
And so in that case, you might employ what's called dual protection, meaning you're wearing an earplug and then an earmuffs on top of that.

664
01:03:21,784 --> 01:03:24,423
Now, this is truly for extreme exposure,

665
01:03:24,424 --> 01:03:31,624
so we don't recommend this if you're TWD is less than 105 decibels and there are very few jobs that have a TWD greater than that.

666
01:03:31,984 --> 01:03:35,404
But again, if you're just getting hammered with noise, this is an option for us.

667
01:03:36,154 --> 01:03:41,224
This tends to be especially useful if you've got a lot of sort of low frequency energy,

668
01:03:41,554 --> 01:03:48,694
because the combination of earplugs and earmuffs do pretty darn well at those low frequencies, much better than either of them alone.

669
01:03:50,254 --> 01:03:52,143
Now, I'll mention a couple of things here.

670
01:03:52,144 --> 01:03:59,943
So the total attenuation here, if I put on a 20 decibel earmuffs and a 20 decibels earplug, I don't get 40 decibels of protection.

671
01:03:59,944 --> 01:04:08,074
We're still in decibel math here. The rule of thumb is you basically take the more protective protector and you add five decibels to that.

672
01:04:08,074 --> 01:04:15,963
So if my ear muff blocks 20 and my earplug blocks 15, I would say I'm going to take that 20 and just pump it up another five.

673
01:04:15,964 --> 01:04:18,604
That's my estimate for how much protection I get.

674
01:04:18,634 --> 01:04:27,004
Now, the second thing I'll mention is I was at a refinery in northwestern Washington state when they were doing a turnaround.

675
01:04:27,424 --> 01:04:31,384
So turnarounds, when they shut down the whole refinery, they fix it up, takes about six weeks,

676
01:04:31,744 --> 01:04:35,734
like a massive overhaul of the facility and involves some really noisy work.

677
01:04:36,274 --> 01:04:39,843
And so I was talking to one of the contract crews there and I was like, Well,

678
01:04:39,844 --> 01:04:45,484
what are the noise levels like when you're in that tank with your needle gun just getting all the scale off and they're like, Oh, it's crazy loud.

679
01:04:45,484 --> 01:04:49,443
We were double protection and looking around and like, Well, what? Where are your your earmuffs?

680
01:04:49,444 --> 01:04:52,864
They're like, You don't need earmuffs for double protection. I was like, Tell me more.

681
01:04:53,284 --> 01:04:57,183
So they whip out a hearing protector.

682
01:04:57,184 --> 01:05:03,304
Let's see, they whip out a foam plug. And this one guy showing me and so he rolls this thing down and sticks in his

683
01:05:03,304 --> 01:05:07,953
ear and he gets a pencil and he shoves it as far in there as he can get it.

684
01:05:07,954 --> 01:05:14,584
And then he puts a second one in behind it. And I was like, dude, again, lost training opportunity here.

685
01:05:14,764 --> 01:05:17,284
And then I was like, Well, how do you get that out there? Like, Oh, it's no problem.

686
01:05:17,284 --> 01:05:22,773
And he fishes out this paperclip that you spent with this little retrieval thing in the air.

687
01:05:22,774 --> 01:05:27,724
And I was like, You guys are so lucky I'm not with OSHA because he would be in trouble right now.

688
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:31,384
So that's double protection again in earplug plus in your mouth.

689
01:05:32,584 --> 01:05:40,923
All right. I've got 11 after. Let's take our five minute break, be back in here at 116 and we'll learn a little bit more about it during production.

690
01:05:40,924 --> 01:05:44,824
So thanks, everybody. Yeah.

691
01:05:48,335 --> 01:05:52,165
And they use. Yeah. Like, that's how that is.

692
01:05:52,165 --> 01:05:57,504
And that is always good. All right, let's dive back in here.

693
01:05:57,505 --> 01:06:00,565
I want to make sure we have time for our our end of class activity.

694
01:06:00,565 --> 01:06:02,475
We're we're going to measure our empathy levels.

695
01:06:03,055 --> 01:06:11,485
And so, as you might expect, anytime you've got people in personal protective equipment and I've said this many times already,

696
01:06:11,785 --> 01:06:15,235
some fraction of people will figure out a way to wear it improperly.

697
01:06:15,235 --> 01:06:18,145
And I give this example, which sounds made up, but it's not.

698
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:26,274
I had a lot of interesting hearing protection stories from Washington State, so I was up with a tour of a pulp and paper mill.

699
01:06:26,275 --> 01:06:31,254
And so if any of you have ever been near a pulp and paper mill, they put out a tremendous amount of sulfur dioxide.

700
01:06:31,255 --> 01:06:37,975
They smell like rotten eggs. And so I've been on this tour like four or five times in grad school, and afterwards I'm now a chaperon.

701
01:06:38,275 --> 01:06:46,375
So we're standing in kind of their their welcome area. And it's me and a bunch of students and the safety person basically walks in with a big

702
01:06:46,375 --> 01:06:52,045
armful of earplugs and just starts spraying like you put this up pretty solid and then says,

703
01:06:52,045 --> 01:06:56,334
I got to go get your paperwork. I'll be right back. And so I'm I'm standing there. I've been to this tour several times.

704
01:06:56,335 --> 01:07:00,355
I'm looking at a picture on the wall, and I turn around and I see this.

705
01:07:00,775 --> 01:07:04,645
Some of our graduate students have put these in their noses to block the smell.

706
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:08,635
And I'm like, you know, he never said they were for hearing. So okay.

707
01:07:09,385 --> 01:07:15,325
So again, if if people can wear this stuff wrong and they will always find a way to they're going to wear it wrong.

708
01:07:15,325 --> 01:07:18,505
And our job is to make sure that we catch them when that happens.

709
01:07:19,195 --> 01:07:21,985
So there's a couple of ways we can do this. One is visibility.

710
01:07:22,645 --> 01:07:31,375
So if we have a person with a very well fit foam roll down earplug, that earplug really should be visible from the side.

711
01:07:31,465 --> 01:07:38,334
And that's why most of them are such brightly colored devices. So you can see them, but from the front it should really be flush with the tray.

712
01:07:38,335 --> 01:07:42,565
Just hear the little part of your ear that sticks out so they can be very difficult to see from the front.

713
01:07:42,865 --> 01:07:50,965
The deeper in it is, the better the seal you've gotten. You also should absolutely train people to do what's called the tug test.

714
01:07:50,965 --> 01:07:54,534
So once you've got this plug in, you should be able to pull on it lightly.

715
01:07:54,535 --> 01:07:57,895
And if it just springs out of your ear, it's not in there very well.

716
01:07:57,895 --> 01:08:04,555
And I can't tell you how many times I've walked around construction sites, especially because they're just notorious for for not getting any training.

717
01:08:04,825 --> 01:08:06,624
And you'll see people wearing their plugs like this.

718
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:13,584
This is truly blocking those sound or they'll have it in sideways like this or they'll have cut it like 90% off.

719
01:08:13,585 --> 01:08:19,375
So there's just the tiny little end and they'll just have that end fit in their ear looking like it's it's really in there.

720
01:08:19,765 --> 01:08:24,655
All those are signs of a bad hearing conservation program, an opportunity for retraining.

721
01:08:26,095 --> 01:08:27,535
The other thing is the Audibility test.

722
01:08:27,535 --> 01:08:34,345
So all of you, when you were trying on your hearing, protectors noticed, at least for one of them, hey, the sound change, that's a good thing.

723
01:08:34,585 --> 01:08:40,975
It should get quieter when the protector is on. If it doesn't, it's not protecting the well for earmuffs.

724
01:08:41,125 --> 01:08:44,575
Specifically, the rules are sort of a little simpler here.

725
01:08:44,575 --> 01:08:49,404
You know, is it completely covering the ear in the ear canal especially, or is it not?

726
01:08:49,405 --> 01:08:52,555
We want the seal of the ear cup again to be unbroken.

727
01:08:53,425 --> 01:09:01,045
Really. Glasses are the primary thing that can break that. But I have seen some people with some, let's say, an unusual feature structures.

728
01:09:01,135 --> 01:09:06,235
They have a very sort of triangular face where when they've got the ear earmuffs on,

729
01:09:06,235 --> 01:09:10,975
there's a giant gap down here because the earmuffs simply can't conform to their facial contours.

730
01:09:11,185 --> 01:09:17,665
Again, that's not the device for that person. And just like earplugs, when you put an earmuffs on, the sound should change.

731
01:09:17,665 --> 01:09:19,735
If they don't, it's not doing their job.

732
01:09:21,145 --> 01:09:27,805
So switching gears from the types of devices to how we actually figure out if they're working or not or how well they're working,

733
01:09:28,165 --> 01:09:32,975
there's really two different ways that we can measure the attenuation of a hearing protector.

734
01:09:32,995 --> 01:09:40,255
The first is kind of the more common approach where we try to come up with just a single number estimate of how many decibels that protect our blocks.

735
01:09:41,005 --> 01:09:42,625
The second approach is a lot more work.

736
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:50,034
It's more accurate, but more work to come up with your attenuation at each individual frequency that the hearing protector blocks.

737
01:09:50,035 --> 01:09:56,185
And then you can get a much better sense of, well, am I blocking the frequencies of sound that are in the actual workplace environment?

738
01:09:57,145 --> 01:10:00,775
So a single number attenuation, again, is mostly what's used around the world.

739
01:10:01,645 --> 01:10:08,905
It's not especially accurate, especially the way we do it here in our country with our 1979 standard that I'll talk about.

740
01:10:09,445 --> 01:10:11,365
And really, for that single member rating,

741
01:10:11,365 --> 01:10:19,105
the only way we can figure out if that protector is appropriate is we have to know the overall or the total weighted sound pressure levels.

742
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:24,055
We need to know DPA or DBC for suite frequency specific attenuation.

743
01:10:24,055 --> 01:10:29,934
As I said, this is the more accurate method, but it requires us to go out and make a bunch of active band measurements,

744
01:10:29,935 --> 01:10:32,995
both in our environment, but also on the hearing protector.

745
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:35,785
That's overkill for almost every environment.

746
01:10:37,225 --> 01:10:45,145
So in the U.S., this outdated standard that I've mentioned from 1979 is called the noise reduction rating or an R.

747
01:10:45,565 --> 01:10:49,254
And many of my colleagues and I think it should really stand for not really

748
01:10:49,255 --> 01:10:53,535
relevant because it's a terrible test and it doesn't give inaccurate results,

749
01:10:53,665 --> 01:10:58,765
but it is what we have we're stuck with. So as I said, this comes from the Office of Noise Abatement and Control.

750
01:10:59,155 --> 01:11:03,444
It is required to be labeled on every hearing protector sold in the U.S. So

751
01:11:03,445 --> 01:11:08,545
there's a reason when you go to the drugstore and you pick up cotton balls, they don't have an interim year, two bullets.

752
01:11:08,815 --> 01:11:15,175
Neither does Bose headset. So if it doesn't have an interior, it can't be worn as hearing protection in a workplace.

753
01:11:15,895 --> 01:11:21,114
The way this entry is computed is basically you take a bunch of trained test subjects,

754
01:11:21,115 --> 01:11:24,745
ten of them to be exact, and you put them in a laboratory setting.

755
01:11:25,135 --> 01:11:30,025
And you have some experimenters, some scientists actually fit the protector for them.

756
01:11:30,415 --> 01:11:34,704
And so if you imagine someone is going to get this thing as deep as possible into your ear,

757
01:11:34,705 --> 01:11:39,385
it's going to be the person doing that test whose whole job is to get it in there as far as possible.

758
01:11:40,105 --> 01:11:48,594
They're going to test you essentially with and without the hearing protector in your ears three different times at multiple frequencies.

759
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:52,105
And then the sum of that becomes basically the amount of protection that you get.

760
01:11:52,525 --> 01:12:00,415
And as I said earlier, there, there is a maximum here. So the highest possible ENR you can find and buy in the United States is 33 decibels.

761
01:12:00,685 --> 01:12:02,815
And it's for foam earplugs like this one.

762
01:12:04,255 --> 01:12:10,705
So as I said, the label is required for a hearing protection to be sold in the U.S. It's got a little bit of information on it,

763
01:12:10,705 --> 01:12:14,725
not especially in a helpful format. So 25 decibels.

764
01:12:14,755 --> 01:12:18,595
Okay, get that when used as directed. That's a bit of a cautionary statement.

765
01:12:19,615 --> 01:12:24,444
You can see here the range here that most workers will get is somewhere between 0 to 30.

766
01:12:24,445 --> 01:12:27,775
So we would interpret this as being kind of on the higher end of protection.

767
01:12:28,315 --> 01:12:32,634
We've got the manufactured identified here, you know, just like your mattress label.

768
01:12:32,635 --> 01:12:39,205
You can't take this label off under penalty of law. And then there's the EPA regulation that it requires this test to be done.

769
01:12:40,495 --> 01:12:43,555
Okay. So how would you actually use that in? RR?

770
01:12:43,915 --> 01:12:49,235
Well, ideally, we need to have the TWC exposure for our worker and we're going to take that TWC

771
01:12:49,255 --> 01:12:53,185
and subtract that in our that's kind of the straightforward way to look at it,

772
01:12:53,665 --> 01:12:54,894
but it's not quite that simple.

773
01:12:54,895 --> 01:13:03,595
And the reason is not only is the test that's done to compute the end are done in a way that's archaic and can't account for current technology.

774
01:13:03,835 --> 01:13:09,385
It's also done using C weighted decibels or DDC, and what do we use in the workplace, in the community?

775
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:13,795
DV Ed Exactly. So that's not good either.

776
01:13:14,845 --> 01:13:22,075
And so so we've immediately got this mismatch between the way the lab test runs and what I actually am trying to do in protecting my workers.

777
01:13:22,075 --> 01:13:29,935
So it's possible for me and anybody else with any remotely modern instrumentation to go out and measure a TWC,

778
01:13:30,385 --> 01:13:32,815
not in DBA as we usually do, but in DBC.

779
01:13:32,815 --> 01:13:43,344
And if I were to do that, I would basically take the T.W. way that I measured on my person in DBC and I would subtract the R,

780
01:13:43,345 --> 01:13:47,155
which is also in DBC, and that's going to give me the so-called protected level.

781
01:13:47,875 --> 01:13:51,265
So here's their exposure, here's how much protection they get.

782
01:13:51,295 --> 01:13:54,684
This is the amount of noise basically underneath their hearing protection.

783
01:13:54,685 --> 01:14:00,615
That's the number I'm really most interested in. So if I looked at an example here, let's say again, I made a.

784
01:14:00,965 --> 01:14:11,105
C measurement. My workers at 91 DBC the interior of their product of their hearing protector is 15 decibels DBC.

785
01:14:11,825 --> 01:14:20,755
And if I do that simple math, I figure out this worker's exposure underneath their protector is 76 DBC so that's way below 85.

786
01:14:20,765 --> 01:14:24,005
No, no concerns there from an over exposure perspective.

787
01:14:24,665 --> 01:14:30,605
But as I said, we don't use DBC. It's nobody does this so in DB a which is what we actually measure.

788
01:14:31,055 --> 01:14:35,315
We've got a slightly different approach here now. Back in the 1970s,

789
01:14:35,315 --> 01:14:43,774
Naish went out to about 650 different worksites and they took VBA measurements and they took DBC measurements side by side and

790
01:14:43,775 --> 01:14:52,565
they looked at the difference between them and on average DBC levels were about seven decibels higher at these 650 worksites.

791
01:14:52,565 --> 01:14:58,205
So now I said, Well, that must be the truth in every worksite, which is a huge assumption, but you have to make them.

792
01:14:59,105 --> 01:15:07,175
And so based on that, OSHA has said if you're taking that NRT, DBC and you're applying it to a DB, a measurement,

793
01:15:07,535 --> 01:15:15,765
you basically have to d rate the nr r by seven decibels to account for the fact that there's this difference between DBC and DBA.

794
01:15:16,415 --> 01:15:18,514
And so now we have a slightly different equation.

795
01:15:18,515 --> 01:15:28,084
We have our RTW now measured in a to decibels, and we're going to subtract from that in our R minus this seven decimal D rating,

796
01:15:28,085 --> 01:15:32,825
and that's going to give us our protected level. So again, just a quick example here.

797
01:15:33,215 --> 01:15:38,585
Let's say my worker still has a 91 decimal T anyway, but now it's a way to decibels.

798
01:15:40,115 --> 01:15:43,145
She is wearing the same in RR of 15 decibels.

799
01:15:43,985 --> 01:15:51,665
So I run through my math here. I've got 91 decibels exposure, 15 DBC and our my seven decibel D rating.

800
01:15:52,055 --> 01:16:00,305
Now I figure out this worker has a protected exposure level of about 83 decibels, which is starting to creep up pretty close to that 85 decibel mark.

801
01:16:01,865 --> 01:16:08,315
So another thing that I have to acknowledge here is like all types of protective equipment,

802
01:16:08,765 --> 01:16:14,615
if we all put on a particular earplug and I were to test everyone in this room, we're not all going to get the same results.

803
01:16:14,615 --> 01:16:18,395
Some of us are going to wear it really well. Others of us will wear it quite poorly.

804
01:16:18,935 --> 01:16:23,014
And that's not just a function of me as a tester. There's tons of literature documenting this.

805
01:16:23,015 --> 01:16:34,115
So this is kind of a summation of about 30 different studies done on workers in the real world comparing what they were wearing as a labeled RR.

806
01:16:34,115 --> 01:16:40,175
So this is what the product is marketed as you can see, these are up between, say, 33 and maybe 20.

807
01:16:40,385 --> 01:16:42,905
I'll say I hate three three dimensional graphs.

808
01:16:43,505 --> 01:16:48,905
If any of you take 655 with me, you'll get to hear me rail about this constantly because you can even tell what this number is.

809
01:16:48,905 --> 01:16:54,455
But anyway, let's say these are somewhere between 20 and 30 decibels on the label.

810
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:59,344
These are the numbers that workers actually get when they wear them in the real world.

811
01:16:59,345 --> 01:17:08,345
So you can see the difference between the label and the real world and is this is often less than half of what's on the label.

812
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:14,614
And in the case of, for instance, ear canal caps are semi insert products.

813
01:17:14,615 --> 01:17:21,694
You can see it's more like a third of what's on the label. You'll also see there's some error bars here showing that there's just huge variability.

814
01:17:21,695 --> 01:17:28,084
People wear these things differently and the protection they get is much, much lower than what we measure in the lab.

815
01:17:28,085 --> 01:17:30,275
That's a problem. That's why I say not really relevant.

816
01:17:31,235 --> 01:17:39,725
And so if you're doing everything according to how OSHA says, OSHA really just requires you to knock off that seven decibel spectral D rating.

817
01:17:40,235 --> 01:17:44,495
So you take the hour, you subtract seven. That's the amount of protection the worker's going to get.

818
01:17:44,975 --> 01:17:47,855
Now, Ash has a much more sort of thoughtful approach.

819
01:17:47,885 --> 01:17:53,945
They still require this seven decibels 50 rating, but they say, for instance, earmuffs are pretty hard to wear wrong.

820
01:17:54,695 --> 01:17:59,524
So we're going to knock the attenuation down by only 25% on those foam.

821
01:17:59,525 --> 01:18:05,915
Earplugs are also, you know, if you're trained a little harder to wear wrong, we'll knock that down by 50%.

822
01:18:05,915 --> 01:18:10,775
And everything else we're going to assume is only performing at about 25% of its label value.

823
01:18:11,345 --> 01:18:16,895
So the idea here is whatever type of protector and whatever equation you use,

824
01:18:17,255 --> 01:18:22,655
the notion that any one worker is going to get the actual number when they put this on is it's wrong.

825
01:18:22,835 --> 01:18:30,545
It's just it doesn't work out that way. And you may have workers who wear it so well that they actually exceed the NA, but for every one of those,

826
01:18:30,545 --> 01:18:36,395
there's going to be someone who's wearing it and getting almost no protection. And those, of course, are that sort of highest risk cases.

827
01:18:37,805 --> 01:18:43,025
So a few other comments specifically with regards to problems with hearing protect your use.

828
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:49,295
As I said, most of the time these protectors will block high frequencies better than low frequencies.

829
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:56,704
Also, as we talked about earlier, if you have a noise induced hearing loss that losses at high frequency is not below frequency.

830
01:18:56,705 --> 01:19:00,875
So if you've got a worker with a hearing loss who's also wearing hearing protection.

831
01:19:01,385 --> 01:19:04,895
Chances are they have very, very poor hearing at the high frequencies.

832
01:19:05,135 --> 01:19:09,295
They have their own hearing loss. And you're basically giving them an artificial hearing loss with this.

833
01:19:09,515 --> 01:19:13,195
So that's problematic, especially with earmuffs.

834
01:19:13,205 --> 01:19:19,024
It can become very difficult to localize a sound. You know, humans are pretty darn good at localizing sound.

835
01:19:19,025 --> 01:19:24,275
We our brain is listening for slight differences in the timing of the arrival of the sound in both of our ears.

836
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:33,065
Earmuffs, especially. You kind of blow that up if you're the military and you need to be listening for snipers and stuff, that's a huge problem.

837
01:19:33,065 --> 01:19:37,624
So the military spent a ton of money trying to figure out how do we design hearing

838
01:19:37,625 --> 01:19:41,585
protectors where people can still hear the direction the gunshot is coming from?

839
01:19:42,485 --> 01:19:46,834
You know, anytime you're wearing hearing protection and you're giving yourself this artificial hearing loss,

840
01:19:46,835 --> 01:19:54,545
that may put you in danger if you can't hear the warning sounds or your coworker shouting for you to run away and then discomfort.

841
01:19:55,265 --> 01:20:00,155
So, you know, if you buy a new pair of shoes, there's typically a break in period, maybe the first couple of days.

842
01:20:00,155 --> 01:20:06,274
They're not super comfortable. Hearing protectors are the same. So I often will will try to negotiate with people and be like, Well,

843
01:20:06,275 --> 01:20:10,084
why don't you just try it for a little while the first day and then longer the second day.

844
01:20:10,085 --> 01:20:15,305
The idea being, we want to get you into something you can wear all day long and, you know, half a day's exposure,

845
01:20:15,695 --> 01:20:20,795
especially if you haven't been wearing hearing protection at all previously, is is a small price to pay.

846
01:20:22,415 --> 01:20:28,895
Now, another question comes up, which is, well, gosh, what if I do only wear my hearing protection for a little bit of the time during the day?

847
01:20:29,615 --> 01:20:37,865
So it turns out the effective protection you get drops off dramatically for every minute that this protector is not in or on your ear.

848
01:20:38,345 --> 01:20:40,865
So we'll just focus maybe on the blue curve here.

849
01:20:40,865 --> 01:20:47,325
So let's say I've got a hearing protector, a foam earplug that's got a nominal attenuation of 30 decibels or more.

850
01:20:48,275 --> 01:20:52,235
Now if I and so I should introduce the x axis here.

851
01:20:52,235 --> 01:20:57,305
So this is the time that the hearing protector is not in your ear during the work shift.

852
01:20:57,605 --> 01:21:02,045
0 minutes here being you wore it for every minute of the day, 120 minutes,

853
01:21:02,045 --> 01:21:07,685
meaning you had it out for 2 hours a day, you had it out for 4 hours a day and so forth.

854
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:13,325
So the idea is if you wear this hearing protector perfectly and you wear it 100% of the time,

855
01:21:13,325 --> 01:21:18,904
so there's 0 minutes when this isn't in your ear, you'll probably actually get 30 decibels of protection.

856
01:21:18,905 --> 01:21:24,275
That's great. But if you take this thing out for just half an hour of your eight hour work shift,

857
01:21:25,085 --> 01:21:32,375
so if I connect the line up here to my blue line now down to an effective protection of about 80 decibels,

858
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:36,095
and that's just from taking this out for 30 minutes out of my eight hour shift.

859
01:21:36,545 --> 01:21:40,504
If I take it out for an entire hour now, I'm down to about 14 decibels.

860
01:21:40,505 --> 01:21:46,505
And if I take it out or if I only work for half my shift, I'm getting basically less than five decibels of protection.

861
01:21:46,505 --> 01:21:52,685
The idea being that no matter how well I wear this when it's in, I can't make up to the sound it gets in when I'm not wearing it.

862
01:21:53,225 --> 01:22:02,014
And so the sort of takeaway here and what I instruct employers is I tell them not to worry about how long the exposure is going to last.

863
01:22:02,015 --> 01:22:06,575
If it's over 85, have them put hearing protectors on. If the exposure is for 10 minutes, great.

864
01:22:06,575 --> 01:22:10,504
They take them right back out. But the idea of the worker saying, well, how long am I going to do this?

865
01:22:10,505 --> 01:22:14,765
Is this going to put me over a TWD of 85? They just don't do math that way.

866
01:22:14,765 --> 01:22:20,225
That's not what they get paid to do. That's what we get paid to do. So the simple guidance of when it's noisy, you wear hearing protection,

867
01:22:20,225 --> 01:22:25,174
even if it's just briefly takes out a lot of this nonsense around sort of communicating well,

868
01:22:25,175 --> 01:22:28,295
it's it's less effective if you only wear it for 2 hours a day.

869
01:22:29,435 --> 01:22:31,385
So that's that's a critical take home message.

870
01:22:32,495 --> 01:22:37,565
We also need to think about, well, how am I going to inform the workers that they actually need to be wearing hearing protection?

871
01:22:38,165 --> 01:22:41,165
You know, there's the very important thing that Oren brought up.

872
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:44,434
We have to tell them. We need to show them to.

873
01:22:44,435 --> 01:22:51,065
So, you know, every time I've been in a plan and somebody from upper management has walked through and everybody else is just getting ready

874
01:22:51,065 --> 01:22:56,974
to wear hearing protection and the manager doesn't wear it totally undercuts the validity and veracity of your program.

875
01:22:56,975 --> 01:23:00,755
So everybody needs to model wearing these things correctly.

876
01:23:01,295 --> 01:23:07,264
There's a pretty good rule of thumb that says if you're standing arm's length from somebody and you have to shout or raise your voice to be heard,

877
01:23:07,265 --> 01:23:11,195
it's probably at least 85 decibels a good idea to wear hearing protection.

878
01:23:12,155 --> 01:23:18,754
Certainly if we have workers who are complaining and my my hearing is like bad at the end of the day or my ears are ringing.

879
01:23:18,755 --> 01:23:21,275
Those are good signs that they got too much noise.

880
01:23:21,845 --> 01:23:27,245
And speaking of signs, there are actually electronic signs you can buy now that have microphones built in.

881
01:23:27,545 --> 01:23:31,445
So this sign can be in the background, constantly monitoring background noise.

882
01:23:31,775 --> 01:23:37,235
And if it gets above 85, the sign lights up and tells you you need to put on the hearing protection now.

883
01:23:37,535 --> 01:23:43,024
And when it drops back below 85, the sign goes off. So I've had employers say, well, for instance,

884
01:23:43,025 --> 01:23:47,854
I've had employers where the majority of the exposure comes not from machinery but from workers

885
01:23:47,855 --> 01:23:51,635
listening to music because their job sucks and that's what helps them get through the day.

886
01:23:51,815 --> 01:23:56,075
And there's a lot of jobs like that. Professor is one. I will throw that out there again.

887
01:23:57,035 --> 01:24:00,254
But the idea here is, well, I don't want to tell the workers they can't listen.

888
01:24:00,255 --> 01:24:04,855
Their music is. It's getting them through the shift, but I don't want them exposing themselves to 100 decibels of music.

889
01:24:05,215 --> 01:24:11,005
So I'll tell them, Hey, you can have your stereo on and you can turn it up as loud as you want until that sign turns on.

890
01:24:11,125 --> 01:24:14,995
And when that side turns on, you have to turn it back down until the sign goes off.

891
01:24:15,265 --> 01:24:20,425
Then the workers can listen to it as as loud as possible without overexposing themselves.

892
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:28,285
So that can be kind of a cool technological solution. One thing we want to avoid here is so-called over attenuation.

893
01:24:28,285 --> 01:24:31,645
So again, the idea here is we want to bring the sound down to a safe level.

894
01:24:31,655 --> 01:24:35,004
We don't want to totally isolate people from their environment.

895
01:24:35,005 --> 01:24:39,445
So as a visual analogy, let's say I go to a beach, but there's a glare, right?

896
01:24:39,445 --> 01:24:42,645
It's super bright. Everything's kind of washed out. I can't see very well.

897
01:24:42,825 --> 01:24:50,454
Well, what do I do? I put on a decent pair of sunglasses that are going to block sunlight and allow me to see this lovely beach scene.

898
01:24:50,455 --> 01:24:54,565
I don't put on a welder's glass because that's going to block too much light.

899
01:24:54,565 --> 01:24:59,155
And now I can't see what I need to see. So this is sort of no hearing protection.

900
01:24:59,155 --> 01:25:05,185
This is appropriate hearing protection, and this would be more protection than people need or over attenuation.

901
01:25:06,715 --> 01:25:13,434
So a reasonable question to ask is, well, what should that protected level underneath my hearing protector be like?

902
01:25:13,435 --> 01:25:19,584
What's a safe level to strive for there? The US has no opinion on this, but the European Union's given us some guidance.

903
01:25:19,585 --> 01:25:23,515
So they think if it's over 85, that's unacceptable.

904
01:25:23,515 --> 01:25:27,834
I think we would all agree that people are still at risk of a hearing loss underneath their hearing protector.

905
01:25:27,835 --> 01:25:32,305
Not good if beneath their hearing protector it's between 80 and 85.

906
01:25:32,305 --> 01:25:37,915
That's acceptable. If again, underneath the hearing protector, it's between 75 and 80.

907
01:25:37,915 --> 01:25:45,804
That's the sweet spot. That's actually where we want them to be. If it's 75 to 70 underneath the hearing protector, that's okay.

908
01:25:45,805 --> 01:25:51,895
And if we're cutting it down to less than 70 decibels below their hearing protection, we're blocking too much sound.

909
01:25:51,895 --> 01:25:53,635
That, again, is undesirable.

910
01:25:53,995 --> 01:26:00,445
So there really is this 15 decibels kind of sweet spot in the middle that we're we're wanting to get people protected down to.

911
01:26:02,365 --> 01:26:06,684
Just a few final comments on hearing protection, and I'll give you this graph.

912
01:26:06,685 --> 01:26:10,045
It's somewhat useful just in terms of thinking about, well, gosh,

913
01:26:10,495 --> 01:26:17,035
what sorts of hearing protectors are maybe not great for high temperatures, earmuffs are among them.

914
01:26:17,815 --> 01:26:22,405
You know, what about if you need to localize? What if your exposures are very short term?

915
01:26:23,065 --> 01:26:29,245
What if you've also got exposure to airborne particles? So just kind of a little rubric here to help you choose hearing protection.

916
01:26:30,835 --> 01:26:37,465
I've already told you many times, but I'll just repeat, one size does not fit all and one type won't work for everybody either.

917
01:26:38,035 --> 01:26:43,795
So two different types is the minimum for a selection of four is better, as I mentioned earlier.

918
01:26:44,305 --> 01:26:53,364
So a question for you all, should you let your workers take their hearing protectors home or grab earplugs and take them home with them folks?

919
01:26:53,365 --> 01:26:56,365
Think about that. Yeah, I think yes.

920
01:26:56,365 --> 01:27:01,075
Because it's kind of the holistic view of your noise. Exposure doesn't stop when you leave.

921
01:27:01,615 --> 01:27:05,245
Good. I think it shows that you care about the workers. Yeah. Excellent.

922
01:27:05,245 --> 01:27:09,965
So, you know, if if the worker loses their hearing off the job, but they have a noisy job as well,

923
01:27:09,985 --> 01:27:15,085
chances are you're still going to get stuck with the worker's comp claim. So you're you're sort of heading off a claim in that sense.

924
01:27:15,715 --> 01:27:19,584
Other thoughts on pro or con? And I'll tell you, companies do this both ways.

925
01:27:19,585 --> 01:27:23,485
So I don't know that there's a right answer. Yeah.

926
01:27:23,725 --> 01:27:27,145
Just the risk is that they don't remember to bring it back and then.

927
01:27:27,145 --> 01:27:31,195
Yeah. And don't have the earmuffs and doing the work and other tasks.

928
01:27:31,405 --> 01:27:35,304
Exactly right. So, you know, for disposable earplugs just grab a new set.

929
01:27:35,305 --> 01:27:40,555
But if it's like your custom molded earplugs that you left at home, I spent a bunch of money for you to wear those at work.

930
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:47,364
I want you to wear them there. So there's that concern. I've also had companies be like, Well, we put everybody in custom molded earplugs,

931
01:27:47,365 --> 01:27:56,004
but we've got this loaner set of really nasty earmuffs that people get to wear if they forget their plugs at home as sort of a punishment device.

932
01:27:56,005 --> 01:28:02,575
It's sort of like if you forget your hard hat, we've got this really ugly hard hat you get to wear during the day that you don't have your hardhat.

933
01:28:02,575 --> 01:28:06,534
So there are other ways to make that work. Other ideas.

934
01:28:06,535 --> 01:28:09,745
I you did you have one she said okay. Yeah.

935
01:28:09,745 --> 01:28:14,454
So I tend to default on take them home, you know, give them to family members.

936
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:21,565
The idea is especially for these foam earplugs, they're so cheap, it's not going to be a loss leader for the company.

937
01:28:21,775 --> 01:28:28,315
And if you can prevent them from getting a hearing loss off the job, chances are they're probably doing the right thing on the job, too.

938
01:28:28,315 --> 01:28:31,945
And you've again prevented that hearing loss claim outright.

939
01:28:33,775 --> 01:28:36,895
Just some final comments on hearing protector attenuation.

940
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:40,584
You know, how can we confirm that workers are achieving a good fit?

941
01:28:40,585 --> 01:28:48,395
Well, there's, for instance, little plastic models you can get to sort of see more who can get the tightest roll down on their foam earplugs.

942
01:28:48,965 --> 01:28:52,524
It seems a little borderline, but people have made money off this so far.

943
01:28:52,525 --> 01:28:59,995
Be it for me to have to judge, you know, a better thing is when you train them, you actually have them try it on and confirm for you.

944
01:28:59,995 --> 01:29:05,604
Like I'm tugging on the earplug, it's not coming out. You can look and see that it's actually physically in their ear.

945
01:29:05,605 --> 01:29:09,775
But the gold standard is fit testing like like Jenny mentioned earlier.

946
01:29:09,775 --> 01:29:16,615
And there's really two types of fit testing we can do here. So the first is called real ear at threshold testing.

947
01:29:16,615 --> 01:29:21,595
This is basically a hearing test with and then a test again without your hearing protector.

948
01:29:21,835 --> 01:29:26,185
And the difference is how many decibels of sound that hearing protection.

949
01:29:26,185 --> 01:29:30,865
BLOCK So this is an insertion loss measurement where we're measuring the same sound

950
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:36,355
level basically at your eardrum before and after you have a hearing protector in.

951
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:41,545
And again, the difference is the rough approximate, the rough attenuation that you get.

952
01:29:42,025 --> 01:29:45,625
And there's commercial devices out there that let you do this kind of testing.

953
01:29:45,625 --> 01:29:49,194
This is one example of one where in the space of maybe 3 minutes,

954
01:29:49,195 --> 01:29:58,075
you could test a worker at different frequencies and come up with their personal attenuation rating what they get with their individual protector.

955
01:29:58,645 --> 01:30:05,425
This works only with earplugs. And fortunately, there are other models out there that are a little more flexible,

956
01:30:05,995 --> 01:30:12,505
but they all have basically the same concept that we're testing, hearing before and after putting on a hearing protector.

957
01:30:13,015 --> 01:30:17,935
The alternative is what's called a microphone in real ear or maia testing.

958
01:30:18,385 --> 01:30:21,294
And so this is actually a noise reduction measurement.

959
01:30:21,295 --> 01:30:28,105
We're making a simultaneous measurement at two points in space inside and outside to protect her, but at the same point in time.

960
01:30:28,495 --> 01:30:31,735
So this takes some instrumentation to do.

961
01:30:32,005 --> 01:30:38,005
And basically we end up having to drill a hole through our hearing protector and thread a microphone through that.

962
01:30:38,005 --> 01:30:42,355
So now we have a microphone in your ear and then we'll have another one sitting out on your shoulder.

963
01:30:42,355 --> 01:30:47,215
And the difference between those when you expose someone to noise is the noise reduction.

964
01:30:47,215 --> 01:30:50,815
And again, there's lots of different types of these.

965
01:30:51,205 --> 01:30:58,614
The downside of Maia, it's much faster. You can take a measurement almost instantly, but you're not measuring the worker's actual earplug.

966
01:30:58,615 --> 01:31:02,754
You're measuring a specialized plug that's got a hole drilled through it and a microphone put in it.

967
01:31:02,755 --> 01:31:08,395
So it's it's sort of a step removed from the worker's own hearing protection.

968
01:31:09,445 --> 01:31:12,354
And then there's an example here for testing earmuffs.

969
01:31:12,355 --> 01:31:19,975
So this is essentially a little apparatus that sits a microphone right in the entrance of your ear, and you can put an earmuffs over that.

970
01:31:20,425 --> 01:31:23,665
And we measure the sound level without the earmuffs on.

971
01:31:23,665 --> 01:31:27,775
And then again with the ear muffin, the difference, what's more, is the attenuation.

972
01:31:28,225 --> 01:31:33,384
And so now we know for this worker on this day with this hearing protector, here's how much protection they got.

973
01:31:33,385 --> 01:31:38,515
That's way better than while the narrator says 30, but they might get 15 or they might get eight.

974
01:31:39,145 --> 01:31:42,625
You know, it's sort of a data driven decision that you can make then.

975
01:31:44,005 --> 01:31:49,375
All right, I've already talked about this. Burnley brought up this point earlier that earbuds are not hearing protection.

976
01:31:49,375 --> 01:31:57,685
That's absolutely right. So I advise employers to absolutely ban the use of personal listening devices on work time.

977
01:31:58,315 --> 01:32:03,504
The reason for it being those earbuds not only don't block sound, you're actually adding sound to your exposure.

978
01:32:03,505 --> 01:32:08,515
So if it's 80 decibels outside, you're cranking your music up to hear it over that 80 decibels.

979
01:32:08,515 --> 01:32:14,755
Maybe you're inducing an exposure of 90 with your amp three player or your iPhone or whatever you're using.

980
01:32:15,715 --> 01:32:21,624
And now the employer has no control over that, basically. So as I said, there's ways to let workers listen to music.

981
01:32:21,625 --> 01:32:28,645
You can have the same. You could put them in a pair of earmuffs where they can crank their music, but earbuds not a good idea.

982
01:32:29,645 --> 01:32:34,435
Okay, so we've got, like 8 minutes left in class, and I'd love to do this efficiently if we can.

983
01:32:34,465 --> 01:32:38,795
So did folks bring their music players and headphones?

984
01:32:38,875 --> 01:32:46,284
Okay, if even a few of you have them, that will do. So the trick here, let me add, I think I've got five setups here.

985
01:32:46,285 --> 01:32:49,345
So folks want to come up and just grab one of these. You can do this in a group.

986
01:32:49,795 --> 01:32:55,915
So the idea here is I've got a sound level meter and I've got this horrible little fake here, here.

987
01:32:55,915 --> 01:32:57,745
When she touched it, you'll know why I'm saying it's horrible.

988
01:32:58,345 --> 01:33:05,995
So I'm basically just going to insert the sound level meter in there until it's basically just barely inserted into your ear canal.

989
01:33:05,995 --> 01:33:11,124
We're trying to simulate basically your eardrum and then you can plug your earbud or your

990
01:33:11,125 --> 01:33:15,775
headphones onto this other end and we can read and see what is your normal listening level.

991
01:33:16,225 --> 01:33:20,995
So I'd say plug your earphones into your phone or whatever, pick your usual listening level,

992
01:33:20,995 --> 01:33:24,295
and then you can plug them in here and see what that level is.

993
01:33:24,745 --> 01:33:30,984
So it's a little clunky. This is not exactly well, let's say it's scientist, maybe not fully scientific,

994
01:33:30,985 --> 01:33:36,385
but it'll give you an approximation here of what you're listening to your music with.

995
01:33:36,865 --> 01:33:43,375
So I'll just sort of hand out your five gizmos here and I can have one.

996
01:33:45,475 --> 01:33:53,545
I just. I don't think we'll have time for everyone to get a measurement, but if you can at least speak to a couple.

997
01:33:54,325 --> 01:34:01,375
Sorry. Oh, you didn't. Yeah, right. Yeah.

998
01:34:04,095 --> 01:34:10,875
Okay. Okay. I was trying to listen to a lot of, actually, this stuff.

999
01:34:11,115 --> 01:34:19,545
Oh, you're gonna be here. I'm going to trauma yourself back here.

1000
01:34:20,985 --> 01:34:25,135
Okay. You're going to stay for.

1001
01:34:26,375 --> 01:34:31,095
Because it has different languages. Oh, yeah, exactly.

1002
01:34:31,115 --> 01:34:41,145
I think that's a good thing to do.

1003
01:34:41,845 --> 01:34:48,995
Yeah. Okay, sure. I think you're right.

1004
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:54,625
Yeah. When I was in India, right?

1005
01:34:56,405 --> 01:34:59,855
Yeah, I think. No, it's not.

1006
01:35:00,185 --> 01:35:03,725
Yeah. Sorry. I don't even know his.

1007
01:35:09,255 --> 01:35:15,765
Okay. The ones that should be good in training at this point.

1008
01:35:19,975 --> 01:35:36,355
Is it playing at all? I turned around and turned it up and then, like they said, I heard it was pretty low.

1009
01:35:37,975 --> 01:35:43,075
And you had like 88, you know, peaks of like 89.

1010
01:35:46,345 --> 01:35:51,745
You know, the other thing I'll say, what's some of the Bluetooth earbuds is they turn off when you take them out of

1011
01:35:51,745 --> 01:35:55,584
your ear and they may not recognize the creepy rubber thing here is an ear.

1012
01:35:55,585 --> 01:36:01,585
So that may or may not work. Well, so that's of but I need to make sure you get your ears.

1013
01:36:01,585 --> 01:36:13,115
I think it was about 75, 81, somewhere around you can see I do feel like, oh yeah, you have both here and.

1014
01:36:15,125 --> 01:36:21,935
Actually, I think you can choose that it's a special celebration. But that specific steps just now.

1015
01:36:22,415 --> 01:36:25,685
I know it's what I went from.

1016
01:36:28,235 --> 01:36:32,095
Yes. Anybody to anyone.

1017
01:36:32,345 --> 01:36:36,695
Yeah. I think I probably of the figure in it. Yeah.

1018
01:36:38,405 --> 01:36:45,055
I don't know what I'm going to try and lose. And those who haven't.

1019
01:36:45,595 --> 01:36:53,595
Now, this morning was lost because the bus driver was literally shot four seats on himself.

1020
01:36:53,835 --> 01:36:59,235
So I'm curious, just since we're wrapping up. Anybody think they had the highest level they listened to?

1021
01:37:00,435 --> 01:37:03,605
No. No judgment here. I just kind of getting a bounding estimate.

1022
01:37:03,615 --> 01:37:09,194
Need to be do that or no. Just what do you think the level that was measured on you might be the highest in the class?

1023
01:37:09,195 --> 01:37:21,555
I mean, was anybody at 90, for instance, anybody at 85 years peaked in any oak, anybody down at 60, for instance, did I hear his was pretty close.

1024
01:37:22,005 --> 01:37:27,585
And so I'll say and Kristen brought this up too you know depending on the type of product you're listening through,

1025
01:37:27,945 --> 01:37:36,434
like if you have over the ear that actually may provide some attenuation from the environment, you can actually listen at a quieter volume.

1026
01:37:36,435 --> 01:37:41,955
Likewise, if you have active noise cancellation going on, you're going to tend to listen at a much lower level.

1027
01:37:42,315 --> 01:37:46,034
I think the worst product, I shouldn't say this out loud,

1028
01:37:46,035 --> 01:37:51,795
but some of the earbuds that are solid and have no absorptive material, there's no tip or anything.

1029
01:37:51,795 --> 01:37:56,475
They just kind of sit in your ear. They do almost nothing to block ambient sound out.

1030
01:37:56,475 --> 01:38:02,295
So if you're in a noisy environment again, you're going to be cranking it up even above that noisy environment just to hear so.

1031
01:38:02,445 --> 01:38:06,975
So in my mind, the best type of listening device is one that's going to provide you some isolation

1032
01:38:06,975 --> 01:38:10,155
from the environment around you so you don't have to listen to at such a high level.

1033
01:38:11,385 --> 01:38:14,534
All right. So I'd love to collect those ears and sound level meters.

1034
01:38:14,535 --> 01:38:19,155
And I will just say there's a couple of other resources here if you're interested.

01:38:19,845 --> 01:38:22,004
And then again, this was our last noise lecture.

1036
01:38:22,005 --> 01:38:28,875
So starting after the lab session next week, we're going to switch gears into vibration support for the lab session.

1037
01:38:28,875 --> 01:38:30,344
Next week, I'm going to bring a bunch of stuff.

1038
01:38:30,345 --> 01:38:34,605
We're going to be just making measurements and making noise in here and hopefully learning some things too.

1039
01:38:34,695 --> 01:38:38,205
So, so thank you all. Have a great week and I will see you next week.
