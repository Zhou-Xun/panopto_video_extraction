2
00:00:06,164 --> 00:00:09,736
I'd like to take a few minutes now to talk
to you about a topic that's especially

3
00:00:09,736 --> 00:00:11,310
near and dear to my heart.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,210
In addition to being an exposure
scientist, I've been trained as

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,350
an industrial hygienist, and
what industrial hygienists do,

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,170
is try to identify hazardous issues
in the workplace, so exposures that

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,430
workers may have that could harm their
health, and to correct those exposures and

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,990
reduce people's exposures to make sure
that workers are safe and healthy.

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,160
Now to put occupational health in context,

10
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,720
I'd like to spend a few moments talking
about other familiar public health issues

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,630
that are probably familiar
to virtually everyone.

12
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,440
So it's no news, I think,

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,920
that heart disease is the number
one killer of Americans.

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,670
We have about 600,000 Americans
a year that die of heart disease,

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,370
at a cost of almost a half $1 trillion.

16
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,610
This is a huge public health burden and

17
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,690
it's one we're dedicating lots of
resources to, quite appropriately.

18
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,380
Another top killer of Americans is cancer.

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,790
It kills almost as many people as
heart disease, but at a lower cost.

20
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,220
Still though,
$100 billion a year in costs for cancer.

21
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:10,720
Stroke or

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,630
cerebrovascular disease are another one
of the top five killers of Americans.

23
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,350
This kills not so many people,
only about 130,000, and

24
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,640
the costs are only about $40 billion.

25
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,172
But I say only 40 billion is
still quite a bit of money.

26
00:01:24,172 --> 00:01:27,510
And then, last,
I'd like to mention influenza.

27
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,990
So the lowly flu virus ends up killing
about 54,000 Americans every year,

28
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,060
at a cost of almost $90 billion.

29
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,190
So these are recognized public health
hazard, these have tremendous burdens on

30
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:43,050
our health, and we've spent a lot of
money trying to address these things.

31
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,200
So which is why we have, for
example, an influenza vaccine.

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,170
On the flip side, let me talk to
you about occupational health.

33
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:54,988
So it turns out, between 4 and
6,000 workers in America die every year,

34
00:01:54,988 --> 00:01:57,530
on the job, from fatal injuries.

35
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,740
And another 50 to 60,000 die every
year from occupational illnesses.

36
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,790
So that's more people dying at work
than die of influenza every year,

37
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,860
but we don't hear anyone discussing
a vaccine for occupational health.

38
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,680
Also the cost of occupational injuries and
illnesses that kill people

39
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,090
is $51 billion a year, so
that's more than the cost of stroke.

40
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,090
So we have these top public health
hazards that we're addressing and

41
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,880
spending a lot of money on,
we haven't really recognized occupational

42
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,900
injuries and fatalities as the big
issue that they really are.

43
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,210
And, in fact,
if we zoom out to the whole globe,

44
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,310
something like 2 million people
every year die on the job.

45
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,467
These are absolutely preventable deaths
and people like me, industrial hygienists,

46
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:44,347
spend our whole career trying
to keep people safe on the job.

47
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:48,309
I'd like you to show a photo now so
you can put on your EHS identification

48
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:50,817
lens and
look with these photo along with me so

49
00:02:50,817 --> 00:02:53,393
we can identify some issues
that we see here and

50
00:02:53,393 --> 00:02:57,819
again you don't need to be an industrial
hygienist to look at the shot of someone

51
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:03,020
working in a steel foundry and figure out,
wow, this is probably really dangerous.

52
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,830
But as an industrial hygienist, I look at
this photo and I see a number of things.

53
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,810
We've got someone working
with molten steel.

54
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,810
This could be 1,500 or 2,000 degrees.

55
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,610
Obviously, if they come
into contact with that,

56
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,590
there's the chance of huge,
perhaps fatal, burns.

57
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,560
But, of course,
anytime we have molten metal like that,

58
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,260
there's gonna be very high
temperatures in the atmosphere.

59
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,629
So this person is also at risk
of having perhaps heat stress or

60
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:28,179
a fatal heat stroke.

61
00:03:28,179 --> 00:03:31,477
You can look at the steel that's
pouring out of that crucible and

62
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:35,140
you can see that there's a fume
coming off that, metal fume.

63
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,290
This worker is probably
breathing that fume in.

64
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,180
Is that good for them?

65
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,060
Probably not.

66
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,910
We know in many types of metals there
are carcinogens or cancer causing agents.

67
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,560
This worker also is standing in
a relatively awkward position.

68
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,420
There may be issues like
musculoskeletal or ergonomic problems.

69
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,700
This person might have a sore back or
some joint disorders.

70
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,440
There's also a chance for noise.

71
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,610
Metal production tends to be very,
very noisy.

72
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,210
So this person might be at
risk of a hearing loss.

73
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,160
And, finally, a lot of jobs like
this are conducted by a person

74
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,410
working all by themselves in
a relatively remote area.

75
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,690
If they get injured and
aren't able to remove themselves,

76
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,690
who's gonna come to save them?

77
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,150
So this is just one example of
an admittedly pretty bad job, but

78
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,790
there are many, many jobs out there that
have huge occupational health hazards.

79
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,190
And, again, people like me,
industrial hygienists and

80
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,180
safety professionals, dedicate our
lives trying to keep these workers safe

81
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,061
to reduce this tremendous
public health burden.
