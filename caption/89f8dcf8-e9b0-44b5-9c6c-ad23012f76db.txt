00:00:00,511 --> 00:00:09,511
Hi, everyone. It's nice to be with you today. I'm here to talk about my research, which is about food insecurity among college students,

2
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:13,921
and my talk today is called No Food for Thought. My name is Cindy Leung.

3
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:19,621
I'm an assistant professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.

4
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:25,581
I have a dual doctorate in nutrition and epidemiology from the Harvard School of Public Health.

5
00:00:25,581 --> 00:00:30,541
And I also have an MPH in public health nutrition from UC Berkeley.

6
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:36,331
My whole field of research focuses on the negative experiences of food insecurity.

7
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:45,331
And this is because before I went to get my doctorate, I spent a year working at a large food bank in Oakland, California.

8
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:48,931
The name of my food bank was the Alameda County Community Food Bank.

9
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:56,521
And we served the entire region of Alameda County, which is as far north as Berkeley and as far south as Fremont,

10
00:00:56,521 --> 00:01:05,461
for those of you who are familiar with the San Francisco Bay Area. And in this role at the food bank, I led nutrition education workshops.

11
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:11,101
I coordinated our large distribution of member agencies,

12
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:20,491
so these were things like soup kitchens, churches, food pantries, schools, basically any organization that distributes food to the community.

13
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:28,561
And I also got to work with anti hunger advocates at the local and state level to advocate for better policies to fight hunger.

14
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:34,591
And this experience really shaped how I saw our nutrition disparities.

15
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:41,161
I had come from my Masters program where I was learning about how we should be eating to promote health,

16
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:50,761
and here I was working in the community, seeing all the barriers that our community members had in just even accessing and affording healthy food.

17
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:57,421
And it really inspired me to tackle these issues from a broader level. And that brings me to my research here today.

18
00:01:57,421 --> 00:02:05,911
So today I'm going to focus on the population of college students. This is a relatively new area of research in our field,

19
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:08,851
and it's not because this is a new phenomenon.

20
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:16,411
It's because for a long time we thought that college students were protected from food insecurity for a number of reasons,

21
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:26,071
some of which are not actually true. And so the first studies of food insecurity among college students were published just over 10 years ago.

22
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:30,751
And it was then, that people start to take notice that maybe college students were

23
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:35,271
actually more vulnerable to food insecurity than we had previously thought.

24
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:38,701
So I'll be sharing with you some of my own research,

25
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:49,601
as well as data from other campuses across the U.S. about the magnitude of this problem and what we should be doing to solve it.

26
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:57,731
So let's get into it. I want to start broad and just think about what is food insecurity.

27
00:02:57,731 --> 00:03:04,601
I'm going to give you the USDA definition. So it's quite long and has a lot of different parts, which I'll break down.

28
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:12,821
Basically, the USDA defines food insecurity as the limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods,

29
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:19,181
a limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways.

30
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:27,491
So the first thing I want you to take note of is that the definition of food insecurity includes the words availability and acquire.

31
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:33,971
So it suggests that to be food secure, you need to have these foods available in your neighborhood,

32
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:39,321
and you need to be a you be able to acquire them with the resources that you have.

33
00:03:39,321 --> 00:03:45,641
The second notion is that food security exists when you have nutritious and safe foods available.

34
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:48,821
So that means that these foods should be high in quality,

35
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:56,291
they should have the nutrients, the macro nutrients, micronutrients that we need to grow and develop in healthy ways,

36
00:03:56,291 --> 00:04:06,041
and they should also be free of toxicants. And in the last part of this definition, it's about acquiring foods in socially acceptable ways,

37
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:12,391
which usually means going to the grocery store and shopping for these with your own resources.

38
00:04:12,391 --> 00:04:18,281
We shouldn't expect that people should need to beg for food, or steal food, or sometimes

39
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:23,321
even people think that waiting in line at a food pantry might not be socially acceptable.

40
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:34,251
So that's what that definition means. The national prevalence of food insecurity in 2019 was 11%.

41
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:39,261
This map shows the distribution of food insecurity in the U.S.

42
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:44,361
And you can see for Michigan, we are one the states that that's above the U.S. average.

43
00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:52,881
So in this figure, the U.S. average was an aggregate of 2016 to 2018 data, it was a little bit higher in those years,

44
00:04:52,881 --> 00:04:56,541
so the average was 11.7%. In Michigan,

45
00:04:56,541 --> 00:05:03,921
across those three years, the average was 12%. So we were slightly higher than the national average.

46
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:08,661
And then you can see that other states in the Southwest, in the South, and in

47
00:05:08,661 --> 00:05:14,151
the Midwest had also levels that were higher than 11.7%.

48
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:17,151
If you want to further break this down, Feeding America,

49
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:23,991
which is one of our largest anti-hunger advocacy organizations, has a tool called Map the Meal Gap.

50
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:29,061
It's on their website, and you can actually put in your county or congressional district, your zip code,

51
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:33,231
and you can look at what's the prevalence of food insecurity in your community.

52
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:43,521
And if you look at that map or you look at this map, it shows you that no state, no geographic area is immune to food insecurity in the United States.

53
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:55,311
It's really a problem for every one of our policymakers. All of them should be concerned that there are food insecure constituents in their areas.

54
00:05:55,311 --> 00:06:00,831
This chart is showing how food insecurity has changed over the last 20 years.

55
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:08,691
And I want to show you this because, number one, you can see that food insecurity has persisted in this country since we started measuring it.

56
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:15,801
It's not a new thing, although it certainly has peaked to historic levels during the COVID-19 pandemic.

57
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:23,091
But basically, since we started measuring it, food insecurity, in the solid blue line, has hovered around 11%.

58
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:30,301
And then in 2008, during the Great Recession, it increased to about 14, 15%,

59
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:36,251
and it stayed there for several years until in the last five years, it's really started to decline.

60
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:42,141
And in 2019, it was one of the first times that it returned to pre-recession levels,

61
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:48,471
and a lot of us are waiting for this data to see how it's been magnified due to COVID.

62
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:53,481
The lower bar, which is very low food security, is the more extreme form of food insecurity,

63
00:06:53,481 --> 00:07:00,111
and that's been around 4% for the past 20 years.

64
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:02,521
So what is food insecurity?

65
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:10,741
Food insecurity is a number of different indicators, behaviors, experiences that are all attributed to not having enough money for food.

66
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:16,531
So these could include just worrying that your food is going to run out before you have money to buy more,

67
00:07:16,531 --> 00:07:20,731
not being able to afford a balanced meal, whatever that means to you,

68
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:25,861
and then the more behavioral indicators are things like eating less because there wasn't enough money for food,

69
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:32,521
skipping meals, hungry but didn't eat, losing weight, all because there wasn't enough money for food,

70
00:07:32,521 --> 00:07:38,821
and the most severe indicator is not eating for a whole day because there wasn't enough money for food.

71
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:45,931
So these are things that we would ask someone to report and a response of three or more.

72
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:50,431
So if someone says that they worry that they didn't have enough money for food,

73
00:07:50,431 --> 00:07:54,061
that they couldn't afford to eat a balanced meal, and then they skipped meals,

74
00:07:54,061 --> 00:08:00,421
because there wasn't enough money for food. That would be a positive indicator for food insecurity.

75
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:07,771
But even just reporting that you worry about food and maybe nothing more extreme, we would categorize as marginal food security,

76
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:15,621
and we know that even marginal levels of food insecurity are associated with poor health outcomes.

77
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:23,601
So who is at risk for food insecurity? The USDA compiles a report every year that establishes the prevalence of food insecurity,

78
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:31,941
and it also looks at demographic groups and how food insecurity varies across these different characteristics. And across every year,

79
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:36,981
these are some of the same demographics that we know are at higher risk for food insecurity,

80
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:44,331
meaning that they report higher levels than the national average. So that includes households with children under age 18,

81
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:55,671
households with young children under age six, households with children headed by a single mom or a single dad, men or women who report living alone,

82
00:08:55,671 --> 00:09:03,831
Black or Hispanic headed households, and households with incomes below 185% of the poverty line.

83
00:09:03,831 --> 00:09:07,731
This report does not include any statistics about college students,

84
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:14,421
and I'll talk more about that in the next part of this talk. But we know that these are some of the same characteristics

85
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:24,511
year after year about who is at higher risk for food insecurity. Food insecurity is a known health issue for children.

86
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:29,611
The research has been clear that for children and adolescents,

87
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:35,851
food insecurity is associated with a number of nutritional and non nutritional health outcomes.

88
00:09:35,851 --> 00:10:20,931
I have some of them listed here, but this is not an exhaustive list.

89
00:10:20,931 --> 00:10:28,651
So as you can see from this list, food insecurity is not just associated with things like vitamin deficiency,

90
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:35,071
even though those things have been found as well. There's a number of developmental risk factors.

91
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:39,961
There's a number of behavioral outcomes. There's also a lot of academic outcomes.

92
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:48,751
And we've seen that children from food insecure households generally have poor academic outcomes compared to food, secure households,

93
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:57,751
even after you control for things like their income, their parental education level and other factors that are associated with socioeconomic status.

94
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:04,101
So above and beyond that, food insecurity seems to be exerting these harmful effects.

95
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:06,831
What about for adults?

96
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:13,821
Again, this is not an exhaustive list of outcomes, but these are some of the ones that are fairly consistent across a number of studies.

97
00:11:13,821 --> 00:11:21,081
So for adults, you've seen things like micronutrient deficiencies, low diet quality,

98
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:27,411
poor sleep outcomes, lower physical activity, and greater levels of smoking.

99
00:11:27,411 --> 00:11:30,891
So food insecurity is associated with some dietary outcomes,

100
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:38,531
and also these other negative health behaviors that we know are important for long term health.

101
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:44,381
Food insecurity has also been associated with lower overall health status and poor physical health.

102
00:11:44,381 --> 00:11:49,581
So these are usually assessed by a single question like how would you rate your overall health?

103
00:11:49,581 --> 00:11:55,181
And it would be on a scale from excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor.

104
00:11:55,181 --> 00:12:00,821
This seems like a fairly general question, but this single item of

105
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:08,201
how would you rate your overall health status, has been shown to be a very robust indicator of someone's future health status.

106
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:15,071
So food insecure adults are reporting that they have poor overall physical health and poor overall health,

107
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:23,961
which has implications then for what's going to happen next. There's also been a number of mental health and cognitive outcomes.

108
00:12:23,961 --> 00:12:31,071
So food insecurity has been associated with poor mental health, greater mental or psychological distress,

109
00:12:31,071 --> 00:12:36,671
lower cognitive function, as well as higher levels of depression.

110
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:44,141
So going beyond health behaviors and physical health outcomes, we're also seeing several mental outcomes,

111
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:49,261
mental health outcomes that are associated with being food insecure in adults.

112
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:54,841
And then talking about chronic diseases, food insecurity has been associated with obesity.

113
00:12:54,841 --> 00:13:02,701
This has been predominantly found in adult women, less so in adult men and very mixed for children.

114
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:08,791
This association has also been called paradoxical because the idea that food insecurity,

115
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:18,241
which is supposed to represent not having enough money for food, is somehow associated with obesity, which we tend to think of as excess calories,

116
00:13:18,241 --> 00:13:25,911
that seems to be a very paradoxical association. But then if you think about our food environment and how food pricing works,

117
00:13:25,911 --> 00:13:32,161
it can be very expensive to eat a healthy diet and to have the resources to prepare all those foods.

118
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:40,741
It's much cheaper to eat convenience foods, ultra-processed foods, and those foods are definitely more prevalent in low income communities,

119
00:13:40,741 --> 00:13:46,451
and so that can be an explanation for why food insecurity is associated with obesity.

120
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:54,761
It's also been associated with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and elevated fasting glucose, as well as diabetes diagnosis.

121
00:13:54,761 --> 00:14:04,481
So we're seeing this cluster of cardio metabolic outcomes that are associated with obesity being more prevalent in food insecure adults.

122
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:09,901
And then finally, there's a fairly robust literature on glycemic control.

123
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:13,361
So this is among people who are diagnosed with diabetes.

124
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:19,661
But we know that people who are diagnosed with diabetes and are food insecure, are choosing between whether

125
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:26,381
they need to pay for their medication and their glucose monitoring supplies or paying for food.

126
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:36,341
And that tradeoff can be very stressful and lead to not being able to monitor someone's glucose well, leading to poor glycemic control over time,

127
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:42,191
more episodes of hypoglycemia, and more visits to the emergency department because of this.

128
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:46,841
So we see that food insecurity is a associated with health conditions,

129
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:52,181
a number of different health conditions, both for people who have not been diagnosed with a chronic disease,

130
00:14:52,181 --> 00:14:59,361
as well as for people who have and they have a harder time managing that condition.
