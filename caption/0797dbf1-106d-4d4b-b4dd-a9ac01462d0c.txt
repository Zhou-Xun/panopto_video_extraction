2
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:10,263
At the federal level, public health is
concentrated inside the Department of

3
00:00:10,263 --> 00:00:14,509
Health and Human Services, headed by the
Secretary of Health and Human Services,

4
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:17,330
a member of the president's cabinet.

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,880
Some examples of agencies that are under
Health and Human Services that you might

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,490
be familiar with include Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC.

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,540
Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services, or CMS.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,710
The Food and Drug Administration, or FDA.

9
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:37,240
And the National Institutes of Health,
or the NIH.

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,560
Let's go into some detail for
some of these agencies.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,770
First is the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.

12
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,340
It's traditional function is to
control infectious disease, but

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,680
it also conducts research,
produces health education materials,

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,960
trains a significant amount of
the public health workforce, and

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,200
collects a large number of
data on the nation's health.

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,190
There are also CDC offices
around the globe to provide

17
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,760
international public health aid.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,510
Where the CDC is more focused on
disease outbreak, the Food and

19
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,540
Drug Administration is
focused on health safety.

20
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,500
Some of these activities include
safety of manufactured foods,

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,780
safety of medical devices,
and safety of vaccines.

22
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,470
Each prescription drug that you
have in the medicine cabinet

23
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,580
went through a long and thorough
process to get approved for human use.

24
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,960
And that was facilitated by the FDA.

25
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,679
You might have heard of
the National Institutes of Health.

26
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:36,432
There are actually 28 institutes focusing
on a broad range of research that

27
00:01:36,432 --> 00:01:41,270
encompass areas such as cancer,
heart disease, aging, and mental health.

28
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,860
Of 28 institutes and centers,

29
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:51,010
three institutes consume approximately
40% of the total NIH budget.

30
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,570
These really large centers include
National Cancer Institute,

31
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,110
National Institute of Allergy and

32
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:01,340
Infectious Diseases, and the National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

33
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,580
In addition to research,

34
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,460
the federal government also controls
aspects of health insurance.

35
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,020
The Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services, or

36
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:14,020
CMS, is the administrative
arm of Medicare and Medicaid.

37
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,500
Medicare provides health insurance for
the elderly,

38
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,725
and this is primarily
a federal responsibility.

39
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:23,970
Whereas Medicaid provides health insurance
and nursing home care for the poor.

40
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,910
And this is a shared responsibility
between the federal and state governments.

41
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,660
There are also a number of federal
agencies that are not under HHS, but

42
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,018
impact public health.

43
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:38,740
These include the Environmental
Protection Agency, or the EPA.

44
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,060
The Department of Agriculture,
or the USDA.

45
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,980
The Department of Education, where health
education and school health resides.

46
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,755
And the Department of Veterans Affairs,
where health care for veterans occurs.
