1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,890
And there we go. There you. I do like that.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,969
So there you go. No. Okay, everybody, you hear me?

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:16,230
Okay. Despite that, the two of you agree you're good. And so for interrupting someone like that,

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:23,009
this is a the seminar series is meant for you guys to be interacting with people that you might not see on the basis.

5
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,339
Right? So feel free to ask me any questions you want and attempt to answer them.

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:33,510
I make no promises that I'll be able to give. And so today we're going to talk about bariatric surgery.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,900
Let's take a look at how many people think bariatric surgery is a crazy idea.

8
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:48,740
Well, okay, good. Like, why would we rip open your intestines and your stomach to fix a problem?

9
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,000
We should be able to fix some other way.

10
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:59,179
And I think that's a reasonable opinion and one that shared by a lot of people, by the fact of a lot of individuals with obesity.

11
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,770
Share that opinion about this. Right. That they have incorporated that into their.

12
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,270
But let me try to at least get you to understand. Right.

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,000
That what we're trying to do with your surgery is not it's not as plumbing oriented as you might think.

14
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:21,360
Right. So. So this is why we care about bariatric surgery.

15
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:30,530
So this is the Swedish outcome study where they followed patients in over a period of 14 years.

16
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,500
And what you see right is that patients with about 40% of their weight in the in the first year.

17
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:44,660
And one of the things you hear sometimes operative surgery is that everybody gains it all back.

18
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,980
That is just not true. Right. So what you see here is 14 years after surgery, right?

19
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,600
There's still a 30% below with it.

20
00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:01,610
Now, what I will do is I'll compare this today near everything else that we have to bring to the patients with obesity.

21
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,100
Right. And most of those I would like to.

22
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:15,130
That's what we can do now that we have better pharmacological tools now starting in the last five years than we and this figure would indicate.

23
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,550
But in general, this is what happens with most patients, is that getting them to lose some weight isn't a problem.

24
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,470
Getting them to keep in office.

25
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:33,730
And the what since bariatric surgery apart is not just the size of the effect, but the durability of that effect compared to almost anything else.

26
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,370
And we're going to try to talk to you it like, why does this happen? Right.

27
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,260
Again, one of the critical issues is this is actually a very old slide down.

28
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,479
Right. So again, it's probably clearly update, but that there are we know that coming with obesity, right,

29
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:56,320
there is at least 65 different diseases that are either made more prevalent or worse by an extant obesity.

30
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,389
And the question that you have to ask yourself about bariatric surgery is how many of these diseases are

31
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:10,780
actually also treated by bariatric surgery and how many of those have impacts that are weight independent?

32
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:15,760
Right. How much of what's happening there is merely because these individuals lost weight.

33
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:22,870
Right. Whereas there are other things that are happening when we change your body in this manner that is useful as well.

34
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,960
All right. So this is the three most common versions of bariatric surgery.

35
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,980
Adjustable gastric banding is almost not done at all.

36
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:42,300
It is on this slide because you will still see patients who've had adjustable gastric banding who show back up in clinics for one reason or another,

37
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,060
including to have that band removed right after the surgery.

38
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:53,430
All right. So the reason it's not used anymore, right, is because the it's a it's a band, right, that you put over it and then you inflate, right.

39
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,000
To make it hard to swallow. Right. It's a restricted procedure.

40
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:04,520
The problem is your stomach is a moving muscle, right? It's moving around underneath that band.

41
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:10,790
And so lots of them will erode over time. The band will erode into the stomach and something has to be done.

42
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,960
The other two are different. Right.

43
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:20,150
And again, are more common today. Right. Vertical side gastrectomy is actually the most common procedure.

44
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,620
It's about 80% of the procedures done here in the state of Michigan, right.

45
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,530
Our vertical sleeve district, and involves removing about 80% of your stomach.

46
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,980
That again is often considered a restricted procedure.

47
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,650
We have made your stomach small, right? So it is hard to get calories down your go.

48
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,370
On the flip side, this is a run by gastric bypass, which is considered a restrictive procedure.

49
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:51,380
I made that small pouch at the top that you can see there. That is supposedly the restrictive part.

50
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,840
And then we bypassed variable amounts of your small intestine.

51
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,870
Again, that is important for the absorptive capacity of your intestine with the idea that we're actually making it mal absorptive as well.

52
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:11,520
Now that is going to be the hypothesis that you'll get from surgeons about why it is that this work.

53
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,040
My boss is a bariatric surgery.

54
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:22,020
These are ridiculous ideas about how this works and the notion that we could sneak calories out of your rectum without you noticing.

55
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,150
That's not in the brochure. Right. But that is literally what it is that you're saying.

56
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,610
Right. And I spent my entire adult life studying body weight range.

57
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,370
Our bodies are not that dumb.

58
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:42,100
Our bodies are much more sophisticated way in which we're regulating our body weight that wouldn't be easily defeated by something this primitive.

59
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,110
So the question is, what is it that's going on?

60
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:55,210
So again, they said the version that you hear from most people think of this in mechanical terms, restriction or malabsorption.

61
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:03,730
But what's the alternative to thinking about that with the return of thinking of it in mechanical terms is to think of it in physiological terms.

62
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:12,700
We are changing the nature of the signals that come from our GI tract, that act on our brain, our liver or pancreas.

63
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:22,170
They may be indifferent, they may be neuronal, but they're changing the communication between your GI tract and your brain.

64
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,879
And again, what surgery does or if you start buying that, that's part of this.

65
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,590
I'm trying to prove this to you in a minute.

66
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:36,540
If you try to hide the fact that this is an idea that that's changing, signals will have to be true that those signals matter to begin with.

67
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:47,200
And part of how we regulate our body weight involves the GI, and that we are altering the nature of that signals in some way than that.

68
00:06:52,750 --> 00:07:01,620
Okay. So. I'm going to show you a comparison between vigorously and ruin my gastric bypass.

69
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,720
Notice something again, I should be clear. Those two servers don't look alike.

70
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,840
Right. They're very different in how a surgeon has to do them.

71
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:20,030
In fact, part of the reason that vertical sling gastrectomy is more popular is it's easier.

72
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,720
Right. You don't have to sew anything. Right.

73
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,370
So they're cutting away the stomach doesn't involve any sewing by because they

74
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,900
use an end to cut right and to cut heart rate cuts and staples as it goes.

75
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:39,840
Right. The wonderful invention that's made the world of laparoscopic surgery much easier,

76
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,220
but it makes that surgery relatively straightforward to do the ruin.

77
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,750
Why? It takes a different layer skill. They're different.

78
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:56,690
And the underlying hypotheses are that one is were just restrictive and one is restrictive enough.

79
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,870
Perfect would imply that they're different.

80
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,690
What I show you is, in fact, they're way more similar than you would think based on just the way you look at the anatomy.

81
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:12,450
So this is a trial that run in the Cleveland Clinic in which they took a patients and randomize

82
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,470
them to whether they were going to get medical management of their type two diabetes,

83
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,030
they were going to get a vertical signal, strikes me or ruin my gastric bypass.

84
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,480
And I can tell you the point of this study was to show that bypasses women.

85
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:34,060
But when you see very clearly is that in the case of both surgeries, in terms of weight loss,

86
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:41,020
it's clear that surgeries are much better than medical management and that medical management really what it means is an

87
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:48,759
endocrinologist talking to you about how it is you should get your diabetes control under and you should lose weight surgeries.

88
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,500
That's much better. And the point here, right, is that both surgeries do much better.

89
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,910
Now would say that the data here is pretty representative what you'll see in the literature,

90
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:04,540
which is that Rubin has a little bit better in terms of weight. But again, what do you see is the difference between surgery and not?

91
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,680
Surgery is enormous, regardless of which flavor of surgery you've got.

92
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:19,760
Now this is body weight, right? The issue in front of us is whether co-morbidities associated with obesity like type two diabetes also resolved.

93
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,000
And this is what you see.

94
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:31,480
So this is A1 CS in these patients and you see the medical management group, they lose almost one and a half points of their A1 seat.

95
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,379
That is, those are good endocrinologists doing a good job by those patients.

96
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,440
Right. To get one or two points on. Bariatric surgery is twice as.

97
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:52,770
And the percentage of patients who show true resolution of diabetes much higher in patients who have had surgery than patients who have had a medical.

98
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:59,729
And the important point for the conversation we're about to have is both leave and ruin.

99
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:10,350
Why do this? So whatever you may think about what the mechanisms are, it should be the common mechanisms that are the most interesting.

100
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,820
Right? The things that they share. Now, let me be super clear about something.

101
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,870
This does not mean that these are clinically equivalent and all individuals.

102
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:26,320
I can tell you that many surgeons have fanciful ideas about what it is,

103
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:31,570
which patients should get, which procedure that are not terribly based on data, to be honest.

104
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,110
But it does not mean that they're equivalent and they should be used equally.

105
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:42,430
But I would say that for the most part, we don't have great ideas about exactly who should be getting which procedure or great ways to separate.

106
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:48,580
So most surgeons, if you have extant type two diabetes, will push you towards getting a run.

107
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:55,330
Right. Even though, again, over this period of trial, you wouldn't see anything if this trial ran for a long time.

108
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,970
And you can find differences between the patients who got road Y and versus leave.

109
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:11,650
But again, you have to work hard to find those differences in terms of their diabetes and that most surgeons will push towards those who.

110
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:18,130
Look, if you go to a big bariatric center of excellence, most surgeons, if you have type two diabetes,

111
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:24,310
will tell you you should get a gastric bypass because it's better at treating type two or four type two.

112
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,180
Some will use weight cutoffs, too. Right. But if you're on the heavier end of the spectrum.

113
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,380
Right, they'll tell you that you need restriction and malabsorption.

114
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,550
Right. But you need both of those things. Right.

115
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:49,060
Given the nature of the two different surgeries where the blue and white looks fairly complex, are there differences in post-surgical complication?

116
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:59,319
Yes. So there are more acute post-op problems for patients who get ruined by gastric bypass because there's more

117
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:05,260
to leave and there's more problems that can happen in terms of what happens in the immediate aftermath.

118
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:11,260
What is true is that when you leak, the VSG leaks are more severe.

119
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:18,640
There are more problem. Right. There's they're easier fixes for a runway leak than there is at times for you.

120
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,620
So so, again, some of it. But just to be super clear, right.

121
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,960
The complication rates of the surgery is as low as it is to have your gallbladder.

122
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,640
Right. So these are at a well-run center.

123
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:40,520
Right. And complication rates are low. Did they observe the same with the duodenal switch or did they not?

124
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:48,370
Is it not too much work? Sorry. The serve the same like the same like glycemic control and weight loss with the duodenum switch.

125
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,750
Or is it lower? So so duodenal switch you can put into even another category, right?

126
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,100
It's not done very much. B it really is malformed.

127
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,450
Right? So, you know, one of the things I always say is like, you know, how much underwear do you own?

128
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:10,870
Right. Right. If you want to get the procedure, it is really clear that it is more effective for type two ed that is met.

129
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,900
Most of the patients will resolve their type two diabetes.

130
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:21,579
Right. To a switch. And then it's not done very much because of the complications for patients

131
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,350
afterwards are trying to manage their potential symptoms as well as the complex.

132
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,910
That is a harder procedure to do in the U.S. It's not it's not done very much at all.

133
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:37,190
In some European countries, it's done in a fair amount. Questions.

134
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:43,390
Okay. So he does look the same again.

135
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,050
At least we look at these really big outcomes.

136
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,650
So what I'm going to show you now, I apologize. I'm going to show you mostly now data from rats and mice.

137
00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:00,090
Why am I going to do that? I'm going to do that because it actually turns out that the rats and mice here

138
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:04,650
are actually really important to help us understand not just how this works, but that it does work.

139
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,840
And the reason I say that is you cannot do a double blinded, randomized controlled trial for surgery.

140
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,110
Nobody wants their surgeon to not know what surgery they're doing while they're doing it.

141
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,260
Right. The patients also have trocar holes. Right.

142
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,060
If you've got surgery, you know you've got surgery. There's no mystery to this.

143
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:27,760
Right.

144
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:35,070
And one of the things that's nice about the rodents is we do not have a registered dietitian telling them what they're supposed to do afterwards.

145
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,090
Right.

146
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:44,640
What you see in those animals is entirely the biological effect of the surgery, independent of any change in lifestyle you're trying to encourage.

147
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,990
Any instructions you want to give them, any knowledge they have about what's supposed to happen?

148
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:57,540
So again, we have built a variety of these models to try to help us understand this is a rat version.

149
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:04,520
And what you see is that, again, this is a vertical sleeve gastrectomy.

150
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:10,140
This has to be wrapped, will be something important for us. It's not going to matter very much with contraception.

151
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:16,530
And what you see is can you almost lose a tremendous amount of weight in the aftermath of the surgery?

152
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:22,260
And they do so in comparison to a group that, again, you can't run in humans, which is a sham operated control,

153
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,460
and we cannot put you under the knife to do something that we think doesn't work.

154
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:35,890
But that's super clear here. And this is looking at body fat, right?

155
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:42,880
So those first two bars are animals that are put on a high fat diet and they double their body fat as a function of being on that high fat diet,

156
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:49,930
that middle bar. Now we're going to give surgery and we're going to come back 34 days later and measure their body fat.

157
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,610
And what you see is that they have lost 50% of their body fat.

158
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:03,850
In just 3040. They then lost all of the access we did accumulate as a function of being on the high fat diet.

159
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,870
But they're still on the high fat diet, right?

160
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:17,239
They don't get to change their lifestyle as a function of it, which makes it weird at some level.

161
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,130
Right. Because we would never tell patients who are getting surgery, like just keep going through the McDonald's drive thru.

162
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,430
Right. It's not where we want to go and encourage them to do that.

163
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:33,260
But again, the biological effect of the surgery. Right. Is not dependent on the animal being able to change what it is that it's consuming.

164
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,470
The question is, how do lose this weight? And the answer is it's because it reduces food intake.

165
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:45,680
Right. And what you see here is, again, in the aftermath of the surgery, the animal greatly reduced its food intake.

166
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:54,140
That's how actually it was important on this graph was a part of the graph, as we see, is the animals go back to eating what they did before.

167
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:04,610
Where's the restriction? I guarantee you that we have opened up these animals and looked at their stomachs.

168
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:10,790
They're not dilated or stretched in any way on day 20 compared to what they are in.

169
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,510
Dana is exactly the same stuff.

170
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,900
Why does the animal go back to eating meat?

171
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,380
If it was a restricted procedure. That's not what should happen.

172
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:30,020
Anything in the restriction should keep preventing the animal from eating what it.

173
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:37,650
What it would normally. What I've argued to you, right,

174
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:43,860
is that what happens after surgery is that we have changed the defended level of weight that the animal thinks is appropriate.

175
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,650
I'm going to prove that to you. So.

176
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:55,170
This is an experiment where we took the animals that had surgery and then a bunch of control groups that didn't have you.

177
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,120
Don't worry exactly with the problems. But after they'd all got to a steady state in terms of their weight after the surgery.

178
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:06,310
So again, now the the animals who got surgery weigh less. They got 50% less body fat.

179
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:11,110
We're going to do it. We're going to force them into a diet. Right.

180
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,790
What's great about rats is they comply with the dietary recommendations.

181
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:21,699
We get them right. So we take away some of their food that they would normally eat each day and they

182
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,200
lose weight as a function of not having adequate access to enough calories.

183
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:32,320
We do that in all the groups. And then a day 21, we're going to give everybody back our live access to food.

184
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,910
If you thought the surgery was restrictive, what do you think would happen?

185
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:45,740
Well, the animals who had surgery had a very hard time regaining that lost weight because there there's a maximum which they can eat.

186
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,270
Right. Your stomach is only 20% of what it was before.

187
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:57,890
The other animals because they defend their weight, are going to overeat and they're going to gain the lost weight.

188
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,660
Right. So I'm going to change this graph a little bit and get everybody started, 100,

189
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,840
all four groups, because I don't want to look at the difference of the face.

190
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,040
I don't see the shape of the curve in terms of what they do to defend their weight.

191
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:23,090
What you see is that Ross, who had a vertical sleeve gastrectomy, defend their weight in a manner that is absolutely identical to the other groups.

192
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:29,650
They are defending a lower weight, but they are defending it nonetheless.

193
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:40,530
And the other reason I bug you with this is because patients have sometimes unrealistic expectations of what's going to happen after surgery,

194
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:48,190
that they're going to be able to lose as much weight as they want. No, they are going to lose, right.

195
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,130
What the biology tells them is appropriate.

196
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:54,480
Anything they want to lose out, that is going to be just as hard as it was to lose weight before the surgery.

197
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,230
All right. So again, whether that weight loss is adequate, whatever we mean by that or inadequate.

198
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:07,640
That is what the surgery delivered. Now, how do these animals recover their lost weight?

199
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:12,170
The answer is they overeat. So here again, the first part is animals.

200
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:17,070
Before we took away some of their food. And then the second part is after we get back out of our system.

201
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:23,090
They lost weight. They're hungry. They more there's still a control group to do the same thing.

202
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,690
And it also had a vertical sleep gastrectomy. They eat more.

203
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:33,500
That is how they catch up. Where's the restriction at the end of the 100% of what it did before the surgery?

204
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,000
Turns out you need 125% if I challenge the animal in the appropriate way.

205
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,130
And notice something. These animals right here.

206
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,010
On underweight right by outside perspective.

207
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:54,000
They're underweight, but they don't act like they're underweight.

208
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,620
They lost 50% of the body fat, but they don't overeat.

209
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:03,660
If I took an animal and starved it down to lose the trans fat, it'd be hungry and it would overeat.

210
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:10,110
These animals don't eat because they don't feel like they're underweight.

211
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,480
We have altered and lowered that defended level of weight in the animal.

212
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,389
And that's why when you the main conundrum about what happens after bariatric

213
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:27,030
surgery is that patients lose weight and they're less hungry when they do so.

214
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,960
Like almost everything else we do. We convince them to lose weight, but they're hungrier.

215
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:46,460
Other do. This is what? I'm going to do one more experiment to try to get to this point.

216
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:50,809
So this is female rats. I think we gave them vertical.

217
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,940
CBS directed your sham version of the control.

218
00:21:53,870 --> 00:22:01,160
And the trick of this experiment is that after you see that, they reduce their food intake just the way you'd expect, just like the males do.

219
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:06,479
After they get back to normal. Normal. I mean, their intake is normal.

220
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,810
They've lost weight. They're not steady state. We make these animals pregnant.

221
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:19,090
And they carry that pregnancy to term and they drop a litter of 12 to 14.

222
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:26,980
Happy little rat pups, right? Those 12 to 14 happy wrap ups have to eat.

223
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,920
Where do they get all their food? They get it from mom, right?

224
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,930
For the lactation. But that is an enormous caloric demand on mom.

225
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:42,129
And what you see is that mom more than doubles her food intake in order to keep up with that caloric.

226
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:49,300
To me, a mom with a very long sleeve gastrectomy doubles her intake to keep up with that caloric demands of.

227
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,330
Where's the restriction? The animal being 100% of what it did before I show you can do 125%.

228
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:06,560
It can double it if it needs to. This has nothing to do with the mechanically small stomach preventing the animal from deciding to consume more.

229
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,120
And this is here to remind me to say something.

230
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,850
But again, that isn't just always about how much we what we matters.

231
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:33,110
Right. I don't need to tell this audience that. Right. And again, the way we do these experiments in the Romans is weird, right?

232
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,760
Because we don't let them change anything about what they can eat and access to one nutritionally complete diet.

233
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:43,979
That's it. Right. But what would happen if we gave the animals a choice?

234
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,820
Remember, they've got no instructions about what's healthy and not healthy.

235
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,650
They don't. There's no frame of reference for the rat and the mice about this.

236
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,680
So what if we gave a choice after what? It looked different than it did before surgery.

237
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,089
Yeah. This is super hard to do in humans because they're getting instructions every

238
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:08,220
day about what it is they're supposed to be doing and what they write down.

239
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:14,270
Right. Probably driven as much by what they're told they're supposed to do as maybe what they did.

240
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:22,740
Right. There's big influences on their recall that matter about what their expectations that the person asking the question has as well.

241
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:33,780
Right. So one version of this experiment is to give the animals a jar of fat, a jar of protein, and a jar of carbohydrate and let them mix it up.

242
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,640
Rats are pretty good at being able to do this right.

243
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:45,520
They will have some issues with protein sometimes depending on the protein source, but they're mostly a consumer diet that is nutritionally adequate.

244
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:53,650
Now, if you thought the surgery was restrictive, how would you change what you're consuming?

245
00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:02,360
If I gave you those three choices. Prioritize fat or carbs.

246
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:06,840
Maybe, but not as much protein. Yeah, but I think your logic is down.

247
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,379
I would say the fat. Right. Because it's nine kilocalories per gram.

248
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:19,690
Right. Versus four. Right. So again, if you want to fit more calories into the small space, that is where it goes.

249
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:27,930
Right. But the animals actually do is exactly the opposite, which is the fact that they actually start consuming less fat and more.

250
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:44,500
Now, just to be clear here. Right. Patients after surgery can detect sweet solutions at lower concentrations than they did before they can detect it.

251
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:51,340
I think what you'll hear from lots of patients, right, is, oh, I used to like that, but it's too sweet for me now.

252
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,410
Right. The Kaaba using here.

253
00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:02,810
Right. Is not very sweet. Right. So what the way you ask the question matters to what outcome you get here.

254
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,819
Right. But what's super clear, right.

255
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:11,420
Is that the handles shift, what they do, the way they interact with their food environment is different when you give them options.

256
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,750
That has to involve their brain variety.

257
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:24,000
And there is no way that doesn't involve some change in their central nervous system as a function of the surgical alteration of their GI.

258
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:31,000
Okay. It's a weird experiment, right? Even in Michigan, we don't run into jars of pure fat.

259
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:37,860
Oh, that's right. So what do we do this way? What if we gave the animal nutrition complete high fat diet and nutrition, good, low fat diet?

260
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,280
By the way, our high fat diet tastes a little like sugar cookie dough.

261
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,180
So you'd like it to know that we have to keep it away from the grad students at the end of the month.

262
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:54,960
Right. If their pizza money has run out. Yeah. So is it that the animals like it better as well?

263
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:05,370
By a lot. And what happens after the surgery, however, is that almost all of that preference for the high fat diet goes away.

264
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:12,030
Right. They are now voluntarily consuming more of the low fat diet.

265
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,070
I'm not about to stand up here and get into the wars about fat and carbohydrate with you.

266
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,320
That is for another day and another time.

267
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:26,389
But I do guarantee you that everyone look at that low fat diet and say that's a healthier diet than the high fat diet.

268
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:29,510
That would be the animal is choosing the healthier diet.

269
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:35,300
Instructions is merely the biological response to the surge.

270
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,170
Here's a third version.

271
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:51,780
So one of the things you'll hear from surgeons to patients sometimes is don't eat a liquid diet because you'll eat your way around the restriction.

272
00:27:53,870 --> 00:28:02,939
And I can tell you, we use ensure here as the liquid diet for the animals that it does not matter one iota to the size of the surgical effect,

273
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,210
whether the animal's on solid diet or its on liquid, that doesn't matter.

274
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:12,120
Now on the other one liquid diet, you can do an interesting experiment so we can take and give them to balance one guy

275
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,530
to ensure the other bottles got to ensure that's just been cut with water by 50%.

276
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:20,640
So again, the same macronutrients now, but just less caloric density.

277
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,719
And when you see in general is the animals basically go for the more calorically

278
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,870
dense because why should I have to pee more often in order to get my calories?

279
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:37,770
Right. But when you give the animal a vertical sleeve gastrectomy, they now prefer the less calorically dense.

280
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:42,620
Very. Again, it doesn't fit easily with the restricted idea, right?

281
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:48,440
If you want color density to fit into that small tube, you should like that 100%.

282
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,630
But that's not what you.

283
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:58,300
Again, the point here is there's all this huge shift in the way the animal views the world and what it views as the appropriate that.

284
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:05,600
Just as a quick read, I'm assuming you did from vertical significantly because you do a comparison

285
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,520
between various leading run why you think that the three choice test they be.

286
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:18,679
Exactly yeah. Is there a mediation with the perceived needs.

287
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:23,980
Would they you. Wait baseline basically.

288
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,730
Not sure I understand the question.

289
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:35,450
So meaning when the analyst perceived energy needs of the animal right after the surgery since they have established a new baseline weight,

290
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,220
is there like a change in what you are saying?

291
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:49,880
Yes. And so there's some differences between rodents, which is super clear and human, and that after surgery, they're burning fewer calories.

292
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:56,089
Right. And some of that is if I take food away from you.

293
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:00,260
Right, your energy expenditures are going to start going down. Right. That's compensation.

294
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:07,760
The question is, so when you're when you're seeing these patients who lose, they're going to reducing their energy expenditure.

295
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,450
Are they doing it the right amount for the weight they have lost?

296
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:17,299
Right. So your point is, a smaller creature right after surgery leads less calories.

297
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,470
And that's absolutely true. And the question becomes and I will tell you, there's no easy answer to that.

298
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,220
Right. It has a lot to do with how you do the experiment, how you normalize the data.

299
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:30,410
And there is no agreed upon way in which we do this. Right, but it's clear that it goes down.

300
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:36,530
So it's not the case where their energy expenditure goes up. That is not a driver of their weight loss.

301
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:41,840
Right. It is almost entirely about food. And again, and that's true for the runway as well.

302
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:45,349
And it's not about losing calories in her feces.

303
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:48,900
Right. It's really about reducing the amount that you're pushing into the goal.

304
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:55,660
Okay. Why am I boring you with all of this? About what the animals do?

305
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,040
I'm doing it because I've had this conversation with a dozen surgeons.

306
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:05,350
I work for a bariatric surgery. I'm married to a surgeon. I come by my biggest surgeons.

307
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:08,380
Honestly. This is the conversation.

308
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,610
So they'll say, you know,

309
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:21,520
the reason my patients eat salads after the surgery is because I sat them down and I told them that they're about to make a serious decision and

310
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:30,340
they were going to involve themselves in a very large scale change that they take a serious commitment to doing better than they did before.

311
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,710
The endocrinologist who told them to do that two years ago. Not a serious person.

312
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,810
Right. It's weird. Right.

313
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:48,299
Right. So there are bariatric surgeons who believe that it's that deep baritone voice in which they deliver

314
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:55,620
these instructions that matters compared to the fact that I'm going to rearrange your anatomy here.

315
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:02,430
And. And again, having that misperception is not without consequence.

316
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:11,190
Right. If you're a patient who has bariatric surgery six months, a year later,

317
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:15,989
two years later, you're going back to the surgeon and you think that it's inadequate.

318
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,230
You know, that the surgeon's going to think that your weight loss was inadequate.

319
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:27,020
Whose fault is it? Right.

320
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:33,950
If the surgeon has told you you have to do these things before you're going to get any better, this surgery is just a tool.

321
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:40,110
Right. You're going to have to do all this work, right, for surgery to be effective.

322
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,480
And then you don't lose the weight. You're going to think it's your fault.

323
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:50,470
Are you going to go back to that surgeon? Can I tell you it's going to be hard.

324
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,650
Please. Would this be a good procedure for somebody who's like.

325
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,570
Oh, like they could be like, oh, listen. Like, it could be like a genetic factor.

326
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:04,650
Obesity. So. So, again, we have relatively few patients, right.

327
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,880
Who have mono genetic obesity. Right.

328
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,980
Where we can say that gene is screwed up and that's the reason for your weight.

329
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:20,950
There they exist, right? But it's a relatively small percentage of those. We know that there's a huge genetic load right, in terms of their obesity.

330
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:28,080
But identifying these specific genes is hard. Right. So if you look at these where we have like clear causes, right.

331
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:34,030
So again, these are primarily mutations in the MSI for receptor gene.

332
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,540
The data is right that they lose weight.

333
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:43,150
But on average, compared to what you'd expect from an equal BMI patient is that they don't lose quite as much.

334
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,280
If you look at patients who have hypothalamic obesity.

335
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,459
Right. So a tumor or other damage to their brain.

336
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:56,320
Right. That causes weight gain. Again, we have very small sample sizes for this.

337
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:02,860
Bariatric surgery seems to be pretty effective in those case. But you're asking the right question.

338
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:09,630
Right. So again, if. It's surgery is not it's physiological, right?

339
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,170
What you'd expect is that there should be variance in the outcome. Right.

340
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,580
Why you ended up at the weight you were. Matters to what it is.

341
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:22,230
What treatment will be effective. Including surgery. If. If surgery was just mechanical.

342
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:26,250
If it was just me wiring your jaw shut. Why are your jaw shot will work.

343
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:29,280
It does not matter what it is.

344
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:39,090
The underlying etiology for your obesity rate with surgery, again, it varies in individuals in terms of its effectiveness.

345
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:42,650
There's a genetic load to that variance. Right.

346
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:47,940
So if you take individuals who are first degree relatives and compare their surgical outcomes, they're very similar.

347
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:51,870
If you take people who live together but aren't first degree relatives and get surgery,

348
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:55,020
so they share some elements, the environment, they're quite disparate.

349
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:00,500
Right. So there's a huge genetic load. We don't know what those genes are.

350
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:07,620
We don't have genetic tests that allow us to say this is a good candidate for surgery, but we should be able to get there someday.

351
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:14,040
And it seems like you wouldn't expect everybody to respond to the same diabetes medication, right?

352
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:19,710
Some people respond drug a better than drug be. That's exactly should be the case for surgery, right?

353
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:27,420
It's a physiological manipulation of your thing is not a forced rule based on us stapling things.

354
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:34,240
Right. That makes it. So don't.

355
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:42,180
The issue about how you view this is that many people are putting the causal arrow in the wrong direction.

356
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:49,889
Right. They believe that the behavior of the individuals is driving the weight loss and

357
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:54,690
that if you don't engage in the behavior right and follow the instructions,

358
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:58,349
you won't get the weight. But again, that points to cause we're in the wrong direction.

359
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:02,250
Right. If the spirit of the surgery doesn't have a good biological effect in you,

360
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:07,830
you're no more likely to change your behavior than you were two years before.

361
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:12,480
Right. But animals change their behavior.

362
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,040
Right. There's no reason for them to do that other than the fact that we change the signals that are coming from their changes.

363
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,930
So do you think there's a benefit like the required like nutrition counseling that they have

364
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:35,809
for the 4 to 6 or like sort of 2 to 6 sessions beforehand on overall compliance later on?

365
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:44,360
Like, do you think that those are even necessary at the surgeries? So yeah, there are there are two parts to what happens here usually, right?

366
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:52,490
So one is many insurance companies require patients to go through a medically supervised weight loss program before surgery.

367
00:36:54,910 --> 00:37:04,230
Some companies require that you fail to lose weight, too, that some companies require that you succeed in losing weight before they give you.

368
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:10,150
Sir. What is super clear is it does not matter to the outcome whether you fail or succeed.

369
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,360
Now you're also asking about what happens before, but also what happens after.

370
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:17,290
Right. So anything that isn't there.

371
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:26,290
There are there are complex issues that happen after the surgery involved in their nutrient loads, how they deal with various symptoms,

372
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,850
the complexity of their life after surgery and how they deal with the environment they now live in.

373
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:41,470
All of those can require some intervention and some people are going to respond better to those to those behavioral interventions.

374
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:46,320
I'll use that term loosely for now. Right. And so we want to maximize the benefit to the patient.

375
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:50,500
Right. And I don't really care what percentage with any individual patient,

376
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,650
I don't care what percentage came from the surgery and what came from the instructions.

377
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,570
Right. I would argue that most of the weight loss benefit of the surgery.

378
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:04,020
Right. Is not very driven by the. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't be trying.

379
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:10,620
We should absolve ourselves from just doing anything right and let the wonder of the hospital afterwards and never come back.

380
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:18,000
I'm not advocating that. But I do think we spend way, much way more time discussing all of that than,

381
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,900
in fact, actually doing what is really what really drives the underlying for now.

382
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:29,910
Are there practical things that you do that you though, like pre-surgery that you need to kind of for the liver side, too?

383
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:36,180
Yes. Yeah. So. So she's very elegant when you're doing these laparoscopic procedures, particularly on individuals with obesity.

384
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:41,250
You have to get around their liver. Right. And that's part of the trickiest parts of the surgery.

385
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:46,170
If you lose some weight ahead of time, your liver will shrink disproportionately.

386
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,790
Right. So again, as the liver smaller than it gets, it is much easier to do the surgery.

387
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:57,510
So that becomes an issue now of using the effective weight loss medications that we have right for some of these patients pre surgery.

388
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,390
But now, again if they lose a lot of weight to the medication, do you want to should they go through the surgery?

389
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:14,280
So I'm going to tell you again, this is one of the weirdest things about trying to treat obesity as a as a thing.

390
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:18,120
There is no cure pathway. Right.

391
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:21,630
So the people who wind up in the surgery waiting room.

392
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:25,560
Right. Are some of the people who decided to go there, maybe got referred by a physician,

393
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:30,030
but there's no one in our clinic where I looked at this data two years ago,

394
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:40,050
less than 8% of the patients who are now signed up to get surgery have tried any weight loss medication less than 8%,

395
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:47,880
less than 8%, even though the basically the guideline is to first try lifestyle modification, then pharmacotherapy then.

396
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:57,510
So again, who's going to get in front of it there? So we have much better tools than we did in five years ago.

397
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,070
We're going to have better tools in the next six months. Right.

398
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:06,790
But who's going to use them? So so the patients are in a dilemma, right?

399
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:12,120
They are. It's not the surgeon's job to try out these medications.

400
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,630
Right. And and do the work with the patient. Right. To figure that. Right.

401
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:23,850
Whose job is the primary? So, again, if you're a primary care physician, you have 14 minutes to see a patient.

402
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:28,110
Right. How deep do you want to get into their weight history?

403
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,330
It's a hard conversation to have. Right.

404
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:36,870
And then to bring up the issue about using pharmacotherapy and deciding which one and how you're going to do it.

405
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:42,200
It's a tough job. And again, I'll be really flipping about this a minute and say, like,

406
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:48,210
if you are a primary care physician and you ignore somebody's cardiovascular disease, that's malpractise.

407
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:52,410
Right. If you ignore their weight, that's Tuesday.

408
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,380
Right. That's true. All right.

409
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:03,060
So again, that's not malpractise right to ignore the way, even though everybody in this room understands how big an impact on their health that is.

410
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:07,890
Right. But we we don't do this very well, period.

411
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:12,690
It doesn't pay. Is going to surgery pains. Right.

412
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,950
Right. There is there is there is RV use at the end of the surgery.

413
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:23,280
That is not true. Right. Either for taking care of individuals with obesity or type two diabetes.

414
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,840
So again, that's why this happened.

415
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:35,249
It's not because we we haven't designed it this way. The version that you have would be exactly the way you would designed it.

416
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:41,000
Right? You would start with the most conservative version of intervention, right?

417
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:44,760
And work your way up the scale. And again, surgery would be at the end of that scale.

418
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:50,700
Now, most of these individuals who end up getting surgery had you wasn't with they just wandered in off the street.

419
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,950
Right. They have been dealing with this over a long period.

420
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,740
They have tried many, many things in their lives to try to do better and have not been successful.

421
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:04,170
All right. So but again, are they doing that in a medically clear way?

422
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:09,660
We didn't get hypertension, right? We start with drug. We increase the dose with lifestyle modification.

423
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,810
We start with trying to get your salt out of your diet again.

424
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:17,280
And we figure out if we keep working and treating until you get the goal right.

425
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:23,000
At least that's the ideal version of what we do, right? That's not the way we deal with obesity.

426
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:27,990
And so surgery has come up again, is affected, but it's still the most effective thing we have.

427
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:36,360
But how we deploy it, I think it's about 200,000 individuals a year in the US are getting bariatric surgery.

428
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:44,700
So compared to the population that's eligible to meet the criteria, it's close to 100 million to meet the criteria.

429
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:51,299
And what is the criteria right now? And so things have been changing.

430
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,960
So I'm not sure I'm going to give you the exact version of the most up to date version.

431
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:03,630
But in general, right, it's you have to have a BMI of 30 or more with the comorbidity or 35 and above with that.

432
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:10,140
Oh, so that changed recently. Used to be like 37 and 40.

433
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,560
So again, these have been moving around. Right.

434
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:18,250
And again, some of it's driven by insurance companies and their decisions about what's appropriate and what's happened and,

435
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:26,879
you know, the NIH version of this. So the NIH is actually putting together a new consensus conference to actually revise their old standards.

436
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,630
So I'm hoping that that will get a much clearer. But again, which co-morbidities.

437
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:37,210
But they don't. They all come to the same right.

438
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:40,820
At some level. Which is probably not the right version of it.

439
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,330
Again, this goes to what are the scaling systems for individuals obesity rates.

440
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:51,680
We have a lot of these our new scaling systems that probably should be used for for how severe are your obesity related diseases?

441
00:43:51,950 --> 00:44:00,799
Right. And again, and that we should be using the most aggressive things for the people with the most other common comorbidities.

442
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,120
I assume some of those capabilities are actually get in the way of being able to safely have surgery.

443
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:12,170
It's start it's certainly not when you are going to do bariatric surgery for a living.

444
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:19,460
You know, you're starting out with patients already, right? Every day raising patients who have going to a high risk for complications.

445
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:25,630
Despite that, though, again, the complication is relatively low. But you're absolutely right and it's there.

446
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,970
And so getting part of the pre surgical stuff. Right, is to try to figure out who who's who can do this.

447
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:38,030
Right. Because, again, there is compliance isn't the right word from my point of view, but there is things that have to be able to do after surgery.

448
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:44,330
Right. And again, some patients are ready to do this, as I've you know, what is it like?

449
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,200
What is a day in the life of a patient after having surgery?

450
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,760
Not the day after, but like months after it is laying down?

451
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:56,059
Yeah, like, like six months later.

452
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:59,540
Like, what are they eating? Like how? You know, I don't know. Kind how different.

453
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,660
Doesn't look so good.

454
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:09,330
Patients can will tell you lots of different things about what happens in their life.

455
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:13,979
I think there is a really nice story in The New York Times that actually followed

456
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:19,320
two patients from U-M over the period of two years and got this report of a bat,

457
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,920
talked to them over and I don't have the reference. I think I'm sure you can find it.

458
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:27,210
Gina Carlotta la Torre is the find it and put it at the site.

459
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,480
And what she heard from those patients is what I hear as well.

460
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:40,020
Almost all the patients say, boy, you know, can I have less pain and less joint pain?

461
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:43,650
And it's easier for me to do my day to day activities.

462
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:50,820
But I have I am often still disappointed with the weight loss that they have achieved.

463
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:59,280
And there's often a lot more social complications to their life if it's successful or if it's unsuccessful.

464
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:03,990
There are different sets of more social complications to the way their life than they had anticipated.

465
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:11,530
When you when you just look at them, when you do nonrandomized trials right now,

466
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:17,230
just taking a look at patients and looking at matched controls, patients who've had bariatric surgery live longer.

467
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:22,930
They have reduced rates of cardiovascular disease and reduced rates of type two diabetes.

468
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:29,020
They have they they live longer. But a big hunk of that is actually reduced rates of cancers.

469
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:37,020
So again, you know, if you if you ask me, then what the world should look like, right?

470
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:44,800
It should be patience. One of the things that you look for our patients who who really do need potentially are at risk for knee and hip replacements.

471
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:51,910
Right. And that this would be a way to at least put off some of those knee and hip replacement, if not avoid them altogether.

472
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,579
That is not usually part of the criteria, I can tell you.

473
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:59,950
But that would that would be a sensible way to think about the system as a whole, both monetarily and for the patients.

474
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:06,010
But that's what they'll tell you, right? I have a lot of pain. For the reduced hatch of cancer.

475
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:11,829
Is that compared to base either version of either version?

476
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:17,980
If you compare to two group of individuals who had their pre-surgery BMI or their post-surgery BMI, right.

477
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:22,810
Their their cancer rates are lower, lower, lower.

478
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:28,810
And a big hunk of that is actually good. Remember, 80% of the people who are getting surgery are female.

479
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:39,640
Right. But that's who signs up for these them. So reduced breast cancer is a breast cancer rate is a very large difference between one and.

480
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:49,120
And again, that the idea they get even lower than the BMI, you get to know, first of all, almost no patient achieves a normal BMI.

481
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:57,030
Right. And again, I think that's one of the issues about the patients who I didn't lose as much weight as I wanted to do.

482
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:01,170
Also, obviously, when you lose that much weight to or there's lots of cosmetic issues that go with it.

483
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:09,990
So again, removal of skin again is actually is a procedure is probably is at least as dangerous as the runway itself or the BSG.

484
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:15,730
But again, it's a cosmetic issue. Who's paying for that? Right. Some insurance companies do some good.

485
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:20,590
How do you deal with those issues? Right. And it turns out to be something that a lot of patients are.

486
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:26,920
How would you? I will tell you one other thing that doesn't get discussed very often, but I think it's clearly true.

487
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:32,680
Right. There is a small increase in suicidality that occurs in the immediate aftermath of the surgery.

488
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:37,959
So it is not clear what that comes from. But I can tell you one thing.

489
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:44,650
Right. Is in both surgeries. Right. You have changed the peak of any oral psychotropics they were take.

490
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:51,159
Right. So somebody who's worked hard to get to to figure out the dosing and drug choices.

491
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,520
Right. You have now screwed with a bunch of that. Right.

492
00:48:54,790 --> 00:49:02,019
And so I think, again, that underappreciated version of what's going to happen to like three or four and it's like a standard,

493
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:05,229
how many psychiatric visits do they usually have to have get?

494
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:09,640
Remember, I'm not a real doctor. I watch wrestling. I watch rats eat for a living.

495
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,200
So I don't know off the top of my head. They go through an extensive hearing.

496
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:21,280
You have to go through an extensive pre psych about and there is the equivalent of the of a tumor board.

497
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:25,870
It's a tumor board. Right. Brings all the various docs and insights for this patient.

498
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:32,650
Right. What are we supposed to do. Right. And they do the same thing that includes the dieticians, the people doing the psych of hours,

499
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:37,000
the the social workers, as well as the physicians decide.

500
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,080
And they sit down and say, okay, this is a patient that we think, right.

501
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,490
Would do well on this, or this is a patient that we don't think is ready.

502
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:49,900
Just to add, in three weeks from now, we actually do have a dietitian that's coming in for somebody who actually does geriatric clinical,

503
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:55,209
who can probably answer some of these nuanced questions about that are more procedural that might

504
00:49:55,210 --> 00:50:02,140
be helpful for you to some questions know I'm totally fine with this version of the work itself,

505
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:10,510
so I do not need to use slides for that. I'm happy to ask you about going back to the like how you're saying like the suicidality goes

506
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:15,630
up like that and you're talking about like medications when they're on medications previously,

507
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:19,030
like do they have to decrease doses or like how does that work?

508
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:27,310
So again, whose job is to figure that out? And the answer is it's not obvious.

509
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:33,370
But what usually happens is the patient goes back to whoever prescribed it and says, you know,

510
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:37,300
I'm having these issues and that person tries to figure out what it is that they're trying to do.

511
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:42,179
You don't do it. Sophisticated surgical environments, right.

512
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:47,650
Can do better jobs at identifying these problems ahead of time and trying to get patients at least alert until these issues.

513
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,690
Another one, right, is is alcohol intake. Right.

514
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:56,330
So you can the peak for alcohol is way different, right?

515
00:50:56,350 --> 00:51:05,500
Way different. One patient described to me that I could she said, I can go from tipsy to I love you in about 10 minutes.

516
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:10,370
And she said, I can be sober again 20 minutes later. Right.

517
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:18,970
Like like so but and and that sort of high dynamic range of of alcohol, psychological effects.

518
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:27,790
Right. And that is, is associated with increased abuse potential by drugs that hit you hard.

519
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:30,520
Right. Quickly. Right. But have more abuse potential.

520
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:36,520
So now, again, this is actually been something we've been trying to figure out in the animals to try to get to figure out where.

521
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:41,890
But it turns out rats don't really want to drink alcohol. They're smarter than we are.

522
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:47,860
And if you remember, there's all of these different social things that are happening to them, right?

523
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:53,620
As they as they've lost weight, their social lives may change in a way, again, that may lead them to to consume more alcohol, too.

524
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:57,070
Right. So it's hard to parse all of this out in terms of what it is that's changing.

525
00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:01,150
Again, all of these effects are relatively small, so don't make them bigger than they are.

526
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:08,830
But they're real. They're real effects of this. A The percentage of women versus men who have the surgery, 80%.

527
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:14,580
Female Do you think that's driven socially mostly, or that there's more of it?

528
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:19,460
You don't matter if you if you're going to run a trial, right?

529
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:23,380
For a weight intervention, it does not matter what that weight intervention is.

530
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:27,760
80% of people who sign up are going to be right.

531
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:35,440
For my interpretation is that women see it more of as an issue that needs to be dealt with than most men average age.

532
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:40,190
Thank you again. It's probably a late forties.

533
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:49,390
Early fifties is the average age. Any more studies on the fertility changes after the.

534
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:54,820
Yeah. So the and this is controversial.

535
00:52:55,210 --> 00:53:06,160
We've done some of this work. Others have as well. It's super obvious that the fecundity goes up, meaning the likelihood of pregnancy goes up a lot.

536
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:12,610
And you look at the in the rodent models, right.

537
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:20,140
The offsprings have metabolic problems. Right. They are small for gestational age and and have some metabolic.

538
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:26,380
And in the the human literature is more complicated because there are these studies that show that,

539
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,980
again, you're making mom better, metabolically, she's healthier.

540
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,400
Right. And does that make it confer a metabolic benefit on to the child?

541
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:37,960
And there have been arguments and data that would say that that's I'm skeptical of those personally.

542
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:44,080
Right. But. So, for instance, women with PCOS.

543
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,650
Right. Can one of the best treatments are PCOS. Right.

544
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:55,750
Even the HIRSUTISM gets better and much more likely to be able to conceive of the only way to do this.

545
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,990
But it definitely is there.

546
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:03,610
Like, say you're three years out versus ten years out.

547
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:09,150
Is there like a difference in overall like metabolic outcomes or even controlling?

548
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:19,450
So I don't know. For fertility. Most most surgical obstetric and the woman is of childbearing age will tell them not to get pregnant for.

549
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:26,500
I think that's mostly out of concerns about surgical complications as opposed to data driven about that.

550
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:37,970
That's when it's safe to say for the child right to do it. But that's what the usual advice shouldn't be until the woman has, like, a constant weight.

551
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:43,370
Yeah. Or sterilized losing weight anymore. I mean, I think there is some sense to that.

552
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:48,440
But I don't again, I don't think there's anything that's I don't think the standard advice looks at self-esteem.

553
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:53,409
And I think, again, it does how to read because of the the increase in functioning.

554
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:58,400
It happens quickly. Right. So, again, if not using protection.

555
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:03,740
Right. The potential for becoming pregnant relatively soon after surgery, is that.

556
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:11,900
Okay. It's boring.

557
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:23,719
So I'm going to give you one last little bit of a vignette here. And let's turn to all of you.

558
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:32,470
Remember how bile acids work. Right. One of the things about glasses, right, is they're obviously they're surfactants, right.

559
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,120
They're necessary for lipid absorption. I have to tell you something.

560
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:45,250
But they're also out there signaling they interact with receptors and those receptors come in a couple of variations.

561
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:50,800
One is a cell surface receptor called TGR five. The other is a nuclear receptor called effects are.

562
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:56,330
So again, it's clear that those receptors were on things outside the GI tract.

563
00:55:56,540 --> 00:56:05,680
So again, bile acids circulate their hormone. What's interesting is that after bariatric surgery, the circulating levels of those hormones go up.

564
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:13,730
This happens to be BSG but is true for ruin y as well. But again, it's a weight independent effect.

565
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:15,339
Right. So we have a perfect group here. Right.

566
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:23,110
So what that means is the animal got a sham version of proceed procedure, but we only let it eat as much as the animal had the BSG.

567
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:27,530
Right, so that it will lose weight but isn't happy about it.

568
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:32,700
But that does not cause their bile acids to go.

569
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:38,220
Does this matter? So here's the kind of experiments that happen in my lab all the time.

570
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:46,980
Right. So what we did was to take an animal that's genetically modified to not have ethics are at the nuclear receptor for bile acid.

571
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,380
And we gave it surgery. Right.

572
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:57,690
If the bile acids matter and that matters because they act on nuclear receptors like effects are, then that animals should respond less to surgery.

573
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:02,580
So here is the body weight change in wild type normal mice.

574
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:08,220
And here is what happens. In the out answer is they don't lose any.

575
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:19,950
If you look at the body fat, but also body fat, if you look at their food intake, that's a good thirst reduction.

576
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:23,550
Food intake and normalize doesn't happen in the dark.

577
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:31,050
And here's the thing. The surgeons made the stomachs just as small in the knockout animals as they did in the wild seven.

578
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:42,170
A small stomach is not sufficient to give you the benefits of vertical sleeve gastrectomy if you do not have bile acid signaling effects.

579
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:52,469
Again, it's a signal. So what that means, right, is that the more we understand this,

580
00:57:52,470 --> 00:58:00,070
the more that we can try to go after those underlying mechanisms that doesn't involve the same numbers of staples and colors.

581
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:14,100
So this would be kind of boring. And so what we did was to move the bile acids without doing any restriction or malabsorption.

582
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:20,040
So we literally stuck a catheter into the bile duct and diverted the bile acid

583
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,670
that would normally go into the duodenum and shoved them into the vegetable.

584
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:32,970
When you do that, you get an increase in the circulating bile acids, say mimic that part of surgery.

585
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:37,830
You get a 50% decrease in body fat and an improvement in glucose regulation.

586
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:42,950
All without having touched the stomach. All without any restriction.

587
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:46,500
All done. Emails. This is not safe.

588
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,850
We can't do this on patients. Bile ducts are very delicate things.

589
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:54,060
The first thing you learn right as a GI, surgeons don't touch that.

590
00:58:56,010 --> 00:59:00,600
But the point is, we don't have to live with the types of procedures we have today.

591
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:06,569
Right. If it is about signals, then there are ways that we can go about trying to figure out those signals and

592
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:10,860
reverse engineer this into things that are that are more patient friendly.

593
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:21,580
And I'll just point out like. We couldn't do bariatric surgery on all the patients who meet the criteria, even if we thought that was the right idea.

594
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:28,900
In 200,000, what we do today. Maybe we could do 400,000 or five, but we could run out of beds.

595
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:35,150
But you run out of surgeons, right? There's just there is no way to scale this as a solution for everyone.

596
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:46,120
And so part of what I spend my time doing is figuring out how I put the bariatric surgery business, how to do this without I mean, so I'll stop there.

597
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:49,660
But I'm happy to take questions or just because I want to get back to the idea before we

598
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:56,650
asses this removing of the gallbladder change that I know how to keep the bile ducts.

599
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,940
So why do the bile acids go up?

600
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:08,860
Right. So if in lieu of doing this and my gallbladder moves, I find a hole.

601
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:15,730
That's not the other thing. How does how is that procedure that you did differ from removing all matters?

602
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:22,420
So so you still have adequate parts without your gallbladder, right?

603
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:27,310
You deliver just makes it and dumps it in a relatively unregulated way into your intestine.

604
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:32,700
And actually, a mouse doesn't have a goal.

605
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:43,010
But yeah, it turns out there's very few gallbladder removals in my view.

606
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,990
Their insurance companies always denied it.

607
01:00:48,370 --> 01:00:53,709
But so you don't need one, right? As you are walking evidence up and you're right.

608
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:59,200
So again, what happens in that situation? This really it's coming in relatively unregulated into a new location.

609
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:03,490
Again, you're not having the squeeze pump right there when you eat a pizza.

610
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:09,320
Right. That in fact, now you're getting a burst of violence in the bar since we're in there, you know,

611
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:13,450
a huge excess compared to what you need, which is why you recycle them and reuse them.

612
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:17,469
So again, the question I thought you were asking on the answer anyway,

613
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:22,720
even though you didn't ask it, is why do why do the biohazards go right, right after?

614
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:29,110
Obviously, we haven't manipulate anything about it. Right? It turns out the reason is because the liver stops taking them back up again.

615
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:35,750
How did the liver know that? I changed the stomach.

616
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,380
That kind of 80% of stuff. I don't know the answer to that.

617
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:47,009
But again, the liver changes a lot after surgery. And this is one of the things and it's one of things that matters to why the surgery works.

618
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:52,290
Fred's delivery is changing the way his handling of my life. Is it reverse like nonalcoholic, fatty liver disease?

619
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:59,260
So the best the best version we have for Nash, not wholly, but for Nash is bariatric.

620
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:04,650
Now, it's not because they lose so much weight, because weight loss absolutely helps.

621
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:09,480
Not clear. Right. And that's something we've been trying to address in the animal models as well.

622
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:15,840
But it's by far, we don't have very good treatments for Nash, and this is a huge issue for it,

623
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:20,880
that it's getting bigger all the time in terms of, again, obesity related co-morbidities.

624
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,940
Right. And we don't do with type two diabetes.

625
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,950
We actually have a fair number of things we could do for hypertension and various cardiovascular diseases.

626
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:35,460
But but for Nash, we don't have very much. And so, again, this goes to the issue of who should be getting bariatric surgery.

627
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:41,550
Well, if you only had 200,000 slots and you wanted to allocate them to the patients who would benefit the most.

628
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:45,570
Again, patients with Nash might be the ones at the top of the list.

629
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,350
That's not the way we do this today. When it's confirmed that it is co-morbidity.

630
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:54,480
Is it like cardiovascular disease? Is it in terms of who has surgery?

631
01:02:54,900 --> 01:03:00,350
Yeah. When you say like this number and a co-morbidity, what's that co-morbidity they're typically looking at?

632
01:03:00,370 --> 01:03:04,220
I could be GERD. It could be something as simple as GERD. Yeah.

633
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:07,710
Because GERD is a complement because it's a GERD gets worse after VSG.

634
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:16,829
But but but again, there's a whole bunch of these for. These are all insurance things, but these are not it's clear for type two diabetes.

635
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:20,920
Right. That you can you can resolve people's type two diabetes with bariatric surgery.

636
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:26,670
Some percentage of patients will actually go off all of their diabetes meds and be relatively normal people.

637
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:35,070
But there's not a plan, right, without a plan to use it that way.

638
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:42,210
Sleep apnea. Right. So, again, a huge issue. Almost everybody reduces the pressure on their CPAP.

639
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:45,260
Some people don't get to throw their CPAP away.

640
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:52,280
We have good evidence in the animal models that that's a weight independent of sleep with a hyper Kaplan ventilator response.

641
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:58,500
It gets compromised in obesity, right. And gets restored in after surgery in a weight independent fashion.

642
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:05,060
So you can see why I spend my time doing this, at least.

643
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:08,750
It's because bariatric surgery is not just a clinical tool. It's a research tool.

644
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:14,360
Right? All this things means that the. The GI tract is involved in breathing.

645
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:22,340
Right? It's possible that all of these other processes that we didn't really understand anyway, again, that bariatric surgery helps us.

646
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:25,829
Really. In the memes photos.

647
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:31,680
Do you also give them like the multivitamin that you would normally give to people or do they choose that?

648
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:35,010
That is a more interesting question.

649
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:44,080
So one of the things so one of the things that happens after surgery, right, is that people are more likely to get iron based on these.

650
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,740
Right. That is usually thought of as a as an absorption problem.

651
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:57,120
Right. Did not clear why it would be in BSG because you still have the iron and where you're absorbing all your iron in the room and y you can see.

652
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:00,600
Right. And bypassing much of the absorptive capacity. That's why of the problem.

653
01:05:01,290 --> 01:05:06,240
So again, people leave the hospital with detailed instructions about supplementing their iron.

654
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:10,050
There's also a bunch of other can live insoluble vitamins.

655
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:17,280
So you can get beriberi, right? Some patients will come back with beriberi if they're a particularly lackadaisical.

656
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:21,000
What's interesting in their minds, if we ever give them any iron supplements.

657
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:31,959
It turns out that iron version just that the the system wants the ions to be lower and so you can show this in the mice.

658
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:34,960
When you try to supplement the ion in the mice, they stop absorbing it.

659
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:40,030
Not because of the surgery, because their intestines just stop absorbing. Right.

660
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:46,720
So it can you tell people your ion is low, take your ion and they say, I did.

661
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:50,290
And you say, no, you didn't look at your ion. Who didn't?

662
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:55,510
The physiology of the system is different and that physiology leads to a lower level of ion overall.

663
01:05:56,140 --> 01:06:01,240
And that leads you to be more risk for animals. But it's also, again, part of the intestinal mechanisms.

664
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:04,840
Right. That are involved in that are part of the things that drive some of the benefit of certain.

665
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:14,120
And we did three papers on my last year. Questions.

666
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:18,480
Problems. Complaints. So.

667
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:24,050
So, again, I hope the one thing you get out of this right is understanding that you may still feel good.

668
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:32,760
The introduce a crazy idea that it is a big A taking a hammer to something that needs a nuanced response.

669
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:38,240
But would you hopefully get this right? Is that what happens after surgery is not is also nuanced.

670
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:44,310
It is mechanistically driven. It is not about the mechanics.

671
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:46,590
It is not about how. So here's what's fun.

672
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:51,990
So I go to these surgical meetings right now, give them all this stuff about like, you know, the restriction doesn't matter.

673
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:58,620
The next speaker will start arguing about what the right size of the BSG that's so they a boozy right that's what

674
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:04,109
they put in the stomach so they can they cut along that booty and they'll be arguing about how big the boogie is,

675
01:07:04,110 --> 01:07:07,230
should be like how much restriction is necessary.

676
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:12,690
And you just want, I want to shoot myself, right? Because you didn't listen to anything I just said.

677
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,650
You get the points. And I'll tell you one other anecdote.

678
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:24,120
Right? So surgeons who have patients who have inadequate weight loss, one of things they'll do is they'll scope them.

679
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:29,610
If you get to run y and look to see that that an estimate is between that the intestine and that small pouch.

680
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:35,640
They'll look to see whether it's might be too stretched out, that it's not restrictive.

681
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:43,700
And they will go in and another surgery and and and stitch it that not one lick of evidence that that matters.

682
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,709
Again matter of fact anybody else's that doesn't rate.

683
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:54,900
So when you look at the gastric emptying rate 90 plus percent of what you consume in a in a patient, etc. in mine is gone in 5 minutes.

684
01:07:55,410 --> 01:08:01,340
There is no signal that's being generated by pushing against that small part of the stomach for them.

685
01:08:01,590 --> 01:08:07,740
So again, misunderstanding how surgery works leads to poor clinical choices.

686
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:12,330
So are you essentially saying that sleeve size doesn't matter then too?

687
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:18,030
I don't think it matters nearly the way that people so we can do a version where we actually just do essentially

688
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:24,810
the top half of a sleeve for the bottom half of the top and recapitulate almost everything about surgery.

689
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:28,960
The bottom half doesn't do it as that.

690
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:32,310
Has that kind of translated to what's being done in humans?

691
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:36,150
No, no. There's the argument.

692
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:41,040
But again, we have to do the right to do that.

693
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:49,229
But is way more is way easier to just do the one version of the cuts. But but again, we get into these these issues about what happens after surgery.

694
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:53,309
Right. And whether patients if you go backwards and say this patient didn't do well,

695
01:08:53,310 --> 01:08:58,580
you will find something about their anatomy that you think you should fix if you think the anatomy is where you need to start.

696
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:07,980
But the reality is, for most patients who have inadequate weight loss, the right choice is to put them on weight loss medications they break.

697
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:19,320
They're likely to lose more weight if you and lose more weight than patients who didn't have surgery to the same as you do studies on gastric sleeve.

698
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:25,860
It actually reduces the hormone ghrelin and how that may be reducing motorcycles as well.

699
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:34,230
Do you believe that that so it's a completely reasonable hypothesis, but it's just not true.

700
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:38,519
Right. So it absolutely little problems go down.

701
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:45,660
But if we take an animal that doesn't have any ghrelin good, it's sort of the response to surgery is just as good as it is an aspirin.

702
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:53,399
So it is not necessary to lower the ground lungs in order to have the benefits GOP ones.

703
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,320
The other one that people talk about, right, is a gut hormone.

704
01:09:55,590 --> 01:10:02,790
Same thing right in our hands can animal that doesn't GOP want will respond just as good or better to surgeries than

705
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:10,590
animal humans to get this because that that's what those are those are things you can do in the animals right.

706
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:17,580
That really clarify right. What is necessary what is the. We take one more question.

707
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:24,110
Anybody else have. Well, I appreciate everybody's attention and question.

708
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:30,830
So I have been to a lot of nutrition seminars. I don't think I've ever seen as many engaged students and questions.

709
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:37,040
And I found this kind of a fascinating sell and I'm sure all these students did to really appreciate it.

710
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:46,890
Thank you. Thank you. Yeah.

711
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:50,380
I've heard that there's a Warren Jeffs camp.

712
01:10:54,610 --> 01:11:17,120
And guess what? We think they're definitely going to use that to make you look like you're ready.

713
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:21,130
Do all things. I got to thinking.

714
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:34,680
Well, maybe there's a soccer game.
