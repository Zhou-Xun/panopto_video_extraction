1
00:00:00,259 --> 00:00:06,909
In this module, we're going to continue to talk about healthy relationships and were specifically going to be talking about boundaries.

2
00:00:06,909 --> 00:00:13,899
So we've talked about how we are looking for healthy interdependence how we are responsible for our own thoughts,

3
00:00:13,899 --> 00:00:22,989
feelings and behaviors and how we're just kind of in support of the people around us and how that kind of all works together.

4
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:29,639
But a lot of times is hard to figure out how to shape your relationships to actually work like that,

5
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:32,389
how to communicate in ways

6
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:42,829
that let people know what to expect and see the relationship work, so that's kind of what we're gonna get in this module.

7
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:49,669
So first, let's talk a little bit about what boundaries are a lot of times people talk about boundaries

8
00:00:49,669 --> 00:00:56,729
and it seems a little bit obscure, like what do they they really mean by that. So boundaries are basically just how we communicate

9
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:02,589
in our relationships and behave to let other people know that is OK with us

10
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:08,769
what is not okay with us and how they actually communicate that back to us also.

11
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:11,809
So if you think about it,

12
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:19,549
almost kind of like two neighbors and two neighbors could live next to each other, have no fence between them whatsoever

13
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:24,899
and everybody just do a great job of respecting what matters to the other.

14
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:28,739
So they might just kind of know where each person stops mowing, nobody

15
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:33,959
throws any trash over to the other yard people speak nicely to each other.

16
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:38,649
And they don't really need any any clear boundary there to mark the difference,

17
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:44,889
and you can probably think of friendships that you have like that, relationships that you have like that, where you communicate well,

18
00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:49,329
Respect seems to go fairly well and it doesn't seem to take a lot of effort.

19
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:57,749
You communicated they respect it vice versa. With another kind of a different neighbor situation,

20
00:01:57,749 --> 00:02:06,439
you might just have that kind of your traditional little white picket fence where it just kind of lets people know, like your dog stays over there,

21
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:13,999
I mow to here, and it's kind of gentle boundary that's there

22
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:23,139
a mild boundary. We probably also know other people in our lives are more like thinking about having like the worst neighbor,

23
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:28,479
where no matter how much you communicate to them, what's important to you

24
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,969
they're not cooperating they're not expecting it. So kind of if you look at this image we've got this

25
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:38,859
concrete wall with barbed wire at the top.

26
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:47,709
So sometimes are we have relationships where it just doesn't seem like there's a lot of work put into boundaries and other relationships

27
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:52,439
there's more toxic things happening that can be a lot of effort

28
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:59,579
to put up boundaries in those relationships often those are the ones where it's most needed.

29
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,959
We've got to kind of figure out what to do in those two. Boundaries vary by relationship,

30
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,839
you're going to have some people where It doesn't take a lot of work, it may come pretty easily,

31
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:17,069
you guys kind of have mutual understandings. But even in those relationships vary from situation to situation.

32
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:22,059
Think about, for example, your boundaries around

33
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:26,899
whether you wanted to shake hands or hug or how close you wanted to be, people may have looked different

34
00:03:26,899 --> 00:03:32,529
pre covid versus what they look like now because the safety is different.

35
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:37,899
And so your boundaries are going to change based on a lot of different things,

36
00:03:37,899 --> 00:03:46,539
but some of the examples would be for the behavior you're seeing from the other person, that the other person's behavior is safe and trustworthy,

37
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:49,309
we're going to talk a little bit more about trust in a minute,

38
00:03:49,309 --> 00:03:54,729
then you may not need to set as many boundaries with them if you feel comfortable and safe

39
00:03:54,729 --> 00:04:00,759
you may share more things with them than you would share with other people.

40
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:08,139
Capacity is also a different thing. For example, when you're really tired, you may put your phone on do not disturb,

41
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:14,979
that's a boundary that's saying people can't have access to you during thus time. So another thing that we check in with

42
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:24,859
is where we are? How much energy we energy can we have? And depending on that, we may adjust our boundaries so they're not fixed and set.

43
00:04:24,859 --> 00:04:28,489
And often, if we do have fixed and set boundaries, it's something to think about.

44
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:42,109
So, for example, if I have these kind of cinder block barbwire boundaries with everybody that I know that may not be working. In a perfect world,

45
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:50,659
our boundaries let in as much good as possible, like that interdependence that we talked about, but also keep out as much unhealthiness as possible.

46
00:04:50,659 --> 00:05:00,259
So if I have these barbwire boundaries with everybody, it's probably keeping out a lot of harm, its probably not letting a lot of good in my life.

47
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:08,419
And I might want to figure out where can I have more openness, less guardedness with people.

48
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:13,239
On the flip side of that if I have no boundaries with everybody

49
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:19,819
that's going to leave me open to a lot of good, but also open to a lot of toxic behavior.

50
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:26,449
If I'm just sharing with everybody, all of my personal information, giving people keys to my house passwords to my bank

51
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:34,369
you can see how that wouldn't work either. So we want to be thinking kind of from situation to situation, person to person, day to day

52
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:44,209
how we're doing and with boundaries makes sense. Another way of thinking about it is

53
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:49,069
Kind of like a house and how are we let people into our house.

54
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:56,409
So there are some people who you like they're they're relatively friendly, but maybe you don't know them that well.

55
00:05:56,409 --> 00:06:00,139
So maybe when you interact with them, you interact with them out on the front porch.

56
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:05,259
You're you're not letting them deep into your vulnerability yet.

57
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:11,399
You know, you're you're getting to know more about them, as you get to know more about them if their seeming safe and trustworthy

58
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,299
maybe you're letting them into your living room and you have conversations there.

59
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:21,389
As we get to know people even more we have more vulnerability with them

60
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:26,039
you may share more things with them, make it to the point where you're like, help yourself make yourself at home,

61
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,129
you can let yourself into the refrigerator get what you need.

62
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:35,519
And eventually, it may even get to the point where we let people see inside our closets and different stuff like that upstairs.

63
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,249
These are all decisions that we make.

64
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:45,689
The important thing to know with boundaries is that we get to make them and we get to change them whenever we need to to keep our relationships healthy,

65
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:53,909
safe. I like this quote, it's kind of not quite a definition, but a way of thinking about it,

66
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:59,339
"Boundaries are the distance at which I can love you and me simultaneously."

67
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:04,859
So kind of like when we look at the two glitter balls, when we were talking about interdependence,

68
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:13,249
boundaries allow me to take care of my own needs, protect myself, and also show up and support other people.

69
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:18,859
But if I'm if my boundaries are so open, let people treat me anyway.

70
00:07:18,859 --> 00:07:22,709
Oftentimes, I'm going to have more difficult taking care of myself

71
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:30,109
taking care of my own needs. And eventually it's going to affect my ability to really want to be close to the other person to.

72
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:35,509
So think about this definition as you're thinking about who makes sense, if somebody always calls me,

73
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:41,639
is always negative, is always or frequently dumping things on my plate

74
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,769
can wear away at how much we want to spend time with that person

75
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:54,309
So what would be the boundary that would allow you to spend time with them, but also keep it in in a way that feels good?

76
00:07:54,309 --> 00:08:03,319
And oftentimes that requires a lot of direct communication. And we're going to talk about how to do that.

77
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:14,029
So when you're thinking about that house metaphor we just talk about how much do you share with somebody, how quickly do you let somebody in?

78
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:22,439
Here are some things that we can think about and this can help us identify how we want to adjust our conversation.

79
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:25,919
A lot of times if you've had the same friends for most of your life,

80
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:33,089
you may have even reflect how did I  initially start trusting people and often if we knew then since like kindergarten

81
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:35,779
you know, we just we didn't even think about it

82
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:43,829
we just kind of were the people that were closest to us. Probably as you're moving through college you're thinking about

83
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:52,469
how do I figure out who tries to do it and where to set boundaries and these ideas can kind of help as you're thinking about that.

84
00:08:52,469 --> 00:08:56,489
I don't know how many people have in classrooms where there's a marble bar.

85
00:08:56,489 --> 00:09:02,019
The teacher gives people marbles for good behavior.

86
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:09,159
But we're gonna use that metaphor on this page. So, trust isn't really an all or nothing thing.

87
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:16,029
Some people kind of have an attitude, I give it to people right away. All of it, unless a do something that breaks it.

88
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:24,099
And that's fine. But the way that we're going to talk about it here is really looking at people's behavior, looking at how they engage with you,

89
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:30,189
and slowly as you're seeing the things that you would need, kind of putting marbles in the jar.

90
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:36,219
And this helps because, again, if you're one of those people who trusts everybody or one those people who trust nobody.

91
00:09:36,219 --> 00:09:41,379
Those boundaries don't always set us up for success from moment to moment.

92
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:50,399
But when we look at the people in our social support in our spot, and we kind of say, OK, what have I seen?

93
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:57,339
I'm going to let that guide how much vulnerability I put in, how much access I think they get to me.

94
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:03,519
It kind of helps us make our decisions in ways that are based on better data and set us up for success.

95
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:11,649
You may have had a situation where you met somebody initially, you click really great, you trusted them with everything and it didn't go well.

96
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:17,019
And this kind of sets us up to maybe slow down a little bit.

97
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:20,769
And it's not that we're being mean to anybody else or disrespecting anybody else's boundaries,

98
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:26,919
but we're getting more information so we know if it makes sense to be really vulnerable.

99
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:35,199
There's a quote that Brene Brown says, That healthy vulnerability is telling our stories to those who have earned the right to hear them.

100
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:42,679
So this is kind of how we assess that. So the acronym is BRAVING.

101
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:54,109
Firstly, we're gonna look at it is as regarding other people. So, for example, when I tell people at something is not okay with me.

102
00:10:54,109 --> 00:11:00,429
Do they respect my boundaries? Do they respect my no? That's to B.

103
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:04,739
When they're not sure, do they ask? And did they tell me no

104
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:10,159
when they mean that or do they say yes when they really need no? So that's kind of what you're looking at.

105
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:17,189
And when you see people respecting your boundaries and communicating theirs, you want to kind of know that that's kind of more marbles going in the jar,

106
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:23,939
they're showing trustworthiness. Another piece of this is reliability,

107
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:29,409
so do they do what they say that they're going to do? Do you trust them?

108
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:34,449
When they are at capacity, do they let you know that and say, you know, "I can't hang out today,

109
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:39,089
I'm really exhausted." Or do they promise that they'll show up and then not show up?

110
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:46,149
Thanks for would be not being reliable. The next one is accountability.

111
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:52,629
So when they make a mistake, can they own it can they apologize when you say something wasn't okay or hurt you

112
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:58,319
can they be held accountable and shift.

113
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:04,809
Vault is about privacy when you tell them something does it stay with them?

114
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:09,639
Or do other people who you didn't intend to know are finding out because.

115
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:16,099
To they keep your confidence space. The next one is integrity.

116
00:12:16,099 --> 00:12:21,049
Do they do what's right instead of what's comfortable? So sometimes it might mean telling you the hard things.

117
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:26,899
Sometimes this might mean if you guys have an agreement about going out to party that they

118
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:31,459
say you're gonna stay together and so-and-so is going gonna be the designated driver.

119
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:39,509
Do they do that or do they just do what's comfortable in the moment?

120
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:44,009
The next one is non judgment when you tell them things

121
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:51,719
do you feel judged, are they able to hear you and respond with warmth even when they have to tell you maybe hard things?

122
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:58,509
Can you ask for what you need, say how you feel without being harshly judged?

123
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:05,479
And the last one is generosity. Basically, when you're having a good day or a bad day, do they give you the benefit of the doubt.

124
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:09,089
Do they give you the best possible interpretation of your boundaries.

125
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:14,839
They assume that you're doing the best that you can on most days.

126
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:19,209
So think about your relationships in this context.

127
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:24,969
The people that are in your social social support, the people that are closest to you.

128
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:28,159
Do they have these characteristics?

129
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:36,199
And are there some people who maybe aren't joining these characteristics who you need to adjust your boundaries with?

130
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:46,579
Now, boundaries can be internal and external, so internal boundaries are like, I'm not going to give as much meat to the things that I tell.

131
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:53,709
If they don't like me, if they don't like my work, I'm going to try not to give a lot of thought to that.

132
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:57,039
I'm going to put less effort into the relationship. Those are internal boundaries.

133
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:04,879
Nobody may even know them or see them. But I'm shifting the way that I'm vulnerable or that I'm investing my energy.

134
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:11,539
External boundaries may be telling them this is not OK. It may be spending less time with them.

135
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:18,769
It may be putting some limits on where you go with them or where you don't go with them.

136
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:23,569
And so it's important to think based on what you're seeing here.

137
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:28,809
what are the boundaries that you need that allow you to

138
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:36,619
support them or care about them, and maybe that's even from afar, and also take care of you.

139
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:42,139
Now notice this was all about what they do.

140
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:48,529
But it's important to ask yourself these same questions for yourself. Do you do these things for them?

141
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:55,879
Because that's that flipside of interdependence. We want these things to be going back and forth in both directions.

142
00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:00,929
And we can look at this and say, am I a trustworthy person in their support network?

143
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:04,889
And if not, it might you why people are having certain kinds of boundaries with us.

144
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:14,919
This is a good thing to really reflect on, even in terms of how much am I showing up in being a good part of other people's social support network?

145
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:23,769
And the last part, I think, is actually the hardest one to ask ourselves is, are we trustworthy to ourselves?

146
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:28,689
So, for example, if I get it, we'll start with B.

147
00:15:28,689 --> 00:15:37,299
If I know that I need to go to bed at 10 o'clock because I have an early morning the next morning and I said, OK, I'm going to get off the phone

148
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:42,549
I'm going to get off social media at that time.

149
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:54,429
But I get on the phone with people and I feel like I'm having a good time or I'm helping them with something and I don't respect my own boundary,

150
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:59,559
I stay on the phone with them to love them eleven, midnight, one o'clock. I'm not being trustworthy towards myself.

151
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:06,109
I'm not having good boundaries with myself. Accountability

152
00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:16,469
you know, when I do things even to myself, like for example, again maybe just scroll social media for way more time when I needed to do other stuff.

153
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:21,219
Do I take accountability to myself and adjust my behaviors?

154
00:16:21,219 --> 00:16:26,319
Am I willing to be held accountable by other people.

155
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:32,209
If we go down to integrity am I willing to do the hard things and just not what's comfortable?

156
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:39,739
We talked about some compassion with that nonjudgmental piece, am I being non-judgmental with my own experiences?

157
00:16:39,739 --> 00:16:47,299
These are all things to just really think about to determine how healthy are people being towards you?

158
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:52,519
How healthy are you being towards them and how healthy are you being towards

159
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:58,459
yourself. There's one last piece of this I just want you to kind of think about.

160
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:03,079
Generosity is assuming that people are doing their best.

161
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:10,059
That based on what they know, their energy level, their history. All of these different things that they're doing as if they can

162
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:19,369
at the moment. But if we believe that then becomes important to go right back and see if this is the best that they can do right now,

163
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:26,719
let's say that they are being really gossipy or really mean or bullying or emotionally abusive.

164
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:31,639
If this is the best thing they can do right now, then we need to shift our boundaries with them,

165
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:36,169
probably to keep ourselves safe from some of the harm that comes with it.

166
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:44,849
The boundaries aren't about. Giving people ultimatums or trying to control other people's behavior.

167
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:49,349
It's looking at other people's behavior, letting them know what we need or want,

168
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:56,669
and if they're not willing to shift or able to do something different, then we shift our boundaries, not trying to control them.

169
00:17:56,669 --> 00:18:02,549
We're setting up the boundaries within ourselves and around ourselves to minimize the

170
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:10,479
harm that we're experiencing and to get the most and the best out of the relationships.

171
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:18,099
One of the researchers that we'll give you in a supplemental material is the information on social media for Nedra Tawwab,

172
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:20,589
she talks a lot about boundaries.

173
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:29,399
And if you're looking for a words for how do I communicate what I want or need or what my boundary is in this situation?

174
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:34,129
She's just recently released a book by her social media, has tons of examples of how to say it.

175
00:18:34,129 --> 00:18:42,229
And just like we've talked about in the other areas, practicing how to become fluent in setting these boundaries is a really big deal.

176
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:42,849
So in the next section

177
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:50,529
we're going to talk about assertive communication because that can be part of communicating to people the boundaries that you have,

178
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:59,609
what you need and what you want, and keeping your boundaries in a healthier.
