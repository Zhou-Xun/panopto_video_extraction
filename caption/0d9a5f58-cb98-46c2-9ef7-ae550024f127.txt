00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,130
Hi there and welcome back to the air we breathe. This is your host, Lyric Kleber.

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:14,220
In our last episode, we discussed some of the important terminology in the world of climate change and some of the challenges we

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:20,970
face as it relates to health outcomes and disparate impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities.

4
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,260
As promised, this episode is going to dig deep into one of those vulnerable communities that have

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,700
been dealing with the ramifications of unfair exposures to harmful pollutants.

6
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:35,510
These exposures have only been exacerbated by climate change as well as the COVID 19 pandemic.

7
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:43,040
The north side of Kalamazoo, Michigan, is a predominantly black community, with 46 percent of residents identifying as African-American,

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:50,020
and for years the community has filed complaints with the city about a smell of rotten eggs plaguing their neighborhoods.

9
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:57,910
Recently, the source of this odor was traced back to the graphic packaging paper mill, a factory that produces recycled paperboard,

10
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,780
this factory is located right on the edge of ZIP code four nine zero zero seven,

11
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,670
the same zip code that encompasses what is referred to as the north side of Kalamazoo.

12
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:12,100
And remember the last episode when we talked about pollutants that cause an odor of rotten eggs?

13
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,140
Well, that pollutant was hydrogen sulfide, which is a major omission from the paper mill.

14
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:26,020
The public outcry about the smell, along with the volume of formal complaints, led to the city of Kalamazoo finally getting involved in twenty.

15
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:31,810
It turns out that the factory had been cited by the city for odor violations eight times in the past decade.

16
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:37,320
And while the company claims it had resolved those violations, the odors persisted.

17
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,720
In the midst of the COVID 19 pandemic,

18
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,960
north side residents were stuck in their homes and neighborhoods exposed to this odor for an incredibly long period of time.

19
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,500
While the short term impacts of hydrogen sulfide exposure are mild,

20
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:56,510
long term exposure and high doses can cause eye irritation, dizziness and respiratory distress.

21
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,260
So let's take a second to define exposure with air pollutants.

22
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:07,400
We use the measure of parts per million or p.m. It's a measure of mass that translates to milligrams per liter.

23
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:17,060
But for all intents and purposes, one p.m. is a very small amount, and 10 p.m. of hydrogen sulfide is generally accepted as a safe exposure level.

24
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:22,560
But when you near the 70 bpm range, you may start experiencing health effects.

25
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,420
Back to Kalamazoo.

26
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:33,480
An MLive report in 2021 found that at its highest levels of hydrogen sulfide in the north side reached up to eighty three point one pm.

27
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,490
It was also found that rates of asthma,

28
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:41,550
hospitalizations and zip code four nine zero zero seven were up to five times higher than neighboring zip codes,

29
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:46,580
and the air quality is consistently lower in this area than anywhere else in the city.

30
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:52,650
Now you may start to see how the dots connect that make this an issue of environmental justice.

31
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:59,250
Currently, there is an ongoing investigation as to whether or not the factory emissions are responsible for these health outcomes.

32
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,920
The investigation has been ongoing for over 15 months.

33
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,630
It was supposed to be finished in January of this year, but was pushed back to be released March 31st.

34
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,590
The results of this investigation are particularly critical because in 2020,

35
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:20,390
the city of Kalamazoo passed a tax incentive that would allow the factory to expand under the condition that they got the odor under control.

36
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:28,410
The company states that they've been able to work on a bio filter that reduces the odor, and they need to be held accountable to that promise.

37
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:34,950
As we mentioned on the previous episode, rising temperatures only exacerbate the concentrations of pollutants in the atmosphere,

38
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:43,740
in turn causing further rising temperatures. When we consider adding another public health crisis into the mix, for example a global pandemic,

39
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:51,330
we now have northside residents stuck in their homes, inhaling noxious fumes, struggling to venture outside due to high heat in the summer.

40
00:03:51,330 --> 00:04:00,550
And even if they do still inhaling high levels of bad air. Stories like this are happening all over the country, and it's important to stay informed.

41
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,390
Listening to communities and putting pressure on local officials are good ways to

42
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:09,480
get green policy implemented that help those most impacted by climate change.

43
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:16,530
When it comes to air pollution, things like HEPA filters can be useful at an individual level as a mitigation factor.

44
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:20,520
But climate change is a big problem that requires collective action.

45
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:26,010
Our next episode will get into some potentially helpful policies, such as cap and trade or carbon taxes.

46
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:32,280
So you know what to look out for in your own communities the next time you speak with a representative or go to the ballot box?

47
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:41,856
