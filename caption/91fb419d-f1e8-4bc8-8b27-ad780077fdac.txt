1
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:23,910
Laura Power: General leadership in fast and today will focus for the lecture part will focus a little bit on strategic planning and really kind of the bigger picture of that so thinking about the.

2
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:32,550
Laura Power: values and vision and mission it's a whole process, and I think some of our colleagues here on the class have been part of strategic planning for their.

3
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,680
Laura Power: health departments and we'll welcome.

4
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,420
Laura Power: Any comments or just sharing what the experience is like for you.

5
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:50,040
Laura Power: So you know we'll we'll cover that the values part in bigger picture, I think that ties back to what we talked about in day one, so that's kind of why i've done this way to sort of.

6
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,140
Laura Power: bring this back home to sort of the general leadership ideas, but how that's applied in public health.

7
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:03,540
Laura Power: So that's what we'll talk about today, the activities that will do will be around thinking about values and how you.

8
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:16,980
Laura Power: brainstorming so kind of using systems thinking and other tools to to brainstorm together about what are the important values and to agree on certain values for a public health challenge, such as the ones you have selected.

9
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:25,980
Laura Power: And then you'll write a vision and mission statements and well before you all work on your own related to your public health challenge will do a brief activity.

10
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:36,780
Laura Power: That you'll just look at different strategic plans and kind of go through and look at some checklist about what's a good strategic plan a good vision statement mission and values and things like that so we'll do that together.

11
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:43,410
Laura Power: And then we'll have most of our presentations later in the day and then we'll end with.

12
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:58,410
Laura Power: letting you work on the final assignment, which is just a reflection so so just general reflection kind of about your own leadership and plans from here, and then also some time to fill out the course evaluation and a program evaluation.

13
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:04,080
Laura Power: But we didn't make a little change because one of our teams has some group members that need to.

14
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:11,400
Laura Power: leave early and we wanted to make sure to give them time to do their presentation so as a group we decided they would actually be the.

15
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,220
Laura Power: The show opener and start as their first they'll do the first presentation so they're going to start.

16
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:25,440
Laura Power: Now, without having the formal review of vision mission values and stuff like that so they'll have they'll show us their presentation.

17
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,850
Laura Power: I know their members will stick around as long as I can, as a couple of them have to leave early and then we'll continue on from there.

18
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:43,980
Laura Power: So that's the adjustment i've adjusted the agenda and the slides you'll see there and i'll pull those up, but any questions or comments before we jump into things.

19
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,120
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: Should we be advancing our own slides, or should we do a screen share.

20
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:55,080
Laura Power: Yes, you can do a screen share so we actually just josh I actually just went ahead and made it so that all participants can share.

21
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,950
Joshua Bosman: Okay, great.

22
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,660
Laura Power: yeah I just did that.

23
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,720
And then so for.

24
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,860
Laura Power: What can I do it.

25
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,620
Yolaine A Civil: I hope I know how to drive it.

26
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,270
Laura Power: Well, I think it's.

27
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:06,900
Laura Power: I think you.

28
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:13,140
Laura Power: Can first I know you can and between your team, you can all decide how you want to do it like if.

29
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:25,500
Laura Power: I go, so I think without further ado, then we'll let team to team to write midwesterners have a question I forget your own midwesterners but aaliyah are you a midwestern.

30
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,620
selfless.

31
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,930
Laura Power: Okay, my.

32
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,040
Laura Power: daughter.

33
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,480
Laura Power: With me.

34
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,980
Anthony Mack: The team name was decided when I was not here.

35
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,730
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: fair.

36
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,910
Laura Power: I was like wait a second I already did you not have a westerner.

37
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,950
Sorry.

38
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:50,250
Laura Power: Alright, just making sure I wasn't missing anything okay alright so i'm team to take it away.

39
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:56,190
Yolaine A Civil: I don't put it in presentation mode, I know what do I.

40
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:04,920
Laura Power: So you're when you're going to share so first one that you go ahead and share your screen, so we can we can talk you through it, because there's a little button that help you put it into presentation mode.

41
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,320
Yolaine A Civil: Is it.

42
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:14,790
Laura Power: Now up at the top right you see the yellow on that says share next to it says present.

43
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,930
Yolaine A Civil: present.

44
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,650
yep.

45
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,030
Laura Power: perfect.

46
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:30,900
Yolaine A Civil: Alright, so um our public health challenge that we chose was maternal mortality, this is our team.

47
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,310
Yolaine A Civil: and maternal mortality is a.

48
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:41,160
Yolaine A Civil: Tragic public health crisis, largely because it's preventable.

49
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:53,010
Yolaine A Civil: with appropriate pregnant prenatal care and interventions and it doesn't have to happen.

50
00:04:53,010 --> 00:05:08,730
Yolaine A Civil: So some important definitions, I think that we need to go through first is what difference between maternal mortality pregnancy associated mortality and pregnancy related mortality and.

51
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:20,280
Yolaine A Civil: The WHO definition of maternal mortality is a death of a woman from director indirect obstetric causes more than 42 days but less than one year after the integral pregnancy.

52
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:31,920
Yolaine A Civil: And pregnancy associated mortality is the death of a woman, while pregnant within one year of the end of pregnancy, due to a cause that's unrelated to her pregnancy.

53
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:40,230
Yolaine A Civil: And then pregnancy related mortality is the death of a woman, while pregnant or within one year of the end of pregnancy for any.

54
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:47,970
Yolaine A Civil: cause related to our aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but it doesn't include accidental or incidental causes.

55
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:58,710
Yolaine A Civil: And the reason why I wanted to go over these definitions first is because i'm in talking about reporting and surveillance of.

56
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:05,490
Yolaine A Civil: return in maternal mortality it's important that everybody's using the same definitions and defining everything.

57
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:26,370
Yolaine A Civil: A certain way, otherwise there can be a lot of ambiguity and things are not reported on so in terms of trying to design interventions or appropriate things like that it can be hard, if you know your definitions are not clear, and these can be very confusing.

58
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:35,250
Yolaine A Civil: So just some background information on maternal mortality is a global and national public health issue globally on this is data from.

59
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:54,180
Yolaine A Civil: The Lancet global in 2017 there were 295,000 women who died off on pregnancy and childbirth and about 86% of these were in sub Saharan Africa in South Asia and actually out of this 86% like.

60
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,400
Yolaine A Civil: think they said.

61
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:10,890
Yolaine A Civil: Four fifths of them are in Africa, and then the one says in Asia, South Asia and in our country, but 700 women die each year as a result of pregnancy or delivery complications.

62
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:17,010
Yolaine A Civil: And this is just a graph i'm also from the Lancet this is.

63
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,570
Yolaine A Civil: From.

64
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,060
Yolaine A Civil: It shows the.

65
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,520
Yolaine A Civil: Top.

66
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:31,140
Yolaine A Civil: Countries that have the highest maternal mortality and then this graph is really important to look at also, if you look at the US here.

67
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:43,020
Yolaine A Civil: It is right it's up this high compared to other high income countries which are way down here like Finland, Denmark and Sweden all their their rates are down here finland's at a low of 3.8.

68
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:53,910
Yolaine A Civil: And this is the US at 26.4 if you can also look at this graph to you can see that it's increasing, which means it's actually getting worse.

69
00:07:53,910 --> 00:08:16,170
Yolaine A Civil: And I just want to say more recently that when I looked at this data on who has the highest these countries are not the highest anymore on the top five are South Sudan, Somalia Central African Republic, which i'm going to talk a little bit about later Yemen in Syria.

70
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:25,440
Yolaine A Civil: And, as I mentioned before the trend for maternal mortality in the US is increasing over time.

71
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:47,250
Yolaine A Civil: And then, this also shows this is from the CDC on data it shows the huge health disparity in maternal mortality by race and the highest rates are in African American women, if you look it's relatively it's like stable it's been this high and.

72
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:53,790
Yolaine A Civil: The differences here if you notice the gap between is actually smaller, which is.

73
00:08:53,790 --> 00:09:12,840
Yolaine A Civil: not good, because it means, these are, this is not getting smaller, these are becoming more in the in these categories so other women are having are dying from childbirth and instead of making everyone's rates go down.

74
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:24,180
Yolaine A Civil: And I just wanted to show this the CDC has a pregnancy or tell the surveillance system um where they.

75
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:37,320
Yolaine A Civil: Are tracking the data on nationally, so that we can have a better understanding of the risk factors and the causes of pregnancy related deaths such a huge issue, and there are medical epidemiologist that link.

76
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:48,060
Yolaine A Civil: The birth records and feel death records with on death death records and analyze those from all 50 states and Washington DC.

77
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:59,040
Yolaine A Civil: And I just want to talk just briefly about the causes so in the US, these are the top causes of which are mortality and, if you look at the highest thing it's from other cardiovascular.

78
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:18,120
Yolaine A Civil: conditions and infections um, but if you look globally, the causes are difference there from severe bleeding infections high blood pressure complications from delivery and unsafe abortions and these things used to be.

79
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:29,430
Yolaine A Civil: more prominent in our country, but now, if you notice it's more chronic diseases and underlying illnesses are causing a problem in our country so it's different.

80
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:48,960
Yolaine A Civil: And I just wanted to share a story about my experience with maternal mortality, even though i'm a pediatrician I have some firsthand experience with it clinically so I when I was working with doctors without borders, I had a mission in.

81
00:10:48,960 --> 00:11:05,700
Yolaine A Civil: 2014 to the Central African Republic and I just put this map here, so you can see where it's located I went there for three months emergency mission three weeks after their military military coup.

82
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,980
Yolaine A Civil: And so during the coup, this is a picture of the hospital that I worked at.

83
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:23,940
Yolaine A Civil: They destroyed the hospital so in these kind of situations, unfortunately, the rebel groups target hospitals, churches and schools, and so this is bison goal, or the city that I was in.

84
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:33,630
Yolaine A Civil: They completely destroyed the hospital and all the people were in hiding when we got there in the bush because best ago was the.

85
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:38,550
Yolaine A Civil: city where their president was born and he had a lot of family and.

86
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:49,320
Yolaine A Civil: Friends they're still, and so they hit bass and go harder than any other area when they came in and took over So these are just pictures of what the hospital look look like.

87
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:59,610
Yolaine A Civil: So that's what they did but entire hospital looks exactly like this was just a mess, so they there was no medical care so basically That was the point of the.

88
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:12,810
Yolaine A Civil: mission was to clean up the hospital and to restore basic medical care, so I just wanted to the next few slides are just pictures from.

89
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:21,870
Yolaine A Civil: Bus and go out and around the area, so you can get an idea of what it's like to be in that kind of situation, because unless you're in that you know, especially living here.

90
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:30,960
Yolaine A Civil: it's really hard to imagine what it's really like unless you're really in that So hopefully the pictures will give you an idea, so this is kind of how.

91
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:45,300
Yolaine A Civil: because their houses their houses were destroyed when they took over, so a lot of people were living like this, so obviously there's no prenatal care there's there's no health care at all basically.

92
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,790
Yolaine A Civil: So this is a picture of my team.

93
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:57,960
Yolaine A Civil: And this young woman here, and this one here they're the two midwives on my team, so I was the medical team leader, so I was in charge of all medical services.

94
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:09,900
Yolaine A Civil: Even though i'm a pediatrician I was in charge of everything but luckily both of them for excellent, and so I really deferred and leaned on them heavily for their expertise.

95
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:20,670
Yolaine A Civil: So one of the other issues in the country, even before the military coup there's a huge shortage of physicians there were only 42 doctors in the whole country.

96
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:34,920
Yolaine A Civil: And so what they rely on instead is nurses do a lot of the role growth that physicians do here and so they're midwives, but really they play the role of like an Ob gyn here.

97
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:44,490
Yolaine A Civil: So they handle complicated deliveries so for routine deliveries i'm just a regular nurse, they are they call them metronome.

98
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:59,910
Yolaine A Civil: In the in the village would take care of that so that would not even go to the hospital, it would go to like a local clinic or stay in their local village, but the midwives would handle them more complicated cases.

99
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:05,370
Yolaine A Civil: And this is just an idea of the road situation there, so because.

100
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:14,520
Yolaine A Civil: Our hospital was destroyed, we had to transfer complicated obstetrical cases to the referral house with just three hours away.

101
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:21,420
Yolaine A Civil: On the road and this actually is a decent road that most of them are worse than this, and this is kind of how travel is.

102
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:34,050
Yolaine A Civil: On the road, and so, can you imagine you know, I have to send a nine month pregnant woman with a complication like either like this, this is three hours, so instead of doing that I would send them on a motorcycle.

103
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:42,330
Yolaine A Civil: Which is two hours away and so you're putting a nine month pregnant woman in Labor on a motorcycle because it's faster.

104
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:52,740
Yolaine A Civil: And so we had money we would pay the drivers and also the other thing I want to highlight is how dangerous it was on the road, because the rebel groups are actually attacking.

105
00:14:52,740 --> 00:15:10,530
Yolaine A Civil: they're attacking people on the roads, so we would give them a letter like an official letter from doctors without borders, to say that they were you know transferring this lady who's in Labor to the hospital and that's all they were doing and sometimes it helps and sometimes it did.

106
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:18,930
Yolaine A Civil: And this is the other issue with maternal mortality over there, I put this picture in here this actually this young lady is actually not.

107
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:24,840
Yolaine A Civil: From Boston Globe she's from my other mission in Central African Republic, but I just wanted to let everybody know.

108
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:32,220
Yolaine A Civil: that one of the huge issues over there, is it the moms are really, really young, as you can see she's really young and she's very small.

109
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:41,070
Yolaine A Civil: And she just had these two babies here she had twins premature twins, which is another problem they're actually that i'm more familiar with.

110
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:48,840
Yolaine A Civil: But I, but the fact that they're young and small puts them at much higher risk for.

111
00:15:48,840 --> 00:16:09,870
Yolaine A Civil: complications with pregnancy and delivery and where I was in car, the most of the girls got married between 12 and 14 and they would have a baby, about a year after that so that's the age their first favorite that's the age of moms that you're talking about.

112
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:25,560
Yolaine A Civil: Let me go back so I, so I don't have a photo of any of the moms I that I took care of when I was in Boston goa but I did want to just share that something that happened, the last night that I was there.

113
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:35,430
Yolaine A Civil: We had tons of pregnant women, they have a huge birth rate and Central African Republic, you know, despite all the issues that they have their.

114
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,850
Yolaine A Civil: The average woman, I think she has something like five or six kids.

115
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:48,780
Yolaine A Civil: So there was a lot of obstetric activity, the last time I was there, we had an 18 year old girl, this was her second pregnancy, she had a two year old baby.

116
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:53,190
Yolaine A Civil: And we sent her to the referral hospital.

117
00:16:53,190 --> 00:17:02,160
Yolaine A Civil: before she was in Labor for C section, because the midwife that I was talking about was excellent, and she explained to me that, because of her size and the shape of her pelvis.

118
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:08,850
Yolaine A Civil: that she would need a C section, because she had a complicated delivery, the first time she had she was pregnant she remembered the mom.

119
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:21,270
Yolaine A Civil: So we sent her there and they didn't agree and did not do the C section, and so they let her deliver badly and send her back on the motorcycle the next day.

120
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:31,470
Yolaine A Civil: She was complaining of a stomach ache and then that night she had a euro rupture and was bleeding, and so my entire teams stayed up.

121
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:40,890
Yolaine A Civil: All night trying to stop her bleeding to stabilize her so we could transfer back there, and unfortunately in the wee hours of the morning she passed away.

122
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:57,780
Yolaine A Civil: And so I would say my whole team was traumatized from that and we were all crying afterwards, and it was just this huge mess it was just horrible and so just highlights, you know just the lack of access and the lack of resources, what happens and that kind of situation.

123
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:07,020
Yolaine A Civil: And it happens all too often, but I wanted to end on a positive note that at the end, we did get the surgical unit cleaned up.

124
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:18,390
Yolaine A Civil: And I got the equipment ordered, as you can see, looks much better than what it looked like before and we have the surgeon ready to go so before I left it wasn't operational so we still Can you see sections here but.

125
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:27,240
Yolaine A Civil: When I I think they told me three weeks after I left this this was operation and I just i'm so.

126
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:37,260
Yolaine A Civil: You know, even though, was a rough mission, we did end on a positive note, we did or able to do some you know some good things in a really horrible situation.

127
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:46,110
Yolaine A Civil: The other thing I was going to say that's different over there is that every physician there is trained to do C section, no matter what your specialty is.

128
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:58,980
Yolaine A Civil: Because it's that in demand, that is their number one surgery is C section and a lot of it is because, like I said, because the moms are really small because they're young and they have a lot of issues with.

129
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:04,740
Yolaine A Civil: Getting the baby out of the pelvis and accomplish the deliveries are complicated.

130
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:35,190
Yolaine A Civil: So with that I will pass it on.

131
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:50,010
Anthony Mack: So well the rest of our presentation really focuses on the United States more local side, I wanted to to emphasize the invaluable work that you've been doing it really shows that.

132
00:19:50,010 --> 00:20:06,180
Anthony Mack: Maternal mortality is not just a local issue it's a global issue is a global public health issue and everything that we're doing everything that you land was able to do it, it shows that everything matters, and I know I speak for everybody here.

133
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:14,670
Anthony Mack: And thank you again for all the hard work she's done and everybody that's been working in this this sector so.

134
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:22,740
Anthony Mack: This is our cause a loop diagram for maternal mortality and as we've discussed in the past.

135
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:43,290
Anthony Mack: there's no one way to show all of the causal relationships for a public health issues is dire as maternal mortality is and then sure is a lot of the practitioners in the audience can vouch for this is a very, very diluted version.

136
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:49,590
Anthony Mack: Because if we tried to do everything it would turn into those 20 page causal diagrams and.

137
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:56,190
Anthony Mack: It would be very, very hard to understand, so what we did is We broke this down and really into.

138
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:05,430
Anthony Mack: Three or four main categories up in the upper right hand corner, here we have advocacy government action education really policy driven issues.

139
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:18,360
Anthony Mack: And we can kind of see a loop here as we get increased advocacy we can get increase in education, increasing government action and all of this really goes to decreasing the mortality rate, both here and abroad.

140
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:27,180
Anthony Mack: Another giant category is physical complications so complications from birth pre existing conditions preeclampsia.

141
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:34,830
Anthony Mack: infections preterm birth, all of these contribute to an increased maternal mortality rate.

142
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:48,450
Anthony Mack: In the bottom left you can see, more social issues, social factors healthcare availability health equity socio economic status and even being a woman of color which includes black and American Indian native American.

143
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:59,070
Anthony Mack: Populations Asians as well, are all included and, unfortunately, having that part of the background is your.

144
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:03,780
Anthony Mack: Of who you are actually increases your chance of having a.

145
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,160
Anthony Mack: Maternal death.

146
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,090
Anthony Mack: So the policy that we chose to.

147
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,300
Anthony Mack: analyze is actually.

148
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:35,790
Anthony Mack: From 2018 the preventing maternal deaths act and just to preface before this time there really was no consensus way of dealing or approaching this public health issue of maternal mortality and there's a lot of states acting independently.

149
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:51,930
Anthony Mack: Collecting data in various manners and, as we all know, in research, we can't really advance a certain area, unless we have consistency, which leads to better results, which leads to better policies in better action on our health issues.

150
00:22:51,930 --> 00:23:03,270
Anthony Mack: So what this policy is signed into law December 21 of 2018 which ended up being public law number 11534, for this is.

151
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:09,900
Anthony Mack: Thankfully, passed unanimously in both the House and Senate votes, and it can be broken down really into three components.

152
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:29,880
Anthony Mack: It creates a mandates consistent reporting of maternal deaths which allows for better analysis of data which can inform policymakers on how to direct their constituents and how to direct lawmaking to essentially create better policies to decrease maternal mortality.

153
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:42,900
Anthony Mack: It also provides significant financial support for state based maternal mortality review committees which i'll talk about in a second and, finally, it ensures confidentiality of the case information participants and discussions.

154
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:49,290
Anthony Mack: This is a huge issue in talking about a sensitive topics such as maternal mortality.

155
00:23:49,290 --> 00:24:00,360
Anthony Mack: A lot of involvement with research for this public health issue, one of the obstacles is the confidentiality.

156
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,350
Anthony Mack: mother's really not wanting their information to be out there.

157
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:18,750
Anthony Mack: If they have a history in their family of maternal mortality families not wanting their loved ones involved and having their information disclosed to the public, so this Act was really, really important for ensuring the confidentiality, so that.

158
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,600
Anthony Mack: Better research can move forward.

159
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,180
Anthony Mack: So the important thing about the maternal mortality review committees is that it.

160
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:40,140
Anthony Mack: centralized advocacy for maternal mortality, a lot of independent groups were doing research into this this health issue, however, with the CDC is based around backing.

161
00:24:40,140 --> 00:25:05,910
Anthony Mack: We now have 46 total States that had this material maternal mortality review committee and this allows like I mentioned before, consistency across all groups are all states and, as we know that allow for better research and better policymaking online or down the line.

162
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:09,150
Anthony Mack: When he just wanted to go, I can.

163
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,950
Quintin Solano: OK cool.

164
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:16,080
Quintin Solano: So here we have our logic model i'm just going to highlight some of the major.

165
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,790
Quintin Solano: ones in each category so for the inputs, we have the maternal mortality review committee.

166
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:28,740
Quintin Solano: which will be important to have that moving forward in order to review the data that will be collecting as a result of this policy.

167
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:36,750
Quintin Solano: public hospitals and outpatient clinics, will also be participating in this, and one of the major ones, I would argue, the most important as federal funding.

168
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:46,230
Quintin Solano: Having funding for anything when it comes to policies or major changes is important because you're going to have to pay for the database to be ran the abstract years to pull the data.

169
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:57,720
Quintin Solano: As well as analysts and people like that to put the data together in a presentable format for policymakers to see as well as for it to be published in major journals and for things to continue moving forward.

170
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:05,040
Quintin Solano: Some of the activities will be active reporting and maternal death numbers, which is important as well.

171
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:23,670
Quintin Solano: Creation of a you have uniform reporting, which is a difficult thing to do in research, when you have numbers and things like that that you want to collect their data, you need it to be uniform across otherwise you run the risk of not being able to match the data are collected and.

172
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:28,440
Quintin Solano: Look at it as a you know large sample size you kind of have would then have to.

173
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:37,170
Quintin Solano: kind of create these cohorts so uniform reporting will be really helpful, as well as developing partnerships between state agencies for data collection and reporting.

174
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:52,260
Quintin Solano: Some of the outputs you know, establishing the database that I was talking about and funding, the creation of this with the regulation of the information as well, so protecting the patient information, the identities, as well as utilizing it for.

175
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,660
Quintin Solano: Appropriate research so for outcomes i'll talk about the long term outcomes for both of these.

176
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:08,370
Quintin Solano: In the interest of time, so for long term outcomes improved national standardization of surveillance on maternal mortality throughout this database that we create our would be created.

177
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:20,100
Quintin Solano: And then long term impact of this overall hopefully would reduce paternal the maternal death disparity that we see in this country.

178
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:31,920
Quintin Solano: In terms of the leverage assessment to that place to start right there on that line this isn't a little changes is a fundamental change to the way that we report collect and distribute this data.

179
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,550
Quintin Solano: It has a lot of leverage behind it as well.

180
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:49,710
Quintin Solano: Including federal funding, as well as a policy that we're discussing and this is, you know ultimately leading to hopefully the prevention of some disasters from this fundamental change.

181
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:59,070
Quintin Solano: And from an equity lens you know those positively affected, obviously, first and foremost at the Center of everything that we hopefully do will be the patients, which in this case is the mothers.

182
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:06,450
Quintin Solano: As well as the infants, those are able to be employed and volunteer do the organization and then.

183
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:17,490
Quintin Solano: Pregnant women as well as children and families those negatively affected good potentially be the reviewers because of the mental strain or reviewing this difficult casework and other social programs.

184
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:28,890
Quintin Solano: The possibility of reducing federal funding for other programs well more funding is being funneled into this policy as well.

185
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:33,480
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: Anthony do you mind advancing since you already have it.

186
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,650
Anthony Mack: yeah.

187
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:46,950
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: Thank you um so some of the unintended consequences that we brainstorm was one that the focus on maternal health initiatives that may help reduce maternal mortality.

188
00:28:46,950 --> 00:29:08,580
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: There can be too much focus on it, and with this hyper focus there, possibly could be missed opportunities when thinking about the woman's life preconception and then also her time after birth so it's important to also think about those phases of of her pregnancy and her life.

189
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:14,610
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: Not only does the review of maternal death cases take up a lot of effort, it can be very taxing.

190
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:34,950
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: So when we're thinking of public health staff clinicians and other professionals that have the responsibility of being a part of the mrc or the maternal mortality review Committee, and it can create exposure to some cases that have really extremely traumatic occurrences.

191
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:45,000
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: For instance, some of the death, some of the cases that are reviewed could be a women that died violent deaths, what can be which can.

192
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:59,220
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: really just be taxing on someone's mental health and, lastly, we also discuss sorry one second.

193
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:05,190
Sorry, one second.

194
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:23,190
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: We we also discuss that like with any other health policies when we're providing resources and focusing on one public health challenge that resources and funding can be taken taken away from other serious public health challenges and next slide.

195
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:34,860
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: Our values are centered around health equity Community partnership and innovation, our values drive our mission to improve maternal mortality through evidence based measures supported by policy.

196
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:42,660
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: And through these we hope to create a world where women experience, safe and healthy lives before, during and after their pregnancy.

197
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,570
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: Next slide.

198
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:54,090
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: So when thinking about the future direction, we believe that there are many steps that can be taking.

199
00:30:54,090 --> 00:31:07,290
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: This could include continued to expand the capacity and establish Mr sees across the nation continue to build relationships with state and local entities and Members in their community.

200
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:15,240
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: Also, to continue to to develop and strengthen initiatives and campaigns that focus on improving maternal health.

201
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:22,920
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: The alliance for innovation on maternal health is one initiative that a lot of States are involved in.

202
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:38,550
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: And to continue to improve national State data collection and reporting systems as it relates to maternal deaths implement policies that have a health equity lens utilize data to influence policymakers.

203
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:54,570
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: continue monitoring the effects of policies on outcomes and, lastly, to conduct a global assessment of maternal mortality and modeling for future policy changes, based on results of the current one.

204
00:31:54,570 --> 00:32:02,040
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: So thank you with that, thank you for your time, I think we went over, but we appreciate everyone for listening so thank you.

205
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,420
Laura Power: i'm great.

206
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,000
Yolaine A Civil: My fault sorry.

207
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:19,020
Laura Power: Well, great I like that i'll just let the group big some comments, first, I thought lots of comments you'll learn about all your great work and i've known you for a while now, but I haven't heard all her stories yet so that was nice to really hear.

208
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:30,240
Yolaine A Civil: i'm sorry a little longer, but I think it's just I don't know for me it's easier if it it's not just a number you hear statistics like people behind it.

209
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,890
For sure.

210
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:39,720
Laura Power: yeah so from just from the rest of our class to some reflections and on this presentation, especially as you thought through.

211
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:54,000
Laura Power: You know what you learned about systems thinking bringing everything together the logic model and maybe from some of our practitioners that are working in the space or participate in the maternal mortality review committees.

212
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,980
Laura Power: Any comments.

213
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,900
Laura Power: I see your hand up, I think.

214
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:12,540
Samantha Lyons: Oh yeah I was just gonna say that I think having this story is a really good presentation.

215
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:19,110
Samantha Lyons: What i'm trying to come up the word a really good way to present, because I think it brings in people, a little bit more sometimes as.

216
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:35,580
Samantha Lyons: Duchess phil was saying, then statistics and I know that these statistics about the US and other countries exists and every single time we hear about it it's just a little bit more painful.

217
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:52,020
Samantha Lyons: But I think this is a really important topic and I just wanted to say that, even though it is painful to keep hearing it every time we need to the so that things change so thanks for doing it on the stuff that.

218
00:33:52,020 --> 00:34:01,590
Laura Power: Well, I was impressed kind of watching the progression of your work, as you all, as a group, worked on your mapping the system and then your final version that you showed here.

219
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:14,400
Laura Power: And I think as you've all seen you at the system, it can it's very messy as you do it right it's like a brainstorming process, and I think you, if I remember right, I think you refine that a little bit and maybe simplified or rearrange some of a.

220
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:25,050
Anthony Mack: yeah we definitely started off with an extremely complex and maybe over detailed diagram and then being able to.

221
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:31,260
Anthony Mack: get to a little bit more simplified version where maybe on the screen it's.

222
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,110
Anthony Mack: Not as.

223
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:45,090
Anthony Mack: Not is complex, not as messy using more broad categories it actually helps us be able to create discussion and dialogue.

224
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:51,300
Anthony Mack: In my experiences doing these for other topics and other classes.

225
00:34:51,300 --> 00:35:01,320
Anthony Mack: It helps where there's less information because it gets questions from the audience Oh, what is pre existing conditions and how is that affecting it.

226
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:14,100
Anthony Mack: Rather than having the words preeclampsia on there it automatically is like oh okay well it's preeclampsia that, obviously, is going to increase maternal mortality it's a pretty.

227
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,090
Anthony Mack: pretty dire diagnosis for.

228
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:33,510
Anthony Mack: Those that have less healthcare availability or support advocacy of their healthcare team so having a broader category allows us to really create dialogue which we can then turn into government action advocacy education policy and.

229
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:39,060
Anthony Mack: Another thing I wanted to mention is that not all arrows are included on here.

230
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,460
Anthony Mack: Just again.

231
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,300
Anthony Mack: For saving space and clarity it's.

232
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,440
Anthony Mack: Very difficult to include all arrows.

233
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,830
Anthony Mack: And still be able to convey what we want to say.

234
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:59,130
Laura Power: I think that kind of matches up with what we learned about all of this knowledge couple days to is that you tend to start off with models.

235
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:22,140
Laura Power: iterative you make different ones, it can get really massive and I ultimately actually tried to simplify it a bit so that it kind of helps you with what you're doing so it's kind of what i'm hearing you say so, I thought that was just nice to point out.

236
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:34,050
Laura Power: i'm hopefully going to say that the cut two things that stood out to me in your logic model is very nicely done, I think this group in this always comes up to like separating out outcomes versus impact can be very challenging.

237
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:40,590
Laura Power: And like what's a little like impact is often a more long term thing that thanks Anthony that's that happens.

238
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:48,240
Laura Power: So that can be kind of challenging to figure out, but I think you did it you guys did a good job I, because I know you were working on this one, when I saw yesterday.

239
00:36:48,240 --> 00:37:00,120
Laura Power: Like what was an outcome versus wasn't impact, and it can be a little bit subjective to you know but it's just helping you think through the process like Why are you doing this and what's the impact you're trying to have so I thought you guys did a nice job with that.

240
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:06,660
Anthony Mack: I think, for us it helped to notice that short term outcomes don't necessarily have to have short term impacts.

241
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,070
Laura Power: Right what your.

242
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:16,830
Anthony Mack: short term can also impact what you're doing long term and what you're doing long term can have just a short term impact.

243
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:21,930
Anthony Mack: So rather than being like Oh, whatever you now can only impact now.

244
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,970
Anthony Mack: yeah the hell.

245
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,250
Laura Power: alone always map it outside like.

246
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:31,680
Laura Power: Short to a short impact sometimes it's just the impact is sometimes, this is a long term like.

247
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:38,670
Laura Power: reducing maternal mortality or reducing disparity in maternal deaths or something like Those are some of the big things that will take time.

248
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:46,140
Laura Power: and hopefully those outcome measures are getting you towards that, so you can kind of look at it in different ways, so I can definitely see how you did that.

249
00:37:46,140 --> 00:38:06,660
Anthony Mack: and especially with policies that are kind of ingrained in their old ways and it's going to take a lot to make a policy change having that short term impact may be just as for lack of better term impactful as the long term and same with the outcomes.

250
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:20,190
Laura Power: And then I might be nice just to reflect on that vision statement you had because I thought this I wanted to just we're about to talk about this kind of stuff so they introduced it for us, they went ahead and wrote their values mission and vision.

251
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:27,630
Laura Power: Anything yeah so world where women experience, safe and healthy lives before, during and after their pregnancy.

252
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:40,950
Laura Power: So maybe, since you did this you guys went ahead and did it what you know as you as you wrote the bs like the what's the difference between the mission and the vision how how did you come to these statements.

253
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:44,550
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: I think that the vision.

254
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:56,790
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: is something as an ideal and it's something that we don't really we can't really say that we can get there, maybe it won't happen in our lifetime.

255
00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:17,430
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: But we're hopeful and the vision is something that continues to drive us when we can take a step back and look at the the greater scheme of things and just a reminder of like why we do this work, and then the mission is like the action and the activities that we're doing.

256
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:20,790
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: So yeah I think that's how we live kind of separate them.

257
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:27,090
Laura Power: yeah I think that I just thought you know this was an excellent example, so I thought, we might as well just spend time looking at this, because.

258
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:36,900
Laura Power: i'll give you some slides, but this is this is really nice example here, so I think this is well done and then ideally to, and you can I can think we can see it flowing through here, but the values.

259
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:46,410
Laura Power: That really is the foundation of everything to because of values really determine how you behave and as as an organization as individuals within the organization.

260
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:55,860
Laura Power: How are you prioritize things when you face difficult decisions, you have to sometimes think about your values and say okay we're valuing partnership over.

261
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,430
Laura Power: Something else and then we're going to we're going to do this.

262
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:04,050
Laura Power: And so we'll talk more about that, but I think this is really nice one.

263
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,270
Anthony Mack: yeah for me it's.

264
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:12,570
Anthony Mack: The way I think about it is values guide the mission to enact division.

265
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:19,260
Anthony Mack: So just like Leo is saying our we're using the values to to have this action mission.

266
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:24,840
Anthony Mack: which in the end is trying to achieve this ideal vision that we have.

267
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:29,580
Anthony Mack: safe, healthy lives before during after pregnancy yeah that's great.

268
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:36,000
Laura Power: really nice great job that was really well done, I really enjoyed the background and just how you pulled it all together so.

269
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:43,530
Laura Power: Like Laura said big act to follow there, but I know that our other groups will do well as well, so.

270
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:51,780
Laura Power: Well, thank you for that, and that was a great way to start off the class so now what i'm going to do is go through some slides i'll go through quickly.

271
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:56,460
Laura Power: So no worries I That was a great presentation we'll catch up on time, so no problem at all.

272
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:12,030
Laura Power: And I want to make sure there's time to hear from our other groups, because I know we're going to have more great information to look at, but i'll Just to give you a little bit of structure, let me go through my slides to go.

273
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:23,460
Laura Power: So alright so we're going to get into the strategic planning part, and this will kind of lead into the values that mission and vision, but again.

274
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:32,280
Laura Power: kind of just getting us in place and where we're at we're thinking about those strategic skills and we've talked about systems thinking and policy.

275
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:50,280
Laura Power: And so, all of this is going to you know as part of the strategic planning as well, but maybe one I don't know about you guys, but for me when I first started learning about all this, I used to kind of blur all these words together systems thinking strategic thinking strategic planning.

276
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:59,760
Laura Power: You know before I really thought about this, but kind of all where the same to me I didn't really distinguish them, but there are there are different, we spent a lot of time talking about systems thinking.

277
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:10,200
Laura Power: And that's more about looking in understanding the big picture, you know, seeing the system seeing the purpose and all the connections and all the parts and you know kind of trying to step back.

278
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:19,200
Laura Power: Get on the balcony or get to the big picture and have a shared understanding together so that's what systems thinking means to me now.

279
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,980
Laura Power: strategic thinking is is a little bit different and then it's more about how you make decisions to get towards a specific purpose.

280
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:38,580
Laura Power: So it's our know away it's their strategic planning and strategic thinking which go together but strategic thinking is just more like decision making way of of heading towards a very goal oriented purpose.

281
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:45,720
Laura Power: Strategic planning that is about that process, and there are specific steps which we'll get into a little bit today.

282
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:51,810
Laura Power: But that's a really about defining your organization's roles and their priorities and how they're setting their direction.

283
00:42:51,810 --> 00:43:05,610
Laura Power: And I hope you can see how all of us can inform each other systems thinking can help with strategic thinking and strategic planning as well if you're able to see the big picture that can kind of help you move forward and all these things.

284
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:15,180
Laura Power: And a strategic planning is important for any organization and any group, really, but there are some special things that are about it that are important for public health.

285
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:22,050
Laura Power: And it's one where really it's you need to understand the needs of your population when you're going about strategic planning.

286
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:35,460
Laura Power: And it seems like in public health, we tend to have an issue of scarcity of resources and being pulled in a million directions, so that can just make it challenging and especially important to do strategic planning.

287
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:52,410
Laura Power: and actually so maybe at least two hands up I think there's a few of you that have been involved in strategic planning in this group let's see maybe put your like a hands up or a thumbs up or something if you've done strategic planning for your organization.

288
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:56,850
Laura Power: Lets you know Victoria Victoria Kenya and.

289
00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:11,520
Laura Power: Aaron has to so Aaron and Victoria think are the ones I caught and aaliyah you to you know yeah there we go I see it, okay and see me okay good well definitely feel free to jump in and add to the conversation here.

290
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:20,550
Laura Power: You know you guys are actually you've been in especially doing it for public health agency, so this is kind of a summary of what you've been doing.

291
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:27,750
Laura Power: But just helped me so that all of our students understand the relationships here so strategic planning is actually something that is.

292
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:38,280
Laura Power: Is a even a requirement that you have public health departments will go about doing it, and just to step back so everyone understand there's the national accreditation for public health agencies that.

293
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:45,300
Laura Power: can be done it's voluntary, in many cases I don't know I mean some States might require it, I think some States do.

294
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:55,230
Laura Power: You want to be told me that, actually, but in Michigan and voluntary many it's nice to have you know nationally accredited but not all health departments are and actually saw one of those public 3.0.

295
00:44:55,230 --> 00:45:08,730
Laura Power: Recommendations was to really encourage getting the national accreditation so as part of that is called FAB public health accreditation boards you hear about fam requirements and FAB accreditation.

296
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:16,830
Laura Power: Until part about one of the components of that is that health departments have to do these things, called the Java chip and strategic plan.

297
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:28,920
Laura Power: The Community health assessment, the Community health Improvement Plan and the strategic plan and all those and those kind of all inform each other and there's a cyclical nature that these are done.

298
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,420
Laura Power: And here's just you know, one of the standards kind of pointing out.

299
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:42,780
Laura Power: Just emphasizing what I said here, the strategic plan is sort of part of that FAB accreditation, one of the standards if you go through the document of what the public health.

300
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:54,330
Laura Power: Accreditation board standards are one of them includes having doing a strategic plan every five years, and so they kind of go into exactly how that needs to be done.

301
00:45:54,330 --> 00:46:03,330
Laura Power: And then, just so you can see the linkage I know our practitioners are very familiar with this, but basically there's the Community health assessment that Community health Improvement Plan.

302
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:18,600
Laura Power: And then five year strategic plan that will inform a lot of other work does anybody anywhere anybody want to comment on this process, do you love, it is a fun you're always in it somewhere else you're always in a cycle somewhere.

303
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:23,010
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: I can say that Aaron and I are both involved.

304
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:28,740
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: In our 2025 needs assessment and we're currently planning that.

305
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:35,190
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: Right now we're creating our surveys and getting an idea of.

306
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:41,610
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: Our populations that we want to survey and the partners that will be working with.

307
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:54,210
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: And yeah so I don't know if Aaron if you have the chance to work on the previous one, but it is a huge project we're already getting started on it and yeah.

308
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,340
Erin  Thompson: yeah I was going to add that.

309
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:16,830
Erin  Thompson: Our block grant works on a on a five year cycle, so we do like he was saying, the big needs assessment every five years, I was involved in a little bit of the 2021 but i'm the 2020 we just submit a bi it starts like Martin manson, so it is our work.

310
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:19,110
process.

311
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:22,260
Laura Power: Good thanks for sharing.

312
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:35,430
Laura Power: All right, so specifically Ben about strategic planning and strategic plan, why do we need one Why is, why are those important, aside from the fact that it might be required by you know certain accrediting bodies and.

313
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:47,490
Laura Power: Ideally it's going to help you really, really move you in a certain direction, so it can try to give a unified picture, especially through those values vision mission statements.

314
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:55,380
Laura Power: With the objectives and the goals that you create what that the measurements that you're going to follow it helps out with their performance.

315
00:47:55,380 --> 00:48:10,500
Laura Power: The priorities are for the organization, it may help think about resource allocation and you know have some thought around and planning around organizational strengths and weaknesses or external opportunities and threats.

316
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:15,720
Laura Power: And then, of course, helps to feed into the chairmanship and they kind of go round and round.

317
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:22,590
Laura Power: I thought it was interesting too, because I get in some classes, sometimes, especially when we get to sort of the vision part like.

318
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:34,650
Laura Power: Some skepticism about well really is just this big process all this work, but does it really matter if we have a strategic plan or does it really matter if we know what our vision is for our organization and I think.

319
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:44,460
Laura Power: Ideally, in a perfect world, of course, having all this having established your vision and deciding the goals for your organization, ideally, that will.

320
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:56,100
Laura Power: Put you in the right direction, but does that really happen and I found it interesting that there was a study done a few years back in published in public management review and they were looking at.

321
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:01,680
Laura Power: More than just health department, they were looking at public service organizations this study was done in Canada.

322
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:12,060
Laura Power: And they were just looking at strategic planning and implementation and they reviewed 150 public service organizations and they use questionnaire data to do this, so they did find support.

323
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:24,690
Laura Power: That the having a strategic plan was helpful in getting done and actually accomplishing things that they had hope to accomplish they did find that it was mediated by having.

324
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:28,710
Laura Power: A manager involved so that seemed to help like having if there was a.

325
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:40,530
Laura Power: manager involvement that seemed to be a good explanation for why the strategic planning seem to be working so it wasn't just wasn't just the plant itself, but it was the people involved in executing the plan.

326
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:53,190
Laura Power: And then, they also found that the importance of the strategic plan was moderated by the stakeholder uncertainty so just knowing about the stakeholders, and if there was.

327
00:49:53,190 --> 00:50:04,380
Laura Power: Like a good relationship and kind of certainty within the stakeholders and how they interact it together or if there was sort of not a certain how the stakeholders would be part of the plan or go along with a plan.

328
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:13,290
Laura Power: So that could that have influenced how well the plan matched up with implementation, so it was kind of that was one that was kind of interesting.

329
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:24,750
Laura Power: So maybe Aaron and aaliyah and others are very familiar with this or other guidance, this is from NATO again that's the National Association of county and city health officials and they have this.

330
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:32,130
Laura Power: guidance on developing a strategic plan for a loan for a local health department, and I think there's similar things for state health departments to.

331
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:38,910
Laura Power: And they go through the steps all spend a look a little bit more at the beginning, steps because i'm kind of.

332
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:51,090
Laura Power: Interested on the organizational direction part of things, but we'll just kind of quickly go through all the steps 30 from environmental scan all the way to evaluating way actually kind of step, looking back and how things went.

333
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:57,000
Laura Power: But before you jump into that and I feel like this has been like the buzzword now I feel like we're hearing.

334
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,460
Laura Power: About this, just more maybe I just heard more trainings around us and I don't know if are others.

335
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:11,070
Laura Power: Like aaliyah like and Aaron is you're getting ready to do your strategic planning the whole plan to plan thing that's that's like a thing now.

336
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:19,950
Laura Power: it's always good to play into plan, but I think there's just been like i've seen more trainings around this So the idea of before you take off on a big strategic plan effort.

337
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:32,100
Laura Power: Like that's a big deal as a oh sort of thing there that it's a lot of work to do all of these things so she took plan brings a lot of people together it's a very involved process it's not just one person.

338
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:43,170
Laura Power: Ideally it's not just one person writing out the strategic plan ideally it's bringing together all your stakeholders and reviewing data and agreeing on things so.

339
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:52,560
Laura Power: Before you do that, you need to know if you're ready to do this, is it the right time, do you have the resources, you have the data that you need so planning to plan.

340
00:51:52,560 --> 00:52:02,190
Laura Power: is actually part of the strategic planning process and a lot of that is really assessing what's going on around you and knowing if it's the right time to do it, and if you have all the.

341
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:12,360
Laura Power: Resources that you need or as best you can to be successful ones just understanding the stakeholders, as you get involved who you should involve in the strategic planning process.

342
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:21,900
Laura Power: And maybe you've seen this before we've talked about mapping stakeholders before is a visualization tool here's another more kind of analytical way of thinking about your stakeholders and just.

343
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:32,460
Laura Power: I think this is helpful just you know thinking through all your whether the partners in the effort that you're going into your local health department, you who you know who you're connected people are.

344
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:49,800
Laura Power: different agencies that you work with for maybe you know, like some of them will have more influence on the activities or you know outcomes that you can have some of them, maybe not so much influence, but you may also have organizations or other people that can really.

345
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:55,800
Laura Power: have a lot of interest in kind of pay attention to what you're doing or really just not be that interested and so you can see how.

346
00:52:55,800 --> 00:53:05,490
Laura Power: they're broken them into different categories and say you know you have you identify organizations or people that have high influence.

347
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:14,730
Laura Power: And are really interested in what you're doing, those are can be considered promoters are also key players and those are people you definitely want to bring along with you and.

348
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:18,870
Laura Power: kind of helping your work, but maybe you have people who have high influence and.

349
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:22,020
Laura Power: Maybe are aren't interested or just.

350
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:34,410
Laura Power: Maybe we could be against you a little bit you want a strategy can be to keep them satisfied, so you know these are influential people but they're not really helping you move along so just helps you think about how to handle the different.

351
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:38,850
Laura Power: People and different players that might be involved in the work you're trying to do.

352
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:51,450
Laura Power: The people that are very interested, but really have low influence, maybe it's important to keep them informed but they're just not able to help you as much so just thinks about you know how you can interact with people as you go about your strategic planning.

353
00:53:51,450 --> 00:54:00,960
Laura Power: And then thinking about data that you might need to do it, it can mean all kinds of data raises Annual Report from health departments, or whatever agency you're doing this for.

354
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:13,170
Laura Power: financial analysis looking at your workforce can get the workforce climate customer service, you know other market analyses all kinds of data that you may have.

355
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:21,240
Laura Power: The chip in the chart things like that may help go into working on a plan so.

356
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:31,170
Laura Power: planning to plan as just like getting ready, making sure it's like okay we're diving in So if you do, then the first thing is often described as being an environmental scan.

357
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:35,640
Laura Power: And you know these are just the steps that they recommend so i'm presenting them in this order but.

358
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:44,760
Laura Power: you'll see that sometimes people do them a little bit differently or kind of some things are happening at the same time, but I was trying to go through it this way in an organized process.

359
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:58,500
Laura Power: So an environmental scan is just trying to understand the playing field and it's you know understand your stakeholders trying to gather some data that you thought about what can you actually get and doing a SWOT analysis.

360
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:07,080
Laura Power: Maybe who's done a SWOT analysis before have you guys had to anyone has to do that i'm sure some of you who've done strategic plans.

361
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,050
Laura Power: yeah Victoria.

362
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:29,670
Laura Power: No good yeah so you're looking at sandy good good okay so some of you have experienced with this and you see this, this is using all kinds of settings I mean I used it back in my infection prevention days as a medical director for infection prevention thinking through various.

363
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:42,870
Laura Power: things we were working on, I remember, like my very first thing I tackled when I started like just having my fellowship and just into this job was trying to improve our Clostridium difficile rate, so the hospital acquired.

364
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:52,710
Laura Power: Healthcare associated diarrhea see death and we did a whole SWOT analysis for our work, and you can apply this in many different situations.

365
00:55:52,710 --> 00:56:05,070
Laura Power: The I like this, I find this helpful to think about how, when you do a SWOT analysis part of it is looking internally and part of it is looking externally So what are the strengths and weaknesses.

366
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:17,220
Laura Power: of your agency or organization and then looking outside and thinking about things that are outside of your agency that might be helpful, or maybe potentially harmful to.

367
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:26,100
Laura Power: Your organization I think it's nice to do this in a systematic way I i've done this, and for my private residence around here i've done this for our.

368
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:32,940
Laura Power: program evaluation committee we do a SWOT analysis and it's helpful because sometimes you might be very focused on certain.

369
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:36,660
Laura Power: Things like there's things you know all is the weakness i've been working on.

370
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:45,960
Laura Power: But maybe you forgot to step back and think about positive opportunities or maybe threats that are looming that you just didn't really strategize around like you might know there you might worry about them when you're.

371
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:57,420
Laura Power: Trying to go to sleep at night or something, but maybe they can actually be built into your plan or talked about with other people to think about and together, so I found that helpful.

372
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:03,540
Laura Power: All right, so agency direction, and this is, are we really get into understanding.

373
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:13,050
Laura Power: The values mission and vision, and these are really the backbone on creating a strategic plan and so that's understanding the values, these are things that are sort of.

374
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:24,510
Laura Power: inherent to you know when you think about like your own values they can be your own personal beliefs and they can be beliefs, that are kind of held largely by an organization, so they.

375
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:35,610
Laura Power: they're not you know really changing their kind of who you are who you are at the core of you as a person or as your organization What are those.

376
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:44,040
Laura Power: underlying assumptions that you or your Organization has, as you do your work and are those things guiding your work.

377
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:57,000
Laura Power: So you can imagine, to bring a lot of people together to define the values that are important that can be actually quite a feat to get everyone together and agree on certain values.

378
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:05,820
Laura Power: I actually agree to participate in this recently for our public health training Center we were working are actually working on our mission and vision statement I was like this has been a process because.

379
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:13,710
Laura Power: We have it's a regional training Center so we have partners across in different states, and we are trying to get everyone on the same page about.

380
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:21,000
Laura Power: Creating our new mission and vision and it's a good is a good process we're actually using some of these brainstorming tools to do it.

381
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:27,060
Laura Power: But it's slow and it's like the word smithing and like one word, you know.

382
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:33,570
Laura Power: It can really change what it means to certain people or maybe you didn't think about or have the same connotation, if someone else had about a word.

383
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:41,970
Laura Power: So it can be really involved process but to just keep it simple the values again to the principal believes underlying assumptions.

384
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:50,460
Laura Power: The mission is an organized organization's purpose and what it does and maybe why and kind of like Leo was saying it's kind of how you get.

385
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:58,440
Laura Power: It sort of thing what you do and what you do as an organization in order to get to this broader vision, the bigger picture the the.

386
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:05,580
Laura Power: kind of future vision, the ideal state of the organization that you aspire to, I believe, is that it may not happen in your lifetime.

387
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:14,520
Laura Power: But it's what you're working towards that, like you know big goal that's way up there that you're why you're doing what you're doing so that's what the vision is.

388
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:25,440
Laura Power: Again, the mission kind of describes how you're doing that and the values are things that under like that, and all of this is really important, as the backbone for your strategic plan.

389
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,730
Laura Power: So the other value statement again the values are those fundamental beliefs.

390
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:40,500
Laura Power: And that are most important they're they're kind of like I was saying before either, and almost inherent they're predisposed not a sign they're just part of who you are in part of for your organization is.

391
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:50,190
Laura Power: And values if you if you if you really think about values are fixed they they don't change your strategies and your practices may change but.

392
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:59,430
Laura Power: The value, like, for your values your own personal values, those are kind of your fixed values that you have I mean they may change over time through experiences and things like that, but they're.

393
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:07,740
Laura Power: You know kind of ideally there at the core of who you or your organization is, and they are the things that you will reflect on as you go up and down and different.

394
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:13,080
Laura Power: Experiences through good times and bad times you reflect back on your values and you think about okay.

395
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:25,200
Laura Power: How do I approach this difficult decision that I have coming up, let me think about my values and our organizational values and then, how do I, how will my decision align with those values.

396
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:34,920
Laura Power: So when you make a value statement is really describing those underlying assumptions that your Organization has and it's helpful, I think, for an organization to.

397
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:45,660
Laura Power: Explain and say what its core beliefs are, and I think you know just thinking through, for example, at our school, public health, as I work on in practice activities for our school.

398
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:58,260
Laura Power: i'll need to reflect on or what is the vision and mission of my school how am I, you know hard activities i'm trying to move this work towards, how is it supporting the vision and mission of my school.

399
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:09,120
Laura Power: So it's helpful to have those statements there so that you can kind of drive what the activities are that are happening.

400
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:15,480
Laura Power: Like I was saying earlier, developing the value statement can be really challenging.

401
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:30,390
Laura Power: I won't I don't do it here actually I forgot, I was remembering now that i've done this and josh I think I did this in episode 603 but I don't remember it before before with you, I can't remember did we do the values brainstorming with you.

402
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:31,650
Joshua Bosman: I rings a bell.

403
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:32,040
Laura Power: Like.

404
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:40,980
Laura Power: hey does it ringing a bell for me it's like bringing my belt right now forgot about it so right now yeah yeah sorry I complete 603 and.

405
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:42,870
Joshua Bosman: 516 or so.

406
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:49,980
Laura Power: Okay, well then thanks for three I don't know if josh isn't that I can't remember anymore.

407
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:52,680
Laura Power: You can find different tools to help you try to.

408
01:01:52,680 --> 01:02:04,290
Laura Power: to hone in on your values that are important to you because there's so many different words and you can pick out the different things, and then you can try to categorize them down until like maybe five or so value statements.

409
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:14,010
Laura Power: But you can imagine doing this with a so that's just for yourself imagine doing it with a group of people, for an agency and how you're you know, trying to come up with something that really.

410
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:24,450
Laura Power: Really truly is the most important things, because a lot of times you look at all, you know all these words and they're all important to you, they all matter you want to have all of these things, probably.

411
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:35,610
Laura Power: So what are the ones that are really important to your work and, if you look at some of the actions that your your your organization does maybe they'll maybe they'll become more clear.

412
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:39,150
Laura Power: And there's different there's other.

413
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:44,550
Laura Power: workbook here the strategic planning for nonprofit organizations, they they kind of also go through.

414
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:51,150
Laura Power: similar to that nature guide that I showed you earlier, they just are you can use this workbook to go through.

415
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:59,640
Laura Power: and try to work on these things together, and so they give you know here's a workbook where they want you to identify the values, beliefs and guiding principles.

416
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:14,580
Laura Power: And then they want you to live behaviors that would support that So if you say you value diversity among your staff and within your community, then what are you doing what are the behaviors that match that so you're really trying to be.

417
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:27,150
Laura Power: I don't know accurate like meaningful in what you're saying how do you actually do that and if you're not doing it, but it's important to you, what can you do, because that might help you as you frame your mission and things like that.

418
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:33,540
Laura Power: here's some examples here's one from Madison county health department, this is an Illinois.

419
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:41,160
Laura Power: They say we believe in being sensitive to cultural factors influencing how encouraging employees to pursue personal and professional growth.

420
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:48,120
Laura Power: Delivering high quality services identifying and minimizing health disparities maintaining a qualified workforce.

421
01:03:48,120 --> 01:04:02,910
Laura Power: Providing programs necessary to promote the Community and sustaining partnerships and maintaining Community collaboration here's another way of doing it from Washington State Department of Health where they can list out the values and then say it as a sentence after that too.

422
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:08,160
Laura Power: Just to give you some examples.

423
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:18,180
Laura Power: So mission statement again, this is an organization's purpose and their business and it's a clear explanation of what the organization does and why it's doing it.

424
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:35,640
Laura Power: And there's not really like, for example, the value statement those it's usually like a sentence is usually how its wisdom, maybe enlisted out in different ways, like this, this is short, you know, a word or phrase and it's our sentence, the mission statement can there's not really a.

425
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:43,500
Laura Power: suggestion on how long it needs to be and you'll see that some organizations have longer ones than others, but it's meant to be.

426
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:58,020
Laura Power: using words that are for everyone to understand so it's, not just for the language of the profession that you're working in but for external people to read your mission statement and understand what you're about and how you do it.

427
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:11,520
Laura Power: And as you develop your mission statement you can ask these types of questions what what are our core values are the basic needs of the organization that they're trying to fill what is the purpose, you know what are we responding to, and how can we do that.

428
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,580
Laura Power: here's some example mission statements.

429
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:21,060
Laura Power: The American cancer society is the nationwide Community based voluntary voluntary Health Organization.

430
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:36,510
Laura Power: dedicated to eliminating cancer as a major health problem by preventing cancer saving lives and diminishing suffering from cancer research, education advocacy and service took a longer one but they're trying to contain everything that they do.

431
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:48,420
Laura Power: Another one is to promote, protect and assure conditions for optimal health for residents of Madison county through leadership partnership, prevention and response.

432
01:05:48,420 --> 01:06:00,840
Laura Power: So the vision statement, then, as we had that lovely example from team to the vision communicates how the organization will be different, or the Community will be different in the future, because of the work so it's.

433
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:14,850
Laura Power: it's a very futuristic high like ideal where the what's the benefit going to be, ideally, this would be a very short succinct statement, those are using the best for vision statements.

434
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:26,970
Laura Power: And just to kind of add to the study I showed you earlier, this was another study looking at does it really matter, the quality of a vision statement and organizational performance.

435
01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:30,510
Laura Power: And this study, it was a qualitative study.

436
01:06:30,510 --> 01:06:43,020
Laura Power: I have to admit I can't remember all the details of it, but they did kind of look at I think they ranked vision statements and they looked at different performance indicators for businesses and they found me look it was across different States.

437
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:52,830
Laura Power: I know yeah I forgot, it was in hospitals so it's hospital vision statement and then they were looking at different performance indicators that you can you know look up and find.

438
01:06:52,830 --> 01:07:04,380
Laura Power: And they did find some correlation some positive correlation so the better vision statement, the better some organizations did in their performance it wasn't in every area and it wasn't like consistent across certain areas.

439
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:22,110
Laura Power: But they say that this this really emphasizes the importance of creating an effective vision statement so maybe if you're skeptical here is this one little piece of here's a study that might maybe help you see it, maybe it's important to have.

440
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:31,500
Laura Power: Some sample vision statements North Kentucky health department, will be a nationally recognized leader in advancing the health and safety of the Community.

441
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:45,030
Laura Power: or people enjoy longer and healthier lives because the Washington State Department of Health leads changes in policy systems and environments that prevent illness and injury promote healthy communities and encourage healthy lifestyles.

442
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:54,180
Laura Power: I think the health department ones are somewhat sometimes tough because they're like you know, making everyone healthy so that's kind of they're not they're not specific.

443
01:07:54,180 --> 01:08:09,510
Laura Power: Then you go on to new goals objectives and strategies and you know I won't get into too much details about these but you've probably heard the idea of a smart objective, or even a smart goal, sometimes that they should be.

444
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:14,610
Laura Power: I think, actually, the S stands for something else I wrote smart there, but I think it's like.

445
01:08:14,610 --> 01:08:23,040
Laura Power: i'm forgetting gave you guys can tell me it's something else and smart but it's measurable achievable relevant and time bound, is it.

446
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:26,940
Laura Power: Specific specific Thank you i'm gonna make sense.

447
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:40,050
Laura Power: Smart specific, very good, because you need me as a measure it's like you it's a very specific goal and you achieve it, you can measure it and it's time bound So yes, thank you, thank you for helping me out there.

448
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:51,030
Laura Power: So that's one thing you'll you'll hear that term smart specific and then some measures, an action plan i'm kind of going to go through these more quickly, but as you do, then.

449
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:55,980
Laura Power: As you go through the plan it would talk about allocating resources.

450
01:08:55,980 --> 01:09:09,060
Laura Power: How, you would you communicate and implement this and you can actually find examples of some agencies, putting like a video out, you know they put on their web page about here's our strategic plan it's out there and they introduce it and.

451
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:16,140
Laura Power: You know leader from their organization will be talking about their strategic plan and then they'll be tracking the data.

452
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:27,000
Laura Power: Following those smart goals and objectives and tracking progress, and then you know, using the track progress of feedback and modify the action plan is needed.

453
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:36,810
Laura Power: And then of course there's always the part where you step back and say well how did the process go, how do we do with our strategic plan, what will we do different next time.

454
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:45,060
Laura Power: So that's those are the steps anybody want to comment on any of those.

455
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:50,700
Laura Power: Since I have experienced people in the audience.

456
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:59,460
Laura Power: I pulled up a couple of examples here's the Kent health department strategic plan, just to walk you through it so and many times they.

457
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:13,080
Laura Power: Some organizations need they are required to post the so a lot of times health departments, you can find their strategic plans so here's, this is a in Ohio can help department actually have a newer one that's available now.

458
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:21,360
Laura Power: But this is the they're the one just before their current one, and they kind of describe their strategic planning process, how they did it So you see, they.

459
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:29,850
Laura Power: mentioned a lot of things things we just talked about this is there, this is just how they wrote it this time, so you can see their core values.

460
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:33,180
Laura Power: Their vision statement and their mission.

461
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:38,130
Laura Power: And then they have their priorities.

462
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:47,640
Laura Power: They have their SWOT analysis and more just showing you an economic review in detail, just so you can see how it was organized and presented on the web page.

463
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:53,310
Laura Power: And then even available for everyone to see is there very detailed.

464
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:58,050
Laura Power: goals and objectives.

465
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:10,230
Laura Power: So that's sort of a summary I do want to mention this resource, the region five public health training Center, as I mentioned, they maybe this is why I think plan plan to plan is like the new hot topic now because my group has been working on these.

466
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:20,430
Laura Power: training modules so For those of you that are involved in doing this, or if your co workers that are doing it, the region five public health training Center has these.

467
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:25,080
Laura Power: sort of webinar training series and a couple other ones too, but they just had this whole series.

468
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:32,880
Laura Power: They called it plan to plan and it was sort of those beginning parts of doing and then later on successful implementation of the strategic plan so.

469
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:42,000
Laura Power: Anyway, good as Google, the region five political training Center and get to their catalog and you can find this and many other trainings as well.

470
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:53,130
Laura Power: Okay, so we're doing pretty good so it's 245 so we're going to take to do a quick activity that i'm going to ask you to take.

471
01:11:53,130 --> 01:12:08,160
Laura Power: Maybe 10 minutes at most we'll see how you do, maybe you won't need as much time to review some strategic plans together so i've got them spelled out here, you can also let me go back to the.

472
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:12,540
Laura Power: You go to the canvas page day five.

473
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:31,140
Laura Power: and go to the first one here, the first link to one review strategic plans, you will find some potential strategic strategic plans that you can look at, if you want to you can also find one hey if you got a draft the one you're working on, you can pull that one up and review it.

474
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:48,150
Laura Power: or some other organization that you care about you can find there's two and then take a look, and just see what you think of it so just read through their strategic plan see do you like it, what stood out, I wanted to pull up this guidance.

475
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:55,170
Laura Power: And let's see this is from this is from our state.

476
01:12:55,170 --> 01:13:06,540
Laura Power: Health association mouth Michigan Association for local public health, they have a strategic planning book so got home guidebook and then they have.

477
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:21,750
Laura Power: Just show you here, so you can take a little bit kind of it's a little bit older, but I think it's still a good guidebook it goes through, how to do strategic planning for local health departments, and they have this checklist.

478
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:31,620
Laura Power: And you can look at their strategic plan and just see like do they have all these things that's one quick way of looking at it, those are providing you this checklist to help you.

479
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:46,740
Laura Power: As you assess the other organizations strategic plan, did they have these things, and then you can look at what makes something maybe a better vision statement or mission statement, do you see these qualities in there.

480
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:52,470
Laura Power: Do you see these things in the mission statement so we'll put you in your groups.

481
01:13:52,470 --> 01:14:01,170
Laura Power: And we'll take just a short time to do that, we won't take too long, then we'll come back together and just sort of reflect on that briefly what what was good, was what wasn't good.

482
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:19,500
Laura Power: And then we'll put you back in your groups and then you're going to do your own values mission and vision statements and just sort of finish up your presentations so that's the plan with the if you guys have any questions.

483
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:40,170
Laura Power: Excellent all right josh go ahead and on the breakout rooms 10 minutes, at most, but we'll see if you guys are kind of done, you can come back we'll give you 10 minutes at most.

484
01:14:40,170 --> 01:15:14,550
yeah.

485
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:18,030
Laura Power: Alright, welcome back so that was just.

486
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:25,620
Laura Power: Maybe just kind of here real quick go through each group and see which one you you look at and what your thoughts were.

487
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:29,190
Laura Power: So we'll start let's start with a.

488
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:33,780
Laura Power: let's go backwards, a separate team for.

489
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:38,730
Laura Power: Which one did you guys okay our fam five or team for.

490
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:40,290
Erin  Thompson: Both both.

491
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:42,570
Laura Grage: start here and go ahead.

492
01:15:42,570 --> 01:16:01,110
Erin  Thompson: you're good we looked at the one from the CDC division of HIV, AIDS prevention strategic plan, we thought it was really good We liked the the core values for guy us, then I guess you would usually see often in a strategic plan.

493
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:04,230
Erin  Thompson: But we thought was well done and really thorough.

494
01:16:04,230 --> 01:16:19,320
Laura Power: With the goals and the bottom line and you got it you got y'all can click on that one if you I don't know if you looked at different ones that you can see that, for your canvas page, so they do have a nice way they present the core values and it's a long plan yeah about.

495
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:25,320
Laura Power: done okay good Thank you team for team three What did you look at masters of none.

496
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:29,250
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: That the U of m policy or the strategic plan.

497
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:30,840
Overall.

498
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:40,770
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: I feel like a lot of that you have them documents like this, I see they're like very like I pleasing and they're very.

499
01:16:40,770 --> 01:16:46,830
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: Like patient friendly and they have a lot of good images and I thought this one did to add like a nice little.

500
01:16:46,830 --> 01:16:51,360
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: brief overview and that's it's nice pillars graph that's really easy to understand.

501
01:16:51,360 --> 01:17:02,130
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: When you look at their like actual objective like supposedly objective, things are going to try to do they're still really vague and there's no like actual markers of.

502
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:14,220
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: You know how they're going to increase diversity or mix make a you know you have a more inclusive, or you know things like that so versus the CDC was we looked at also which had very.

503
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:21,540
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: Very like if we need to get this to this percentage when you get this to this percentage now tell us that we're improving.

504
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:44,400
Laura Power: yeah that tends to stand out in that one you see the pillars, a lot of big Henry Ford had a very similar for their health system they have the the pillars that we were talking about very similar Thank you brandon and team to I think most of you are still here are midwesterners.

505
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,670
Laura Power: you're down you're down quintin at this point, but you're still here.

506
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:51,180
Yolaine A Civil: yeah I have a few minutes.

507
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:53,220
Laura Power: I know.

508
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:58,230
Laura Power: What did you guys look at.

509
01:17:58,230 --> 01:18:06,270
Yolaine A Civil: We did the HIV, AIDS prevention prevention's just teaching.

510
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:10,470
Laura Power: me thoughts about it.

511
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:22,020
Yolaine A Civil: i'm just going through that checklist that the guidance when it's the alarm plan it had everything in there, except for the stakeholders weren't listed in there, everything else good job.

512
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:31,050
Laura Power: yeah that's a big third one good Okay, and then our optimizer team, what did you look at.

513
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:35,970
Samantha Lyons: We looked at the portland farmers market, I was really excited about that one.

514
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:36,540
Laura Power: Anything with.

515
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:38,610
Samantha Lyons: portland and the farmers market.

516
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:40,110
Samantha Lyons: and put two together as like.

517
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:40,740
Samantha Lyons: Yes.

518
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:49,620
Samantha Lyons: that's it, but it was really well done in terms of it we really liked how it was concise and then it was accessible to a lot of different groups.

519
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:57,540
Samantha Lyons: And we were going through the guidance checklist and the things that we noticed that we're still missing know where towards the end so items 14 through 16.

520
01:18:57,540 --> 01:19:10,140
Samantha Lyons: and specifically like for like internal external assessments and then how they were going to go about making changes and making revisions and pivoting as needed they didn't really elaborate on and Douglas.

521
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:16,980
Samantha Lyons: notice that specifically if you go to the very end of the packet it says that they're going to determine changes needed.

522
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:31,200
Samantha Lyons: And budget impact, but there's no further explanation of how they're going to do that, so we thought this was a very public facing document and perhaps was an internal one that they were using, and this was purely for the public.

523
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,820
Laura Power: mm hmm.

524
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:35,280
Laura Power: Okay, oh yeah let's see.

525
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,380
Laura Power: The fake.

526
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:43,830
Laura Power: Oh yeah sharing that so keep sharing the strategic plan for the old good okay.

527
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:52,170
Laura Power: we'll take that one out thanks for sharing that came to add that, to my repertoire of a plan that we get to look at it together.

528
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:56,820
Laura Power: Were you part of this or did you.

529
01:19:56,820 --> 01:20:04,080
Kate E Schedel: Know it's like our parent organization for all of us that kind of work in maternal and child health, and so they rolled it out.

530
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:16,650
Kate E Schedel: I think, at the end of 2020 or this year and it just as someone who works in maternal and child health, like we can really clearly see how our work at state level wine so that's a really nicely done.

531
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:20,040
Laura Power: Thank you for sharing that.

532
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:30,690
Laura Power: Alright, so that was just a quick activity to get you thinking about those components, so now we're going to put you back together with your group and let you actually work on some thinking about the values.

533
01:20:30,690 --> 01:20:41,670
Laura Power: mission and vision for your own challenge that you're facing and you're kind of facing it as a sort of maybe you're like a public health coalition, which is very you know nebulous group but you're thinking about trying to.

534
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:48,840
Laura Power: address this problem and how would you do that, what would be the values and come up with a mission and vision statements so.

535
01:20:48,840 --> 01:21:00,030
Laura Power: i'm thinking that i'll let you work on that and then also you know just if there's any finishing touches you want to make to your presentation and then i'm thinking, maybe we could come back together at 330.

536
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:09,150
Laura Power: So we put you in your groups, but you work together stretch your legs, as you need and then come back at 330 does that sound good.

537
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:38,280
Laura Power: Okay, and then I know for the team to what we can we can figure out because no one's got to go soon here so josh go ahead and put them in their group and then aaliyah Anthony we can figure out, we may either have you join or kind of check in with the others.

538
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:49,290
Laura Power: Okay, I think we're all back looks like so now it's time to do the presentations but anything you all need or any questions before we get started.

539
01:21:49,290 --> 01:21:59,520
Laura Power: And if I can just go in order, but if there's any volunteer who wants to go first, we can also do that continue one present first yes, you, Sir can yes.

540
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:16,500
Laura Power: def team on sorry I was just directly to be but team on your number one let's go that makes sense we'll go in order to one of so you guys are welcome to start.

541
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:26,520
Laura Power: Oh that's beautiful.

542
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:30,360
Douglas Frederic Werkman: alrighty so hey guys so we're gonna optimizes we're.

543
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:32,070
Michael-Ryan Lowe: At one second.

544
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:33,180
Michael-Ryan Lowe: Okay, one second.

545
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:41,190
Michael-Ryan Lowe: hey and keep you go to present right of their boss yeah.

546
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:42,270
Michael-Ryan Lowe: yeah.

547
01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:44,370
Michael-Ryan Lowe: Okay sorry about.

548
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:45,360
Douglas Frederic Werkman: you're good you're good.

549
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:45,810
Douglas Frederic Werkman: Thank you.

550
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:57,960
Douglas Frederic Werkman: um, so we are optimizing consisting of annually myself Sammy lions and Michael Ryan, we are going to talk about combating covert 19 vaccine hesitancy.

551
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,820
Douglas Frederic Werkman: And so next slide.

552
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:06,510
Douglas Frederic Werkman: And so, basically a lot of people will think of vaccine hesitancy as being the same as being an Anti vaccine those two.

553
01:23:06,510 --> 01:23:12,840
Douglas Frederic Werkman: Terms kind of get misconstrued a lot in the media and kind of just in general conversation but they're really not the same thing.

554
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:22,170
Douglas Frederic Werkman: When you're thinking of kind of vaccine hesitancy what comes to mind in Michigan as a problem is kind of in like underserved rural areas, you see a lot of vaccine hesitancy.

555
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:35,070
Douglas Frederic Werkman: And this is this is linked to several factors I mean a lot of times you see people with you know less understanding of science, largely due to having you know lower education in general, a lot of just high school graduation.

556
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:37,710
Douglas Frederic Werkman: and as such they have you know.

557
01:23:37,710 --> 01:23:43,440
Douglas Frederic Werkman: A lot of misinformation coming down, they have fear of medical establishment they're kind of anti establishment in general.

558
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:49,170
Douglas Frederic Werkman: kind of altogether this comes together as people delaying getting the vaccine or not getting the vaccine at all.

559
01:23:49,170 --> 01:24:00,900
Douglas Frederic Werkman: Even with lots of efforts from primary care physicians across the state there's still a lot of resistance, and this is in contrast to anti vaccine which that's more so kind of like the conspiracy theory.

560
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:12,750
Douglas Frederic Werkman: intentionally spreading misinformation, or you know not intentionally spreading this information, but people who are really dedicated thinking that you know the vaccines evil, or you know Bill Gates is going to microchip you that type of thing.

561
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:14,610
Douglas Frederic Werkman: And so next slide.

562
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:20,010
Douglas Frederic Werkman: So this from a legal standpoint it's kind of interesting to look at this stuff because.

563
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:33,690
Douglas Frederic Werkman: So the va health system was the first federal agency which mandated covert 19 vaccination and just recently, the state of California rolled out a mandate for other State employees who work in healthcare or higher risk congregate settings now.

564
01:24:33,690 --> 01:24:36,540
Douglas Frederic Werkman: Something that's kind of interesting with this is.

565
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:46,350
Douglas Frederic Werkman: How it's working out legally across the nation it's going in all kinds of directions indiana a federal judge recently ruled on a coven 19 mandatory vaccination thing in favor of it.

566
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:57,060
Douglas Frederic Werkman: However, a similar case in Texas was overturned in a I believe circuit court and so people are thinking that this is going to ultimately result in the scotus case.

567
01:24:57,060 --> 01:25:04,830
Douglas Frederic Werkman: which could be very interesting and you know, believe it or not, everyone on scotus is actually vaccinated and has been for a while.

568
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:17,100
Douglas Frederic Werkman: Not all of them are openly public about it, but it is now known information that everyone is vaccinated So hopefully that will lead to this being ruled in a good direction for the public health of our nation.

569
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:27,600
Douglas Frederic Werkman: Further on you know 163 million people are vaccinated in the US and 169 or not so that's not you know the best statistics to be seeing with how devastating the virus has been.

570
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:36,450
Douglas Frederic Werkman: However, Californians are up to 65% having at least one or two shots which you know that that's better than the US at large.

571
01:25:36,450 --> 01:25:45,330
Douglas Frederic Werkman: kind of a shocking thing that I stumbled upon was a Washington Post article but references study done about 20,000 people so it's a fairly large sample size.

572
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:51,960
Douglas Frederic Werkman: Talking about where people get their news now I was fairly shocked at 31% of people primarily get the news from Facebook.

573
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:57,450
Douglas Frederic Werkman: because to me that that's just it's just shocking to me that that's like a primary source that people use.

574
01:25:57,450 --> 01:26:12,270
Douglas Frederic Werkman: But it's it's widespread and I think that contributes a lot to this vaccine hesitancy and that's what the article was talking about a lot, I mean the other two thirds are largely from CNN and Fox, both of which are you know bias in one direction or the other politically.

575
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:19,710
Douglas Frederic Werkman: A couple other just interesting statistics I pulled from that were that women are amongst the study sample 10% more likely to get the vaccine than men.

576
01:26:19,710 --> 01:26:29,370
Douglas Frederic Werkman: And the other kind of shocking one was that a quarter of gen Z are not planning to get the vaccine gen Z are people born around the millennium or younger.

577
01:26:29,370 --> 01:26:35,250
Douglas Frederic Werkman: And so, in general, the unvaccinated the people who are resisting this, as I said before, less education.

578
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:44,610
Douglas Frederic Werkman: You see younger people people of color people who lean conservative on the voter spectrum and just being really located.

579
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:50,370
Douglas Frederic Werkman: And next slide.

580
01:26:50,370 --> 01:27:08,220
Michael-Ryan Lowe: Alright guys i'm gonna pick up here so right here what our diagram we kind of just looked at on four different areas that were prominently up.

581
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:23,520
Michael-Ryan Lowe: I said, we probably probably looked at four different areas um well five i'm sorry areas that were that are prominently affecting the vaccine has no see i'm racing the country because, as you can see, as the cover 19.

582
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:37,170
Michael-Ryan Lowe: Rights are starting to skyrocket and incline we are seeing very much a decline and people who are wanting to receive the vaccine, and so we had to survey the server different reasons why this may be problematic.

583
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:42,690
Michael-Ryan Lowe: So, for example, when we look at the vaccine itself, you know some individuals.

584
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:56,460
Michael-Ryan Lowe: Have a fear of you know, the agreements that are contained within that vaccine, some people just simply don't want to have to get two doses of a vaccine, you know they wonder, you know i'm do to.

585
01:27:56,460 --> 01:28:01,740
Michael-Ryan Lowe: Pass experiments, like the tuskegee experiment and different things that nature.

586
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:12,030
Michael-Ryan Lowe: Will you know the history of vaccines and everything in this country will that you know contribute and be the same effects of cover 19 like what are the long term effects.

587
01:28:12,030 --> 01:28:24,240
Michael-Ryan Lowe: And when we look at healthcare, you know from the scope of healthcare back saying hesitancy is negative and it's a really impacts our health care system, you know we're running out of rooms.

588
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:42,330
Michael-Ryan Lowe: I see us are severely impacted you know they don't I mean supplies is one area of because you know, in order to run a hospital, you have to have the appropriate supplies, you have to have medications and everything of that nature and so with our healthcare system being overwhelmed by.

589
01:28:42,330 --> 01:28:53,430
Michael-Ryan Lowe: The coven it pandemic, you know by individuals choosing not to get a vaccine we're pretty they're pretty much aiding in the impact of our healthcare system, you know.

590
01:28:53,430 --> 01:29:02,790
Michael-Ryan Lowe: When we look at your efforts structure, you know, health, health disparities plays a major part in in vaccine hesitancy as well you know.

591
01:29:02,790 --> 01:29:16,260
Michael-Ryan Lowe: i'm I have been came across specifically anyone who has been you know in any extreme our hardships or conditions, whereas they couldn't afford or can afford a free vaccine, or you know.

592
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:31,410
Michael-Ryan Lowe: i'm couldn't get it, for any reason, however, you know just just having to deal with you know housing security and and being inside of you know um dwellings that where we consider a project, where people are.

593
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:38,160
Michael-Ryan Lowe: Side by side, or in close proximity of each other that increases the spread of the covered 19 vaccine.

594
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:58,650
Michael-Ryan Lowe: And you know by them choosing not to you know become get vaccinated you know we're seeing an increase with that to within our country social determinants of health, you know citizenship status, I haven't I don't I don't pretty much know how citizenship status would necessarily directly.

595
01:29:58,650 --> 01:30:05,490
Michael-Ryan Lowe: impact, you know not receiving the vaccine, however, you know when we're dealing with.

596
01:30:05,490 --> 01:30:17,100
Michael-Ryan Lowe: groups who are spreading false information like anti vaccine and things of that nature that's promoting negative publicity and that's causing a lot of people to second guess.

597
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:27,900
Michael-Ryan Lowe: Should they get the vaccine is the vaccine say that's why I always tell individuals who kind of present to me with miss or reasons why they shouldn't get the vaccine, I always tell them, you know.

598
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:32,760
Michael-Ryan Lowe: it's good to form your own opinion but just make sure you're focusing more on facts.

599
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:44,760
Michael-Ryan Lowe: Instead of myths and you always always always want to check your sources that's the first time they ever tell you when you're doing research check your sources so you know if i'm on Facebook and I see.

600
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:52,800
Michael-Ryan Lowe: A friend billy gel post a status, I just that says, you know i'm color vaccines contain microchips you know.

601
01:30:52,800 --> 01:31:07,860
Michael-Ryan Lowe: Do we think that sort of a reliable source Facebook or any social media outlet no probably not however be received information probably from the CDC or and I he or follow those pages that information may be more positive and more impactful.

602
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:20,910
Michael-Ryan Lowe: And lastly, we kind of just want to look at the the Community development Center upward trend in the Community development will will help towards vast faxing hesitant to see you know that's kind of like the.

603
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:26,220
Michael-Ryan Lowe: The purpose of our presentation, you know, to come up with a public health initiative that will help.

604
01:31:26,220 --> 01:31:42,240
Michael-Ryan Lowe: decrease, you know vaccine hesitancy that's the purpose, right here is for us to decrease lacks a hesitancy to decrease the negative connotations and myths that are surrounding our social media platforms and to promote positivity and factual information.

605
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:49,440
Michael-Ryan Lowe: Next.

606
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:58,800
Anne Victoria Lee: And so, this week was very fortuitous in that on Monday California announced a covert 19 vaccination mandate.

607
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:17,880
Anne Victoria Lee: For all State employees, which actually those who work in healthcare and Congress settings and interact with the public, and if an employee doesn't show proof of vaccination with a Vaccination Card, they must undergo weekly covert 19 testing and continue to wear pee pee.

608
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:29,430
Anne Victoria Lee: So in California this affects a tremendous number of employees, because the California school systems, the uc system, all of the prisons.

609
01:32:29,430 --> 01:32:53,280
Anne Victoria Lee: This California state firefighters are just so many California State employees, and so it will take effect August 2 and the testing will be phased in over the next few weeks and healthcare workers and color facilities mandate will take effect August night and so that was kind of.

610
01:32:53,280 --> 01:33:17,940
Anne Victoria Lee: A new thing because it was an entire state, and then on Wednesday in New York state enacted their own coven 19 vaccine mandate requiring vaccination for State employees and that will take effect after Labor day and so far the news reported, it will affect over 130,000 employees.

611
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:25,620
Samantha Lyons: Talking briefly about our logic model, beginning with the situation California was experiencing an increase in the number of.

612
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:34,500
Samantha Lyons: infections and so by employing this policy, they were really aiming to prioritize the safety of healthcare workers and restabilize the economy.

613
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:43,260
Samantha Lyons: Several investments have been put into place, such as Community partnerships with faith based organizations and local businesses such as mcdonald's and six flags.

614
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:56,670
Samantha Lyons: They also worked with barbershops as well to serve as pop up clinics ultimately they wanted to also protect vulnerable communities, those who were remote homebound and with limited access.

615
01:33:56,670 --> 01:34:00,960
Samantha Lyons: And those who also frequented state services.

616
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:09,960
Samantha Lyons: There were several short term results and medium results, as well as long term results that we are anticipating as a result of this policy.

617
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:14,520
Samantha Lyons: Some that we were expecting and others that we will likely unexpected.

618
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:23,940
Samantha Lyons: Some that we were expecting was to hopefully reduce unemployment, improve productivity of the state and begin to engage residents again and social activities.

619
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:39,330
Samantha Lyons: Some unexpected consequences of this policy include an impact on climate change as people get back to doing regular activities and frequenting businesses there's an increase in energy expenditure and also use of natural resources.

620
01:34:39,330 --> 01:34:44,910
Samantha Lyons: Next slide please.

621
01:34:44,910 --> 01:34:56,460
Samantha Lyons: In terms of the leverage assessment we position the star here because we saw this as a fundamental change in behavior given that what we have seen over the last year and how this will change moving forward in California.

622
01:34:56,460 --> 01:35:04,200
Samantha Lyons: We anticipate that there will be few unintended consequences in terms of those that are drastically impactful on the Community.

623
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:18,150
Samantha Lyons: Because we saw that most of the consequences would be positive, some of the negative ones being the climate change that I mentioned previously, as well as perhaps polarization of the local communities.

624
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:29,010
Samantha Lyons: Next slide.

625
01:35:29,010 --> 01:35:48,150
Michael-Ryan Lowe: Our very poor habit of mute my MIC I forget that it's muted all right so i'm right here we're looking at how to apply an equity lens to vaccine hesitancy, so we need to pretty much survey, the best way to make this fair and promote you know.

626
01:35:48,150 --> 01:35:58,890
Michael-Ryan Lowe: The positive and the negative impacts of you know vaccine has been saved to the Community OK, so the groups that are mostly affected um.

627
01:35:58,890 --> 01:36:19,560
Michael-Ryan Lowe: You know by this policy on in California it's got it well first off it's going to impact all employees, but it's predominantly you know impact California State employees it's going to impact, you know state government health officials, as well as firefighters and.

628
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:29,730
Michael-Ryan Lowe: it's going to also impact, you know the the kids you know it's gone at the kids and everything like by them initiating this policy.

629
01:36:29,730 --> 01:36:40,530
Michael-Ryan Lowe: More children can go back to school and I have to worry about you know contracted the virus from their peers and potentially going home and pass it on to their relatives and.

630
01:36:40,530 --> 01:36:59,430
Michael-Ryan Lowe: The conditions and waste of policy on the effects of Community it's going to now pretty much improved the stability of the of the economy is going to help you know any visitors will return to back to their regular social activities is going to you know.

631
01:36:59,430 --> 01:37:15,000
Michael-Ryan Lowe: The crease you know the individuals who oppose the vaccine what we consider as anti vaccine and it's going to this policy is going to also help to increase like the energy and natural resources throughout the state of California.

632
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,470
Michael-Ryan Lowe: Next slide.

633
01:37:19,470 --> 01:37:30,210
Samantha Lyons: In terms of unintended consequences we could potentially see an increase and resident rebellion against the California government for those who do not want to comply with this policy.

634
01:37:30,210 --> 01:37:37,230
Samantha Lyons: As well as potentially immigration of residents and businesses out of Camp California, to avoid this Protocol.

635
01:37:37,230 --> 01:37:43,950
Samantha Lyons: given also that more people will be receiving the vaccine, as a result of this mandate, we may perceive.

636
01:37:43,950 --> 01:37:51,570
Samantha Lyons: there to be a greater rate of adverse reactions to vaccination when the actual reality, the number would be consistent with previous data.

637
01:37:51,570 --> 01:37:59,400
Samantha Lyons: And, as I mentioned previously potential increase in pollution and use of natural resources, as people return to social engagement.

638
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:04,470
Samantha Lyons: In terms of decrease consequences we anticipate that perhaps.

639
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:10,290
Samantha Lyons: The retention of State employees would decrease, given that some may not wish to comply with this mandate.

640
01:38:10,290 --> 01:38:22,620
Samantha Lyons: As well as trust in medicine, if people are being forced to do something for whatever reason they're less likely to contribute further to a positive relationship between themselves and medicine.

641
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:35,820
Samantha Lyons: And then, in terms of other unintended consequences this may impact the governor who had issued this mandate as he is undergoing a recall election, so we could see some political shifts and governance as a result.

642
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:39,810
Samantha Lyons: Next slide.

643
01:38:39,810 --> 01:38:47,460
Douglas Frederic Werkman: Thanks amy and so for village values mission and vision we were kind of inspired by the Washington county health department's.

644
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:57,030
Douglas Frederic Werkman: stuff it's very positive very tangible list for our values we used, we will statements, because it's kind of like a tangible like this is what we're going to do.

645
01:38:57,030 --> 01:39:05,340
Douglas Frederic Werkman: We will promote equal health access we will decrease barriers to social services, we will improve Community and individual health and we will advance public safety.

646
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:15,180
Douglas Frederic Werkman: I mean, of course, all of this just comes together for kind of the health of the nation, all together, as a very big public health initiative and knocking down barriers to care is a huge central part of that.

647
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:26,160
Douglas Frederic Werkman: And so, our mission is to promote and encourage comprehensive multifaceted integration of systems for improved vaccination rates and prevention of communicable disease to maintain public safety.

648
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:34,920
Douglas Frederic Werkman: And our vision and the future we imagine a world where people can enjoy their lives and community without fear of code and its variance which will look different in different communities, but.

649
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:45,780
Douglas Frederic Werkman: we're hoping to alleviate that fear and get rid of the coven threats and now i'm gonna hand it off to Andy to take us home with the last few slides.

650
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:46,350
Anne Victoria Lee: So.

651
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:51,960
Anne Victoria Lee: When we're looking at vaccine hesitancy this is.

652
01:39:51,960 --> 01:40:14,850
Anne Victoria Lee: A behavior that's been in existence since the first vaccine in 1796 with the smallpox smallpox vaccine, but because of our increase news awareness and the speed of social media it's been much more prominent and it has affected a lot more people so.

653
01:40:14,850 --> 01:40:35,310
Anne Victoria Lee: This concept of vaccine hesitancy was given a name in 2016 and two has actually done a lot of research on it, and they have a model of vaccine hesitancy which involves complacency like oh I don't think I could ever get coated and confidence in the vaccine which is.

654
01:40:35,310 --> 01:40:48,240
Anne Victoria Lee: They just don't feel like the vaccine is going to work because they know somebody who got it back the infection, even though they have the vaccine and then convenience could be a lot of different things like.

655
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:52,650
Anne Victoria Lee: it's just too much trouble they don't have the time to get it and.

656
01:40:52,650 --> 01:41:05,700
Anne Victoria Lee: They don't believe in it, so why should they put themselves out those are all classified under convenience which can be minor like they just don't have time that they're not really objecting to outright refusal.

657
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:25,590
Anne Victoria Lee: And there was nothing that really captured the essence of the fanatical anti baxter's with their kind of misinformation in terms of what we need to be doing in the future to combat vaccine hesitancy is come up with measures that.

658
01:41:25,590 --> 01:41:44,460
Anne Victoria Lee: measure the degree of vaccine hesitancy and there already is a lot of surveys on this going on and regularly check in with public perception of vaccine mandates and then continue to follow the infection rates and vaccination numbers.

659
01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:48,000
Anne Victoria Lee: And then, in terms of strategies.

660
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,340
Anne Victoria Lee: lately.

661
01:41:50,340 --> 01:42:11,280
Anne Victoria Lee: it's been made aware to me that a lot of the burden of combating vaccine residency has been on healthcare workers, the primary care doctors who have to convince somebody to get vaccinated and that's been a big burden and I was thinking of ways to.

662
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:17,700
Anne Victoria Lee: handle this problem strategically, so I designed this little wheel and.

663
01:42:17,700 --> 01:42:25,590
Anne Victoria Lee: it's the system strategy to combat vaccine hesitancy and so, first of all there's the government, they they make the.

664
01:42:25,590 --> 01:42:41,160
Anne Victoria Lee: The laws and the policies like California New York did, and the second aspect of the wheel would be legal and the courts and whenever there's going to be a challenge to that policies or mandates, they could uphold.

665
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:53,430
Anne Victoria Lee: The mandate for the vaccine and then they could also prosecute people who are really egregious in spreading misinformation about.

666
01:42:53,430 --> 01:43:17,520
Anne Victoria Lee: Vaccination and the third aspect of that which also blends into the fourth is a more active role for media public relations public figures and social media to support and promote vaccination and also get involved with trying to understand what is making people refuse to get vaccinated.

667
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:29,070
Anne Victoria Lee: The fourth one is the businesses and organizations and community groups faith based community groups and schools which will continue to.

668
01:43:29,070 --> 01:43:34,080
Anne Victoria Lee: Take the mandate into effect and.

669
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:44,580
Anne Victoria Lee: Like employers who are mandating vaccination for their employees and carrying out the actual enforcement of these mandates.

670
01:43:44,580 --> 01:44:00,900
Anne Victoria Lee: And then five is something that we haven't mentioned before, and it's everybody else like we all as individuals, know somebody who has refused a vaccination and we can all say this, since I knew somebody who.

671
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:20,820
Anne Victoria Lee: didn't get vaccinated is it's my responsibility to try to convince that person to get vaccinated and or to contribute to the understanding of what is making that person refuse to get vaccinated and if we all can take it upon ourselves to accept some of that responsibility.

672
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:28,410
Anne Victoria Lee: that's what we need to do to combat this vaccine hesitancy.

673
01:44:28,410 --> 01:44:32,340
Anne Victoria Lee: And these are references.

674
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:35,760
Anne Victoria Lee: And, and as a presentation Thank you so much.

675
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:37,260
Laura Power: Thank you.

676
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:45,030
Laura Power: reject team that was really good very comprehensive, I would say to I was especially impressed with the.

677
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:53,310
Laura Power: The mapping the system that you did your causal diagram that was very impressive as to how you thought of many different things in there, and you were actually.

678
01:44:53,310 --> 01:45:04,050
Laura Power: able to display it in a way that we could follow to have that was really nice and kind of a very timely I don't know if For those of you at university of Michigan if you saw the.

679
01:45:04,050 --> 01:45:19,260
Laura Power: emails but now it is, it is now mandated for university of Michigan so that's a big news today, so we weren't sure that was going to happen, we were there was a lot of debate lot of feelings back and forth can that happen, but it's happening so.

680
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:22,950
Laura Power: kind of timely that's interesting.

681
01:45:22,950 --> 01:45:31,530
Laura Power: What i've just asked from the group I love to hear some other people kind of add to the discussion here.

682
01:45:31,530 --> 01:45:38,880
Laura Power: You guys did a really nice job of explaining the policy in your logic model also it was very well thought out.

683
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:56,010
Ahya Sajawal Ali: One thing that I wanted to sort of share wise then like faxing hesitancy in America as a small proportion, or maybe I don't know how much of the proportion of the population of living in rural areas and in really is.

684
01:45:56,010 --> 01:46:04,320
Ahya Sajawal Ali: it's comparing it to Pakistan it's, not only because people are not educated enough or they don't have enough information.

685
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:14,580
Ahya Sajawal Ali: The cases in rural areas are obviously less because they don't have like you know, in a big city, you will have crowded.

686
01:46:14,580 --> 01:46:22,770
Ahya Sajawal Ali: gatherings more and, obviously, the population is more, I mean they're very obvious reasons to buy the spread just.

687
01:46:22,770 --> 01:46:31,620
Ahya Sajawal Ali: is like fire wanted comes to a major city versus the rural areas, and I think like in mitigating this.

688
01:46:31,620 --> 01:46:47,490
Ahya Sajawal Ali: This is an important aspect that even though you might not see cases it's not that you know you're safe, where necessary, I mean there has to be some policy which either limits travel, I mean Australia is done that.

689
01:46:47,490 --> 01:46:50,280
Ahya Sajawal Ali: They have interstate.

690
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:59,640
Ahya Sajawal Ali: Restrictions all on the time they are four cases and Adelaide right now, and they cannot cross state border lines.

691
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:15,060
Ahya Sajawal Ali: i'm not saying that this would be the best policy but, like some retribution or something that makes you understand that it's if you don't see it it's not like you know it's not going to impact you when you're not going to give it to other people yeah.

692
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:22,260
Laura Power: yeah that's often mentioned and thinking about beyond Kobe but just actually hesitancy in general, when you think about measles.

693
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:30,030
Laura Power: measles mumps and things like that that we're not really, seeing as much anymore, because the vaccines have been so successful, but that is sometimes brought up as a reason why.

694
01:47:30,030 --> 01:47:42,150
Laura Power: Maybe people are hesitant because they don't feel like they're likely to get it so where people live there's different things that could go into their perceptions about their perception of risk that's a great point.

695
01:47:42,150 --> 01:47:43,980
Laura Grage: And I quick.

696
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:50,940
Laura Grage: comment as well, I, like you, guys included at the beginning of the show about how.

697
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:58,080
Laura Grage: Were the primary news sources for people, I think that you said that Douglas and that like Facebook, is a.

698
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:10,350
Laura Grage: huge proportion of people go to Facebook first and I found that astounding as well and I work on a misinformation group for Facebook for Alaska about code 19 and.

699
01:48:10,350 --> 01:48:21,420
Laura Grage: I wasn't prior to working with this group on Facebook that much it was on there just for my own personal you know, think it was a very personal Facebook page and.

700
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:33,300
Laura Grage: I have just learned so much about my community and about Alaska and my whole algorithm has changed because, for it would send to work we kind of go to these flagged messages, as a group and.

701
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:40,770
Laura Grage: respond to the misinformation and it's just really interesting what you learn about your community and how things move through a community and how.

702
01:48:40,770 --> 01:48:56,250
Laura Grage: You know when they talk about how things move like fire on social media if you don't spend a lot of time on social media it's pretty incredible to see that in play, and just really interesting for public health practice going forward and i'll post a little.

703
01:48:56,250 --> 01:49:07,410
Laura Grage: News article in the chat box about our misinformation group just to inspire other states to take them up via social media people on it, but that was a great presentation thanks you guys.

704
01:49:07,410 --> 01:49:11,190
Douglas Frederic Werkman: yeah Thank you, thank you for the insight that's really interesting.

705
01:49:11,190 --> 01:49:17,970
Douglas Frederic Werkman: I actually wanted to add something that I forgot to mention that Washington Post Article one of the points of the article was that.

706
01:49:17,970 --> 01:49:32,010
Douglas Frederic Werkman: If people so, but the largest proportion of people do get their news from Facebook and if people get their news from Facebook they're much more likely to be anti vax than people who watch fox or CNN which I thought was interesting but yeah.

707
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:34,620
Ahya Sajawal Ali: i'm surprised, since again not too.

708
01:49:34,620 --> 01:49:37,320
Ahya Sajawal Ali: Bad list yet.

709
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:38,730
No.

710
01:49:38,730 --> 01:49:46,050
Laura Power: very interesting, well, I think your presentation just shows how complex, you know we talked about complex problems.

711
01:49:46,050 --> 01:49:55,200
Laura Power: And I think your system map really brought that home there's so many things and even separating out anti vax from vaccine hesitancy.

712
01:49:55,200 --> 01:50:09,540
Laura Power: And where they blur and where are they where they are very different, and so, those are different things to counteract to so it just really is a multi layered multi multiple perspectives that you pointed out in that so.

713
01:50:09,540 --> 01:50:14,190
Laura Power: And I, and I liked your approach at the end just thinking through like different ways.

714
01:50:14,190 --> 01:50:25,290
Laura Power: to how we can come at this issue so i'm really nicely done I enjoyed kind of watching your thought process through it all and see how you did that Oh, I also wanted to say to I enjoyed your list of.

715
01:50:25,290 --> 01:50:36,930
Laura Power: unintended consequences, I think you really took it out really far you thought you know, like all the different things that could change so that was a really well thought out so great job, thank you.

716
01:50:36,930 --> 01:50:44,400
Laura Power: All right, well i'm to the next group, so I think, maybe team three then we'll see.

717
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:50,430
Laura Power: let's see team three are masters of none, maybe you feel like masters of all now me.

718
01:50:50,430 --> 01:50:59,100
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: Right, so I can share my screen if that works with you all team, and then I can just flip through the slides for everyone.

719
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:09,060
That works.

720
01:51:09,060 --> 01:51:27,060
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: All right, Hello everyone, we are the masters of none let's see if we learned something we're going to talk about to about the accessibility and affordability of insulin and our mandate for emergency insulin supply for the under insured and uninsured.

721
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:34,500
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: To start just a little bit about the issue, maybe you all have seen, especially if you live in America that.

722
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:46,770
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: Access insulin is a huge problem there's a lot of diabetics worldwide and in the United States, a lot of them requiring insulin and insulin being a drug that they need to live.

723
01:51:46,770 --> 01:51:58,920
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: There, a vulnerable population at baseline and just the access to insulin is difficult for a lot of patients, due to the cost mostly.

724
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:09,900
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: insulins one of those medications that no matter how long it's been out it the price just keeps going up, and if you don't have insurance, it can be thousands of dollars you're paying.

725
01:52:09,900 --> 01:52:26,250
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: per month there's even programs like Bernie Sanders is kind of quoted for starting a program going to Canada to get patients insulin just because the costs are so expensive in the United States and it's been in the media very frequently.

726
01:52:26,250 --> 01:52:36,780
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: I know the slides pretty wordy but some of the demographics just give you a little bit of more information about diabetes so about 10% of Americans have diabetes.

727
01:52:36,780 --> 01:52:54,630
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: And a lot of them are also children with the usually worse prognosis type one diabetes and it's just increasing, as you can see the prevalence is increasing as increased by 26% and just continues to increase.

728
01:52:54,630 --> 01:53:04,800
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: More and more Americans are being diagnosed with that every year, we know that there is a racial ethnic component, that seems like.

729
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:13,530
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: Like people from Alaska and Native Americans Hispanics are definitely at greater risk than some other ethnic groups.

730
01:53:13,530 --> 01:53:30,570
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: And it's also one of the leading causes of death, just because it causes so many complications that really lead to it being a very chronic problem that has a lot of costs on the healthcare system and a lot of reducing quality life years.

731
01:53:30,570 --> 01:53:42,900
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: So what is the cost, overall, as you can see from the image on the screen left the United States is much more expensive, and this is just talking about out of pocket costs for the average person, so this is talking.

732
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:58,440
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: People with insurance without insurance because it's usually not free, even if you have insurance, and you can see it's over double what the next country is, and that also just continues to increase.

733
01:53:58,440 --> 01:54:19,290
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: Another slide that I thought was interesting just showing that the people with insurance with medicare their out of pocket costs has quadrupled in the last 10 years you can see, almost $1,000 per month people with insurance or even having to pay for their insolence.

734
01:54:19,290 --> 01:54:33,750
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: So what's the reasonings for this there's a variety, to start there's really a monopoly on the supply of insulin about three companies, some of you probably heard of eli lilly eli lady.

735
01:54:33,750 --> 01:54:41,340
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: Novo Nordisk and send O fi our control about 90% of the world's insulin market.

736
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:52,230
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: which obviously you can tell makes a monopoly developed very quickly when you're not having a supply and demand there's no other companies making the price.

737
01:54:52,230 --> 01:55:05,460
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: go down and we've noticed that in some other countries like China and India, they have more domestic insulin companies that can kind of drive down that price, and they have other systems that incorporate that.

738
01:55:05,460 --> 01:55:12,690
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: it's also just a really vulnerable population it's estimated about 10 million people in the United States need insulin.

739
01:55:12,690 --> 01:55:27,150
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: And with that that those patients that they don't get insulin they're going they're going to have very bad health outcome very quickly and that number is estimated increased by about 20% by 2030.

740
01:55:27,150 --> 01:55:31,290
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: there's also a problem with the generic most drugs when you.

741
01:55:31,290 --> 01:55:38,550
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: When they've been around for a certain amount of time they're usually on a patent so like the pharmaceutical company that people that made it can make their money back.

742
01:55:38,550 --> 01:55:50,220
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: But at some point that drug it's a lot cheaper, but with insulin it's what we call like a bio a biologic medication because it's not made in like a you know chemical way per se.

743
01:55:50,220 --> 01:55:54,810
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: And there's different rules on that and there's.

744
01:55:54,810 --> 01:56:03,930
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: it's much more challenging to make usually if someone else is trying to get in the market for something like insulin they have to go through the same process that the original company did.

745
01:56:03,930 --> 01:56:13,140
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: To prove that the biologic is safe so it's a lot of getting approval from the FDA doing studies that cost a lot of money so there's not as much incentive for it.

746
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:19,530
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: there's also something called price fixing so usually with competition.

747
01:56:19,530 --> 01:56:31,260
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: You know if you have two companies, they will compete like if you know Amazon is selling something at $10 but walmart sells at $8 you know Amazon will will move it down.

748
01:56:31,260 --> 01:56:40,410
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: But, as you can see from this bottom image that's not what's happening so you can see, for example on the Left lantus is one of the major three companies.

749
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:51,540
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: insulin and 11 years another company, and you can see that both got released around the same time and they're doing this thing called price fixing, which is illegal, but when you're a big company and kind of get away with it.

750
01:56:51,540 --> 01:57:05,580
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: Is that you can see, like every time one drug went up the other one went up just with the same amount so it's basically one company is like hey we're going to charge them $100 part will charge them $100 to, and you can see the same thing with human log.

751
01:57:05,580 --> 01:57:12,060
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: That the as the both those medications went up they increase they both increase that the same amount.

752
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:23,010
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: Next, something called ever greening so I didn't know what this was either, but I guess with a patent more or less than United States usually it's about 20 years and then that patent goes away and.

753
01:57:23,010 --> 01:57:29,100
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: You can another the drug gets generic so they can start selling it for a much cheaper price.

754
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:39,540
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: But with evergreen, as usual, is the concept of being able to just change around the structure of the drug just enough to where it's considered new again so you can get a new patent.

755
01:57:39,540 --> 01:57:59,220
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: And this has been done multiple times something like the drug lantus, which is a very common long acting insulin there's like more than 70 patents for just that drug and it's added like an additional 3040 years on its patent so they can keep selling it at the increased price.

756
01:57:59,220 --> 01:58:07,890
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: They also have these pay for delay schemes so if someone else wants to make a drug that you have a patent for another company.

757
01:58:07,890 --> 01:58:21,360
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: The original company that has that patent can actually pay that company to not make it so if you have already have a monopoly, because only three companies hold most of the supply of a drug that a lot of people need.

758
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:35,340
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: They can, if someone's like Oh, I want to start making insulin they can just pay off that company and say hey we'll give you this much money just don't make it because it's their patent and that's legal to do in certain cases and they've been able to make it work.

759
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:43,530
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: And last it's lobbying, you know they have a lot of power they have billions of dollars they're part of basically every election.

760
01:58:43,530 --> 01:58:52,830
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: And so there's a lot of reasons why it makes a lot of sense why insulin should be affordable for patients and why it hasn't been cheaper, or why it hasn't gotten cheaper.

761
01:58:52,830 --> 01:59:08,580
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: can see from the top right that insulin was started in like the 1920s and some of the drugs that we still use today came up not too long after that and they're still the prices are just continuing to go up.

762
01:59:08,580 --> 01:59:11,160
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: From there i'll pass it on.

763
01:59:11,160 --> 01:59:20,250
Kate E Schedel: Alright, thanks brandon i'm, so this is our cause a little diagram and we had one and we kind of scratched it and went back to the stakeholder list, because this is.

764
01:59:20,250 --> 01:59:34,350
Kate E Schedel: Like what I would imagine is one of these just really complex problems, and when we talked about insulin supply, we talked about both affordability and accessibility, but all of the points that we have in our original causal diagram.

765
01:59:34,350 --> 01:59:36,450
Kate E Schedel: kept leaning back to stakeholders.

766
01:59:36,450 --> 01:59:46,500
Kate E Schedel: And so we kind of broke it down into ones like in this red so big pharma and how you create it and their profits are lobbying, they were anomaly over some of these things.

767
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:54,180
Kate E Schedel: And then went to the orange categories like government who oversees patent issuing drug approval laws and policies.

768
01:59:54,180 --> 02:00:00,420
Kate E Schedel: And how they're working directly with insurance coverage, so you have you have big players like medicaid and medicare.

769
02:00:00,420 --> 02:00:11,310
Kate E Schedel: And veterans affairs private insurance and uninsured and then you're also adding in this more complex problem, like brandon said a biological manufacturer where.

770
02:00:11,310 --> 02:00:21,090
Kate E Schedel: they're really impacted by quality and so depending on quality it's harder to make more quantity, because it is a biological process instead of a chemical process.

771
02:00:21,090 --> 02:00:31,140
Kate E Schedel: If you look at those colors that are in yellow they're more like once it's made and once we know the quality and they're going to a pharmacy it's ordered by healthcare providers.

772
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:36,540
Kate E Schedel: it's getting to patients and we're adding an advocacy groups that are thinking about.

773
02:00:36,540 --> 02:00:43,500
Kate E Schedel: How do we get more, how do we get it for less cost, how do we get it to people who are uninsured underinsured aren't getting enough.

774
02:00:43,500 --> 02:01:01,380
Kate E Schedel: And then health care providers also thinking about education, making sure their care management is there for patients, making sure there's prevention for some of those pre diabetic so again an extraordinarily complex issue, which is why next slide brennan thinking about.

775
02:01:01,380 --> 02:01:10,380
Kate E Schedel: Some of those leverage points it's hard because they're very different, and so we ended up putting to leverage points if you're in the big pharma bucket.

776
02:01:10,380 --> 02:01:24,870
Kate E Schedel: Maybe less likely to change behavior as far as manufacturing and making it more cost affordable, which has many unintended consequences to the population of people not getting really life saving medication.

777
02:01:24,870 --> 02:01:42,570
Kate E Schedel: If you're the population and you're wanting it for a lower cost and getting this policy that we'll talk about next there's a high leverage point there's going to be a change in behavior and there's less unintended consequences when people are getting the care that they need next slide.

778
02:01:42,570 --> 02:01:52,710
Kate E Schedel: So will be looked at as our policy sort of kit was interesting was a free emergency supply of insulin with allowed pharmacist to prescribe and dispense.

779
02:01:52,710 --> 02:02:02,760
Kate E Schedel: A 30 day supply to anyone who has underinsured or uninsured I mean needed to have a existing prescription, or at least a diagnosis that you were in fact diabetic.

780
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:11,520
Kate E Schedel: And there was a little bit of variability by state so, for example, Minnesota they could get that free emergency supply once a year.

781
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:18,870
Kate E Schedel: But they might have to pay like a small cost just to cover the cost to the pharmacy I think they put it around $35.

782
02:02:18,870 --> 02:02:33,450
Kate E Schedel: In Oregon they had to make sure they were getting some education on diabetes management in order to access the free supply, we also know that some of these policies like an Oregon and New York state started in.

783
02:02:33,450 --> 02:02:50,790
Kate E Schedel: Minnesota was one to add it during the coven pandemic, which I thought was interesting that states have started this emergency supply before coven because we we assumed that it was as a result of coven and a pandemic next slide.

784
02:02:50,790 --> 02:03:02,280
Kate E Schedel: So yes, again, this is implemented, just in three states, the last one being Minnesota, but we know, this is just a short term solution, please, even if you have a 30 day free supplies.

785
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:22,650
Kate E Schedel: That may or may not enable you to continue getting that or work things out with your insurance or the cost and getting it or having access through your local pharmacy or hospital system next slide i'm passing it over oh one more thing and then this is our logic model.

786
02:03:22,650 --> 02:03:29,430
Kate E Schedel: If we're thinking that the situation is diabetics requiring insulin.

787
02:03:29,430 --> 02:03:38,550
Kate E Schedel: That are uninsured or have had co pays and we're trying to get them more access we're investing all of the factors that we talked about all of those stakeholders.

788
02:03:38,550 --> 02:03:45,360
Kate E Schedel: That are involved, plus the constant supply that you'll need, especially as diabetes is increasing in the US.

789
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:52,800
Kate E Schedel: What are the funds to support this, especially if you're giving out free insulin and how long that can be sustained.

790
02:03:52,800 --> 02:04:06,240
Kate E Schedel: we're talking about staff time like pharmacist health care providers who's getting that out even advocacy groups like how are we educating people that this is available and making sure people know.

791
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:12,840
Kate E Schedel: And so that's why we're tapping into experts through physicians or advocacy groups and then lastly patients.

792
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:22,020
Kate E Schedel: We need them to want that, and so some of our assumptions that we thought about where one do they have access to a pharmacy or they're going to have access to this free insulin.

793
02:04:22,020 --> 02:04:34,410
Kate E Schedel: Even though it's free to get I guess rings true for the earlier group singing about vaccines are free and not everyone wants or has access to it, and so this might be true for us as well.

794
02:04:34,410 --> 02:04:42,660
Kate E Schedel: Is there trust by the patient is their desire for that free medicine, what is it's free and it's from the government is that something that they don't want.

795
02:04:42,660 --> 02:04:51,030
Kate E Schedel: And so, when we think about activities that we can do to help people it's really that education, making sure providers know about it.

796
02:04:51,030 --> 02:05:03,900
Kate E Schedel: there's campaigns and advertisements getting it out there, making sure pharmacy and providers are set up to give that or providers and physicians and pharmacists can give that diabetes management education.

797
02:05:03,900 --> 02:05:16,530
Kate E Schedel: And then have an awareness campaign public facing campaign, and so we were hoping to reach uninsured and underinsured patients and then the physicians pharmacists and advocacy groups.

798
02:05:16,530 --> 02:05:26,940
Kate E Schedel: As far as outcomes, I mean our long term impact would be that we've better diabetic diabetes control less complications we're lowering healthcare costs.

799
02:05:26,940 --> 02:05:34,380
Kate E Schedel: And we're overall lowering the cost of insulin to make it free for all are just more affordable or covered on an insurance plan.

800
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:44,400
Kate E Schedel: But then you back that up into short term at least you're getting more education on on insulin there's more diabetes are diabetics with access.

801
02:05:44,400 --> 02:06:01,230
Kate E Schedel: And we're giving out more free free insulin and in the medium term we're hoping that this policy is a band aid to a larger policy that sort of make sure the coverage is there, of course, there are a ton of external factors that we were thinking about.

802
02:06:01,230 --> 02:06:16,020
Kate E Schedel: Specifically, if this is a thought, a small family owned pharmacy can they afford this are we interrupting their profit margins sort of like the grocery store had that we talked about earlier this week, can they do this.

803
02:06:16,020 --> 02:06:24,450
Kate E Schedel: And then is this also inviting lawsuits from big pharma to say that we can't give this for free.

804
02:06:24,450 --> 02:06:30,570
Kate E Schedel: And is there a supply issue as the number of cases grows every year.

805
02:06:30,570 --> 02:06:34,140
Kate E Schedel: Next slide all right i'll pass on.

806
02:06:34,140 --> 02:06:47,010
Anam: Great Thank you K, so we analyze this public health issue from several angles so thinking about the potential social impact, so, first of all, if you're providing people with a drug that they need.

807
02:06:47,010 --> 02:06:57,660
Anam: you're also lessening severe disease outcomes and there's obviously some cascade of events that happen when an individual's diabetes is not under control.

808
02:06:57,660 --> 02:07:06,000
Anam: And, as a result of better control diabetes you're also thinking about improved quality of life, and that means improve social engagement and participation.

809
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:14,070
Anam: in society and you're also improving awareness of disease and complications so as we mentioned some of.

810
02:07:14,070 --> 02:07:20,970
Anam: The states that have implemented have said that pharmacists need to have a conversation with patients about other ways that they can also.

811
02:07:20,970 --> 02:07:27,450
Anam: supplement the insulin and manage their diabetes so they're getting that education and awareness, alongside the insulin that they need.

812
02:07:27,450 --> 02:07:35,160
Anam: But it may also give them greater insight into sort of how important it is and how regular they need to be in the use of the insulin.

813
02:07:35,160 --> 02:07:42,270
Anam: And then, with diabetes, we know that if it's not well managed it can lead to a lot of complications, such as.

814
02:07:42,270 --> 02:07:57,900
Anam: Potentially ulcers and, in extreme cases things like amputations, so people who have diabetes well managed, because they have regular incidence apply it also means greater physical mobility and engagement in your Community next slide please.

815
02:07:57,900 --> 02:08:06,480
Anam: We can also think about some of the potential economic impacts off we're thinking about it from just the starting off with the patient perspective.

816
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:17,040
Anam: If they're in better health, they can contribute economically to their local communities through work you're also talking about less sick days and less absent days from work.

817
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:30,630
Anam: And then they can also if they have more money in their pocket because they're not spending exorbitant amounts on trying to purchase their insulin they can also focus on other aspects of diabetes, prevention and management so thinking about.

818
02:08:30,630 --> 02:08:41,040
Anam: Food healthy food exercise, so they have more money to be able to spend in other parts of it as part of a more comprehensive diabetes management Program.

819
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:43,020
Anam: Next slide.

820
02:08:43,020 --> 02:08:50,220
Anam: But as we were brainstorming some of the really potential positive benefits of doing this type of Program.

821
02:08:50,220 --> 02:08:57,390
Anam: We were also thinking about some potential unintended consequences, and some of these are things that brandon and.

822
02:08:57,390 --> 02:09:08,460
Anam: Kate also alluded to in their slides so Kate mentioned this local community pharmacies are often small they're not large chain pharmacies and.

823
02:09:08,460 --> 02:09:17,520
Anam: Some of them, this could be costly both from like a time resource perspective, but also a cost money to dispense these and so for smaller pharmacies.

824
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:26,880
Anam: It may not be financially feasible for them, and that could mean that if, in certain communities where they're the only source and their go out of business, it can also decrease.

825
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:38,820
Anam: access and supply for other medications for other people within the Community, so just thinking about the fact that in larger cities with chain pharmacies, they may be better able to support that type of program than smaller ones.

826
02:09:38,820 --> 02:09:51,330
Anam: As we mentioned some states have said, have added a feed that the individual would pay to help cover the cost of the pharmacies, but again, that introduces additional barriers to both the patient.

827
02:09:51,330 --> 02:09:59,730
Anam: And it may not be something they're able to do so just thinking about the context in the Community, and what type of pharmacy is there.

828
02:09:59,730 --> 02:10:08,550
Anam: As Kate mentioned, it is only a one time emergency prescription so some states have mentioned that you can only get it once a year.

829
02:10:08,550 --> 02:10:14,940
Anam: So it's not really addressing kind of the broader structural barriers to the cost and supply of insulin.

830
02:10:14,940 --> 02:10:26,610
Anam: So if they get that one time supply, what about the rest of the year, does that mean that they're they're not able to manage their diabetes for the remainder of the time so it's as we mentioned a band aid solution.

831
02:10:26,610 --> 02:10:33,300
Anam: And so it could have long term adverse outcomes if people are not able to get that access again.

832
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:44,100
Anam: There was, as we were researching this one of the things they brought up was that it could potentially result in an increased cost for insured individuals and that's because these.

833
02:10:44,100 --> 02:10:58,260
Anam: Pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers may actually increase the cost further in order to recuperate any last margins that they had with this policy, so it could just end up shifting the cost elsewhere.

834
02:10:58,260 --> 02:11:16,410
Anam: and create a greater burden which then you get into this cyclical problem of more individuals, not being able to afford it, and then there could also potentially be supply issues in some pharmacies and communities, which could then further the disparities that exist next slide please.

835
02:11:16,410 --> 02:11:19,410
Anam: And now i'll hand it off.

836
02:11:19,410 --> 02:11:20,700
Ahya Sajawal Ali: So when we.

837
02:11:20,700 --> 02:11:22,380
Ahya Sajawal Ali: come to the values.

838
02:11:22,380 --> 02:11:25,260
Ahya Sajawal Ali: mission and vision P so far work.

839
02:11:25,260 --> 02:11:40,290
Ahya Sajawal Ali: The biggest thing to look at in this policy is that the reason that this policies even needed is because the people who are affected are wonderful, why are the vulnerable is because, eventually, no matter how high the price is.

840
02:11:40,290 --> 02:11:48,150
Ahya Sajawal Ali: They will have to buy it it's not like this is something that is a part of their life, where they can think about it.

841
02:11:48,150 --> 02:11:55,110
Ahya Sajawal Ali: Or do it once a year, they need it, if it's $12,000 of their income they're just going to have to use it.

842
02:11:55,110 --> 02:12:08,880
Ahya Sajawal Ali: So our broader vision is that we want this access to insulin for the under or the uninsured individuals to be equitable and it should not be dependent on you know which.

843
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:21,990
Ahya Sajawal Ali: What what their work status says, or anything in terms of personnel sort of day to day life things, everyone should be able to.

844
02:12:21,990 --> 02:12:35,730
Ahya Sajawal Ali: afford insulin so the mission definitely is to advocate and implement policies and programs to remove these barriers and like we mentioned before, that the stakeholders that we've identified.

845
02:12:35,730 --> 02:12:42,930
Ahya Sajawal Ali: A few of them have a huge role to play in all of this and the policy making really needs to start at the top.

846
02:12:42,930 --> 02:13:03,120
Ahya Sajawal Ali: right there with the government agencies and the pharma companies and the manufacturers themselves because they really control honest, this the patent that issue that branding brought up that's where policies need to be really developed the overall values of our.

847
02:13:03,120 --> 02:13:13,020
Ahya Sajawal Ali: of our mission our that we want to just have more access affordable access equitable distribution transparency transparency.

848
02:13:13,020 --> 02:13:31,980
Ahya Sajawal Ali: And the overall big picture is compassion, because these people who are already suffering from a very chronic debilitating potentially debilitating disease, they need to not feel like they need to sell off stuff just to buy their shots for subscriber next name.

849
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:40,590
Ahya Sajawal Ali: So the future direction is something that we alluded to a couple of times the, this is not, this is not a policy which is offering a solution.

850
02:13:40,590 --> 02:13:46,920
Ahya Sajawal Ali: What we are wanting to do is that right now it's like we're just putting a bandaid on top, but.

851
02:13:46,920 --> 02:14:00,540
Ahya Sajawal Ali: Once that one month is there, what we really want to develop during that time is that we are able to come up with better insurance plans for these vulnerable people who are uninsured or underinsured or have high.

852
02:14:00,540 --> 02:14:11,790
Ahya Sajawal Ali: copious so that they are directed towards some sort of insurance specifically for the diabetics which can give them easier equitable access.

853
02:14:11,790 --> 02:14:27,240
Ahya Sajawal Ali: The other thing that that this the patient, education, the physician education, pharmacists, they all have the education like we were talking about the vaccines that the fear of complications.

854
02:14:27,240 --> 02:14:36,390
Ahya Sajawal Ali: With the vaccines are there, they may be unfounded According to scientists, but the people might have different opinions.

855
02:14:36,390 --> 02:14:48,690
Ahya Sajawal Ali: Similarly, like the complications for diabetes, not every diabetic has of a sound idea about how important their dosages are how important.

856
02:14:48,690 --> 02:14:56,970
Ahya Sajawal Ali: Are the factors in their lifestyle changes can impact their diabetes is so we're also hoping that when these individuals and.

857
02:14:56,970 --> 02:15:07,770
Ahya Sajawal Ali: Obviously, when we're involving the healthcare sector at large that better patient education strategies will cause a sort of like a.

858
02:15:07,770 --> 02:15:26,280
Ahya Sajawal Ali: cause and effect where once they start talking to diabetics more about it, there will be other lifestyle changes that the patients will be will try to incorporate eventually what we also want to be able to do is that we.

859
02:15:26,280 --> 02:15:37,170
Ahya Sajawal Ali: inculcate this preventative aspect, as far as instilling new systems on we take it to the preventative side of medicine, rather than the curative form and.

860
02:15:37,170 --> 02:15:43,590
Ahya Sajawal Ali: Eventually, like there should be no copious at all for something that is preventing such a disease.

861
02:15:43,590 --> 02:15:55,380
Ahya Sajawal Ali: And what we also hope to do is in the future that once this state of one month is there, there are a lot of costs that are gone not.

862
02:15:55,380 --> 02:16:07,590
Ahya Sajawal Ali: they're gone a bit I noticed these diabetics when they come to the hospital with complications the there the er visits, there are procedures operations.

863
02:16:07,590 --> 02:16:15,210
Ahya Sajawal Ali: They are in icu for so much longer, they have complications with other diseases that they might have.

864
02:16:15,210 --> 02:16:26,490
Ahya Sajawal Ali: So it's it's it's very costly for a diabetic to stay sick and, if not able to really make sure that those people who didn't have access to Internet have access to Internet.

865
02:16:26,490 --> 02:16:33,420
Ahya Sajawal Ali: Maybe we can really develop a health model and show the economic aspect of the cost that we are saving.

866
02:16:33,420 --> 02:16:47,430
Ahya Sajawal Ali: By giving people even free insulin because insulin is just like one part of the problem, the bigger picture is other health care costs that are associated with the lack of proper care for the diabetics.

867
02:16:47,430 --> 02:17:02,970
Ahya Sajawal Ali: um so just just a general policy making rule that this publicizing and education can definitely bring about a big change for this wonderful population, and I think it, it might seem like.

868
02:17:02,970 --> 02:17:19,260
Ahya Sajawal Ali: It might seem like the band aid is is very far far stretched and it's it's a really silly idea, but just that one month for a diabetic missing their daily doses will definitely change change the trajectory and make it.

869
02:17:19,260 --> 02:17:27,930
Ahya Sajawal Ali: make it possible for us to convince other people that this needs to be something that definitely needs to be changed.

870
02:17:27,930 --> 02:17:30,300
we're done.

871
02:17:30,300 --> 02:17:45,480
Laura Power: Great job what a very comprehensive, I mean thinking through the background you presented all the way to these future directions i'm really impressed with the comprehensive nature of all your presentation, so this is excellent i'm very, very impressed.

872
02:17:45,480 --> 02:17:53,640
Laura Power: First questions ideas from the group.

873
02:17:53,640 --> 02:18:04,200
Laura Power: I liked what I what really stood out to me just since I watched your greeting on your group, as you were processing all this, especially for all of you, like working through.

874
02:18:04,200 --> 02:18:08,310
Laura Power: Your mapping, so I like I love, how you ended up doing the stakeholders, I think.

875
02:18:08,310 --> 02:18:15,540
Laura Power: This was a tricky one I think is you know we as as I when I stepped into your brainstorming session about the mapping the system.

876
02:18:15,540 --> 02:18:29,310
Laura Power: You know, it was like what what exactly are we trying to get out and you kind of went there was a lot of different ways to go, and I think your strategy of using mapping out thinking about stakeholders was very helpful and was able to kind of.

877
02:18:29,310 --> 02:18:34,950
Laura Power: bring in all those different ideas that you were having so I thought that was really nice and I like how you presented that.

878
02:18:34,950 --> 02:18:39,870
Laura Power: And I also wanted to point out in the group, you probably all noticed in their logic model.

879
02:18:39,870 --> 02:19:01,590
Laura Power: I didn't really talk about it in our in a lecture stuff but the assumptions and the external factors, I think this group, you did a nice job thinking through what some of those factors might be and how that would up like how that could affect the policy, so I think very nicely done.

880
02:19:01,590 --> 02:19:04,500
Anthony Mack: i'm excited to see so.

881
02:19:04,500 --> 02:19:14,520
Anthony Mack: The impact of the bio exchange of bio exchangeable that was approved yesterday, I think.

882
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:23,280
Anthony Mack: On needed the price of insulin because now that there's that bio similar out there that can be exchanged for lantus.

883
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:28,200
Anthony Mack: That could ask some really interesting impacts on the whole insulin market.

884
02:19:28,200 --> 02:19:30,120
Anthony Mack: will be fascinating.

885
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:36,720
Laura Power: yeah we were talking about there's so many different types of insulin and just like you know it's a this is really a complex topic so.

886
02:19:36,720 --> 02:19:52,650
Laura Power: Great well Thank you so much, was it to keep us moving, so this is for 30 were last but not least, to our FAB five, which is, I think the fat for today so we'll let you all take it away.

887
02:19:52,650 --> 02:20:27,180
Erin  Thompson: i'm gonna share my screen.

888
02:20:27,180 --> 02:20:28,650
Erin  Thompson: Namaste my screen.

889
02:20:28,650 --> 02:20:31,080
Laura Power: yep there it is.

890
02:20:31,080 --> 02:20:33,990
Erin  Thompson: So we are the FAB five today we're missing game, so the fact.

891
02:20:33,990 --> 02:20:35,250
Laura Power: That he.

892
02:20:35,250 --> 02:20:45,150
Erin  Thompson: will be presenting with us Laura and Victoria today and we're focusing on equity and breastfeeding.

893
02:20:45,150 --> 02:20:55,170
Erin  Thompson: um so I wanted to start with just an overview of the benefits of breastfeeding, it provides benefits to the invent the mother and many economic benefit.

894
02:20:55,170 --> 02:20:57,780
Erin  Thompson: So, to the baby.

895
02:20:57,780 --> 02:21:09,600
Erin  Thompson: breastfeeding promotes improves cognitive development its strength strengthens the immune system and reduces the incidence of severity and severity of conditions.

896
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:19,920
Erin  Thompson: Is and urinary tract infections and also reduces the risk of chronic conditions and cancers, such as lymphoma and then diabetes and asthma.

897
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:32,430
Erin  Thompson: It can also reduce the risk of the child, becoming overweight or obese and for the mother it decreases postpartum bleeding decreases menstrual blood loss.

898
02:21:32,430 --> 02:21:35,670
Erin  Thompson: leads to increased child spacing.

899
02:21:35,670 --> 02:21:47,220
Erin  Thompson: It can lead to an earlier return to a pre pregnancy weight and decreases the risk of breast and ovarian cancers and, as far as economic benefits goes it can.

900
02:21:47,220 --> 02:22:00,780
Erin  Thompson: produce higher employee productivity and lower absenteeism and increase employment retention by working mothers who breastfeed and family cost savings by avoiding purchase an infant formula.

901
02:22:00,780 --> 02:22:06,600
Erin  Thompson: can also results in decreased health care costs.

902
02:22:06,600 --> 02:22:11,010
Erin  Thompson: Low rates of breastfeeding lead to.

903
02:22:11,010 --> 02:22:13,380
Erin  Thompson: More than 3 billion.

904
02:22:13,380 --> 02:22:23,730
Erin  Thompson: Additional health care costs for the mother and the baby in the United States that's a little it's that's from healthy people 2010 but the data is still does hold true that it's about.

905
02:22:23,730 --> 02:22:30,690
Erin  Thompson: It can be over $3 billion in cost savings.

906
02:22:30,690 --> 02:22:36,630
Erin  Thompson: As some breastfeeding recommendations from the American Academy of pediatrics in the World Health Organization.

907
02:22:36,630 --> 02:22:41,850
Erin  Thompson: The American and kind of Academy of pediatrics recommends that infants be exclusively breastfed.

908
02:22:41,850 --> 02:22:59,880
Erin  Thompson: For the first six months with continued breastfeeding, while introducing the appropriate complimentary foods for a year or longer and who recommends exclusive breastfeeding after six months with continued breastfeeding.

909
02:22:59,880 --> 02:23:09,060
Erin  Thompson: So although many women do strive for six months of exclusive breastfeeding or a year breastfeeding, there are many reasons why they do not meet their goals.

910
02:23:09,060 --> 02:23:21,300
Erin  Thompson: 60% of mothers don't meet their breastfeeding goals, and this is intended, or because of barriers, including issues with lactation and latching concerns about infant nutrition and weight.

911
02:23:21,300 --> 02:23:31,080
Erin  Thompson: mother's concerns about taking medications while breastfeeding, and supportive workplace policies and lack of parental leave and our specific policy.

912
02:23:31,080 --> 02:23:35,460
Erin  Thompson: aims to create more supportive word policies.

913
02:23:35,460 --> 02:23:43,860
Erin  Thompson: Cultural norms and lack of support and unsupported hospital practices and policies.

914
02:23:43,860 --> 02:23:55,650
Erin  Thompson: are also many disparities and breastfeeding, and the 2018 2019 national immunization survey found that fewer not as many black infants are ever breastfed compared to.

915
02:23:55,650 --> 02:23:59,520
Erin  Thompson: convince a non Hispanic white infants.

916
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:06,360
Erin  Thompson: survey also found that infants eligible for in receiving special supplemental nutrition Program.

917
02:24:06,360 --> 02:24:11,070
Erin  Thompson: For women infants and children are less likely to be ever breastfed.

918
02:24:11,070 --> 02:24:14,250
Erin  Thompson: Compared to elements are breastfed.

919
02:24:14,250 --> 02:24:17,640
Erin  Thompson: In bins that are eligible but not receiving week.

920
02:24:17,640 --> 02:24:20,640
Erin  Thompson: And for if it's eligible for week.

921
02:24:20,640 --> 02:24:32,040
Erin  Thompson: And younger mother's age 20 and 29 and less likely to be ever breastfed compared to mother's age 30 or older.

922
02:24:32,040 --> 02:24:38,490
Erin  Thompson: I will pass it to Sarah, I believe, to go over our calls Luke guide.

923
02:24:38,490 --> 02:24:44,790
Sarah E Briley: yeah thanks Aaron, as you can see, at the Center of our diagram we have equity and speeding.

924
02:24:44,790 --> 02:24:53,040
Sarah E Briley: I really tried to divide the color surrounding those as far as the different aspects and levels of the socio ecological model.

925
02:24:53,040 --> 02:25:01,440
Sarah E Briley: So really starting at that top left corner, with the purple circles, we focused on the organizational level, so we have lactation consultants.

926
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:09,180
Sarah E Briley: systemic racism baby friendly hospital designation and provider bias, so an example with those.

927
02:25:09,180 --> 02:25:22,950
Sarah E Briley: we're assuming that the more provider bias, the less equity, we would have in breastfeeding, but we also discussed how high provider bias, they also negatively impact the buy in of physicians within a specific hospital.

928
02:25:22,950 --> 02:25:32,820
Sarah E Briley: That may lead them to not being interested in getting that baby friendly designation much return blood approved speeding rates across the board.

929
02:25:32,820 --> 02:25:48,510
Sarah E Briley: Moving to the top right corner, with the Green circles, we thought of individual factors that impact equity and breastfeeding, so these include misconceptions regarding the benefits of breastfeeding a partner, support and knowledge, as well as stigma.

930
02:25:48,510 --> 02:26:02,580
Sarah E Briley: bring to the orange circles, we have interpersonal factors like cultural acceptance in society so, for example, the more acceptance in society as a whole, we figured the less stigma would be resulting from that.

931
02:26:02,580 --> 02:26:10,140
Sarah E Briley: Moving to the bottom Center with the red circles, we have funding health benefits and other other fleeing workplace policies.

932
02:26:10,140 --> 02:26:21,480
Sarah E Briley: And last and, not least, we have a section of yellow circles, representing Community those include a culturally representative workforce of breastfeeding advocates.

933
02:26:21,480 --> 02:26:45,930
Sarah E Briley: Diversifying images promoting breastfeeding access to healthcare breastfeeding education and peer support groups and the last example provide he figured the peer support programs, the less societal sticking followed by again more equity and breastfeeding next slide.

934
02:26:45,930 --> 02:26:52,770
Sarah E Briley: Thank you, so we decided to focus our time this week on the break time for nursing moms policy.

935
02:26:52,770 --> 02:26:58,380
Sarah E Briley: It became law in March of 2019 or 2010 i'm sorry as part of the affordable care act.

936
02:26:58,380 --> 02:27:07,500
Sarah E Briley: This law asked that employers provide reasonable break times for employees to express breast milk and a designated private space, other than a bathroom.

937
02:27:07,500 --> 02:27:15,960
Sarah E Briley: At the break time for nursing moms policy does not require employers to pay staff during these break times, however, some employers encourage their women.

938
02:27:15,960 --> 02:27:26,910
Sarah E Briley: to utilize their already provided paid 15 minute break i'm a caveat law, though, is if a business has less than 50 staff, they are not required to implement this policy.

939
02:27:26,910 --> 02:27:32,580
Sarah E Briley: Especially that will cause economic economic hardship in order to provide a space.

940
02:27:32,580 --> 02:27:46,800
Sarah E Briley: After reviewing the law, I found it really interesting that the law only covers women who are breastfeeding a child, up to one year in age so after the child's first birthday, this law, no longer protects that mother to pump while she's at work.

941
02:27:46,800 --> 02:27:50,100
Sarah E Briley: Next slide.

942
02:27:50,100 --> 02:28:02,250
Victoria Walker: So when we started working on our logic model we really focus on two priorities that enables marketers to meet their breastfeeding goals and then the ability to breastfeed and their respective workplace, so we thought was really important that we engage.

943
02:28:02,250 --> 02:28:11,550
Victoria Walker: A variety of different stakeholders that does WIC Community based coalition's that have a stake and mothers and infants and children and family peer support groups.

944
02:28:11,550 --> 02:28:18,930
Victoria Walker: providers thoughts coordinate include policymakers, because they have the ability to continue to enforce those laws out of state.

945
02:28:18,930 --> 02:28:28,440
Victoria Walker: At the State level and at the local level at the county municipal funding could be very important, especially if we're going to offer like mini grants or resources to.

946
02:28:28,440 --> 02:28:36,990
Victoria Walker: Businesses to help make those accommodations as well as materials into signage and educational materials for the employers and employees.

947
02:28:36,990 --> 02:28:42,990
Victoria Walker: For activities we really thought about how we can collaborate with stakeholders i'll do a work group or a coalition.

948
02:28:42,990 --> 02:28:49,320
Victoria Walker: Also, focusing time on educating breastfeeding mothers and pregnant women on the breastfeeding laws, what are their rights.

949
02:28:49,320 --> 02:28:56,370
Victoria Walker: We also important to do focus groups with HR directors and employer to get what they're to get their buy in what are they think.

950
02:28:56,370 --> 02:29:03,300
Victoria Walker: Are the benefits when I think of the challenges, so that the work group could address those issues as they go along, doing the work.

951
02:29:03,300 --> 02:29:11,160
Victoria Walker: And then educate employees, as well as the employees, because we know that women are just one component of those work of the workforce, so we don't want to.

952
02:29:11,160 --> 02:29:19,050
Victoria Walker: increase any animosity or any tension, or have low morale we want to make sure that employees also understand the benefits of breastfeeding.

953
02:29:19,050 --> 02:29:31,260
Victoria Walker: So who reached employers breastfeeding mothers and pregnant women, and please also thinking about the small business associations chamber of commerce's other avenues that allow us to tap into employers.

954
02:29:31,260 --> 02:29:41,700
Victoria Walker: So far, outcomes and impact for short term we have awareness of rice and mom breastfeeding mothers pregnant women and employers employer awareness of breastfeeding walls.

955
02:29:41,700 --> 02:29:52,470
Victoria Walker: For our mid term we have employers implement mother friendly policies for breastfeeding women that more women breastfeed at work and that workplace supports for breast for women breastfeeding.

956
02:29:52,470 --> 02:30:00,330
Victoria Walker: And for our long term will see that mothers can meet their long term breastfeeding goals, the reduction in racial disparities.

957
02:30:00,330 --> 02:30:11,220
Victoria Walker: With breastfeeding more infants are breastfed exclusively through six months, an increase in breastfeeding equity that we embed breastfeeding laws are more widely implemented.

958
02:30:11,220 --> 02:30:21,690
Victoria Walker: That we see a decrease in infant mortality and, lastly, that most more postpartum women are remain employed so for some of our assumptions.

959
02:30:21,690 --> 02:30:25,140
Victoria Walker: We assume that someone would like to breastfeed at work.

960
02:30:25,140 --> 02:30:31,170
Victoria Walker: and want to continue to be a part of the workforce other assumptions close employers are willing to make these accommodations.

961
02:30:31,170 --> 02:30:41,430
Victoria Walker: For external factors and factors we focus on societal and cultural norms, as well as the availability of breastfeeding pumps, I know, with insurance, they have you can get pumps.

962
02:30:41,430 --> 02:30:50,520
Victoria Walker: Or we may have a supplier pumps, but they may not have them available at the time that women need them next slide.

963
02:30:50,520 --> 02:31:00,840
Victoria Walker: So when looking at applying equity lens We thought that breastfeeding mothers pregnant women, women considering becoming pregnant innocent and families for most positively affected.

964
02:31:00,840 --> 02:31:14,970
Victoria Walker: Those negatively affected would be potential employers, employees and really is the financial burden and the mindset change for employees to have about you know bright schedules, or how they accommodate for like meeting anything of that nature.

965
02:31:14,970 --> 02:31:23,340
Victoria Walker: When it comes to the policy effect on conditions in the Community for social, we think that the workplace culture will become more supportive of breastfeeding.

966
02:31:23,340 --> 02:31:29,130
Victoria Walker: That other employee accommodations for health related issues might actually increase over time.

967
02:31:29,130 --> 02:31:40,410
Victoria Walker: And that employee health in general, would increase do that, that it reduce the stigma around breastfeeding, and that would directly affect those external factors of societal and cultural norms.

968
02:31:40,410 --> 02:31:47,940
Victoria Walker: For economic the potential burdens employer to meet those calls requirements, whether it be them having to find the space to.

969
02:31:47,940 --> 02:32:02,820
Victoria Walker: You know, get a refrigerator all of those things could be considered part of that financial burden on improve family, it could improve family incomes, because now we have both parents that may still be working or there's not a reduction in hours by one partner.

970
02:32:02,820 --> 02:32:11,790
Victoria Walker: There be greater work satisfactions would you would wait until the greater productivity and that we have fewer miss work days, due to a sick infant.

971
02:32:11,790 --> 02:32:21,270
Victoria Walker: Either even for the woman with any complications that may occur for her not breastfeeding, I mean not pumping at work and then long term health benefits to the woman.

972
02:32:21,270 --> 02:32:24,330
Next slide.

973
02:32:24,330 --> 02:32:33,000
Victoria Walker: So some of the unintended consequences could be employees can resent the time and space designated for women to breastfeed and this could directly impact morale.

974
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:41,010
Victoria Walker: Employers might be less likely to hire pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding, and this is discrimination, and there are laws that are protecting women but.

975
02:32:41,010 --> 02:32:54,180
Victoria Walker: We know, sometimes it's hard to push back against some of those claims and that employers might limit the number employees to less than 50 people to avoid implementing the policy.

976
02:32:54,180 --> 02:33:05,400
Laura Grage: Okay, so this is Laura to bring the show home the values mission and vision or values, we had a pretty focused.

977
02:33:05,400 --> 02:33:26,580
Laura Grage: policy, so this slide is is pretty focused as well, our values were on equity inclusion on access partnership on families and respect and our mission was creating a workplace environment that provides support for women to meet their breastfeeding goals and our.

978
02:33:26,580 --> 02:33:36,360
Laura Grage: vision is that all mothers have equitable opportunities to meet their breastfeeding goals, excuse me next slide.

979
02:33:36,360 --> 02:33:45,480
Laura Grage: And the future directions that we came up with there was, we had a lot of conversations about the unintended consequences that we came up and that kind of drove.

980
02:33:45,480 --> 02:33:59,250
Laura Grage: Our idea our ideas here and we struggled to find a lot of you know just descriptive data about equity and disparities and breastfeeding, and so you know when you can't find that data really.

981
02:33:59,250 --> 02:34:09,000
Laura Grage: quickly there's usually some kind of a dearth in research in that area and understanding what's going on, so more research regarding those disparities.

982
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:22,650
Laura Grage: And we also thought promoting like a mother friendly workplace designation or a program would be an incentive for employers to develop something like that, and then.

983
02:34:22,650 --> 02:34:40,170
Laura Grage: for employers to create anonymous support lines for breastfeeding mothers to utilize when they need a little help seeking the accommodations that the law should provide and then Lastly, the requirements.

984
02:34:40,170 --> 02:34:51,540
Laura Grage: based around the number of breastfeeding rooms available or the space available for moms and bigger workplaces so understanding, you know if you work in a really large workplace.

985
02:34:51,540 --> 02:35:06,510
Laura Grage: And, and your employer has provided a closet for this activity that's not going to be that helpful so understanding what different employment places look like and the different needs there excellent.

986
02:35:06,510 --> 02:35:17,910
Laura Grage: And that's it for our group, so we have questions and then Aaron will show our references as well, so any questions or comments are welcome, thank you.

987
02:35:17,910 --> 02:35:20,340
Laura Power: Thank you, excellent.

988
02:35:20,340 --> 02:35:24,570
Laura Power: Questions comments from the group.

989
02:35:24,570 --> 02:35:42,960
Laura Power: Good I was not familiar with that policy specifically so that was just interesting to kind of hear more details about it, and I know this is a topic is important to live you in the group and in part of our class too, and I were really liked.

990
02:35:42,960 --> 02:35:57,060
Laura Power: Like you did I like when you talk to your unintended consequences, and I think thinking back to some of the facts, you had the beginning of your your background like showing the benefits for even employers and how to try to understand that unintended.

991
02:35:57,060 --> 02:36:01,950
Laura Power: Potential you know bias or resentment or just you know how do we handle this isn't workplace.

992
02:36:01,950 --> 02:36:10,770
Laura Power: And, being aware of actual the benefits, so I thought you did a really nice job kind of like addressing all those concerns in a circle and then thinking about the future directions that could help.

993
02:36:10,770 --> 02:36:20,160
Laura Power: You know, like a mother friendly workplace or something or breastfeeding, you know that that was a neat idea so very nicely done Thank you.

994
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:27,750
Laura Power: Well, that is bringing us towards the end guys it's getting close to five o'clock and you've all hung in there, so well so far i'm.

995
02:36:27,750 --> 02:36:35,400
Laura Power: really what we have left is just for you to take some time to do a reflection to fill out the evaluations for the course.

996
02:36:35,400 --> 02:36:43,590
Laura Power: Sometimes they do I think what i'm going to do, because it's close to five I I play a video sometimes while people are filling out the reflection.

997
02:36:43,590 --> 02:36:47,910
Laura Power: Is that last if you're looking at the slides that last.

998
02:36:47,910 --> 02:37:01,410
Laura Power: slide there I think what i'll do is just put the link in the chat in case you want to listen to it at some point, I like this video because it it sort of ends on a positive note, and it talks more about.

999
02:37:01,410 --> 02:37:12,540
Laura Power: Bringing it back to the idea of personal leadership so we've kind of gone through you know we started off with public health 3.0 general concepts of leadership we got into the weeds systems thinking and policies and.

1000
02:37:12,540 --> 02:37:18,840
Laura Power: kind of thought through, it all together, but just to to end it as you think about your own leadership journey.

1001
02:37:18,840 --> 02:37:30,210
Laura Power: You know this, that video kind of gets into the more idea of personal leadership and how you can affect your life and getting you know, doing the things that you want to do and setting your own goals so.

1002
02:37:30,210 --> 02:37:40,770

1003
02:37:40,770 --> 02:37:56,280

1009
02:38:45,810 --> 02:38:53,550
