1
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:14,860
Now that you have a better understanding of how states actually fit into the overall health care system,

2
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,690
let's talk a little bit more about how they're actually carrying out their health responsibilities.

3
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,610
As you can see, there are many, many different types of state health agencies.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,790
There are a lot of them. Approximately 58% of state public health agencies are freestanding.

5
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:41,540
This means that they're isolated in their own unit. 43% of them are then a unit of a larger umbrella nested inside of another department, basically.

6
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,790
In the majority of states. The state health official is appointed by the governor.

7
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,510
So think back to our discussion of the Department of Health and Human Services.

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,010
The Secretary is appointed by the President here in a similar fashion.

9
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,270
The director of the State Health Department is appointed by the chief executive of the state.

10
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:06,130
The governor. Approximately 100,000 people work in state health agencies across the country.

11
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:12,100
Smaller states tend to have the fewest number of staff but are responsible for fewer citizens.

12
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,380
This means that larger states might have more state health department employees,

13
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,580
but those employees are actually responsible for a larger number of people.

14
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:31,030
The workforce is generally made up of administrative and clerical staff, public health nurses and environmental health workers.

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,870
Some of you might have actually been involved in some of these jobs or interfaced directly with some of these state health employees in the past.

16
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:47,560
State health agencies provide a number of services, including emergency preparedness, maternal and child health, vital statistics,

17
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:55,570
preventive health and health services, mental health, environmental health, food safety, public health laboratories.

18
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,790
Tobacco Prevention, and the Women, Infants and Children's Program or Wik.

19
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,980
In some states, there are multiple agencies responsible for public health.

20
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,770
And in other states, there's a single agency or department set up to manage health at the state level.

21
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:19,840
So let's take an example. A great example is the structure of the department in Michigan responsible for health care management.

22
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,770
In 1963, the state created the Department of Social Services by 24.

23
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,610
This department was actually renamed the Department of Human Services.

24
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:37,510
At the same time, there was also a department established in 1996 called the Department of Community Health.

25
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,999
This department was formed as a result of a large merger between many of the different

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,290
agencies inside of the state that were housed across the different departments.

27
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:54,340
These included the Department of Public Health, the Department of Mental Health and the Medical Services Administration.

28
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,910
So again, we're consolidating. We're thinking about different parts of the state where health care services

29
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:06,250
are taking place and how the state is actively looking for ways to coordinate,

30
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:14,710
not just coordinating with other levels of government, but coordinating inside of the broad, diverse agencies that exist to manage health.

31
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:22,600
So going back to our example, the authority over health at the state level was extremely fragmented and a solution

32
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,130
to that problem was to centralize authority inside of these two departments.

33
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:34,870
So in 2015, another merger took place between the Department of Human Services and the Department of Community Health.

34
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:40,030
This created what is now known as the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

35
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,130
Now, on paper, this seems like a simple case of consolidation.

36
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,530
The agencies get together. They're centralized. We prevent duplication, and we're done.

37
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,920
But in practice, these types of mergers are really a very large management challenge.

38
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:02,700
It changes the structure inside of state government. And as you might imagine, it's disruptive to operations.

39
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,219
So a very important idea that you need to keep in mind as you think about state governments

40
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,370
role is how does consolidation create opportunities and how is it creating challenges?

41
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:23,220
Is consolidation of responsibility helpful to the other entities or is it creating a challenge where they're unable to coordinate?

42
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,220
So let's go back to our example of H1N1 that we were talking about earlier.

43
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:34,370
You might imagine that having many agencies under different departments all needing to

44
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:39,440
be involved in the management of the pandemic might create confusion and duplication.

45
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:51,050
And you might be right. But at the same time, having one large entity responsible for all the areas can create a lot of bureaucracy and red tape.

46
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,090
So as you think about the role of state government in public health,

47
00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:00,460
carefully consider how the state government is faced with a broad range of responsibilities

48
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,860
and how it must carefully navigate a sometimes fragmented public health landscape.
