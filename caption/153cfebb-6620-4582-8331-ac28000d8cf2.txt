00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:10,760
Hi. In this video, we're going to be talking about where's SAS data sets live on your hard drive?

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:18,740
We'll also be talking about how some of those data sets can be temporary and some of them can be saved.

3
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,210
Whoops. I got ahead of myself. All right. So in this particular video,

4
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:29,960
my learning objectives for you are to really understand where SAS stores its data sets and then show you

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:39,980
how you can map SAS to a place on your hard drive where it can both save and retrieve SAS data sets.

6
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:47,930
So as you recall, when we're working in SAS, you can find your data sets in the Explorer window.

7
00:00:47,930 --> 00:01:10,716
If I go ahead and go back to SAS really quickly for you, I can show you right that SAS data sets can be found in this explorer window over here.

8
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:10,716
So, for example, I still have the data sets from the last video open in here.

9
00:01:14,523 --> 00:01:19,023
And it's very important, the distinction. So the first one is called work.

10
00:01:19,023 --> 00:01:26,253
And that's one that you saw last video. I was saving things to the default of the work library.

11
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:32,973
What's very important to know about the work library is that is a temporary data set.

12
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:42,333
In other words, all of your data sets will be stored within that library or that directory while you have sites open.

13
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:49,323
As soon as use shut down says anything that was in the work directory will now be gone.

14
00:01:49,323 --> 00:01:53,853
It's not being saved on your computer anywhere that you can access it again.

15
00:01:53,853 --> 00:02:03,633
So I put up this this imagery of the, you know, footsteps in the sand, just like the footsteps in the sand does appear when the wave comes by.

16
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:09,213
When you close out SAS again, your temporary data sets will be erased.

17
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:12,903
Now, that obviously is not something that you always want to many a time.

18
00:02:12,903 --> 00:02:21,363
We are working with projects, you know, that can take us years to develop the final models and we keep going back and doing new papers.

19
00:02:21,363 --> 00:02:29,313
And so obviously, we want an option to be able to store our source data sets on our computer to do that.

20
00:02:29,313 --> 00:02:41,973
We call something a permanent library, and that's basically just saying that there's a place on your your hard drive that is storing those files.

21
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:53,763
So, for example, I can give SAS a little nickname of Ctools here that I want to map to somewhere physical on my on my computer.

22
00:02:53,763 --> 00:03:04,893
You know, under this you epit faculty adaa c tools directory where my files will both be saved and I'm able to retrieve them.

23
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:16,803
So the way in which we map our data to sorry, our library to our computer is to use something that's called a live name statement.

24
00:03:16,803 --> 00:03:21,723
Effectively what the live name statement does is it just says, Hey, SAS,

25
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:28,083
I would like you to create for me a little directory that I'd like you to call C tools.

26
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,093
Right. A little library called C Tools.

27
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:38,553
That's a nickname of my choosing that I would like for you to point to this this physical space on my computer.

28
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:46,473
So I often tell students it's not that dissimilar from, you know, just saying my office, for example.

29
00:03:46,473 --> 00:03:51,532
So on the first day of class, you know, a student might come up to me and say, hey.

30
00:03:53,942 --> 00:04:04,412
I'm confused. And I would say, OK, great, come to my office at 10 a.m. I would then say my office is located on the fifth floor of a speech to.

31
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:07,922
Right. And I'm in room five five three nine.

32
00:04:07,922 --> 00:04:15,572
You know, it's it's it's giving a physical place to what I mean by my office the next time when I'm talking.

33
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:22,322
That's student, right. Because I've already defined my office and where that physical is, I might just say, hey, come to my office.

34
00:04:22,322 --> 00:04:25,802
Right. So that's the same thing that's happening here in SAS.

35
00:04:25,802 --> 00:04:34,832
I'm creating just a nickname called C Tools that SAS is then directing to a physical place on my computer.

36
00:04:34,832 --> 00:04:38,732
You know, again, here's a different example. I'm saying life name.

37
00:04:38,732 --> 00:04:47,972
He says create me a a library in my SAS program that I want you to use the nickname lecture to.

38
00:04:47,972 --> 00:04:57,212
And I want you to map that lecture to to the physical place on my hard drive called, you know, see users ADR documents teaching lecture too.

39
00:04:57,212 --> 00:05:07,052
And that would be that actual place on my hard drive. Once I do that right, I can actually save files in that directory.

40
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:16,992
I can retrieve files there. And one of the things that I can do is use that location as a directory in my import wizard now.

41
00:05:16,992 --> 00:05:24,002
Right. So I don't have to just go to the work directory. I can actually use C tools as well.

42
00:05:24,002 --> 00:05:32,732
And actually, I'm just gonna take one quick pause and show you this in real time, since we are all online and I can do that a bit more easily now.

43
00:05:32,732 --> 00:06:29,838
So here I'm going to show you that I can run this live name code.

44
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:47,552
Right? I just do that and then I press the submit button. If I go to my log, you can see here that I ran the code LIBE name.

45
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:51,012
That's the code I ran in black. It then tells me that.

46
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:59,262
Was successfully assigned to this location on my computer, when I do that, this directory will pop up.

47
00:05:59,262 --> 00:06:08,932
I can double click on it and any SAS data sets that were contained inside of that directory on my computer, which is here.

48
00:06:08,932 --> 00:06:16,152
Right. So this is actually that directory on the computer are going to appear here in my SAS library.

49
00:06:16,152 --> 00:06:21,882
You will notice that the that the code that was here does not appear.

50
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:29,838
It's only those data sets which are shown as SAS seven B that that are going to show up in that directory.

51
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:41,373
So now that you know that we can put things as temporary or we can make them permanent.

52
00:06:41,373 --> 00:06:45,183
The question is, is how does SAS know which library to put things in?

53
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:52,233
Well, the truth is, is the way that SAS calls its data sets is using what I like to call a last name and a first name.

54
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:56,373
The last name is effectively the library name. So that could be work.

55
00:06:56,373 --> 00:07:00,573
It could be C tools. It could be Epit 640, whatever.

56
00:07:00,573 --> 00:07:10,773
That directory that I put on my SAS program using the Leive name statement becomes an option, as does work.

57
00:07:10,773 --> 00:07:18,873
Now, the first name is the data set name. So basically I will tell it the directory with a period and then its data set name.

58
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:28,803
I like to joke that work as a very casual place. So if you want to talk about temporary data sets, you can call them work dot file name.

59
00:07:28,803 --> 00:07:33,303
Or you can actually just call them the file name itself. And SAS will know that.

60
00:07:33,303 --> 00:07:36,012
That must mean the work dot the file name. One quick trick of the trade is that I always like to assign my library name at the

61
00:07:42,236 --> 00:07:48,986
top of my SAS code so that it's available as soon as you open your source code.

62
00:07:48,986 --> 00:07:55,016
As soon as you start SAS and it's easily found and changed. So let's say I'm moving from one computer to another.

63
00:07:55,016 --> 00:08:02,336
Sometimes those directories will shift a bit. And so I can just very easily substitute that out at the top of my code.

64
00:08:02,336 --> 00:08:08,486
And then from then on, SAS will still be directing to the proper place for my files.

65
00:08:08,486 --> 00:08:10,466
All right. With that,

66
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:18,506
I just want to wrap up by saying key takeaways from this particular video are that libraries are where SAS data sets are stored in the program.

67
00:08:18,506 --> 00:08:23,816
There's temporary data sets that disappear after you close out SAS and then there's data sets

68
00:08:23,816 --> 00:08:30,596
that can be saved to your computer work as a default library for the temporary SAS data sets.

69
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:39,116
Whereas libraries with names of your choice that are mapped to your computer must be created using a line name statement.

70
00:08:39,116 --> 00:08:46,596
And that line name statement now allows you to save and retrieve different SAS data sets.
