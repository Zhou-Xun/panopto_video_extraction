1
00:00:05,848 --> 00:00:09,528
As we know, formative research is
the process of gathering data,

2
00:00:09,528 --> 00:00:13,028
to inform development and
implementation of interventions.

3
00:00:13,028 --> 00:00:16,939
This type of research is essential to
creating new programs in nutrition and

4
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:17,988
health promotion.

5
00:00:17,988 --> 00:00:22,580
In this session, we'll focus on using
formative research, to adopt or

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,265
adapt a program that has already been
created and proven to be effective.

7
00:00:27,265 --> 00:00:31,733
Such evidence based approaches,
are seen as essential to ensure that

8
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:34,848
programs ultimately
improve health outcomes.

9
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:37,240
So what is evidence?

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,708
Evidence is considered the body of data,
or

11
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:43,789
information that can be used to make
decisions when planning a program.

12
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:46,209
These data can include needs assessment,

13
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:49,097
knowledge about the causes
of the health problem,

14
00:00:49,097 --> 00:00:56,422
as well as research that has tested
the effectiveness of an intervention.

15
00:00:56,422 --> 00:00:59,960
Several governmental agencies and
professional organizations,

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,691
routinely review and recommend
solutions to public health problems.

17
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:06,971
Rating the strength of the evidence for
each solution,

18
00:01:06,971 --> 00:01:08,933
from strong to not recommended.

19
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:13,625
Among these, the CDC Guide to Community
preventive services is a resource to help

20
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:18,933
Public Health Professionals, select health
promotion interventions for their setting.

21
00:01:18,933 --> 00:01:23,102
For example State, community,
organization, business,

22
00:01:23,102 --> 00:01:24,713
Health care or school.

23
00:01:24,713 --> 00:01:26,532
The Academy of Nutrition and

24
00:01:26,532 --> 00:01:30,254
Dietetics also maintains
an evidence analysis library.

25
00:01:30,254 --> 00:01:33,499
This is an online resource
of systematic reviews, and

26
00:01:33,499 --> 00:01:36,469
evidence based nutrition
practice guidelines.

27
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:40,829
This is designed for nutritionist, as well
as other members of the health care team.

28
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,648
When adopting a proven intervention
what are the key questions we

29
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:48,719
want to ask in evaluating this evidence?

30
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:54,121
First, which program and policy
interventions relevant to my public health

31
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:59,950
problem, for example teens smoking, or
adult obesity, have been shown to work.

32
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,965
Are there effective programs, services and

33
00:02:02,965 --> 00:02:06,383
policies that would fit
the needs of my committee?

34
00:02:06,383 --> 00:02:10,821
Finally, what would the potential
intervention cost, and

35
00:02:10,821 --> 00:02:13,786
what would be the return on investment?

36
00:02:13,786 --> 00:02:17,969
We know that findings from
Randomized Controlled Trials or RCTs,

37
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:21,191
are often considered
the best possible evidence.

38
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:22,216
Why is this?

39
00:02:22,216 --> 00:02:23,046
To review,

40
00:02:23,046 --> 00:02:28,200
this design maximizes the internal
validity of the program evaluation.

41
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,488
This is because effects of the program,
can be compared in the treatment and

42
00:02:32,488 --> 00:02:33,501
control groups.

43
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:38,011
And the randomized design strengthens
the plausibility that any effects we

44
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:40,547
observer are due to the intervention, and

45
00:02:40,547 --> 00:02:44,014
not to other unmeasured
influences on health behaviors.

46
00:02:44,014 --> 00:02:46,198
There can be constraints however,

47
00:02:46,198 --> 00:02:49,337
on translation of such
programs to the real world.

48
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:52,753
Several factors can contribute
to the lack of effect,

49
00:02:52,753 --> 00:02:57,737
when a tested program is adapted for a
public health setting with a wider reach.

50
00:02:57,737 --> 00:03:02,415
These include time and resources of
practitioners, lack of feedback or

51
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:05,866
incentives to use
evidence-based approaches, and

52
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:09,637
inadequate infrastructure,
or systems organization.

53
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:14,443
Thus, if a proven approach to changing
health behaviors has no effect when

54
00:03:14,443 --> 00:03:18,641
they're directed for
a particular community, this could be due

55
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:23,067
to inadequate implementation,
low acceptance of the program, but

56
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:26,833
not necessarily to inadequacies
in the approach itself.

57
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,080
What do we need to know then to adapt or

58
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,928
adopt approaches that have been
tested in a research setting?

59
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:34,993
In this context for program planning,

60
00:03:34,993 --> 00:03:38,812
public health professionals will
need to complement their knowledge,

61
00:03:38,812 --> 00:03:41,955
with what might be considered
practice-based evidence.

62
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:45,014
Let's look at a familiar example.

63
00:03:45,014 --> 00:03:49,673
This figure shows trends in
the prevalence of obesity in children in

64
00:03:49,673 --> 00:03:54,672
The United States ages two to five,
six to 11, and 12 to 19 years.

65
00:03:54,672 --> 00:03:59,330
Tracked over a 15 year
period from 1999 to 2014.

66
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,668
Increases in child obesity that
started before the year 2000,

67
00:04:03,668 --> 00:04:07,627
spurred numerous intervention
trials that promoted healthy

68
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:11,066
lifestyle behaviors in
an effort to reduce obesity.

69
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:16,106
By 2005 however, the pace and
persistence of trends in all age groups,

70
00:04:16,106 --> 00:04:20,835
coupled with limited evidence for
effective interventions led expert

71
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:25,957
panels to advocate moving ahead using
the best available evidence to prevent

72
00:04:25,957 --> 00:04:30,550
child obesity rather than waiting for
the best possible solutions.

73
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,358
In addition to the persistence and
pace of trends,

74
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:37,736
higher prevalence of obesity among older
children seen on the previous slide,

75
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:42,071
also led to calls from multi-component
approaches to reduce child obesity.

76
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:44,965
These included site-specific approaches,
or

77
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:49,693
ones that partner with organizations
already serving children and families,

78
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:54,645
such as schools, and that are consistent
with the concept of primary prevention.

79
00:04:54,645 --> 00:05:00,225
That is, ensuring all children in
a particular setting receive the program,

80
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:03,956
not just those who are already
overweight or obese.

81
00:05:03,956 --> 00:05:07,536
Within schools,
the best possible evidence at this time,

82
00:05:07,536 --> 00:05:11,475
also suggested that more intensive
interventions were needed,

83
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:14,570
to effectively prevent and
manage child obesity.

84
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,093
Elements seen as essential to
a multi component approach,

85
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:22,533
included providing opportunities for
more vigorous physical activity,

86
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:27,958
greater family and community involvement,
introducing interventions at younger ages,

87
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:37,333
and implementing progressive environmental
change to facilitate healthy behaviors.

88
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:41,182
Finally, multi-site or
trans-site designs were advocated.

89
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:47,266
Experts emphasize that this strategy would
be needed to go beyond the school day,

90
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:51,952
and the school yard, in order to
truly slow child obesity trends.
