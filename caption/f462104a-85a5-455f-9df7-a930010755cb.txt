1
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:09,267
So now, I'd like to talk to you about one
approach that you can use whenever you

2
00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:12,080
are advocating for something.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,442
The idea here is that sometimes we need
to write in a particular structure,

4
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:19,360
and I've heard various names for
the structure.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,969
One-pagers, policy briefs,
sometime these briefs get long.

6
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:28,809
But I want to talk today about
the briefest form of an advocacy message,

7
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:31,642
which is very common in policy contexts.

8
00:00:31,642 --> 00:00:36,602
Now, the common elephant of all advocacy
situations is that they are what

9
00:00:36,602 --> 00:00:38,842
you would call a push situation.

10
00:00:38,842 --> 00:00:44,260
I, the communicator have a point, and
I am pushing it on you, the audience.

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,720
I have a goal that I want to achieve,
I wanna convince the reader or

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,330
the listener to agree with me.

13
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,510
Now, because this is a push situation,
we need to think about using

14
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:01,520
the structure of our communication to help
re-enforce the point we're trying to make.

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,045
The structure I'm gonna propose for

16
00:01:03,045 --> 00:01:06,153
you is not actually new, there's
nothing here you haven't seen before.

17
00:01:06,153 --> 00:01:10,850
It's basically a hybrid of the inverted
triangle structure that puts

18
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,708
the most important points first,
and the ABT, and-but-therefore,

19
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:20,182
narrative structure that allows
you to see the arc of an argument.

20
00:01:20,182 --> 00:01:22,970
So here's the basic structure.

21
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,210
On top, the first thing you get
is whatever your main point is,

22
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,550
the advocacy point, what you want
people to do or to take away.

23
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,218
Then once you've stated that,

24
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:35,695
you then take them through that
and-but-therefore structure.

25
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:40,887
You start with the and section,
in which you describe the problem or

26
00:01:40,887 --> 00:01:43,816
the issue, but there's a solution.

27
00:01:43,816 --> 00:01:48,574
So you describe the solution, which is
related to whatever you're advocating for.

28
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:52,522
Which leads naturally to the therefore,
you should support the policy.

29
00:01:52,522 --> 00:01:55,266
Or support the action, or undergo, or

30
00:01:55,266 --> 00:02:01,340
do the behavior that was what I said at
the beginning, that I want you to do.

31
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,670
So let me give you an example.

32
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,940
Let's imagine we're talking
about flu vaccines for

33
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,120
caretakers of the elderly,
so what's the story here?

34
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,689
I might be saying, we should encourage,
or maybe require, or

35
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:20,446
provide resources for
flu vaccinations for these people, why?

36
00:02:20,446 --> 00:02:23,071
Well, now I get into, what's the problem?

37
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:26,149
Each year,
the flu kills many elderly people.

38
00:02:26,149 --> 00:02:27,412
And unfortunately,

39
00:02:27,412 --> 00:02:32,121
statistics show that many caretaker
workers are not necessarily vaccinated.

40
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:36,880
Which might enable the flu virus to
get into the elderly communities, and

41
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,965
infect the people that
they're working with.

42
00:02:39,965 --> 00:02:44,467
But requiring caretaker workers to
vaccinate has been shown to reduce

43
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:48,904
the number of cases of flu that occur,
it's an effective strategy.

44
00:02:48,904 --> 00:02:53,631
Therefore, we might wanna support
vaccinations of workers as a way of

45
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:59,930
protecting not just the workers, but also
the elderly who they're taking care of.

46
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,980
See how this structure
puts the point first, but

47
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,690
then provides the logical
argument to support that?

48
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,583
With limited adjustment,
this format is surprisingly adaptable.

49
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:14,374
You can stretch it,
it can be longer or shorter, but

50
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:16,349
the basic structure stays the same.

51
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:21,449
And I find myself using it, for example,
when I'm emailing colleagues about,

52
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:27,190
let's say, a need for changes to papers
we're writing, or committee work, right?

53
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,940
I start in the first paragraph,
saying what my request is,

54
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,550
or what my need is, or what the point is.

55
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:37,529
And then I go through pretty much
that and-but-therefore structure.

56
00:03:37,529 --> 00:03:41,030
What's the problem, but
here's the solution, and therefore,

57
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:46,160
I need you to do the thing that I just
said at the beginning I need you to do.

58
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,230
If you look at op-ed articles
in newspapers or websites,

59
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,370
you'll see the same kind of structure
come up over and over again.

60
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,580
You'll also see this in press
releases about a new program.

61
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,950
Announcement, here's our new program.

62
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,510
There is this problem in the world,
but our program is addressing it, and

63
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,830
therefore you should be
aware of our program.

64
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,890
You see this kind of structure
happen over and over again.

65
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,510
Now, the key to writing anything in
this format is being very conscious

66
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,090
about the structure.

67
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,980
You have to know what your central
message is, and to write or say it first.

68
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,610
Make sure it's up front, so
that people are not confused.

69
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,260
What are you trying to get me to think,
or feel, or do?

70
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,650
And then you have to know the ABT story,

71
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,860
especially the but, which connects
to why they should care about it.

72
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,911
When you put them together,
it works better.
