00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,426
Hi, I'm Marisa Eisenberg, I'm an assistant
professor in epidemiology, and

2
00:00:06,426 --> 00:00:11,510
today we're going to talk about
infectious diseases and public health.

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,360
In this lecture, we'll start by
talking through a little of how our

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,690
understanding of infectious diseases
has evolved through history.

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,850
Then we'll talk a little bit
about the biology, epidemiology,

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,790
and mechanisms of transmission
of infectious diseases, and

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:29,050
how we respond to infectious
disease outbreaks.

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,900
First, let's start with the definition.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,510
Infectious diseases are caused by
organisms or infectious agents which

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,730
are transmitted from person to person
either directly or indirectly.

11
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,790
And many organisms live on or in our
bodies and normally they're harmless or

12
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,720
even helpful, but under certain
conditions they may cause disease.

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,630
And so, infectious diseases can then
be passed from person to person.

14
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:56,670
And that might happen either directly from
person to person contact or via insects or

15
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,890
via the environments or through food and
water, any number of different ways.

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,010
There are also infectious diseases that
entirely affect other animals only and

17
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,450
don't infect humans at all or
even only infect plants.

18
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:15,060
So, let's start with a little
history of infectious diseases.

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,980
Our understanding and explanations
of disease have involved over time

20
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,630
as new ideas and information have emerged.

21
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,900
And so
we start in this lecture in the 1800s

22
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,730
when miasma theory was the dominant
explanation for infectious disease.

23
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,210
So, the idea behind miasma theory
was that foul clouds of air

24
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,670
was what made people sick.

25
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,160
So for example, in this picture,
cholera is depicted as a foul,

26
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,820
poisonous cloud that brings death and
disease wherever it goes.

27
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,850
And this idea held sway for a long time,
dating back to Roman times and

28
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,220
even ancient China.

29
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,305
Miasmas were thought to emanate from
decaying matter, unclean water or

30
00:01:52,305 --> 00:01:54,365
soil, and other pollution.

31
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:59,455
And this actually was the origin of
the name malaria, which means bad air.

32
00:01:59,455 --> 00:02:01,330
And so potential remedies for

33
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:06,317
miasmas in order to prevent infection
were to in general to improve sanitation.

34
00:02:06,317 --> 00:02:09,972
So, people thought that by removing
garbage,creating sewers and

35
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:11,447
improving cleanliness and

36
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:15,897
sanitation you could prevent foul
gases and odors from carrying disease.

37
00:02:15,897 --> 00:02:20,329
And so, although this underlying idea, the
theory of miasma was actually,eventually

38
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:22,910
disapproved and replaced with germ theory.

39
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,880
These non-specific remedies often did
improve conditions because by improving

40
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,190
sanitation, they reduced
the exposure to pathogens.

41
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,290
And so, one of the major proponents of
these ideas was Florence Nightingale

42
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,040
who was a statistician, nurse, and

43
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,390
reformer who showed that improved sanitary
conditions in military hospitals and

44
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,580
barracks could significantly
reduce mortality.

45
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,990
She pioneered many of the standards and
practices of nursing and

46
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:52,720
also developed statistical approaches to
show the effects of her interventions.

47
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,550
At one hospital, mortality dropped
from 42.7% to 2.2% after her arrival.

48
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,470
And so you can get a sense from that how,

49
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,330
even though the miasma theory may
not have been quite correct, many of

50
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:14,460
the interventions that were tried as a way
of counteracting disease still works.

51
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,470
Then in the mid 1800s ideas of contagion
and germ theory began to take off.

52
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,120
The idea of contagious disease had been
speculated about for a long time, although

53
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,940
it was viewed as outdated and thought to
be an uneducated view in the early 1800s.

54
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,743
Still, people slowly began to put
together ideas of contagiousness and

55
00:03:32,743 --> 00:03:35,495
the idea that microorganisms
could cause disease.

56
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:40,999
So, the idea of contagion had actually
been proposed way back in 1546,

57
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:45,901
when Girolamo Fracastoro proposed
that epidemic diseases could be

58
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:49,500
caused by transferable seed like entities.

59
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,450
He didn't know anything about germs or
bacteria, or any of that sort of thing,

60
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,240
but still that basic idea was there.

61
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,914
And then it wasn't until 1840,
when Jacob Henle proposed

62
00:04:01,914 --> 00:04:06,499
re-embraced this idea in his
paper on Miasma and contagion,

63
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:14,004
that these ideas of germ theory
sort of came back into the fore.

64
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,859
As germ theory began to take off,

65
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:20,760
the work of John Snow provided some of the
early evidence in favor of germ theory.

66
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,590
As we saw in the illustration of
the cholera miasma earlier, cholera had

67
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:29,730
previously been believed to be caused
by these clouds of bad air or miasmas.

68
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:34,548
And then during the 1800s there were this
frequent cholera epidemics in London and

69
00:04:34,548 --> 00:04:37,459
one of the most severe of
this occurred in 1854.

70
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:41,424
And so John Snow investigated the outbreak
and realized that cholera was

71
00:04:41,424 --> 00:04:45,970
likely contagious and could be spread
through contaminated water sources.

72
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,150
His work mapping the cases
of cholera showed that

73
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,730
the outbreak in Soho was likely due to
the public water pump on Broad Street.

74
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,290
And so based on his analysis,
they were able to convince officials

75
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,040
to remove the handle of the Broad Street
pump and the outbreak subsided.

76
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,780
It's still not quite clear whether this
was actually due to the removal of

77
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,140
the pump handle or if the outbreak was
starting to decline on its own, but still

78
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:13,230
this is a great early example of where
spacial patterns of cases were mapped and

79
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,310
used to determine
the source of an outbreak.

80
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,340
And is also one the earliest
epidemiological studies and

81
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,590
John Snow is often said to
be the first epidemiologist.

82
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,077
But the move to germ theory was not
without its hurdles and difficulties and

83
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,410
puerperal fever was a key example of this.

84
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,900
So, puerperal fever is also called child
bed fever and it's a bacterial infection

85
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,450
contracted by women during
childbirth that often led to sepsis.

86
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,690
At the time it wasn't
considered infectious,

87
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,950
although some hospitals experienced
outbreaks with nearly 100% mortality.

88
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:48,880
And so in the 1840s two doctors, Oliver
Wendell Holmes and Ignaz Semmelweis,

89
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,950
among others, figured out that puerperal
fever was likely a contagious disease

90
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,640
being transmitted by
doctors to their patients.

91
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,410
Doctors would often deliver
one baby after another

92
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,420
without washing their hands in between.

93
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,785
And doctors and medical students would
also move from autopsies to working with

94
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:05,851
patients, again without
washing their hands.

95
00:06:05,851 --> 00:06:09,986
And so Ignaz Semmelweis investigated
puerperal fever in several settings and

96
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:14,117
show that mortality was lower in home
births than it was in the maternity ward,

97
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:18,439
and furthermore mortality in the ward
where med students performed autopsies was

98
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:21,180
higher than in the ward where they didn't.

99
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,200
Based on this,

100
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,520
Ignaz Semmelweis instituted an antiseptic
hand washing policy at his hospital.

101
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,180
And you can see the data here, the number
of puerperal fever deaths before and

102
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,830
after the hand washing
policy was introduced.

103
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,819
He found that it reduced
puerperal fever deaths by 90%.

104
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:39,483
But in spite of all the strong results
that he found he was ridiculed and

105
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,420
rejected by the medical community.

106
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,296
Doctors were offended at the idea
that they could possibly be spreading

107
00:06:45,296 --> 00:06:46,460
the disease.

108
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,840
As an example, Dr.

109
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,260
Charles Meigs said that, doctors are
gentlemen and gentlemen's hands are clean.

110
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,380
So there was this sense that because
doctors where gentlemen they couldn't

111
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,010
possibly be spreading
the disease to their patients.

112
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,440
Semmelweis grew frustrated and

113
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,920
depressed as he fought with the medical
community over these ideas.

114
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,470
He was eventually referred
to a mental institution,

115
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,450
where he died just two weeks later.

116
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,690
His ideas were not validated until
years after his death, when Pasteur and

117
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,190
others more fully developed germ theory,
and

118
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:19,280
found that bacteria were responsible for
puerperal fever.

119
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,530
Pasteur's experiments eventually provided
scientific proof for germ theory.

120
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,140
He was the one who discovered that
microorganisms cause fermentation and

121
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,770
disease, and he did this with the series
of experiments that show that liquids

122
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,570
would grow bacteria when explodes
to particles namely bacteria

123
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,510
in the air rather than
just the air itself.

124
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,460
Those experiments were important pieces
of evidence in favor of germ theory.

125
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,470
He also invented the process of
pasteurization, which is the process of

126
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,180
heating liquid of food to kill
bacteria to make it safe to eat.

127
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,230
This is how we have pasteurized
milk that can last much longer

128
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,710
without spoiling than it ordinarily would.

129
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:58,610
And he also discovered a number of
different species of bacteria and

130
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,510
developed vaccines against anthrax and

131
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,520
rabies based on his initial
work with chicken cholera.

132
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,200
And so, Pasteur played a specific role
in building a scientific basis for

133
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,219
germ theory.

134
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:13,039
And then building on the work of Henle and
Pasteur,

135
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,540
Robert Koch further developed germ theory.

136
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,210
So he was originally
a student of Jacob Henle, and

137
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,310
he developed techniques
to classify bacteria.

138
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,870
He discovered the bacteria
underlying tuberculosis

139
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,410
as well as cholera and anthrax.

140
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:32,490
And so, in fact in 1905 he received
the Nobel Prize for Physiology and

141
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,340
Medicine for his discoveries
with regard to tuberculosis.

142
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,662
He also developed Koch's postulates
building on earlier ideas from

143
00:08:40,662 --> 00:08:41,720
Jacob Henle.

144
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,130
And this postulates were four criteria
that were needed to establish a causal

145
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,300
relationship between a microbe and
a disease.

146
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,340
There are now newer criteria
that we use based on these, but

147
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,570
the idea was that in order to
establish causality you needed to both

148
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,170
isolate the pathogen, show that it can
cause disease and then isolate it again.

149
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:06,910
So, for instance in this illustration you
first have a suspected causative agent

150
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:11,410
that is absent from healthy organisms and
present in diseased organisms.

151
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:17,060
And then that causative agent needs to be
isolated and grown in culture on its own.

152
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,070
Then using that cultured agent,
you need to be able to

153
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:25,840
cause disease in new healthy organisms and
then isolate it again.

154
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,210
So essentially, you need to be able
to step through the whole process of

155
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,450
infection, culturing and infection again

156
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:38,180
in order to truly demonstrate that
that microbe is the cause of disease.

157
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,670
These provided the guidelines for

158
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:43,317
identifying the pathogen which caused the
disease although some infectious agents

159
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:45,380
may not actually fulfill
all four postulates.

160
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,742
So for example, if you have
asymptomatic carriers of disease,

161
00:09:48,742 --> 00:09:55,970
they may appear healthy but
still have the infectious agent present.

162
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,000
So, once we began to get a handle on
the causes of infectious disease,

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,990
there was series of shifts where
mortality began to decline and

164
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:10,140
we underwent what's called
an epidemiological transition.

165
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,400
As we developed vaccines and

166
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,560
antibiotics and began to understand
how to maintain good water,

167
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,020
sanitation, and hygiene, deaths due to
infectious disease dropped sharply.

168
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,610
And so you can see here,

169
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,040
the sort of progress as death due to
infectious diseases began to fall.

170
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,430
So we start by having health departments
and then chlorinating our water.

171
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,890
There are some exceptions
like the 1918 flu pandemic.

172
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:37,850
But overall, between antibiotics,
vaccines, and better water and

173
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:44,785
sanitation, infectious
diseases were sharply reduced.

174
00:10:44,785 --> 00:10:48,867
And eventually it reached a point were
many people though that we could close

175
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:52,823
the book on infectious diseases and
that our focus would shift completely

176
00:10:52,823 --> 00:10:59,030
to chronic disease, but
this turned out not to be quite true.

177
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:02,994
The HIV epidemic made it clear that
infectious diseases would remain

178
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:04,640
an important issue.

179
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,120
And with climate change,
antibiotic resistance, and

180
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,090
increased travel in contact patterns
between individuals, there is more and

181
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,720
more concern about infectious diseases.

182
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,200
Moreover, we're beginning to realize that
many chronic diseases actually may have

183
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,480
infectious disease origins so
that infectious diseases and

184
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:29,744
chronic diseases maybe more
linked than we once thought.

185
00:11:29,744 --> 00:11:33,832
Over time, the growing HIV
epidemic began to level off and

186
00:11:33,832 --> 00:11:39,800
finally to decline as new treatments for
HIV became available and have improved.

187
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,437
We're seeing deaths due to AIDS
drop off more and more and so

188
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,047
more people are living with HIV.

189
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:51,844
HIV also provides an example of a link
between infectious and chronic diseases as

190
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:57,990
HIV is associated with cancers such
as lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma.

191
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,056
Another example of the link between
infectious and chronic diseases

192
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:06,542
is the bacteria Helicobacter pylori,
which can cause chronic gastritis,

193
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:13,600
ulcers, and can lead to increased risk
of stomach cancer and gastric lymphoma.

194
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,153
Perhaps the most well-known link
between infectious disease and

195
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:20,840
chronic disease is the link
between HPV and cervical cancer.

196
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,577
In fact, HPV can cause not only
cervical cancer but oropharyngeal and

197
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:30,867
other types of cancer as well.
