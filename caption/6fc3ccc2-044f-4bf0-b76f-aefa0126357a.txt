1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,990
I was like, Did she not grade my midterm because it was bad?

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,550
Sure. You. I'm sure you'll get. No. She sent an email to you or something.

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:13,290
Yeah. Know, we had a candidate during camp. Dear God, it's me again.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:27,980
I don't know. I think, like. I think I think it's good because she, like, makes it better.

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,950
Yeah. She's got a way to different, like, the things she can read.

6
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,690
Wait the final to be more points. Oh, right. I, I don't know I, I do.

7
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:45,790
Well yeah. I like. Well, yeah, I was surprised that the average is 83%.

8
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:55,400
That right. Now I'm emotional myself.

9
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,790
I really hate you. But it was a painful time, I'll tell you that.

10
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:13,330
I don't know if it was worth my time, actually, even if the metrics, you know, it was not worth my time at that point.

11
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:26,490
I mean, I'm just curious, how did you ever you know, why know?

12
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,580
I didn't know. Because I do. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Now, you just said to the next day.

13
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,720
Well, within a day there's a 1985.

14
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:43,000
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think just generally I like it even if time you address associated with that.

15
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:50,040
Yeah. I mean, for all you know, for the fact that there's no news.

16
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:57,099
Yeah. Know, the later one killed me, I was like, oh, my God, I had so much fun.

17
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:04,560
It was over Thanksgiving. Well, I guess, like, oh, I don't know.

18
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:09,810
I don't know. I guess I, you know, I was like, oh, that's why I did it.

19
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:15,190
And I was like, Yeah, okay. I think that's all right. Oh, yeah, yeah.

20
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,790
I don't like that.

21
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:33,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's it's again our because it is recording, you know, it's just like, yeah, like I said, my God, they are like the captures.

22
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:57,340
All right. Most vulgar. Like, I think a weird thing is probably is like advertiser like, you know, like, like everything.

23
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,870
It should be turned on. Yeah, right.

24
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,830
Yeah. That's what I was reading through all these things about.

25
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,640
Yeah, I know they have. Yeah.

26
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,860
And then they're still funny.

27
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:32,560
And then the other day I was reading this comment, and I'm like, That makes sense.

28
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:39,460
Yeah. Yeah. But I really am like, well, you know, this administration, but it's kind of simultaneously.

29
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:48,040
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I. I literally didn't even finish everything else.

30
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,380
I was like, also just finished reading and. Yeah, like.

31
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:03,150
Oh, you did? Yeah. It's like near 5 minutes. I didn't get anything done by that.

32
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,220
Yeah, I'll take you there. I like new. You're so excited about that house shaped.

33
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,350
Oh, it's too slow, actually.

34
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:19,900
What? Decent plan. It's a sandwich. Yeah, that's true.

35
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,230
Yeah, they took away the. Hold on. Have they? Yeah.

36
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:28,490
So it's supposed to be turned into like one of those auto cafes where you, like, scan your stuff yourself.

37
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,300
I'll be happy. I want a locker. Well, the one at the.

38
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,500
They have, like one of those auto cafes at the end CRC. And you have there's like a coffee machine there.

39
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,540
I mean, they can make like special batteries and stuff. We could come in where we have fun.

40
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,650
That's true. Yeah. It's also like, uh, I think they're doing the same one behind Beekman now.

41
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:54,309
Oh, yeah. Like my friend. Yeah, they have, like, that one market did not.

42
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,620
That's like you get slushies at the one at the end and that's pretty bad.

43
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:09,590
Yeah, there are three and a half dollars. Oh, yeah, I didn't know about it, so.

44
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,490
Yeah. Do you remember what it was?

45
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,160
Yeah, well, let me see. I didn't want it to be there because it wasn't there.

46
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,230
It was a parking, so I got it.

47
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,420
Maybe I can't decide where I put it.

48
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:36,700
You boy. Look, I know that's not a really looked up, but I checked the logic out of the way, and I just like.

49
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,780
I didn't really say that.

50
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,950
I didn't think. Yeah. And then also. Yeah, and it's very interesting to go.

51
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:52,780
We had to do it. This is like part time school. So I.

52
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:59,470
Oh, okay. Well, what was the first cell type for?

53
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,550
I said this one was simple people. I left l feeling like I was incorrect.

54
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,440
I didn't. I don't know. Yeah, that's the that's the number on. This is the Maryland.

55
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,230
Yeah, yeah. That's, that's like development in their own way.

56
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,760
They were like, oh, okay, I'll take.

57
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,330
That's fine. First of all, I said, Yeah, oh yeah.

58
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,900
Okay, yeah, they're on us.

59
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,660
But we'll yeah.

60
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:39,230
Well, I guess neurons kind of like they have the ball catcher answers and it's nice to get job but yeah, that's, I mean, rub it in, you know.

61
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,600
You know what I've done? So are you.

62
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:58,100
It's going to be fine. For how long? I'm sorry, but other than you know, your dad went on like this.

63
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:07,590
30. A lot smarter than we all do, you know?

64
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:13,540
Not. Oh, yeah.

65
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,250
Yeah. You haven't started yet. Yeah, I know.

66
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,910
And I think that all my kids are going to be okay.

67
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,760
I can see, like, maybe that's me, you know, like, a little more like, gosh, yeah.

68
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,860
I hear you will be here. Oh, yeah, I know.

69
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:45,830
Yeah, yeah, I did not. Oh, I guess you could say, you know, strange, hopeless, depressing.

70
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:53,660
Yeah. I feel like this is I hope this is going to be well.

71
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,870
She said it was very she said it.

72
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:06,200
We do have and I think she said it was supposed to be like a war that like there are problems over there more like, you know.

73
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,280
Yeah. Was that. Yeah. About that last quiz.

74
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,050
Had me on the phone.

75
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:20,080
Ah. That the liver the. Yeah. Oh yeah. That was crazy because those lines didn't have the answer.

76
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,010
It was like right in my class, you know, you're like one.

77
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:39,220
And I was like, I looked at that the gas molecule and like, I'm about to draw this out right now.

78
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:54,259
Yeah, that because I literally can't drive through it and work hard and it's not something I did.

79
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,560
Like, I was like I was anymore.

80
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,870
Yeah. I wasn't ready for that kind of directed in the worst way possible.

81
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:08,310
I could have done exactly what I did and got in the same room and all this like that.

82
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,900
I'm involved so that it worked. Totally. Yeah. I score 100 out.

83
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,260
I think one. Amber, you and Neil sent me a file.

84
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:27,550
Oh, the slides. Do you have a flash drive or something?

85
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,620
I was unable to get to my email from where I was.

86
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,190
I want to present the slides. We don't have to present the slides.

87
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,540
It's not okay. Well, whatever. He made these beautiful slides.

88
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:50,670
This beautiful slides. I mean, I don't know if they're their way to upload it to our Kim site and they're probably just upside down.

89
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,510
Yeah. You know, I have a planner. Oh, yeah, he doesn't do that.

90
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,440
I just don't. There's like, two is. We could sign in and then.

91
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:02,560
Yeah. I know.

92
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:09,030
Yeah, I think so. Yeah, but I have a question now.

93
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,200
Or did you just, like, carry a flash drive around everywhere? You never know.

94
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:18,530
You might need a flash drive, and I hate it. That's a good idea.

95
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,790
I don't know. The whole thing? Yeah.

96
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:28,260
More than one? No. Yeah. There's one for each day of the week.

97
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:37,470
Yeah. This is my Friday. That's a hard day at all times.

98
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,500
Oh, okay. Kansas 2011. Sorry.

99
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,990
Yeah, that's my 2011 a things, right?

100
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:56,850
Well, I like that. Why scandals? Everybody's got it differently.

101
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:04,510
No, it's not. Well, I think I'm tired.

102
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:14,100
Oh, come on. You know, I remember.

103
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:26,980
I just got to tell you, this is a way for or to never give you again.

104
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:36,840
Ever really find another. Nothing. Yeah, I know.

105
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,250
Everywhere I go sleeping.

106
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:50,860
Everyone makes fun of my. I know that's kind of cool you bring me.

107
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,230
Actually I like I smart there. All right.

108
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,500
Is it the cord? I don't think that extension cord saved my life, though.

109
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,930
I can't I can't make fun of it the way you did.

110
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,960
And I did make fun of it in the past, and I do regret it.

111
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,030
Is it Christmas lights? Sorry.

112
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:21,250
I know I did say sorry as well as the extras that there had been lighting going around my wall.

113
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:28,280
Oh, that's cool. All right. So I guess what we'll do when we get if you have slides, if you have it on a flash drive.

114
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:37,250
But one of the many flash drives that Nielsen apparently provide for you, when we get to your section, we'll just have you load that up.

115
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,660
Yeah. Thank you. Does anyone else have anything that they want to?

116
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:51,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We also have sides, although we really can just log in on Google Drive.

117
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,100
Okay? Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We could do it here.

118
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,140
Yeah, we can do that from here. But you don't have to do it now. We can just be quick.

119
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,610
Yeah. All right, let's try it out for you.

120
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,160
He says this 2011 development process.

121
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,950
Back to the future. Thank you. All right. Okay.

122
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,940
So do you want to flesh out? Okay.

123
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:41,400
Yeah, we're just using the template. Did you want to come up with it?

124
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:58,230
It's got to look nice. Give me some presenters. Look, we're all like.

125
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,070
I think we're all slap happy. Going to be out in public.

126
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,570
Oh, ready? I got to catch it. Oh, yeah, yeah.

127
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:16,850
Don't want to mess around with it. Sorry, I'm going to use it. But, you know, talk like, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, it's right back.

128
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:21,030
So let's jump on that thing now.

129
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,710
Okay. All right. What are we doing? We're doing study results.

130
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:32,100
Yes. Wow. So I think the assignment was to go through your assigned results sections.

131
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,450
We're pretending we're having kind of our group discussion at the end of our factual

132
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:43,620
study and explain what the results meant in the context of our actual study.

133
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:52,740
Give me a just explain how you would analyze this statistically and if there were any other aspects of the data you wanted to discuss, really.

134
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:59,400
So kind of did this in sort of logical order as I might look at it in an actual study.

135
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:06,840
So body weights being a general measure of toxicity, oftentimes, I'll look at that first.

136
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:12,940
So who's you know? Oh, yeah. Speaking of logical, do you want me to jump to your slides?

137
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:18,360
Do you have this on your side? Yeah, yeah, sure. Okay. And we get to the presentation here.

138
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,950
Yeah. I'm not going to I'm not navigating the shipping music with this.

139
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:27,530
Like I feel like this. Yeah. Oh, yeah. We should have gotten to work on that for next year.

140
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,620
I get that. All right, you want to tell me I'm going to go?

141
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:35,340
Oh, yeah. So we can get started, and I'm just like, pass out to you. Yeah, sure.

142
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:40,469
Yeah. So basically, are we looking at body weights as an endpoint and efficacy in the toxicity?

143
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:44,280
Arms of our study were similar, but they have a little few distinctions that we wanted to point out.

144
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,730
So anybody want to take it away? Yeah.

145
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:57,630
So the purpose of our efficacy arm was to determine the efficacy of our vaccine against the human respiratory.

146
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,740
So was that supposed to be on there? Oh, my God. I don't talk about that.

147
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,719
Oh, my God. I just saw that was. I was going to talk about that. Yeah. Because I was going through your method methods.

148
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,910
And I remember when I was looking at that, I'm like, why does this person psychic?

149
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,440
How did they know that this was it?

150
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:22,530
And then I loved that it was a call and I'm like, Iris Xe act like yeah, that rabies virus acts in a rat in a rat model.

151
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:29,970
So what are we doing in my cell?

152
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:36,930
The some of the animals were monitored weekly and they were monitored daily for one week after

153
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:42,220
the dosing and the challenge of five days after five days a week and in the interim weeks,

154
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:50,730
we know that once we have a positive control with five rats and a treatment control with five rats as well.

155
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:55,380
So wait, so what was the positive control then in this context?

156
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,879
What happened was sorry, what was the positive control in this context?

157
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,690
Like what happened to those animals when they were vaccinated with.

158
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,530
So there you go. Yeah. Yeah. No. Is the positive control being infected and.

159
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,350
Yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah. So infected but not unimmunized, so natural infection.

160
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,870
And then the other one was actually immunized. Yes.

161
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,610
Thank you. Yeah. Sometimes when I'm writing, I phrase if I'm doing like a vaccine study or something like that,

162
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:29,309
I'd probably phrase that as like natural infection versus immunized because like treatment versus

163
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:33,660
positive control makes me think a little bit like efficacy of a drug and treating something.

164
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:39,330
And like you could almost think of this well, you could almost think of this as a negative control.

165
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:43,500
But I think if you just stick to infection versus immunized and infected.

166
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,850
Right, right. Go ahead. Sorry. That's all right.

167
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,490
Yours. Oh, I think we can. I'll get to the. Yeah, well we'll get to the last part.

168
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,809
Yeah. And then similarly the toxicity study, we wanted to determine the tolerability of the hormone.

169
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:02,130
You're not going to do adjuvant and vaccines against the virus in our rat model.

170
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:13,110
So toxicity, are we determining the tolerability against a virus or not the virus.

171
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:17,249
But just in the end, right. So like the virus doesn't even come into play here.

172
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,930
It's just the vaccine itself. So. It's tolerability in a rat model.

173
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,620
So just any toxicity associated just to the vaccine?

174
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,840
Yeah. Does that make sense? And then, yeah.

175
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,089
For our methods, we had like a similar interim endpoint.

176
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,240
So like monitoring weekly. There wasn't a challenge for this.

177
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,080
So it's just monitoring daily for one week and then after dosing it in five weeks.

178
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,219
Yeah. Five days a week. And the. And then we had similar.

179
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,940
But the important distinction here is that for our like negative control,

180
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:54,410
meaning that it wasn't like actually dose with the vaccine and then for the treatment group actual dose with the vaccine.

181
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:58,400
Yeah. So in your writing, you guys, when you're referring to these groups in the text,

182
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,140
just think about your poor reader who's going to have to keep referring back to that diagram of the study groups,

183
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,480
try to make it as easy for them as possible.

184
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:13,820
So if you can use relevant words like immunized versus non immunized, immunized, infected versus immunized versus infected, non immunized.

185
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:18,440
So just try to make sure like what the relevant comparison is so that it's easy for them to compare.

186
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,760
Oh, good. And yeah, I think I'll just talk about that.

187
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,360
Do you want to go to the next slide? Yes. Okay. Yeah.

188
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:31,970
So I looked at the efficacy arm and as we can see, this is not significant.

189
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:38,749
I don't know how many stats test. Really? Yeah. How are the immunized are immunized group and are in fact a group.

190
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:47,840
We're like essentially identical. You know, the we have like overlapping confidence intervals, so that's great.

191
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:53,580
So we don't have to do a post hoc test. And these are young rats.

192
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,749
So like they're in their growth phase and growth phase that can happen later like 6 to 7 weeks.

193
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:06,020
I think we said given the duration of the study, they're actually data doesn't really show up very well,

194
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,570
but there's different there probably at the end of their sort of rapid phase of growth here.

195
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:15,260
So if we had data going back to when they were like three or four weeks old, we might actually have quite a different slope.

196
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,980
But even here you can see that they're kind of topping out. The slope is changing.

197
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,059
So sometimes that can you might have to sort of mathematically apply a different

198
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,180
analysis depending if you're a long term study at which phase of growth.

199
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,590
But they're growing they're young, growing rats, and they're continuing to do so regardless of the vaccine.

200
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:38,930
Do you go forward? Oh, I wanted to ask, is it something in the notes or.

201
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,550
No, I just thought something that it's evolving. Okay.

202
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:53,480
And then toxicity. Oh, you know what? I'm going to do it. So infection rate was somewhere in here.

203
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:59,870
49, I think. So, like, there's a little bubble in here and a little bit more variability if we were to zoom in there.

204
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,440
So infection itself, they might have had a day or so of not feeling well.

205
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:09,290
This data does suggest that infection by itself doesn't massively impact them.

206
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:12,559
But if we were to zoom in and look perhaps at a finer discrimination here,

207
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,670
infection by itself may have had some effect on the data here, but it's just not significant.

208
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:26,219
Yeah. Okay. Sorry. Oh. So let's see what all the confidence intervals overlap for the body weight and our toxicities study of the arm.

209
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,610
So you can see, like, there's no asterisks and you know, it's good news.

210
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,590
And so no point psychoanalysis were needed because otherwise they're just inflator type one hurt.

211
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:40,770
Okay. Is there anything after that? You know, there's a yeah, I guess there's a rapid.

212
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:46,740
So yeah. So the variations in body rates between control and say groups do not really show significant differences.

213
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:53,309
And so percent post hoc testing was not recommended at least for inside your in another question.

214
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:57,090
So going back to like if these rats were older.

215
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:01,050
Yeah, they were immunized or they were, you know, exposed to the virus.

216
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:10,200
What the what this, what the body weight should be like the graph be flatter like should we see any weight gain at all in like later life.

217
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,430
Yeah, in later life. What a brilliant lead in Amber because I have a slide about that.

218
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:23,700
Q So this is back to my PowerPoint. These were the body weights that you just showed this there was in your background section.

219
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,359
There was an article just talking about body weights in general for toxicology.

220
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,550
So this is from that article I think I can remember I called it, but it's in your like resources or background materials.

221
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:41,309
And this particular study was looking at long or this particular paper was looking at long term studies.

222
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:47,460
So this is from a carcinogenicity study over like 21 months and this is from a single mouse in the control group.

223
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,899
And the actual they were interested in like daily fluctuations in body weight.

224
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,500
So these are absolute body weights at different periods in the animals lives.

225
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,280
So this is actually like 12 weeks or so. So this is the rapid growth phase.

226
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,300
The open circles are daily fluctuations and this is it's adult life.

227
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:08,310
So yes, in later life, it really kind of flattens out, maybe declines a little bit.

228
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,309
And they were talking about different ways of handling that data.

229
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:17,220
And one of the things that they had suggested might decrease some of this noise would be looking at interval body weights.

230
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:25,130
So taking rather than the absolute body weight at each time point the change in body weight or the

231
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:30,600
but or I think they used the average or the mean of the body weights over whatever interval it was.

232
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,720
So that's the black dot here.

233
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:41,520
And they were also pointing that the slope of that line is going to be very different in that early growth phase compared to here.

234
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:48,120
So in some instances, they might actually analyze these separately depending on the impact of the drug at different standpoints.

235
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:52,620
So that's kind of body weight over time because their data was relatively boring.

236
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,069
I threw in as an example of where data can be interesting.

237
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:03,270
This is from another version of this class that looks at an unknown liver toxin, which is acetaminophen.

238
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,350
So there you go. So you don't take that class because it's acetaminophen.

239
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:11,310
And these are also different ways of looking at body weights.

240
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:16,200
So this one used absolute these are larger rats. So the body weights or higher.

241
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:21,900
But these this used absolute body weights. And this one, we did have a dose dependent effect.

242
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:30,360
Where's my key? So the red line is high. So in the medium and high dose groups dosing, they really started to drop in body weight.

243
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:35,700
And that was most after the day of dosing. This was a single dose study and then they picked up a little bit.

244
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:45,270
So one other question that you might ask. So this was kind of that interval method like looking at the change percent change

245
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:49,260
from certain intervals and it's very similar to the absolute body weights data.

246
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,820
But another question might be, okay, we know they took a hit at the time of dosing.

247
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:03,360
Do they recover from that, at least in terms of rate? So this was interval percent rate change from from the start.

248
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,580
So obviously, they started with a percent rate change over each interval related to growth.

249
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:14,370
And then that percent change decreased a little bit over time in the control animals.

250
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:20,370
But the animals that were high dose really dropped. They had a drop in body weight in terms of their percent change at the time of dosing.

251
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:27,420
But then in terms of rate, like once it was just a single dose, once they recovered in terms of rate of change, they actually recovered a little bit.

252
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:35,040
So that suggests that even though they took a hit, their sort of growth capacity or their rate of change was not irreversibly altered.

253
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,490
So again, depending on the study, there are different ways to look at body weight change.

254
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,490
But that was an example where we did have some significant data.

255
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:48,870
But there was one other aspect to your dataset and some of the others that were repeated

256
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:55,140
measures that we're going to address at the end with the serum neutralizing antibodies.

257
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:07,440
So if you remember your dataset, we had animals that were infected and sacrificed their time point six days later.

258
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:13,469
So in our infection study we actually started with groups of ten and we had five

259
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:17,400
animals that dropped out at day six because we decided we knew from previous.

260
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,780
That was the maximum point of disease for the PAP.

261
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:27,260
And then we had other animals that we looked until day ten because we wanted to see what happened to the antibodies with a later time point.

262
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,800
So the unfortunate part is that in things like body weight,

263
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:37,639
your data set up until day six post infection was ten animals and then it became five during Jeremy.

264
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,140
So there was some missing data and that was kind of the part that I didn't

265
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,130
emphasize because that can be problematic with a repeated measure as a nova.

266
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:54,020
And I didn't for this class, I didn't want to get too in the weeds because it becomes much more complicated to handle statistically.

267
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,030
But we're going to hold that thought and think about how we might address that when we get to the serum neutralizing antibody,

268
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:05,450
because you guys had the same issue with your data. But in general, for repeated measures,

269
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:12,290
whether it's five groups or two groups compared in general for repeated measures where each data point is tied to the time,

270
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:18,950
to the same individual time point before repeated measures, they know what is the most common test, just as you have said.

271
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,880
So it's good. All right. Organ weights, I think.

272
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,490
Who did organ weights? Do you want me to show anything? Yeah.

273
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:33,350
Sorry. Sorry. Another one. Oh, sorry to interrupt the holy grail.

274
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,960
Thank you. Yeah, I do agree with that. I'm there.

275
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:41,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. MARGARET Got it.

276
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:48,620
All right, let's see how we're going to sit. And we're, like, passing it around and then we'll fly out of hand then.

277
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,720
So hard to. You probably didn't want to use this clock doesn't count.

278
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:56,360
That is not that interesting. It's okay.

279
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:59,580
I looked at it and I was like, That's good. That's what I like.

280
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:04,680
I should have no idea. Oh, yeah. I didn't know that she had. Is it the same thing?

281
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,690
I assume that it was a confusing terminology, but I think it's okay.

282
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:18,530
And, you know, like. Oh. That's a better graphic.

283
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,610
All right. Yeah. So we did orient weights.

284
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:32,770
And the purpose of doing the organ weights when you're you when you're doing it, is that if you want, I won't do it.

285
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:40,600
It's not necessary. The paper the corresponded with this topic was physical at all.

286
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:48,649
It was seven paper and it kind of discussed how organ weights are really sensitive and are good indicators of chemical changes and talk studies.

287
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:55,219
So that's the reason behind why we do it. They kind of noted and this is in the slides that you're probably going to

288
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:59,330
present the the it's like some organoids are not quite as valuable as others.

289
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:05,600
So they talk about how the heart is really not maybe the best indicator of a talk study versus something like the liver or kidney,

290
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:10,360
which makes sense when you think about the functions of the liver kidney that they filter out things.

291
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:17,930
So yeah, that was the reason. And yeah, I think just human work or yeah, okay.

292
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:22,969
So this is like, well yeah, the big five or yeah,

293
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:27,860
that's my vibrant big five organs that we're looked at and all these associations

294
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:32,120
and reasons why we look at them correspond to their thing on the right.

295
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,780
And yeah, that's pretty much it.

296
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,990
If you want to, if I can go through them, I could or I don't know.

297
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,409
I mean, it's fairly self-explanatory, but that's that's absolutely true.

298
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,860
These tend to be sort of the highest yield ones.

299
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:52,070
Um, I think if there's anything else I want to say, I did, I think I threw an example from the acetaminophen study and.

300
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:57,680
Oh, did you? There were two ways we measured organ weights, right?

301
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,370
We did. Absolute and relative. Yeah.

302
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:05,360
Do you remember or is that in here? No, that is not in here. But that's on the slide.

303
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:13,040
Yeah, it's on your side. Okay. Yeah. So, yeah. Absolute and relative and they're both used for different reasons and.

304
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:18,950
Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. So I'm talking for like a really good example.

305
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:27,829
So if you drop in body weight, so just a generic drop in body weight can either some organs are affected by that.

306
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:34,640
So you can have a proportional drop in an organ weight or some organs like the brain kind of tend to stay the same and not be affected by body weight.

307
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:40,310
So relative organ weight size is kind of correct.

308
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:45,770
The organ weight change to any body weight change and that can either be very useful.

309
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:50,540
Like if you have animals that are just, I don't know, maybe have something that makes them hyper fade and they're just gaining a ton of

310
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:54,530
weight and their liver is full of fat and that just kind of makes it proportional. That's percent body weight.

311
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:59,120
If you have other animals, maybe they're sick and losing body weight generically.

312
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,829
If you just did if you did relative weights of brain, that would look like an increase.

313
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:08,450
But it's really just that the brain weight remains stable. So like you have to kind of compare both.

314
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:13,339
It's usually useful to have both and compare both against the other and think about what

315
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:18,110
it's really telling you as a correlation with histology because the kind of the good ones,

316
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:24,800
another like example that they talked about too was like like sickness, like infection and spleen and overall body weight.

317
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:30,020
We're like, yeah, the spleen is will often enlarge and then you're also losing weight at the same time.

318
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:34,129
So it seems like it's not changing, but it is. Yeah, that's an excellent and excellent example.

319
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:38,330
And I'm also remembering that these organ weights, tucks,

320
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:46,940
they can tell us specific toxicity like compound related toxicity or as you just pointed out, kind of generic sick animal.

321
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:51,800
So like this by itself gives you a good indication that there's something wrong with an organ system,

322
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:57,590
but you have to tie it to your histology and to what you anticipate from that basic drug.

323
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:04,100
So immuno toxicity related to stress, so do you guys.

324
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,569
We know like when you say that someone has stress from like chronic disease or stress from illness,

325
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:12,530
what like endocrinology is happening in their body?

326
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:17,060
Like what's the marker of stress? What substance cause in terms of corticosteroids, right.

327
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:23,420
And corticosteroids of the immune system are inhibitory towards overall white cell giant or

328
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,720
corticosteroids can actually be an elevation of overall white count but are inhibitory for lymphocytes.

329
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:38,780
So your overall white cell count can go up, but it'll be more acute inflammatory cells like neutrophils and the lymphocyte count can go down.

330
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:46,550
And that actually in clinical medicine you call that a stress. Luca Gram And there are very specific mechanisms by which corticosteroids do that.

331
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,750
So we would give an animal corticosteroids, we'll see that effect.

332
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:55,970
Or if they have an increase in endogenous corticosteroids from their adrenal glands,

333
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:02,090
like if they're sick and miserable and they have an elevated endogenous level of corticosterone in the case of rodents,

334
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,040
that is going to mimic kind of if we were to give them an immunomodulatory corticosteroid.

335
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:11,870
So it might not be anything related specifically to the Mechanism B drug. And sometimes you have to parse that out.

336
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:16,760
Oops. Oops. Here. Yeah. These are just a number.

337
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:26,899
This is from our, like, protocol discussion. So the body weights, which we already talked about, were done the way that you guys described.

338
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:33,950
They were done. Um, and then the tissues were harvested and weighed individually, a gross, gross necropsy.

339
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:40,399
And that included the five that we kind of mentioned. They were then placed in the formalin for histology,

340
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:47,000
and that includes all of those tissues that we didn't weigh every single one of them, but are included in there.

341
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:58,880
Yeah. Um, so in the local paper that we read for this, they said that not everybody performs statistical analysis on this type of data because,

342
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,370
uh, some people found that it did not always enhance the understanding and could be misleading.

343
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:09,380
I was like, well, very much what someone would write in the journal Toxicological Biology.

344
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:14,990
I think like 90% of pharmaceutical people do or some there was a table that they had.

345
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:21,739
This paper was essentially just like a survey. Yeah, that's like the site of your talks about do white papers on like best practices.

346
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:26,600
And that was one of the best practices, like a survey paper leading up to their best practice recommendations.

347
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:38,810
But you know, most people do statistical analysis because being zero is like it means nothing.

348
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:44,100
Then it's a ratio variable and it's a continuous variable for both the absolute and the relative or anyway.

349
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:53,940
So we have the mean and standard deviation for both of those things and we can confirm a few has referred to that.

350
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:59,879
So this is the data that we have. So you can see like the topic of the toxicity studies so that none of them were infected,

351
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,570
but some of them are not immunized and some of them are immunized.

352
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:08,999
Mm hmm. And so the first two columns in both of the tables are absolute organized.

353
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,270
So it's just like how much it weighs or grams is the second.

354
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:15,570
Two columns are ratio to total body weight.

355
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,510
And then for the efficacy study,

356
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:26,660
some of them were they were all infected and some of them were immunized or not in a good way of actually working very hard.

357
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,330
So so the comparison you're basically making is like this.

358
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:38,640
Right? Yeah. So we didn't really see any differences in any of the groups, which I guess is a good thing.

359
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:45,749
Yeah. So very poor data. Sorry about that. But if this were our compound or a vaccine that we're trying to bring to market,

360
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:54,340
we'd be pretty psyched about that because we wouldn't want to see anything toxicity relevant related just to our vaccination sometimes.

361
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,820
Let me see what the deal looks like here. There's immunized.

362
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:06,930
Sometimes it would be unusual in the UN in unchallenged state to see an increase like in the spleen, like in a lymphoid organ just from vaccination,

363
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:14,130
because the degree of sort of proliferation of those cells is not enough to contribute to an increase in the organ weight.

364
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,290
And that's potentially in the challenge situation. I can't remember here.

365
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,390
So these are infected or spleen.

366
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:27,270
So there was a little bit of a tick up in the organ, wait for the spleen and the infected immunized animals.

367
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:33,810
But that did not reach statistical significance. And this is like basically the same thing, basically the same number.

368
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,829
So this is like a tiny tick up, but it's really nothing substantial.

369
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:43,560
So it would be unusual just from the vaccine alone to see an increase in lymphoid organ size.

370
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,780
If you weighed like draining lymph node, which I don't think we picked,

371
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:55,439
you might see an increase in organ size in the draining lymph node depending on the timing of when you took that lymph node,

372
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,800
because that would go down pretty quickly. Okay.

373
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,610
So good. So unfortunately, that was boring data, but I guess that's good.

374
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:10,529
Yeah. So in terms of toxicity, we didn't get sort of any sort of like, you know, like Jen mentioned,

375
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:18,389
this is kind of just a screening thing to show where, yeah, you would want to look more carefully for like toxicity and those kinds of effects.

376
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:27,270
So we didn't see any evidence of that. But just, I mean, the toxicity doesn't exist, just that this part of our shouldn't detect anything.

377
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,380
And really same for efficacy. It didn't seem to make a difference.

378
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:35,400
Yeah, I guess for us for this I wouldn't,

379
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:43,910
I think emphasize this because this isn't really a strong it's a parameter that we measured in our efficacy study because like,

380
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:48,810
I don't know, maybe there'd be a change in organ weight related to infection and we'd have an amelioration of that or something.

381
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,919
But it's by itself because like I said, even with just a vaccination,

382
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:59,100
you're unlikely to see a change in an immune organ, but that's not going to be a good sensitive measure of efficacy.

383
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:03,360
So I wouldn't try to draw a protective effect conclusion based on this data.

384
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:12,509
I would just say there's no effect. Does that make sense? So it would be it would be if we so we wouldn't expect to see anything for efficacy.

385
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:21,540
If we didn't for toxicity of the we wouldn't expect, well, infection because the difference in that in those groups for infection.

386
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:30,420
So like if infection itself made them sick enough like maybe infection itself like gave them a whopping spleen response from lymphocytes,

387
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,170
maybe the infected animals would have an increase in spleen size.

388
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:42,270
And then if our vaccine were effective, maybe we would see an amelioration of that increase in spleen size because maybe our spleen is like,

389
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:47,070
Oh my God, I'm infected, I'm going to gear up. And then the spleen size would increase.

390
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:51,840
But if the immunized animals were less affected by the virus,

391
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:56,280
maybe they wouldn't get that increase in spleen size because they could more quickly take care of it.

392
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:05,910
That didn't happen, but that would be one reason where that would be a reason where we might have some indication of efficacy from organ weight data.

393
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:10,670
But in this case they were basically the same, like the toxicity and the efficacy studies.

394
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:15,960
All we can say is there's no difference. Oh yeah, that's good.

395
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,510
So that as this might cause that. Yeah, that's, that's fine.

396
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,180
We got there. So. And I think I gave you that.

397
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:32,570
They said, oh, here's the acetaminophen study.

398
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:39,740
What's going on? Okay, so the acetaminophen study, just because something changed in here, so maybe it's more interesting.

399
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,680
So they still haven't said it was acute.

400
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:48,260
And these were the dose groups of C and D were the medium and the high dose groups and they had whopping necrosis.

401
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:52,699
Those were really cool slides to see, actually. But they had really severe necrosis.

402
00:39:52,700 --> 00:40:01,550
So cell loss and necrosis tends to drop and tends to drop the absolute weight of an organ because they're losing cells,

403
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,990
especially in the acute stages before you have a lot of inflammatory infiltrates.

404
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:12,979
So they had a drop in their absolute liver weights and then it was less obvious when we did the relative organ weights.

405
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:21,799
But like what kind of what happens they actually had relative to body weight a higher level of liver weight and that kind of reflected that.

406
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,640
These animals were also pretty sick. They had also dropped significant body weight.

407
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:33,170
Adrenal glands are always at the limit of what we can actually even measure by our weight.

408
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:39,619
But there was also there was actually a drop in adrenal glands, in adrenal gland weight for these animals.

409
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,060
This was a very acute study.

410
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:48,710
So it might reflect either some necrosis or the fact that adrenal glands are essentially squeezing out as much corticosteroid as they possibly can.

411
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,140
But they didn't really have a lot of time.

412
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:56,470
I don't think the time frame of the study was long enough to get like a hyperplasia or anything, so maybe that was just an example.

413
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,290
Oh, in the thymus, look at thymus. So that's a lymphoid organ.

414
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:04,520
So does that mean that acetaminophen is an immunomodulatory drug?

415
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:07,850
No, not necessarily. It means that these animals are sick.

416
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,480
So they were having some atrophy or some involution of the thymus and their hematology data actually reflected that as well.

417
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:22,549
So that's an example of a stress related finding. So it was definitely sort of study related, but not directly compound.

418
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:28,970
Well, it's still compound related because the compound make them sick, but it's not a direct immune toxicant.

419
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:33,740
It was a kind of a secondary effect. Okay.

420
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:38,450
Speaking of hematology, this was hematology results.

421
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:43,340
We had hematology. Oh, did you are you good with this slide here? I'm going to show you where we're going with that.

422
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,380
Okay. So just the goal obviously focused again on advocacy on the bed.

423
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:56,140
And so the question we're kind of asking was, does the immunization of this vaccine candidate yield human health?

424
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:07,550
You mythological differences between those immunized and unimmunized, my organism, your rat with strain in response to an infection that we give them.

425
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:14,060
And this was performed this ecology study was performed.

426
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:23,870
Did I give you did I give you hematology data for both efficacy and toxicity?

427
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:28,489
I think we were just supposed to focus on the efficacy. I can check again.

428
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:35,510
I think that we did I do data for that. I don't I thought you just I can't remember what I gave you.

429
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,910
I thought I wanted you to focus on hematology, but I can't. Did I read them all that toxicity?

430
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:47,360
Yeah. So I think this parameter we just because we were taking blood for.

431
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,299
Well, I mean this had serum neutralizing antibody too.

432
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:56,390
I don't think we measured this parameter because this study, I think we just measured it in the toxicity groups.

433
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:03,210
I. Oh. Is that what you remember?

434
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,970
Okay. And that's okay.

435
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:14,389
So I was like, Did I forget to put something up here? Because these are the toxicity study groups.

436
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:18,020
This is just immunized versus unimmunized. So there's no infection present here.

437
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,030
And we could have done that.

438
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:26,750
That would have been something to measure in the efficacy study for whatever reason, probably only if you know everything you do costs money and time.

439
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:33,500
So probably the decision was in the efficacy study. Really the focus there was does it prevent severe infection or not?

440
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:41,090
And these are kind of generic parameters of hematologic health, but nothing here is anticipated to be directly.

441
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:48,860
I mean, you could come up with some things that were changed with infection, but there were not as important parameters for the efficacy study.

442
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:54,500
So the decision was to just run them for the study and it's the content is misbranded.

443
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:56,940
No, no worries. I just wanted to make sure I didn't, like,

444
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:05,930
put something wrong up there or like something up or accidentally put the name of the actual virus infection out.

445
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,969
All right. So this is toxicity.

446
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:16,070
So these are generic general markers that sort of telling us general markers of hematologic performance or hematologic parameters.

447
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:22,640
And we measured in our study for. So we're looking for like does the vaccine do something horrible to our hematologic markers?

448
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:31,219
Okay. So this was performed by collecting blood from the intracranial puncture and the bone from added to a K-2,

449
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:38,450
EDTA anticoagulant for a complete blood count, and then run on an automated hematology analyzer or five HD.

450
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:44,120
So whole blood specimens were then analyzed for a complete blood count and the five HD

451
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:49,220
doses by using flow cytometry to differentiate based on the cell size and complexity.

452
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:55,040
The complete blood count consists of a white blood cell count and then red blood cell indices.

453
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:01,670
So that white blood cell count for the disease with a white blood cell count.

454
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:06,890
And the total white blood cell count form accounts for neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils.

455
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:14,140
And then our red blood cell indices include the total red blood count, along with the hemoglobin concentration and the well.

456
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,020
So we have our NCBI, which is our average volume of the red cells.

457
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:26,510
AMC was going to be the average amount of hemoglobin in our red blood cells, and CHC is the average amount of hemoglobin within the sample.

458
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:33,110
And then our RTW, which measures the degree of cell size variation, and we also have platelet platelet count.

459
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:42,339
So the appropriate testing given that we have to prove the two unpaired groups being

460
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:48,010
unpaired t test and if there is a physical significance there in the first half.

461
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:53,350
So just like in summary,

462
00:45:53,740 --> 00:46:03,969
given the if you look at the evidence asserted that the immunization with the vaccine candidate does not produce any significant with an asterisk,

463
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:10,960
there hematological differences between immunized unimmunized groups in response to or administered inoculation.

464
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:16,300
Good. Well, that's good news for our vaccine. Yeah, that's good.

465
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:23,980
So, again, this was boring data, but you can kind of get the sense of the things that might be reflected on the red cell parameters.

466
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:28,750
So this is the same, you know, if you go to your physician and they do a CBC,

467
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:38,140
watch episodes of those medical shows in the CBC screen, this is the CBC, the complete blood count portion for the red cell portion.

468
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:45,850
Red cell count and hemoglobin are both your base measures that tell you like increase or decrease in red cells.

469
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:50,709
So essentially, I mean, clinically, you call anemia, right, if you have a decrease in red cells.

470
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:55,600
So these are the two main parameters increase to indicate whether things are increased or decreased.

471
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:02,469
Increase is a weird one because like usually under normal conditions, you're not going to push out from your bone marrow.

472
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:08,500
Too many red cells. The most common cause for an increase in red cells is just dehydration.

473
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:15,699
So we talked about water balance today. When animals are getting stressed out, they're drinking less and they actually get dehydrated.

474
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,790
And that's going to increase the relative amount of red cells.

475
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:20,830
So that's the most common cause for an increase.

476
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:28,750
There are some more rare primary causes for an increase, but an increase is usually a kind of nonspecific effect of dehydration.

477
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,390
And then obviously, there are things like if you have,

478
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:39,999
you can actually induce an immunologic response against your red cells and get an immune mediated hemolytic anemia.

479
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,400
And so you can have lysis of the red cells in response to an immunologically reactive reagent.

480
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:50,920
So that can be one thing. So basically you first look at these to know if things are up or down and then

481
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,910
this tells you something about the reason for that increase or decrease.

482
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,370
The red cells come from the bone marrow.

483
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:03,240
If I have a decrease in red cells, one of the things I'm going to want to know is that happening in the periphery,

484
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:08,080
like, am I having a drug that's causing an animal logic, destruction of my red cells in the periphery?

485
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:14,320
Or do I have something that's bone marrow suppressive and my bone marrow is not pushing out red cells the way it should.

486
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:19,120
So ordinarily so these parameters can help you a little bit with that.

487
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,840
Ordinarily, if there are immature cells coming from the bone marrow,

488
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:28,480
immature cells tend to be bigger for red cells and they have a lower hemoglobin

489
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,780
content because they're kind of pushing them out before they're fully loaded.

490
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:37,780
So if I have a drop in red count and I want to know, oh, my gosh, is this for my bone marrow?

491
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:40,300
If I look at the mean cell volume, then it's up.

492
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:48,820
And if I look at the hemoglobin concentrations and that is down that supports this is probably my bone marrow is probably okay.

493
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:54,429
This is more likely in the periphery. Okay. So you don't need to know the details of all those interpretations,

494
00:48:54,430 --> 00:49:03,130
but I'm telling you to know that these individual parameters can help you more fully explain the basic sort of up or down numbers.

495
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:07,240
So that's what is often done when you're trying to figure out the reason for toxicity.

496
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:14,049
And then the other kind of hidden secret in this is what I've just told you, tells you that these parameters,

497
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:18,070
even though we're measuring all these things independently, they're not really independent.

498
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,580
Right. But I have a drop in red cell count.

499
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:25,810
My concentration of hemoglobin in the sample is going to be affected as well.

500
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,549
So statistically,

501
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:35,050
we kind of pretend even in our you over that there or if we're doing it in an overt or in our T test that these are like different things.

502
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:41,730
But even if so, that's one of the reasons why we have to be kind of conservative.

503
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:48,480
And if we did find something significant applying multiple comparisons correction or if we don't like, maybe we're worried about our power.

504
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,430
We're like, I just want to know big picture, what can I see?

505
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:57,090
If you see a change in one of these parameters, so let's say we just see a statistical change in that.

506
00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:05,690
CV So certainly Red Talks papers were like, well, this was statistically different, so it's evidence of hematologic toxicity.

507
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:15,190
I question whether that might be a statistical aberration because these things I know are related to red blood cell count.

508
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:21,820
And in clinical clinical practice, typically, if there is no change here, you kind of ignore minor changes here.

509
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:29,440
So the reality check that we apply to our tox data when we're running a study is that, okay, well, run our stats.

510
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:33,880
We may or may not use the multiple comparisons correction depending on how wide.

511
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:38,740
We want to be, but then we apply a biological validity test.

512
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:45,780
Are these things moving in the same direction? Does it all makes sense that I look at it as an entire puzzle, or does it not make sense at all?

513
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:51,849
And then I have to figure out, is this just a statistical blip that's fooling me, or is there some really weird thing about this toxicity?

514
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:57,310
And I might need to run a very specific, hematologic, reoriented study to try to piece that out.

515
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:04,750
So again, the upshot is like your statistics can be very powerful and help you, but you have to interpret that in a biological context.

516
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,980
So those are some of the things related to Red Cell, this red cell distribution web.

517
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:12,880
If I'm losing red cells, I'll have little fragments of them around.

518
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:18,040
And some of you saw in the lab, I showed you the scatter gram that we get out of the instrument.

519
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:27,310
The red cell cluster, rather than being tightly compressed, will be all over the place unless you're both larger cells and smaller cells.

520
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:32,200
So sometimes the mean cell volume is fine, but the spread of the data is wider.

521
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:38,200
So sort of knowing what these things are when you're interpreting torques data or if you're looking at that in the literature,

522
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:42,770
understanding kind of what they're measuring can really help, you know, whether, you know,

523
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:46,450
claim that somebody is making or something in your own data really makes biologic sense.

524
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:57,909
Yeah. Why were eosinophils you specifically focused on and not like another immune cell is I assume the eosinophils where they they

525
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:04,840
kind of they're like cells for like the type to a response which is normally for like helminth infections or like an allergy.

526
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:13,270
And they did granulation as like they're it's like they're saying, I mean, the short answer is that these are the standard parameters on a CBC.

527
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:17,739
So the hematology, it's like hematology analyzers.

528
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:23,889
This is kind of standard. All CBCs will have this data. There actually is a basic fill channel to base.

529
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:29,950
Apple's are very very rare cells and like the the just eosinophils are also very low number.

530
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:39,990
The normal reference range for basic fills as a per microliter of blood in mice includes zero like the normal reference range is like 0 to 2.

531
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:46,690
So like it gets much harder certainly to interpret a decrease and these are field changes are relatively rare.

532
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:53,170
So I'm I think I might even have basis of data for this, but I just didn't report it because it was less interesting.

533
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,950
But yeah, it's pretty standard for the CBC to have these parameters.

534
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:02,910
Some of the things can go together, like if you have that stress, glucagon, these,

535
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:10,420
those are kind of related neutrophils go up if you have a stress response and eosinophilia can go up, no, no.

536
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:13,839
It's an inflammation sometimes go down depending on the species as well.

537
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:20,630
So sometimes little things pop up. But essentially Hematology Analyzer does that.

538
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:27,520
Some of them do work by flow cytometry, but they're a little bit less programable than an actual flow Cytometer you're not applying an antibody,

539
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:32,890
you're looking at sort of light scatter and some of them also have an electrical impedance component.

540
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:38,580
So you don't have to apply an antibody, it just has certain parameters that it knows to recognize and assign to these cells.

541
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:46,570
Okay. This was your example from the acetaminophen study against the group was the control group D was the high dose.

542
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:51,129
And this was kind of a classic to have a little thing that's a classic stress.

543
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:59,740
Luca grad these poor animals were pretty sick and they actually had a relative, Oh, this is the right one.

544
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:03,970
Sorry, they had a drop in the leukocytes in a lymphocytes excuse me.

545
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:07,569
Then dropping the lymphocytes neutrophils.

546
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:12,370
Mice aren't a great species for the nutritional effects of corticosteroids.

547
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:15,849
Dogs are dogs. The neutrophils will go way up mice.

548
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:21,639
It's mostly the lymphocyte effects, but look at the relative percentage that really helps you a lot.

549
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:26,110
So mice are lymphocyte dominant species. They should have like 70% lymphocytes.

550
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:34,900
So even if the absolute neutrophils look fine, if you have a shift, like if the lymphocytes have dropped down below the percent for the neutrophils,

551
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:39,340
that's a huge indicator that there is inflammation or a stress in the background in mice.

552
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:45,010
So just an example, more interesting data serum chemistry.

553
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:48,340
Who did Gene? All right.

554
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:56,320
So serum chemistry is used to kind of get more insight into effects of the tissue level.

555
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:02,200
So each of these parameters are representative of different like tissue damage.

556
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,820
So albumin would decrease with impaired liver function.

557
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:13,870
Aspartate transferase and alanine immunitaires transferase are both indicative of

558
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:18,460
liver damage if like you see an increase because they're released during the process,

559
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:24,339
alkaline phosphatase is released during damage to the biliary track specifically.

560
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:30,640
So again, liver damage bilirubin is also elevated within her liver function.

561
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:36,110
So those first. After six or 12 liver.

562
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:40,070
Yeah, they tell you slightly different things about the type of toxicity.

563
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:48,080
But yes, they're all kind of related to liver function and then getting into urea nitrogen like we talked about in lecture today,

564
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:55,280
that's indicative of kidney damage because it's elevated during kidney damage or dehydration specifically.

565
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:03,680
And then we also talked about creatinine, which is a product of muscle breakdown, and that's also elevated with kidney damage.

566
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,320
And then glucose and total protein are a little bit more general.

567
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:18,380
So, you know, you're expected to see your glucose levels spike after a meal or with excitement or stress or if you are diabetic.

568
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:26,660
But then, you know, similarly, you're supposed to or conversely, you're supposed to see a decrease in hungry.

569
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:37,690
But it can also a decrease in glucose can also be indicative of malabsorption and toxicity or lead substance and then total protein.

570
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:47,479
A decrease in that would reflect decreased liver synthesis, but an increase would reflect dehydration or an immune response.

571
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:52,550
So like total protein can kind of give you insight into both liver or kidney damage.

572
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:57,950
Yeah, yeah. Liver that that was really broad liver damage.

573
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:03,110
So if your liver is not functioning because at the end of the liver lecture, we talked about all the different proteins the liver makes.

574
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:08,840
So albumin is one of those. So these if your liver is having a problem, both of these would probably go down.

575
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:15,740
Total protein also is lost if you have weakness across a membrane that usually restricts protein.

576
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:22,669
So that can we talked about with the glamorous today if we have leakage across the kidney, you can have a protein losing nephropathy.

577
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:29,960
So it could be lost in the urine. So if we have kidney damage, if you have inflammation in your GI tract, you can lose protein in your GI tract.

578
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:34,129
So if I see this decreased, I have to think, okay, what does my other data tell me?

579
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:40,970
Because this could be due to liver decreasing function could be due to damage to the kidney, could be due to damage to the GI.

580
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:50,390
And if it's increased the other tela proteins, basically measuring albumin is one of the major carrier proteins in serum plus immunoglobulins.

581
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,290
So if I have an immune response that's robust.

582
00:57:54,800 --> 00:58:00,830
So and again with just the immunization, it's unlikely that would be enough to really reflect that.

583
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:08,420
But if this is really, really high, that can be indicative of immune stimulation because you can hold the albumin consistent.

584
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:12,530
And then if I have immune stimulation, the globulin which are the other fraction are going to go way up.

585
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:16,250
And so that's another reason. So it's really versatile. It hits a lot of different.

586
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:20,840
It's a good first screen because it reflects a lot of different body systems,

587
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:26,870
but it's not going to be specific enough to tell you exactly what's affected except in the context of your other data.

588
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:32,270
So good markers, quite boring in our case yet.

589
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:39,139
So this is again collected this pretty much the same way as the data.

590
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:47,270
And so all blood is collected postmortem in the inner core, I'm sure, and then placed into serum separator,

591
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:54,800
micro nicotine or tubes and then allowed the clot before being centrifuge to be able to get this here now.

592
00:58:55,940 --> 00:59:01,250
So do you guys remember in your tour of the lab that was the instrument that I said was kind of like a mini spectrophotometer.

593
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:07,010
So we have done a full chemical kits that measure each of these parameters by how for the enzymes,

594
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:14,090
there's an actual chemical reaction run in there and for some things that measures the component self itself directly.

595
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:20,240
For others, like for aspartate, aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase, it measures a byproduct of the reaction.

596
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:26,120
So it's a spectral photometric detection. So that's where our artifact can come into play.

597
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:33,169
Like if you have a rough blood draw and you have hemolysis and bilirubin or hemoglobin, rather gets into the serum that can interfere.

598
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:39,440
So that's a place where a lot of artifact can come into play and mice are so tiny, it's really easy to get artifact.

599
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:45,229
So these results and hematology in mice in particular are one where you can often

600
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:50,120
see really wide standard deviations and you have to be very careful about outliers.

601
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:53,599
So like in the company, of course, that I teach to my residents,

602
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:58,879
we have little problem sets and I have examples where you have like one mouse that's like throwing everything off.

603
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,790
So they have to look at the means that to notice that, you know,

604
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:05,750
the standard deviation is wide and then they look at the raw data and try to figure out what happened.

605
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:09,490
So. Oh, right.

606
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:17,300
Oh yeah, sure. This one. Yeah, yeah. So with these groups that, you know, he relies on being independent groups,

607
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:21,440
it will be appropriate to use that to sample t test or it's known for a metric

608
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:27,200
equivalent depending on the data passed and a few assumptions or criteria,

609
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:31,820
which is that you're going to experience or the magnitude of the test for that.

610
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:42,819
So where respect to toxicity, we do not have enough evidence to have said that there is a significant difference between these two between.

611
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:48,430
But there was there was again with respect to toxicity,

612
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:58,120
we do not have enough evidence to say that there was a significant difference in means of these biomarkers of toxicity between the immunized group.

613
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:02,980
No. Yeah. Yeah. So there's no evidence of toxicity from or serum chemistry data.

614
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:06,820
So I guess that's good standpoint of our vaccine.

615
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:18,370
Yeah. And so this was another marker that we could have measured in our infection group anticipate knowing now that it affects mostly the lung,

616
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:22,599
we wouldn't anticipate that any of these would be particularly reflective of lung function.

617
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:28,810
So we probably chose to just keep these for the toxicity arm just given the number of data points we have.

618
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:36,909
But yeah, it was a pretty good representation and I sorry I didn't put any dummy data in with cool serum chemistry results,

619
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:42,520
but we've talked about it enough in this class and at 16 you can probably imagine now.

620
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:46,780
So like we did our kind of generic toxicity markers, we did some of the efficacy parameters.

621
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:52,450
Now we're going to we're going to look more specifically at does this vaccine make a difference as far as virus infection?

622
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,380
So I think this was our plaque. Was that you? Tiffany Yeah, you're the solo.

623
01:01:56,430 --> 01:02:02,799
And so the purpose of Virus Titer is to assess a concentration of virus.

624
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:10,840
In this case, it's in live lung tissue in in live with not live from live animals.

625
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:14,120
Yeah. Like in unfixed lung. Yes. Yes.

626
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:16,050
Sorry. That's what is turned on.

627
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:24,720
There is actually like in larger animals you can do a broncho alveolar labarge, which is where there's actually a way to do this in humans as well.

628
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:30,850
You're kind of flushing fluid breast down the trachea and flushing up neutrophils and potentially virus.

629
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:34,990
There's actually a diagnostic test version of it, probably not something you want to experience,

630
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:44,320
but so in interim time points for larger animal studies, sometimes they'll do bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and measure virus amount in that.

631
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:57,249
But they're mice. And how this is done is the lung tissue is homogenized and plated or serial dilutions are done

632
01:02:57,250 --> 01:03:03,430
and it's plated and allowed to incubate and blocks are allowed to grow in that time period.

633
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:16,360
And after the certification time, the blocks are counted, which is how you were able to obtain the platform units per gram as is seen on the Y axis.

634
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:24,720
In this case, we saw the virus titer in the day.

635
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:34,660
Six animals. For the vaccinated infected group B is significantly lower than in the unvaccinated group.

636
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:39,680
And it's important to note in this case that the Y axis is No.

637
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:49,489
One on a log scale. So the group B virus titer is orders of magnitude lower than your day to day sense.

638
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:52,490
And that data, there was no difference. Okay.

639
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:58,850
And so what does that mean? So this was supposedly our maps of infection like with from our previous data.

640
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:02,810
So what would your conclusion then be for our vaccine group?

641
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:11,810
So in the vaccine there was the viral concentration in the lung tissue was significantly lower than in the unvaccinated in.

642
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:18,010
Yeah. At peak infection. Yeah. So like, you know, it had some detected incompletely protect from infection.

643
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:25,280
But these data at least suggest that at peak infection, the viral load was lower in the vaccinated group.

644
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,819
Now, this shows us something about natural infection,

645
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:34,970
that these animals have a pretty good inherent ability to drop the level of virus down just by themselves.

646
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:42,680
So in the black line, even the unvaccinated animals, by day ten, they pretty much cleared that virus from their lung.

647
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:49,160
So natural infection has a certain course and our virus here is kind of modulated the disease course.

648
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:53,540
And so this is good in terms of virus titer.

649
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:57,740
Well, what's the other aspect of infection that we want to see corresponds to this?

650
01:04:57,890 --> 01:05:01,880
This tells us virus number from the standpoint of severity of disease.

651
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:16,220
What else might want to look at? Like, What's your interest if you are the individual and infected, like what corresponds to symptoms?

652
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:19,410
It's a very yeah. But like in our contact like symptoms certainly.

653
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:24,000
So like the body weights which didn't seem to be affected and histologic changes like are we having

654
01:05:24,810 --> 01:05:30,180
is this a perceptible degree of difference if there is a histologic change associated with this,

655
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:34,320
presumably, if there is like inflammation, maybe some of the alveoli are getting clotted up.

656
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:42,450
Is that correspondingly decreased by this? Is that correspondingly decrease with the decreased amount of virus?

657
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:45,930
It might not be might actually might not have an effect.

658
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:51,989
So that'll be something we have to correlate this drop in virus number with a drop in actual disease.

659
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:55,530
And here we're evidencing that by microscopy. Okay.

660
01:05:55,590 --> 01:06:01,500
Yeah, because there is no evidence of the difference in histology or body weight between the natural infection and vaccinated.

661
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:06,510
Would it just be what it might nullify the vaccination?

662
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:13,080
So like if if we have this result and then we went to our microscopy and it was like no protection.

663
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,940
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

664
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:23,819
That wouldn't necessarily be a very good that would be kind of concerning for our efficacy of vaccination because maybe this degree

665
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:32,010
of drop in virus titer is not enough to effect a significant biologic decrease in symptoms because there's still some virus there.

666
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:38,220
So it's a combination like that's good. It's a good sign that it's dropped the actual number of viruses present.

667
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:42,569
But as long as there's virus present there, like, you know,

668
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:47,640
it might there might still be enough damage that you're not having a significant amelioration of symptoms.

669
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,610
So yeah, it's not a completely done deal that it's effective.

670
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:58,049
Yeah, this is the point of, you know, piece of data and like every data set has to be interpreted in its own context.

671
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:05,100
So this is data that suggests that our vaccine was effective at decreasing viral titers at peak infection rate.

672
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:08,400
So that would be the kind of data focus the way we would phrase it.

673
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:12,240
But it doesn't necessarily mean that the vaccine as a whole yet is effective.

674
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:19,469
And I can't remember doing that for your methods because like when you do a platforming and I'll say I guess

675
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:26,160
if you're using I can't remember on the methods if they were homogenizing the lung and bleeding that on a

676
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:33,120
virus permissive media has the other way of doing a plaque forming assay is you have is most viruses have to

677
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:39,720
infect cells so you have a plate of cells supposed to be a solid sheet of cells that are just a cell line.

678
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:45,330
And if I infect the cells with virus, it's going to kill the cells in a certain area.

679
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:53,040
So the plaques that actually form see those circles that I'm drawing here are the bigger those are the plaques.

680
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:58,320
They're actually areas of clearing of the cells that's emanating from one virally infected cell.

681
01:07:58,330 --> 01:08:09,960
So this is really what you would be counting. So if I have my sheet of cells here and I take my one homogeneity.

682
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:15,600
So what they're actually planning then is the one the one is all homogenized in here.

683
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:19,409
So it has lung tissue and some unknown amount of virus.

684
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:23,309
Right. So I'm going to play this.

685
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:31,530
I'm going to throw this out. Oops, I probably start putting 1 to 100, 1 to 1000, etc.

686
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:37,950
So I'm going to have multiple plates duplicates of these, and then I'm going to see.

687
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:44,519
So presumably if there is some virus present in my highest dilution, I'm going to get some plaque effect, right?

688
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:50,729
So I'm going to get some plaque effective. There's a lot of virus present, but if there's not much, if this is just a 1 to 10 dilution,

689
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:54,600
I don't know what the starting amount is and I'm trying to see what I dilute out.

690
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:58,079
That plaque effect survive a ton of virus present.

691
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:02,070
I might still get some plaque and plaque forming here, right?

692
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:06,000
If I'm starting with a lot and I'm diluting it out. So I'm still getting some plaques forming there.

693
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:11,850
If I just have a couple, I mean, I have a couple of viruses, but if I have a few viruses in my starting sample,

694
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:18,450
I'm going to dilute this out sooner and I'm going to lose that platform again sooner.

695
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:26,580
Okay. So a higher virus concentration is going to be a longer dilution.

696
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:35,700
And so a lot of times that the concentration is expressed as the reciprocal of the dilution that it took to,

697
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:39,060
um, to, to still get that drop in plaque effect.

698
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:46,410
So like if my high virus amount sample, I could dilute it all the way out to 1 to 1000 before I saw,

699
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:53,430
you know, a disappearance of that plaque forming effect. The answer for that would be like a thousand isn't the reciprocal.

700
01:09:53,760 --> 01:10:01,080
Maybe my low where I started with a low sample count. I diluted that already and I have no effect on plaques and that would be ten.

701
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:04,140
So this is a higher amount of virus that makes sense.

702
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:07,330
Yeah. And that ties in to your neutralizing answer.

703
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:13,300
Right. You want me to do something, and you have to do that for sure.

704
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:18,250
So, um. And, um, what you were saying, Tiffany, these are often because these are,

705
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:23,680
it's easier to expressing this lot so that you take the log of that to express on your y axis.

706
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:34,119
How do you quantify the decrease in participation? So in many cases you'll have sort of a known virus titer.

707
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:39,390
So you're sort of salvaging kind of a standard term for a certain amount of virus to how would I

708
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:47,410
titer that out for how much plaque formation I have with undiluted starting sample versus dilution.

709
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:51,910
So I have a sense of how much I want to say.

710
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:56,830
So at my highest concentration, I have lots of plaques and then that'll dilute out over time.

711
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:02,340
And then I usually have a definition like if I don't add any, um.

712
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:09,180
If I don't add any virus to the sample now, that's something I won't say.

713
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:16,080
I have a definition of how much plaque formation I want to see in my in my standard sample.

714
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:22,830
And then when I drop it above a specified threshold, like, say, 50%, a 50% from the control.

715
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:29,310
Yes, 50% from the control case, which has the most amount of plaque.

716
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:34,410
That would be kind of the threshold at which I'm calling a decrease.

717
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:39,180
Yeah, I think I understand that. I think I mean, like, literally, how do you measure it?

718
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:49,650
Is there like a camera that you would you. Oh, it would look by the naked eye and making that person way too complex.

719
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:54,220
So but old school way is literally to count. So over the microscope tool.

720
01:11:54,270 --> 01:11:59,159
And these are and you either don't like count or like you know yeah as in our microscope.

721
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:02,639
But now I guess it's with a camera set up,

722
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:11,430
there are ways that you can put it through an automated instrument to like read like the strength of the, like what and like essentially count.

723
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:20,519
And then you can, you have the numbers, you just calculate out. You just specify what threshold decrease in plaque formation you'd want to 50%, 60%.

724
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:31,860
But have you sort of I mean, I know what kind of cells that you saw in the monolayer was it it didn't epithelium it's whatever the virus

725
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:36,430
is permissive to virus growth I think these were bureau cells which are just marking can be so yeah.

726
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:41,070
So it just has to be a cell line that's known to be permissive for for virus growth.

727
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:46,709
Okay. So it could be different depending on the virus type. So everything that like unnecessarily complex.

728
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:50,580
But that's my M.O. All right. What are we doing now?

729
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:53,960
We're doing this. All right. Okay.

730
01:12:54,140 --> 01:13:01,260
Yeah. So. So, yeah, Tiffany's was the plaque formation.

731
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:05,489
So this is the plaque reduction neutralization assay.

732
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:11,910
So this is used to quantify the concentration of neutralizing antibodies that are found in this zero.

733
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:24,540
So the unit that is used here, it's on the Y axis is the reciprocal dilution and it's log that results in like a defined reduction of virus plaques.

734
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:30,960
So in our in the context of our study, it's a 60% reduction in plaques.

735
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:40,440
Yeah. Oh, three times. So the difference between that reduction utilization.

736
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:48,010
It seems to me that we had different forms delusions of Sarah,

737
01:13:48,020 --> 01:14:01,140
which contain antibodies with virus and we could bet that there of virus mixture with the cell culture to come to know that

738
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:12,660
reduction in things so that this is this measurement is used to analyze the B-cell activity based on the antibody production.

739
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,820
And for that if they could see arm, you see that.

740
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:34,800
So let's first talk about statistical methods to suggest using repeated repeat measures of ANOVA to measure the difference among the time period.

741
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:42,959
The only difference is that at day 59, which is the post change,

742
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:52,620
they tend to observe the significant difference between the effect in immune and immunized group and immunized group.

743
01:14:53,280 --> 01:15:02,750
We found that that is really weird that the control group seem to have higher level of antibodies compared.

744
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:13,980
So these are the infected as natural infection. Exactly. And that the immunized groups, they did produce lower concentration of antibodies.

745
01:15:15,070 --> 01:15:26,610
At this point it makes me think that it's probably because the of target is that our vaccine because of our method cannot find the proper target.

746
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:32,190
So it seems that naturally natural immunity is more effective.

747
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:33,000
Okay,

748
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:41,010
so this is the first piece of data that if in our little vaccine company that makes our investors a little bit nervous because this seems to suggest,

749
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:45,750
you know, if you have natural infection, right, it's the whole virus that you're getting infected with.

750
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:51,320
You're going to take a wide variety of antibodies. So the antibody response to natural infection tends to be pretty broad.

751
01:15:51,330 --> 01:15:57,570
There are a lot of different epitopes that are targeted. Not all antibodies that are made are neutralizing antibodies.

752
01:15:57,690 --> 01:16:02,070
Not all antibodies can neutrophil can bind to virus and prevent it from entering cells.

753
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,960
Not all antibodies can neutralize its effect.

754
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:11,970
So this suggests that the and this particular assays let's go to our assay just to make sure we all follow that.

755
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:16,170
This is that same plaque formation assay that we just talked about with Tiffany's data.

756
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:29,770
So if I have an immunized animal, right, with as with serum, neutralizing antibody, I can so the same kind of thing I can add.

757
01:16:29,790 --> 01:16:38,969
But this has one difference at the front. If I have a virus culture that I know, I know the concentration of.

758
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:47,910
So I know it can create a certain number of virus plaques. So my control for this is just virus culture and plot and plaques forming.

759
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:51,780
So here's my virus culture by itself.

760
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:59,070
So that's going to create a certain number of plaques. And I know how, how much I that it doesn't that are based on the starting concentration.

761
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:09,090
I can take the same virus culture so that's my two with virus in it and add the sample serum the serum which has antibodies in it.

762
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:17,310
Right. Serum antibody in the serum, those antibodies. So those antibodies hopefully will neutralize some of this virus.

763
01:17:17,730 --> 01:17:22,799
So the effect is I'm going to decrease the starting concentration of virus, right?

764
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:28,950
So with no antibody, this is kind of my standard curve of reduction with accelerating dilution, right?

765
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:32,040
But if I have neutralizing antibodies,

766
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:39,240
it's going to drop down the effective concentration of virus at the start and I'm going to get fewer plaques and I'm going to move it out sooner.

767
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:46,320
Does that make sense if I have antibodies that are not neutralizing?

768
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:54,480
If I add the Sierra Nevada antibodies present but they're not neutralizing the virus, it's going to look more like that.

769
01:17:55,900 --> 01:18:02,680
Then I can. Yes. Well, I think that is so.

770
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:05,740
And this in this graph on the bottom. Oh, okay.

771
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:10,120
Is that what is what is happening in relation to what you just described.

772
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:14,950
Is the is the group a. Okay.

773
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:22,300
I see. Yeah, I know. This is what you were asking me about, but now I understand the question and it has to do with the confusing y label.

774
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:29,410
This should really. Okay. This was added to clarify the point of the graph.

775
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:36,160
But this should really be this really should be eliminated because this is the log.

776
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:41,280
Let me make sure I can understand this correctly. Yes.

777
01:18:42,130 --> 01:18:45,640
It's the log. Reciprocal titer. It's this part.

778
01:18:45,850 --> 01:18:51,850
I think that makes sense for both A and B, I believe so.

779
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:55,890
Let me just think for a second. Yeah.

780
01:18:55,900 --> 01:19:03,540
Because this is going to be this is going to have a higher value if I'm looking at log reciprocal titer.

781
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:10,180
Right. And this is going to have a lower value, but it's corresponding to.

782
01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:14,380
So it has to be the reciprocal of that, I think. Yeah.

783
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:19,299
Go ahead. Okay. So I think it would if I'm understanding this right.

784
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:23,710
What that graph is representing is if you took like just the bottom half of what you drew.

785
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:30,750
Yeah. Then Drew another one that could be group F where it's not neutralizing.

786
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:40,520
So like you kind of started drawing it where it just like group is just on specific antibodies that aren't neutralizing the this.

787
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:47,340
Yeah, but it still is serum. It still has serum antibodies, but they're ineffective.

788
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:50,919
Yeah. So there's a lot of them. Well. Ah, no, no.

789
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:54,969
Because those would not be measured by this assay. Oh they're not.

790
01:19:54,970 --> 01:20:06,250
I mean measured by the opposite, as they only indirectly measures antibody by its ability to inhibit virus survival, not realizing antibody.

791
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:10,840
The virus is just going to look like this. Well then it looks like group B is more effective.

792
01:20:11,230 --> 01:20:16,140
Or if you're paying, if there's the control group is the infected infection alone.

793
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:20,680
So group is more effective. It's infection alone but not immunized.

794
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:24,490
Yeah, but it looks like the antibodies are more effective.

795
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:28,930
But it's the reciprocal. It's the reciprocal.

796
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:38,860
That sounds like the patient. So it's saying that in the infected group, we have more serum neutralizing antibodies.

797
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:42,630
Because you're clear inverse because.

798
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:47,530
All right, let's try to draw it out. You're right.

799
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:50,680
You're right. You had it. You had. Yeah, you have it. You're right.

800
01:20:50,710 --> 01:20:59,680
Oh, I'm right. Yes. You're saying I go it let's let's figure out from our group because it's all right.

801
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:06,100
So we know that our infected group, natural infection, has more thorough neutralizing antibodies and that that's kind of this guy.

802
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:10,809
So it's going to be more effective. Oh, I see.

803
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:13,990
You're saying. Yeah. At a lower dilution interval.

804
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:22,450
You're right. Yeah. But more effective at a lower dilution in terms of diminishing plaque formation.

805
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:32,050
So can we label that box for bad? Yes. The top secret B and then the equivalent diminution for group B, B somewhere out here.

806
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:38,380
Okay. So that makes sense. So then why would you use the vaccine?

807
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:51,159
Right. Right. I mean, this data suggests that our vaccine is less effective than natural infection at decreasing or

808
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:56,530
that the less effective the natural infection at generating a neutralizing antibody response.

809
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:05,080
So remember when we talked about the effects of the vaccine, we have an antibody response.

810
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:08,620
Some of those antibodies are neutralizing and some of them are not.

811
01:22:09,070 --> 01:22:15,430
And this data from the standpoint of our vaccine is a sort of a negative results for efficacy.

812
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:21,280
His one proxy for infection is the number of sero neutralizing antibodies that are generated,

813
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:27,490
and this suggests that it's not good at doing that other aspects of a vaccine induction.

814
01:22:27,490 --> 01:22:33,780
But we also have the conflicting result that the virus titer in tissue is decreasing.

815
01:22:34,510 --> 01:22:38,650
So the immunization seems to be able to decrease the amount of virus.

816
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:42,250
So the whole other Axl antibodies are b celebrating.

817
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:49,290
The other arm of immunity that can affect decreasing amount of virus is the T-cell.

818
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:53,919
So if we have a T cell response, we're not measuring that in this assay.

819
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:58,690
We can have a T-cell response that induces inflammation or induces.

820
01:22:59,030 --> 01:23:08,360
Lysis of a virus, infected cells, and the t cell response, which ideally would also be induced by our vaccine, can also decrease our virus amount.

821
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:13,330
So we still haven't figured out like what's happening in terms of infection in the lung.

822
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:18,290
Like is, is the net effect that we had. It doesn't matter that we don't have serum neutralizing antibodies.

823
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:23,450
Maybe this virus is more effectively cleared by a T-cell response.

824
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:29,270
All that really matters is our T-cell or this might be very important.

825
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:37,310
So we have two pieces of evidence, like we have evidence that the B-cell response, at least as far as neutralizing antibody, is not that good.

826
01:23:38,150 --> 01:23:39,469
And we don't know yet.

827
01:23:39,470 --> 01:23:46,880
We have evidence that the virus amount itself is lower, but we don't know yet really why that is because we haven't done a T-cell related assay.

828
01:23:47,910 --> 01:23:51,319
Do I think it's a complicated thing?

829
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:59,720
No, that makes sense to me. All right. The only thing that I would like ask, though, is if the purpose of the vaccine is to prevent future infection.

830
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:04,190
Don't you do that by means of antibody response? So that is the more important.

831
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:09,580
Yeah, that would be another factor. So like this is just an efficacy class.

832
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:13,969
So these are these are potential results for an efficacy test. So it's not a guarantee that it's going to work.

833
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:21,170
And in fact, if this is our little vaccine company, this would be a result to suggest that would be worrisome because you're right,

834
01:24:21,170 --> 01:24:27,560
in different points of infection, when the virus is already present in the cell, you want to be able to destroy infected cells.

835
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:31,280
And there are mechanisms for doing that with an antibody.

836
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:38,660
So there are antibodies that are not necessarily virus neutralizing for the virus itself, but can recognize an infected cell.

837
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:45,260
So they'll bond and maybe the cell has viral proteins on it. It can bind to that cell and target it for the inflammatory system.

838
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:51,680
So that might still be happening even though our virus doesn't hit circulating, even though our vaccine doesn't have circulating virus.

839
01:24:52,370 --> 01:24:56,930
But you're right. So that those are parameters that help when you have an infection.

840
01:24:57,380 --> 01:25:04,640
But for preventing future infection, neutralizing antibody is often the more relevant parameter because that in theory,

841
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:08,090
if it works best, will hit the virus before it ever gets the stuff.

842
01:25:08,210 --> 01:25:13,320
Yeah. And then you don't want to just kill your cells if you don't have to write that killer.

843
01:25:13,490 --> 01:25:21,170
Yeah. So this is about this. Is that right now bad results.

844
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:26,960
And so what we have to explain that we want to understand so like if we are running a toxicity efficacy study,

845
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:29,690
we'd be all excited when we saw that virus had a result.

846
01:25:30,110 --> 01:25:37,309
But in this result, we're going to start to get a little bit more sober and we still have some more data like we want to see,

847
01:25:37,310 --> 01:25:44,210
okay, well, what happened? Maybe we can tweak something and we can tweak our protein and get a better neutralizing antibody response,

848
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:47,660
but we still want to see what happens in terms of actual disease.

849
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:51,470
Right. To see if that other result is supported by a decrease in disease.

850
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:56,389
Yes. You have a question? Yeah, I do.

851
01:25:56,390 --> 01:25:59,750
So, yeah. Okay. I'm sorry.

852
01:25:59,930 --> 01:26:08,750
You're right. So is this sort of like a is this sort of like a like a test homolog for like B cell memory?

853
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:15,079
If, like, if they're producing or if their B cells are producing, you know,

854
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:26,270
like you have your B cell panel expansion B cells producing IgG IgG that IgG is then used to neutralize.

855
01:26:26,330 --> 01:26:33,800
Yeah. If you're not creating, you're not creating the correct IgG, then that's not then you're not going to have that neutralization.

856
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:38,780
So you won't have memory later on for that, this specific virus, you know.

857
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:47,629
Does that make sense? Yeah. So, okay, so two things. So this was a spike, this increase f are in our highest level of disease.

858
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:48,740
This is where we tested first.

859
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:58,640
This elevation after the peak of disease suggests that we do have a strong B-cell memory response for this specific virus, though.

860
01:26:58,730 --> 01:27:07,250
Yes, because this is a serum neutralizing. These are looking at antibodies to have an effect for this for the infection only group, right.

861
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:10,999
Yeah. No, I get that. Yeah. No surprise. Yeah. That's what I'm asking for.

862
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:17,870
The, for this immunization, typically you're not going to have the correct B cell memory later on or not.

863
01:27:17,870 --> 01:27:21,509
It's just not the correct I mean, we probably have some, but it's just not effective.

864
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:25,960
That purpose of creating a neutralizing. We might still have a memory response, right.

865
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:31,040
And we might still be generating antibodies. And I'm going to show you some data that suggests this in a minute.

866
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:39,680
We might still be generating antibodies, but the particular types of antibodies that we're generating are not effective at neutralizing virus with.

867
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:44,240
And one common reason for this is that the target is where our vaccine is.

868
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:49,040
We've done something to the virus so that it's not the same as natural infection.

869
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,469
So we inactivated it in some way.

870
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:58,070
So we've altered the protein structure from natural infection, and it might be what we did when we altered that protein structure.

871
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:01,430
You know, it's not infectious anymore.

872
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:10,120
But in our in our vaccine, that made the immune response less able to recognize it and less able to generate a strong antibody response.

873
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:15,650
Okay. So they're to make you take one more time. No, but this is the discussion.

874
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:19,740
Are we're supposed to do this? Okay.

875
01:28:19,770 --> 01:28:24,300
So if you want to wait, I think I just answer my question.

876
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:28,860
Everyone know it's like is like other people probably have the same question. Well, so.

877
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:38,460
Okay. All right. All right. So if you had the virus titer that we talked about yet, which made the concentration of virus lower.

878
01:28:38,490 --> 01:28:44,040
Yes, that's like a pointer. So, like, let's pretend like it was low.

879
01:28:44,130 --> 01:28:55,320
The thing is low point there. That works. Yeah. Was it if your slope was higher for group B even though.

880
01:28:55,330 --> 01:29:02,880
Yes. Okay. So like if you see like the bottom squared and the slope was higher than it was here or something.

881
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:10,410
It doesn't even have to be like literally that high because I guess I'm not saying that I'm right.

882
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:17,160
So what I'm trying to say is like, would it be as effective if like, let's pretend it was only like this high.

883
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:19,720
Okay. But it had it was like parallel with this.

884
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:27,629
Oh, I think would it be as effective because it wasn't responding to like literally as many things because the virus titer was lower,

885
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:31,320
but the b cell response was like the same like slope.

886
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:36,180
Maybe it was still like a lower absolute number of antibodies.

887
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:44,049
Like, I think I think it would be less but it's a lower absolute the number of viruses because through but I think your immune response.

888
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:56,640
Well I think about C that situation in reality and that could happen if you if you were exposed to it previously.

889
01:29:56,790 --> 01:30:01,380
Right. If the rats were exposed. Yeah. Okay. So actually, that's a good example.

890
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:09,570
If I had so like, well, so like if your t cells took your, your virus titer down to like a lower absolute value.

891
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:16,920
Right. And then when you, when, when the thing initiated an antibody response, it was a lower absolute value because the lower.

892
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:20,370
Yeah. Virus. But the response is like parallel.

893
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:26,160
So the slope is the same. Yeah. I'm not sure. Still that still I think would be a concerning effect.

894
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:30,870
Okay. Partly.

895
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:37,770
I think that would be unlikely to occur and some of that has to do.

896
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:42,530
I think I can phrase this right. Well,

897
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:46,820
it'd be like really hard to explain in this context and might be very might be easier

898
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:49,890
because we actually have sort of a wrap up that ties it back to our immune lecture.

899
01:30:50,300 --> 01:31:00,800
But one of the things that causes this spike, the initial kind of round of antibodies that you make even in natural infection, are kind of nonstick.

900
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:03,020
They're specific, but they're less effective.

901
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:12,680
So like you make a broad range of antibodies first, and then in your lymphoid tissue, you actually have sort of the second.

902
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:18,319
One of the reasons for giving, like when you do a vaccine of giving a booster is you actually have affinity maturation.

903
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:26,210
So when you have your next exposure of the the sort of library of antibodies or B-cell clones that you made first,

904
01:31:26,630 --> 01:31:31,160
only the ones that are most effective at destroying the virus preserved.

905
01:31:31,170 --> 01:31:38,930
So you have an affinity maturation. And then when those cells encounter virus, you have sort of a more robust response.

906
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:45,140
So this is actually not only more antibodies but also more effective antibodies.

907
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:53,450
So I still think obviously the point, the absolute number makes a difference,

908
01:31:53,450 --> 01:32:02,510
but also sort of the maturation like the degree of difference between your initial response and your next one and the efficacy of neutralization.

909
01:32:02,730 --> 01:32:06,110
Mm hmm. I don't know if maybe I went the wrong way with that.

910
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:11,130
No. Do I think I got okay? Because it's not an absolute number you're looking for is the number of, like,

911
01:32:11,270 --> 01:32:17,480
specific antibodies of neutralizing antibodies or antibodies that aren't neutralizing harmful?

912
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:29,209
Not necessarily. And not. Well, they can so they can facilitate, like we were saying, cell killing because they can bind to a virus protein.

913
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:35,120
And then your macrophages recognize that or a set of toxic t cell comes and kills the infected cells.

914
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:40,790
And that's all part of the normal immune response if that happens too much.

915
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:46,460
Like if you have if you induce a robust, especially in your lung because you need air space in your lungs,

916
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:55,640
if you induce a ton of t cell related inflammation in your lung, that's going to be a problem because you're filling up air space.

917
01:32:56,120 --> 01:33:01,070
You're not going to want to induce a lot of inflammation as a sort of bystander effect in your along with you could help it.

918
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:03,920
So yes, that can potentially be a problem.

919
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:09,770
And that would be one thing you would be looking for in the histology for this to see if there's collateral damage.

920
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:14,840
Like maybe we are dropping the virus amounts by inflammation, which is great,

921
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:18,770
but the lung could be suffering for that if there's a lot of collateral damage.

922
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:23,130
Does that make sense? That's a really good discussion. Thank you.

923
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:28,660
It was a confusing, but that shows that you're really thinking about the data and making me think about the data, too.

924
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:32,479
But I think that's a good example because especially with the immune system,

925
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:37,129
with responsible arms, you know, it's not as simple as virus up or down as it would be.

926
01:33:37,130 --> 01:33:42,410
In a culture, you can have very positive effects like the virus titer being low.

927
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:44,630
But if that's happening due to inflammation,

928
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:51,260
that potentially is not the best type of immune response that you want to induce if it causes a lot of host collateral damage.

929
01:33:51,650 --> 01:34:00,380
So it illustrates that the different arms of the immune system. We want to design a vaccine that sort of balances the aspects appropriately.

930
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:04,909
Okay. So summing up like from the efficacy and the toxicity standpoint,

931
01:34:04,910 --> 01:34:10,760
I think you could probably say that we have little evidence that the vaccine itself is directly toxic.

932
01:34:11,210 --> 01:34:14,120
Right. We had body weight for fine organoids are fine.

933
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:22,100
But as we look at the chemistry data, you guys did the hematology data, that was all side efficacy.

934
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:27,920
We have evidence that at peak infection, our virus decreased the viral load.

935
01:34:28,490 --> 01:34:34,790
We have some very disturbing, funny looking results in our serum neutralizing antibody that suggest it's not

936
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:39,140
very effective at B-cell stimulation towards a neutralizing antibody response.

937
01:34:39,470 --> 01:34:44,540
And we're gonna look at histo next week and I have one more piece of data I want to show you at the end.

938
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:51,379
But I want to come back to this, which is the nuance of the statistics that I totally, intentionally glossed over,

939
01:34:51,380 --> 01:34:55,430
because it's actually a little bit beyond the statistics that I want to concentrate on for this class.

940
01:34:55,910 --> 01:35:02,510
So we had a problem with our repeated measures. This was our our infection only group.

941
01:35:02,810 --> 01:35:06,080
Same thing would be for B. So we had ten animals to start with.

942
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:08,209
This was our peak infection rate.

943
01:35:08,210 --> 01:35:16,040
And so we wanted to look at histology at peak infection rate because we know that normally they clear infection by day ten.

944
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:21,140
So there's no point in looking at histology here. So we wanted to look at histology at day six.

945
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:25,070
So we sacked five of our animals at day six. Right.

946
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:30,770
And then we kept five to go to that day ten because we wanted to see what happened to that antibody response.

947
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:37,310
So that's great. But it means that for our body weights and for our neutralizing antibodies,

948
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:40,790
I think those are the only two repeated measures because everything else was.

949
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:46,690
Euthanasia dependent for our body bodyweight in our neutralizing antibodies, we have missing data.

950
01:35:47,380 --> 01:35:54,820
And the unfortunate thing about our repeated measures, ANOVA, is that it handles missing data by list wise deletion.

951
01:35:55,630 --> 01:36:03,070
So it'll go, okay, I have ten samples here, I have five full data sets.

952
01:36:03,580 --> 01:36:07,090
These are missing data delete. I'm going to ignore them.

953
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:13,900
So I mean, maybe we had robust enough results that we could just look at these five, but we've eliminated like half our data.

954
01:36:13,930 --> 01:36:20,530
That's not really something that we want to do. So repeated measures, ANOVA is not very good at dealing with missing time points.

955
01:36:21,970 --> 01:36:28,750
So an alternative is a mixed is essentially a regression model.

956
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:30,940
So a linear mixed effects model,

957
01:36:31,570 --> 01:36:39,490
which is a type of regression where you're comparing the relationship between the predicted variable and body weights and the independent variables,

958
01:36:39,490 --> 01:36:43,140
which is a group in time. So just like we did for repeated measures de Nova,

959
01:36:43,390 --> 01:36:49,629
so it's the same kind of idea with the repeated measures they nova in that we're trying to see what's the relationship between these?

960
01:36:49,630 --> 01:36:52,540
Is the relationship different for the different groups that we're comparing?

961
01:36:53,170 --> 01:36:57,730
The biggest difference are from our standpoint, the biggest difference is how it handles missing data.

962
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:04,120
So with the mixed effects model, if the majority of points are present like this is only missing one data point,

963
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:07,840
it can accommodate mathematically retaining that dataset.

964
01:37:08,230 --> 01:37:12,580
So we're not going to kick out all that data. So that's good.

965
01:37:12,850 --> 01:37:15,940
So it's much more sensitive measured by that standpoint.

966
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:21,009
It's a much more complicated measurables, like kind of setting it up and analyzing the data.

967
01:37:21,010 --> 01:37:23,410
So utilizing it is a little bit more complicated.

968
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:31,269
And so if you're going to use I mean, if you're not a statistician or have special training in statistics,

969
01:37:31,270 --> 01:37:34,989
most people get a statistician involved at least to make sure they're using it appropriately.

970
01:37:34,990 --> 01:37:42,370
So it's a little bit more complicated to conduct and interpret and is not as commonly utilized in like a standard gen tox study.

971
01:37:43,390 --> 01:37:51,219
Yes. So is this just like imputation? So again, imputation method or you've exceeded my ability to explain statistics.

972
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:56,920
So I don't know. Does anyone have a statistical hobby can help us.

973
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:03,530
Tiffany. Tiffany, what's going on for us? It's not including it.

974
01:38:03,730 --> 01:38:14,190
It's just using the data that's there, okay? Because if you imputed it, it would cause the standard deviation to be lower.

975
01:38:14,710 --> 01:38:23,140
Hmm. So you're not you're not doing analysis on the right data then because you have five sample points that are the mean.

976
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:27,730
Exactly. So the standard deviation of that whole thing would be smaller than the rest.

977
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:33,310
But that makes sense. Yeah. That's why it doesn't usually happen.

978
01:38:33,550 --> 01:38:37,420
Okay. Yeah. So I don't like that explanation.

979
01:38:37,420 --> 01:38:43,810
I do. I don't know, like why it can handle the missing data or is there an easy way to explain that or.

980
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:47,660
I don't know. I mean, that's what they say.

981
01:38:47,920 --> 01:39:04,209
Oh, but with longitudinal data, if it's unbalanced, then linear mixed models allow the data like part of the data to vary randomly.

982
01:39:04,210 --> 01:39:07,410
So it's kind of hard to like colloquially.

983
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:17,020
It's okay. But if it doesn't make your analysis dependent on the data that you have.

984
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:23,330
Okay. If that makes any sense. But can we correctly understand that?

985
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:25,750
I mean, I guess for our purposes,

986
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:31,510
can we correctly understand it that the difference if we wanted to think about the difference between this and like our competitors,

987
01:39:31,510 --> 01:39:37,650
they know this will allow us to return to retain more of a longitudinal data of like the.

988
01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:46,540
Yes. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. We're, like, decreasing our level of detail that we need to understand ourselves.

989
01:39:46,570 --> 01:39:52,300
That is awesome. Thank you today. Well, all right. A little note to your professor, for example.

990
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:57,160
You can be excused because he explained it to us. Yeah.

991
01:39:57,220 --> 01:40:04,930
So these data were actually compared by that mixed effects model because of the missing data points.

992
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:10,329
So this is mean. I just grabbed a screenshot from the ah data set and again,

993
01:40:10,330 --> 01:40:19,250
it's not a stats course so like you won't well I don't have a question for Tiffany or something but you have to put this on your quiz just under.

994
01:40:19,330 --> 01:40:24,340
And I'm actually not going to ask you specifically about a mixed effects model, but for your own knowledge,

995
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:29,469
if you have a dataset like this, know that there is that there is an alternative to utilize.

996
01:40:29,470 --> 01:40:34,030
If you have missing datasets and you would ordinarily use a repeat measure, say, NOVA.

997
01:40:35,350 --> 01:40:42,820
Okay. So, so to fill out your protocol, this will be added to that.

998
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:46,240
So your protocol is getting more and more complete in your module.

999
01:40:47,470 --> 01:40:53,290
This is going to be added on to the stats section. So this is just a description of what was done for the different sets of data.

1000
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:58,950
So I highlighted for the repeated by repeated measures analyzes of mixed effects models utilized.

1001
01:41:00,860 --> 01:41:02,740
I was going to say something else that I can't remember.

1002
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:10,600
And then for the single endpoints that was unpaired t tests we were doing, you know, things like clinical chemistries and hematology.

1003
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:12,850
And for the organoids we're looking at multiple organs.

1004
01:41:12,850 --> 01:41:19,700
So there was a multiple effects, multiple tests, comparisons, correction and a false discovery rate applied.

1005
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:25,660
So like these were the criteria used for this data to set what the significance level was.

1006
01:41:25,690 --> 01:41:28,659
So this is just for your methods and for your quiz.

1007
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:36,400
Just understanding, given a particular dataset, what would be an appropriate statistical test to utilize?

1008
01:41:36,970 --> 01:41:37,720
So for your quiz,

1009
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:44,670
it's sufficient to know when do you remember that chart I gave you that had prepared impaired and poor parametric versus non parametric?

1010
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:47,500
That's basically your study guide for this course.

1011
01:41:48,220 --> 01:41:54,100
And as I said, the mixed effects model was just kind of an extra piece of information that might be useful for you someday.

1012
01:41:55,060 --> 01:42:04,570
Okay. So next week we're going to do histology. So, oh, and then these were the P values.

1013
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:05,980
So those are going to be added as well.

1014
01:42:05,990 --> 01:42:12,460
So when you do your methods, make sure you incorporate your next draft, make sure you incorporate the state or at least for your final draft.

1015
01:42:12,610 --> 01:42:15,640
So I'll do that for you. Oh, I'm so sorry.

1016
01:42:16,990 --> 01:42:22,600
This is kind of interesting. I'm just going to briefly talk about this and we'll get back to it when we do our kind of wrap up.

1017
01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:26,889
So this is an additional test that was done sort of subsequently.

1018
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:37,420
This is our Natural Infection Group and this is the immunized group, an infection neutralizing antibody that we looked at both before the white boxes.

1019
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:43,480
Okay. So we did not have as high a neutralizing antibody level in our immunized group, which is a bummer.

1020
01:42:44,050 --> 01:42:47,980
But then we also measured by lifestyle total serum immunoglobulin.

1021
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:51,760
Okay. So for a natural infection, those were about the same.

1022
01:42:52,180 --> 01:42:55,900
So that tells you that most of the antibody made by those animals was neutralizing.

1023
01:42:56,710 --> 01:43:01,330
But in our animals we made a bunch of antibody, maybe not as much as the natural infection,

1024
01:43:01,330 --> 01:43:05,020
but we made a bunch of antibody, but the fraction of it that was neutralizing was lower.

1025
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:09,250
So this is another like, oh, maybe we're not hitting the right target.

1026
01:43:09,610 --> 01:43:13,690
We're not getting a strong enough effective or neutralizing antibody response.

1027
01:43:14,380 --> 01:43:14,790
Okay.

1028
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:22,240
So now the piece that's missing is to look at what actually happens in the tissue and then we're going to try to explain why this might have happened.

1029
01:43:22,870 --> 01:43:26,860
Okay. So things aren't looking good for our virus, our vaccine.

1030
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:32,790
So I'm sorry that I told you was respiratory syncytial virus, but so makes it more interesting.

1031
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:33,670
I'd like to reveal,

1032
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:43,779
does anyone know about anything about that virus is actually resurgence of that virus right now the kids it is causes like really bad coughs and kids.

1033
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:51,399
Yes. And elderly. There's actually a little kind of spike in RSV cases right now that they think is probably related.

1034
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:56,000
The fact that everyone's kept their kids indoors for like two years and they're calling it the triple dummy.

1035
01:43:56,410 --> 01:44:01,450
Yeah, flu. And I think that's it from that because yeah,

1036
01:44:02,830 --> 01:44:09,700
but most kids have that infection at some point in their childhood and some kids can be quite severely affected, particularly really young.

1037
01:44:11,390 --> 01:44:16,420
And it has kind of a sordid vaccine history. That is Pennsylvania.

1038
01:44:17,570 --> 01:44:20,810
We think about this pertussis. Yeah. Yeah.

1039
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:27,490
All right. Ready? Now we're watching her for a while. All right, that's it.

1040
01:44:32,090 --> 01:44:37,190
Jennifer, thank you for those questions that are really helpful for the. Yeah, I saw this example.

1041
01:44:38,250 --> 01:44:47,870
Her. You know what?

1042
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:57,200
I think we should be quiet.

1043
01:44:57,950 --> 01:45:10,450
Yeah, I would like to know what it's like if you are really going to explain to anybody at all.

1044
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:17,260
And I only know, unfortunately, maybe Monday night.

1045
01:45:18,190 --> 01:45:24,070
Yeah, I think that was that was all right.

1046
01:45:24,110 --> 01:45:36,020
I mean, that was like, you know, I have you know, that's basically on them.

1047
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:42,170
Yeah. I mean, that's the fun part about in real time, like working in group three.

1048
01:45:42,170 --> 01:45:48,960
Hi statistician all you all have to learn how to talk to each other and the other person thing.

1049
01:45:49,190 --> 01:45:54,049
Well, I was like able to communicate really special to the theory, theory,

1050
01:45:54,050 --> 01:46:02,680
theory and I know your field and to learn how to do that, it's not really self wild, but it's like, well, this.

1051
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:07,530
Yeah, you know it's weird because you saw this and how did you like it?

1052
01:46:07,530 --> 01:46:12,330
Dose response first and then you have to figure out like the legislation over there.

1053
01:46:13,310 --> 01:46:21,940
Exactly. It's like, you know, it's it's been monitored, but it ended up like I think it's actually my right here.

1054
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:26,000
No one knows about me, though, but I don't know.

1055
01:46:26,470 --> 01:46:36,580
It's better, so. Well, yeah, all right. I'm just thinking that they're doing that, and they're my friends these days and it's cool stuff.

1056
01:46:37,070 --> 01:46:43,570
I think it's really important cause if it's like, it's so it's really cool learning all your very horrible attacks.

1057
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:46,819
Yeah, yeah. It's really hard to like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1058
01:46:46,820 --> 01:46:51,710
Without being careful about it, you know, about, like, being exactly right, you know?

1059
01:46:52,580 --> 01:46:52,850
Yeah.

1060
01:46:52,850 --> 01:47:01,100
It's hard because you serious issues like possibility that they're like, oh, partial credit for the possibility, but it's like the answer, right?

1061
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:05,290
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think yeah. In the past looks like.

1062
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:11,150
Yeah, I feel like going through that. Honestly, all we go except for Saturday Night Live for us.

1063
01:47:11,570 --> 01:47:16,610
Yeah, we'll be there. I know you didn't like the U.S. of trying to group.

1064
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:20,780
Yeah but if you look at independently definitely that have that.

1065
01:47:20,780 --> 01:47:27,530
But I know that there are instances where you might want to look at one or both or one or the other and like one of those comparison like

1066
01:47:27,530 --> 01:47:33,390
for us group the kind of more important comparison here because we know the early talking points were before he even vaccinated with me.

1067
01:47:33,580 --> 01:47:38,300
I think there's going to be a difference this time there. And so group is the more important one.

1068
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:46,460
But the individual like if we have one animal that's a super responder and the first time point, it's going to affect that day ten times.

1069
01:47:46,730 --> 01:47:52,990
So we want to know like who is super responder at these things? Do you know that he started at a higher level compared to the other guy?

1070
01:47:53,060 --> 01:48:01,100
Yes, I think it lets you do that. Yeah. But like by little understanding, like, okay, I'm going to go into our I'm going to look up to see, you know,

1071
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:08,120
but then I need to do mixed effects modeling and make sure that I have all the data points that I need and make sure that I'm okay.

1072
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:10,490
My assumption for testing and then I'm going to run it.

1073
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:17,360
Yeah, but, um, but I think it's good to have some understanding of like when you would apply that has been like,

1074
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:26,360
well, yeah, but that can be hard once you mentioned we are are typical people that can teach us.

1075
01:48:26,540 --> 01:48:29,780
Right, but that's why we have people like you.

1076
01:48:32,750 --> 01:48:37,640
Is that what your interest is in? Like, are you okay, you two?

1077
01:48:39,650 --> 01:48:43,520
When I graduated college. Yeah, I know.

1078
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:49,190
I was coming here for both studies, and then I worked for a neurosurgeon over the summer,

1079
01:48:49,670 --> 01:48:54,980
and I figured I want to go to med school, so kind of like you're going to be, like, less valuable.

1080
01:48:57,200 --> 01:49:00,799
No, I don't know how much I'll use it, but I'm.

1081
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:08,150
Well, yeah, if you are. And I mean, you're probably if you're, you're not going to be involved in some sort of clinical research.

1082
01:49:08,150 --> 01:49:13,950
Yeah. And so having that thesis is helpful. You know, just for setting up comparisons adequately.

1083
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:20,459
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Then I did a lot of placenta work awesomely.

1084
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:23,730
That's what I design. Paris on hers.

1085
01:49:24,030 --> 01:49:26,600
Oh, yeah, I know them. Yeah. Oh, that's right.

1086
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:33,830
Over the summer, I worked with a post-doc who she'd been mentoring, needed building bioinformatics research.

1087
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:39,840
But the other thing that she did, she taught me how to teach in the hospital to get the placentas.

1088
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:43,230
And then, um. Oh, my God. Cool.

1089
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:50,309
Like take explains from the ground. Oh, I think we processed Sean Samples because like, some of these samples,

1090
01:49:50,310 --> 01:49:58,800
some of there's a Patrick somebody who was like running down these carotid below samples from upstairs and you're processing in our histo.

1091
01:49:59,010 --> 01:50:03,000
And I know we did like samples that Sean had from something.

1092
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:12,000
Yeah, I know he's done placenta stuff before, but this specifically was for RNA extraction protocols and metabolomics,

1093
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:16,020
which actually we did seven of them over the summer.

1094
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:22,680
And we've been waiting and paging like every single week since then, since August and haven't gotten the placenta until last night.

1095
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:26,939
So I just oh my God, got it last night. And I did the RNA extractor between 616.

1096
01:50:26,940 --> 01:50:29,999
And so this class. Oh, my God. Yeah.

1097
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:37,450
So we got it last Sunday. There was a boy. Just I mean, it's really cool when you can do something that's sort of directly related to like even,

1098
01:50:37,890 --> 01:50:41,670
I don't know, you have your class work and then you can actually see like how things apply.

1099
01:50:41,700 --> 01:50:45,240
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that would be a really good background.

1100
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:56,520
I mean, I think it's pretty kind of shockingly rare how few people have any real statistics involved.

1101
01:50:56,970 --> 01:51:04,230
I mean, it sounds toxic, but like as far as position, certainly veterinarians or even some biomedical scientists.

1102
01:51:04,330 --> 01:51:10,530
Yeah, I don't I mean, I think there are definitely points that would you should have a statistician involved.

1103
01:51:10,530 --> 01:51:16,770
And I read some points pretty quickly. But like I think that everybody can have a basic understanding of like what a T test is.

1104
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:20,400
Yeah. And you know, I mean, you can do that. Yeah.

1105
01:51:21,030 --> 01:51:28,049
So like, yeah, I remember going to Matthew during my residency and oh, so much on their data and like well we don't know the stats.

1106
01:51:28,050 --> 01:51:34,560
Yeah. Because we sent them to the statistics club from t to like protest.

1107
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:40,200
I mean I didn't want to say anything like that school like you can do that.

1108
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:44,790
Yeah. And I also think it helps, you know, like even exactly if anyone could do that.

1109
01:51:45,090 --> 01:51:53,640
But I also think it helps you, even if you do involve a statistician like you can understand what they're trying to do.

1110
01:51:53,700 --> 01:51:56,339
Like, yeah, let them do their expertise.

1111
01:51:56,340 --> 01:52:02,010
But like, when you're presenting the results, you can't be like, well, that's it's just like, just like a pathology.

1112
01:52:02,010 --> 01:52:09,180
Like if the pathologist reads your data but they can't and they scored something or whatever and they can't explain to you,

1113
01:52:09,210 --> 01:52:12,690
this is why I scored them in this way. That's not really useful.

1114
01:52:12,690 --> 01:52:18,810
If you have even if you're not the pathologist, you have to understand what are the criteria that that person is using to make these assessments?

1115
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:23,010
Yeah, because like it's your data, you can't be like this that.

1116
01:52:23,240 --> 01:52:29,310
Yeah. You're saying about like, oh, there's not much that you know about stats.

1117
01:52:29,340 --> 01:52:36,690
Yeah. For most people I thought I knew about statistics until I got here because I did bio in college.

1118
01:52:36,780 --> 01:52:43,439
Yeah, that's what I majored in. And then I got here and it's like there's a whole new world of like how all of

1119
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:47,879
this is derived that we need to take a biostatistics and one and six or two.

1120
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:52,870
It's like the whole theory of like, Oh my, how all this stuff is derived and like doing it by hand.

1121
01:52:52,950 --> 01:53:00,960
No calculators, little thing. Um, and like, I, I had no idea that it was not you, but it it is.

1122
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:09,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, that's probably the downside to having, like, all these easily accessible programs because if, you know,

1123
01:53:09,450 --> 01:53:16,880
like you can't apply statistics incorrectly to a lot of data like for this kind of dissected,

1124
01:53:16,890 --> 01:53:22,890
but like it's hard to like show to give dummy data and then have people analyze it.

1125
01:53:22,890 --> 01:53:28,469
But like if we apply repeated measures, they go back to those markers even though like we have full data set, we could do that.

1126
01:53:28,470 --> 01:53:33,930
It wouldn't be a problem. Yeah, but like if we applied it to that data, 7 to 10 would be the best way to do it.

1127
01:53:34,230 --> 01:53:34,500
Right.

1128
01:53:34,530 --> 01:53:42,090
So, um, but like, I can totally see where you would just go to Graphpad and wouldn't even know that those their bones were missing unless you could.

1129
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:47,790
Yeah. Yeah. So I feel like a lot of people don't always know what degrees of freedom are either.

1130
01:53:47,790 --> 01:53:50,910
Yeah. So that helps out.

1131
01:53:51,330 --> 01:53:52,830
But I mean, I don't know.

1132
01:53:52,830 --> 01:53:59,440
I mean, I guess that's the downside of like having easily accessible programs that you can punch in a lot of numbers and get a result that yeah,

1133
01:54:00,660 --> 01:54:07,340
it's also good that we have easily accessible tools. You don't have to sit there or something to try to figure it out.

1134
01:54:07,350 --> 01:54:10,540
But yeah, but yeah, that was really cool. That thing for, um. Yeah.

1135
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:15,690
Providing a guest lecturer or just a subject expert.

1136
01:54:16,200 --> 02:07:27,100
All right, have a good weekend. Do something, you. That.

1137
02:07:38,710 --> 02:07:43,850
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1138
02:07:50,530 --> 02:07:58,180
I a lot of they are. Yeah. Yes, I know.

1139
02:07:59,650 --> 02:11:45,460
All. And.

1140
02:26:32,000 --> 02:27:32,180
Really? There's nothing else, really.

1141
02:27:32,260 --> 02:27:38,209
The stuff that. 31.

1142
02:27:38,210 --> 02:27:41,480
And then today I can smell the oak.

1143
02:27:41,990 --> 02:27:45,650
Yeah, we had a little bit of leeway behind that.

1144
02:27:45,950 --> 02:27:49,460
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I'll be there.

1145
02:32:04,870 --> 02:32:50,830
I. Yeah.

1146
02:32:58,650 --> 02:33:27,780
And later. Correspondent.

1147
02:35:33,390 --> 02:40:19,170
Yeah. No, that's right.

1148
02:40:19,540 --> 02:42:05,980
You know that. Yeah, that.

1149
02:42:13,920 --> 02:42:19,290
And I think that that.

1150
02:51:51,520 --> 02:54:01,670
Oh. Yeah.

1151
02:57:40,710 --> 02:57:45,980
No one has ever. Yeah.
