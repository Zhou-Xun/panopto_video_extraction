00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:06,181
Hello, today we're going to talk about allele and genotype frequencies.

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,511
Learning objectives include calculating allele frequencies,

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,771
genotype frequencies and carrier frequencies.

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,932
To calculate allele frequency, we're going to think about the prevalence of

5
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:23,610
a particular allele in a given population.

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,404
So really, allele frequency is pretty easy, it's just the number of

7
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:32,729
alleles of a certain type, over 2 times the number of people.

8
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,648
Because each person carries two copies of each allele one that they inherited from

9
00:00:37,648 --> 00:00:40,871
their mom and one that they inherited from their dad.

10
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,053
So for example here's a population of 10 people.

11
00:00:46,053 --> 00:00:49,935
We're showing for example their chromosome 1 and

12
00:00:49,935 --> 00:00:53,470
on chromosome 1 there's a particular snip.

13
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,567
The snip can either have the C allele or the A allele.

14
00:00:57,567 --> 00:01:01,740
Here this first person we're showing their two chromosomes

15
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,490
has a allele on both copies that they inherited from their parents.

16
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:12,050
This next person, has an A from one parent and a C from another parent.

17
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,960
This third person has an A from each parent.

18
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,817
This person has genotype CC at that snip.

19
00:01:17,817 --> 00:01:20,050
This person has genotype AC.

20
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,578
This person has genotype AA.

21
00:01:22,578 --> 00:01:29,210
So if you know people's genotypes, you can calculate the allele frequencies.

22
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,710
Here, we've got the frequency of the C allele.

23
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,973
There are 11 Cs in this population and there are 20 total allele,

24
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:41,930
because there are 2 times 10 people.

25
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,440
So the frequency of the C allele is 11 over 24 or 0.55.

26
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:52,600
And the frequency of the A allele is 9 over 20 or 0.45.

27
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,948
Since A and C are the only possible alleles in the population,

28
00:01:56,948 --> 00:01:59,549
their frequencies should sum to 1.

29
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,790
You can calculate allele frequency using the gene counting method as well.

30
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:12,955
So here, I'm illustrating how we would do that using genotype data for

31
00:02:12,955 --> 00:02:15,650
a snip that has two alleles.

32
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:21,618
So then, let's say we have 1000 individuals that are genotype for

33
00:02:21,618 --> 00:02:23,712
a particular mutation.

34
00:02:23,712 --> 00:02:27,967
So there's a deletion in a gene called CCR5

35
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:32,350
that's associated with resistance to HIV.

36
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,340
And let's say that that deletion we're gonna call small a.

37
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,786
Whereas not having the deletion will call that big A,

38
00:02:39,786 --> 00:02:43,011
this is our sort of fictional form of allele here.

39
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:50,642
So here it was found that 795 people had genotype big A big A.

40
00:02:50,642 --> 00:02:56,195
190 had genotype big A small a, so they had one copy of the CCR5 deletion and

41
00:02:56,195 --> 00:02:59,670
one chromosome that did not have that deletion.

42
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,271
And 15 had 2 copies of the deletion and they were small a small a.

43
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:10,500
So we've got the number of people with each of these three genotypes here.

44
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,363
The number of big A alleles that each of these homozygous big A people carry

45
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:18,030
are gonna be 2, cuz they each carry 2,

46
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,492
times the number of people that have that genotype.

47
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:26,294
The number of big A alleles from these heterozygous big A small a people is

48
00:03:26,294 --> 00:03:29,061
going to be 1 times the number of people.

49
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,365
And homozygous small a small a people carry none of the big alleles,

50
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:35,960
the big alleles.

51
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,390
You can do the same for the small a alleles.

52
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,090
So here we've got 1000 people,

53
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,640
we've got 1780 big A alleles and 220 small a alleles.

54
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:51,714
So the allele frequency of big A is 1780 over 2 times the number of people or

55
00:03:51,714 --> 00:03:54,220
2000, which is 0.89.

56
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,370
And the frequency of small a is 0.11.

57
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,940
And again, since there's only two options, these two numbers should sum to 1.

58
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,860
We can also use another method to calculate allele frequency,

59
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,510
called the recessive phenotype method.

60
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,304
But this method has a lot of assumptions and

61
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:17,500
can only be used in really specific situations.

62
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,340
When we talk about the word phenotype, that is how geneticists refer to

63
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,070
any kind of trait or characteristic that a person has.

64
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,414
So when we say genotype, we're talking about the genetics and

65
00:04:29,414 --> 00:04:32,340
when we say phenotype, we're talking about a trait.

66
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,941
So here let's say that we have in green this phenotype

67
00:04:37,941 --> 00:04:42,810
that is sort of most common in the population.

68
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,480
And gray represents a phenotype that's not very common in the population.

69
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,382
We also have to assume to use this method,

70
00:04:51,382 --> 00:04:57,068
that everybody who has 2 copies of the least common allele,

71
00:04:57,068 --> 00:05:03,783
the small a small a genotype, will always exhibit the gray phenotype.

72
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:09,960
And if you carry at least one copy of a big a allele, so you can be big A big A or

73
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,980
big A small a in your genotype, you will always have the green phenotype.

74
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:22,264
What this does is it allows us to look at the green or gray phenotype in

75
00:05:22,264 --> 00:05:27,480
the population and we can tell the genotype of people who are gray.

76
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,428
So everyone who exhibits this particular gray phenotype has a small a small

77
00:05:32,428 --> 00:05:33,820
a genotype.

78
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,470
So 2 people in this population have a small a small a genotype.

79
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,629
And we know because everybody who's small a small is gray.

80
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:45,864
All these green people do not have a small a small a genotype,

81
00:05:45,864 --> 00:05:49,540
they might be big A big A or they might be big A small a.

82
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,610
So 2 out of 10 people have the recessive phenotype.

83
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,514
We infer that they can have the small a small a genotype.

84
00:05:57,514 --> 00:06:02,803
Making the assumption that the population is in hardy Weinberg equilibrium

85
00:06:02,803 --> 00:06:07,200
which we'll talk about later, we can use the following math.

86
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,264
So the relative frequency of the small a small a genotype is 2 out of 10,

87
00:06:12,264 --> 00:06:15,570
cuz 2 out of people have it or 0.2.

88
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,238
If we take the square root of that,

89
00:06:18,238 --> 00:06:22,851
we get the allele frequency of small a, which is 0.45.

90
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:27,786
Because there's only two options the small a or the big A,

91
00:06:27,786 --> 00:06:32,333
as the alleles at this particular site in the genome.

92
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:37,357
We know that if the small allele is 0.45 in frequency,

93
00:06:37,357 --> 00:06:41,262
the big A allele is 1 minus that or 0.55.

94
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,331
How do we talk about allele frequency?

95
00:06:49,331 --> 00:06:50,820
How do we annotate that?

96
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,860
We can annotate that in a lot of different ways.

97
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,323
We've talked about sort of the big A and small a.

98
00:06:57,323 --> 00:07:01,290
We can talk about allele frequency is the probability.

99
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:06,251
So the allele frequency of big a in the population we can kind of annotate

100
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:10,290
it like this with a capital P, the probability of big a.

101
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,080
0.89.

102
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,557
The allele frequency of small in the population for

103
00:07:15,557 --> 00:07:21,560
example is probability Smalley annotated this way is 0.11.

104
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,540
The probabilities of big a.

105
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,540
And small a.

106
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,031
Will of course sum to one.

107
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,630
We can also talk about a little frequency as P's and Q's.

108
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,430
You might have seen this before.

109
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:40,080
So sometimes we write the dominant allele or the more common allele as P.

110
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,700
And the recessive or least common allele as Q.

111
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,690
And P plus Q of course is going to equal one.

112
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,571
And if we have three alleles we might say P plus Q plus R equals one.

113
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,717
This will become important when we start talking about the math of hardy Weinberg

114
00:07:57,717 --> 00:07:58,471
equilibrium.

115
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:06,320
So a leo frequency is I want you to know can mirror ethno geography.

116
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,621
So for example there is a disease called sickle cell anemia

117
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:16,596
which if you have two copies of the sickle cell mutation

118
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:21,572
will cause your red blood cells to sort of crinkle up and

119
00:08:21,572 --> 00:08:26,330
make a sickle shape and it can cause a lot of different

120
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:32,950
complications including blood clots and other issues.

121
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,890
The frequency of the sickle cell mutation

122
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,679
actually mimics the incidence of malaria in africa.

123
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,729
And the reason why is because if you have two copies of the sickle

124
00:08:44,729 --> 00:08:49,017
cell mutation, then you have sickle cell disease and

125
00:08:49,017 --> 00:08:54,000
your fitness and your ability to reproduce is is lessened.

126
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,356
So in general without any other sort of effects from the environment,

127
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:07,150
you would expect the little frequency of the sickle cell mutation to go down.

128
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:11,188
But if you have one copy of the sickle cell mutation and

129
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:14,071
one chromosome that does not have it.

130
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:17,625
So your hetero CGs for the sickle cell mutation,

131
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:23,190
you won't get sickle cell anemia but you will be more resistant to malaria.

132
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,205
Which is another which is a disease that can that's transmitted

133
00:09:28,205 --> 00:09:33,060
by mosquitoes in africa that can kill that can also kill people.

134
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,618
So people who have no copies of the sickle cell mutation

135
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,310
are less resistant to malaria.

136
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:45,883
And so what you have is this balancing selection where you've got

137
00:09:45,883 --> 00:09:51,390
people who carry two copies of the mutation are at a disadvantage.

138
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:56,129
People who carry no copies are at a disadvantage due to increase increase

139
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,090
susceptibility to malaria.

140
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:02,280
And so those who are hetero actually have the advantage here.

141
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:07,409
And so you can look at the sickle cell mutation,

142
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:12,417
a little frequency and its highest in these areas

143
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:17,441
that are also that are also have more malaria.

144
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,320
Another frequency that we need to talk about is genotype frequency.

145
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,080
So just like a little frequency is the prevalence of an allele in the population.

146
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,530
The genotype frequency is the prevalence of a particular genotype in a population.

147
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:41,401
So here each individual has gina types at this particular snip.

148
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:42,421
So we've got the CC.

149
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:43,551
Genotype, the A.

150
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:47,030
C. Genotype, the aa genotype.

151
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,821
We've got two people who have the A.

152
00:10:48,821 --> 00:10:49,720
A. Genotype.

153
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,000
So that frequency is 20%.

154
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,171
Or the probability of having the A.

155
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:57,560
A genotype is 0.2.

156
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,201
The A. C.

157
00:10:58,201 --> 00:10:58,791
Genotype.

158
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,740
The frequency is 50%.

159
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,586
Or the probability if you select a random person from this population,

160
00:11:05,586 --> 00:11:07,261
the probability that their A.

161
00:11:07,261 --> 00:11:07,880
C.

162
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,131
Is 500.5.

163
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,680
And finally we want to talk about carrier frequency.

164
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,793
So this is the prevalence of the genotype that has one

165
00:11:18,793 --> 00:11:21,790
copy of an allele that causes recessive disease.

166
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,890
So for example if we're talking about sickle cell anemia,

167
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:30,401
the carrier frequency would be the frequency of hetero zygotes.

168
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,450
Here, let's say that the big a big a genotype is the recessive allele.

169
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,271
And the genotype frequency of that is 1%.

170
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:45,111
Let's say that everybody who has two copies of of of the A.

171
00:11:45,111 --> 00:11:47,430
Allele gets the disease.

172
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,321
These people who are hetero hetero Z.

173
00:11:50,321 --> 00:11:52,321
Is only have one copy of the A.

174
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:53,080
O. L.

175
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,761
And they won't get the recessive disease but they will be carrying that.

176
00:11:57,761 --> 00:12:00,780
Alil on one copy of their chromosomes.

177
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,720
And that means they'll be able to transmit that a little to their Children.

178
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,791
So we call this group the hetero cigarettes

179
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,970
carriers of the recessive disease allele.

180
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:15,800
They don't have the disease, but they can pass it on to the next generation here.

181
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,741
The carrier frequency is 18% or 0.18.
