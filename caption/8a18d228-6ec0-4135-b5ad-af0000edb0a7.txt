1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:09,660
Yeah. And, you know, they just don't have anything, right?

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,140
I don't know. I wrote my letter.

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,200
Hi. How you doing? Sounds like us.

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:35,070
Yeah. Just like everyone just was trying to take their kids in the morning.

5
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,680
So that's probably the. The last class you guys will attend before leaving.

6
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,550
Before the break. Almost. You know, one more time.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,220
Yeah. What is that?

8
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,320
Announcements that I wanted to make this morning has to do with perusal.

9
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,460
So I set everything up, and then I think when I was cut, see,

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,480
the way the way they set up my perusal through canvas is that I have to duplicate everything.

11
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:18,780
So I have to set it up in canvas and then I have to set it up in perusal and I collect copy by mistake and that messed everything up.

12
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:26,640
So if you didn't get all of your points from the perusal assignment, send me an email.

13
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:36,180
It's not do tell that are ones that you have to I the deadline so if you didn't get all your points send me an email because of that and that's fine.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,940
It was my fault. Okay. Today we're going to talk about, um, before we talk about lifestyle modification.

15
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,920
He's got two separate lectures for his last bit of things.

16
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:01,140
Obstructive sleep apnea and osteoarthritis. But before we talk about that, let's talk about the quiz number ten.

17
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,380
So the first question is about apples.

18
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,299
And so the question is do a liver biopsy.

19
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:21,570
And that reveals the presence of the site ballooning, an inflammatory infiltrate and a few areas of college and deposition.

20
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:30,740
And there's also a blood test and you have serum DNA and they're elevated above normal.

21
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:39,410
In this particular case, this description probably indicated which of the following conditions an average of 70 occurrences.

22
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,300
Nash had cirrhosis and had a cellular carcinoma.

23
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:52,190
The key difference here was the other ballooning, and there's ballooning which would occur in the set of the it tells us.

24
00:02:53,630 --> 00:03:02,630
But the key difference here is that there's inflammatory cell infiltrate and areas of deposition.

25
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,790
So that's what distinguishes Nash from the other physicians here.

26
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:15,860
Then we have the question that go to the next question.

27
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:21,590
Number two, is that a positive absence associated with an increase in insulin?

28
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,030
How would elevated insulin affect capacity with this simulation?

29
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:37,190
So the choices here were that it would increase the expression of the sterile response and I'm quoting in the noble look Genesis,

30
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:42,710
which was the correct answer. And there's a little bit wrong with each of the other answers.

31
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:49,310
It would increase HDL activity and reduce hepatic lipid acquisition.

32
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,469
Well, actually, insulin inhibits HDL activity.

33
00:03:54,470 --> 00:04:03,110
So that's why that's wrong. It would enhance beta oxidation and reduce hepatic fatty acid levels.

34
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:09,860
So actually, insulin does not enhance beta oxidation.

35
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,480
And that's why that one is wrong.

36
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:24,499
And the next answer is it would increase very low density lipoprotein mediated lipid export and reduce hepatic triglycerides.

37
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,120
So that's not true and actually has the opposite effect on the LDL.

38
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,880
We need a little bit extra for this.

39
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,130
So the next one is the one that some of you got wrong.

40
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:48,949
Let's go over the answers here. So this one has to do with we're talking about cardiovascular disease that's about a positive special in the visceral

41
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:56,270
intravascular compartments contributes to the development of vascular sclerosis by which of the following mechanisms.

42
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,060
Many of you chose this as an answer for a few of you, I should say.

43
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:09,200
Some of these are constriction induced by increased expression, and that's the earlier nitric oxide synthase are in us.

44
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:19,240
So the reason why this is not the correct answer is nitric oxide is a vasodilator in us

45
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:27,410
is one of the enzymes that converts reactive oxygen species to nitric oxide vasodilator.

46
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:39,950
So it actually would not be the answer because of that indexation of vascular smooth muscle via the renin angiotensin aldosterone system.

47
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,510
Well, it has actually the opposite effect.

48
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:58,190
The correct answer is oxidation of the LDL cholesterol and both the monocytes and the cells interactions we've been given.

49
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:06,320
The opposite reaction will be increased. Any questions about the quiz itself?

50
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,520
This is there's been ten quizzes, there's three more.

51
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:17,720
And you get your final score and your quizzes will be based on your best ten scores.

52
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,130
So there'll be a quiz this week on what we talk about. Okay.

53
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,590
All right. Same same guidelines. I'll drop on Friday and I'll be due on Monday morning.

54
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:38,560
Any questions about this before we go on? Yeah, I don't know if anyone else has had this issue, but my quiz seven hasn't been posted,

55
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:44,820
so I don't know if that was just like mine got skipped or if and know I'll go back and look at that.

56
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,690
You know, that reminds me that I should go back and see what the issue was there.

57
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,760
There was there was one quiz for one person where it would not let me post to graded.

58
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,430
I don't understand why. So it was probably it was mine. Okay.

59
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:09,510
So thank you. So what do I want you to get out of today's lecture?

60
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:18,270
So I'll be able to describe the characteristics, etiology and diagnostic criteria for these two different conditions.

61
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,980
Obstructive or osteoarthritis. Obstructive sleep apnea.

62
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:32,460
Identify the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and describe the management of both of these conditions.

63
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:44,640
So there there was a lot of thinking that went along with this, and they gave you more information than you ever wanted to know about these two.

64
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,310
But they're very common, and that's something you should be aware of.

65
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,450
So I'm going to first talk about obstructive sleep apnea.

66
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,630
So it is a condition in which.

67
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:13,560
There is a repeated collapsing of the airway and this occurs during sleep and it leads to intermittent hypoxia,

68
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:21,840
where your actual saturation of oxygen hemoglobin declines by about at least 3%.

69
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,050
So this is a pattern that repeats itself during sleep.

70
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:35,760
To overcome this. There is this increase in respiratory effort.

71
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:48,300
So in the sleep study, you would see an increased muscular contraction within the abdominal region and within the cell racks.

72
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,570
And this can cause an arousal to overcome this occlusion of the airway.

73
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,600
So there's this recurrent arousal and the consequences are significant.

74
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:08,639
You experience excessive daytime sleepiness and this causes attentiveness.

75
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:16,860
This impairs performance and students and people who have rap careers.

76
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,610
And in particular, it's a problem when you're driving.

77
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:28,110
So people with this excessive daytime sleepiness have a greater risk of getting car accidents.

78
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:37,260
And this is this is very common. So this is a serious condition for this reason and many others as well, we talked about.

79
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:47,020
So if you don't get a good night's sleep, you experience tiredness and fatigue throughout the day.

80
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:55,390
And this has a significantly negative impact in your quality of life when you're trying to work or study.

81
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:03,510
And it diminishes your desire to engage in other types of healthy behaviors like physical activity.

82
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,060
If you're tired all the time, you're less likely to engage in that kind of activity.

83
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:18,060
So another consequence of this airway closure when you're trying to sleep is you wake up gasping and coughing and choking.

84
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:25,680
And this causes this arousal. And this is another thing that can be disconcerting for people with conditions

85
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:32,400
like snoring would occur when there's some partial closure of the airway.

86
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,230
And this can disrupt your sleep, it can disrupt your partner's sleep as well.

87
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,230
And most of the time, if you have snoring, you don't realize it.

88
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:46,560
The person who is back with you will realize this.

89
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:53,030
And a lot of the diagnosis of this condition might depend on your partner,

90
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:59,820
whether or not they have observed you waking up, gasping and coughing and choking, and whether or not you snore.

91
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:10,820
And this constant condition in which you have this intermittent hypoxia has serious consequences.

92
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:16,220
It is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease and hypertension.

93
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,510
And it's associated with an increased risk of death.

94
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:28,010
So this is a serious condition. So what is the heart?

95
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:36,290
So this is a condition in which the airflow is restricted by at least 90%.

96
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,900
So this condition, that usually happens when people are lying on their back.

97
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:52,159
You have this reduction in airflow by 40% and it's associated with persistent respiratory movement.

98
00:11:52,160 --> 00:12:03,050
So there's this contraction of muscles that affect expiration, that try to overcome this pressure and it's enough to wake you up.

99
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:12,290
And there are episodes in which you might not have a complete closure or near complete closure, but you have a partial closure.

100
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,160
So this is about more than a 30% closure of the airway.

101
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:26,600
The other thing that occurs I should probably have split this out from this particular outline is that oxygen saturation occurs.

102
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:35,300
So this intermittent hypoxia is so significant that it affects the transport of oxygen in your blood.

103
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:47,020
And throughout the evening, when you're trying to sleep, you experience these micro arousal where you're awakened.

104
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,250
So these events occur throughout the night.

105
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,500
They're brief and they're transient, but they prevent you from getting a restful sleep.

106
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:11,290
So this is a diagram that shows you the airway and things that can contribute to collapsing of the airways.

107
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:20,709
So you have two different examples here. You have a normal anatomy and the typical anatomical changes that occur with somebody with sleep apnea,

108
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:25,600
and they're more pronounced when somebody is lying on their back as opposed to lying on their side.

109
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:36,400
So you have here's here's the trachea here shown in this orangish color to the first sample here.

110
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,290
And here you have the airway. Here's the tongue.

111
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:50,530
Here's the mouth. And the air would be fired through the nose, through the oral pharynx, and then through your mouth.

112
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:59,500
So here's the hyoid bone. And notice that the airway is open here in this particular normal anatomy.

113
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,950
It's somebody who is more prone to have sleep apnea.

114
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:10,760
There's some there could be some structural abnormalities just related to their anatomy or over time,

115
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:16,070
if they accumulate adipose tissue around their neck.

116
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:22,160
And this would be more common in people who have more of the male pattern of adipose tissue deposition.

117
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:28,940
You would see more adipose tissue around the neck, and this can contribute to collapse of the airway.

118
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:37,759
So here's an impingement here shown here, and then it shows you some anatomical differences with the hyoid bone,

119
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,450
number three and the position of the jaw.

120
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:51,050
And you also would find in people who have who are more prone to obstructive sleep apnea, to have a thicker tongue.

121
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:58,640
And this can restrict the passage of air out of the out of the individual.

122
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:09,140
So these anatomical differences, even even somebody who is lean and has a normal level of adiposity around their neck,

123
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,780
might experience sleep apnea as a consequence of having this different anatomical structures.

124
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:25,880
So the if you have this particular architecture, it can make you more prone to this condition.

125
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:35,360
So. So, yeah. So in the pictures that you showed, are those.

126
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,910
So those are difference. Not not changes from one situation to another.

127
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,980
A difference is you most commonly see people that already have obstructive sleep.

128
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:54,950
Is that right? You can have a structural difference short here that if somebody just this is just their architecture,

129
00:15:54,950 --> 00:16:04,960
they're going to be more prone to their condition. Now, notice how the air is open a little bit when they lie down or there are other influences.

130
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,130
This impinges the airway further.

131
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:15,530
So you can have the anatomical differences when you add the other things, increase out of hospital on your back and so on.

132
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:22,600
It can further close down the airway. So these are anatomical risk factors in developing.

133
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:35,410
Yes. Yeah. So epidemiology is based on this age tie index.

134
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,170
This is the apnea hypothesis index.

135
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:45,970
It has to do with the number of these events that occur during this particular time period, and that's how the diagnosis is made.

136
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,760
So the prevalence based on HIV is increasing.

137
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:59,330
This would be a more moderate form, more than 15 events per hour of sleep.

138
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,210
So that's what's increasing.

139
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:12,550
But if you look at the prevalence and you set this HDI level at more than five per hour, we're talking about 14% of the general population.

140
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:19,460
The incidence and prevalence, I should say children is much lower, but it does occur to children as well.

141
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,430
About 1 to 2%.

142
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:36,800
It increases with age and the increase with age would be associated with things that affect the tone of the smooth muscle around the airway,

143
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:41,720
which we'll talk about what act and a subsequent slide.

144
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:56,120
And then the soft palate as you age recedes, perhaps less innovation is less rigid and it can can contribute to closure of the airway as well.

145
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:04,010
More common in men, probably due to the structure,

146
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:14,040
made it a little bit different and the propensity to commit age increase adipose tissue accumulation of the waist and around the neck.

147
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:21,810
And then, yeah, weight gains are strongly associated with obstructive sleep apnea.

148
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:29,280
So 70% of people who have OSA also have a BMI, 30 and over.

149
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:39,920
So yeah, it's maybe a little off topic, but the difference in the hired bond between men and women is that is that anatomically different,

150
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,430
the lower that contributes to the hyoid bone itself?

151
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,849
I know that the hired by makes a difference or that that's a use as a marker for structural differences within that area.

152
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:57,500
But whether or not that is different between men and women and that contributes to greater OSA in men than women, I don't know.

153
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:09,200
So how do we know this in terms of who's figured out that you increase adiposity, that increases the risk?

154
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:17,900
Well, there is some evidence that indicates this, and it's based on this Wisconsin sleep cohort.

155
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:26,810
So University of Wisconsin has this sleep cohort, a group of individuals they've been following for a very long period of time.

156
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:34,610
And this is kind of one of the Centers for sleep science investigator.

157
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:41,750
A friend of mine is actually there, and she does this assessment of sort of sleep apnea.

158
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:49,640
So the Wisconsin sleep cohort is a longitudinal study and it's still going on.

159
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:57,140
And they are looking at the causes and consequences of natural history, of sleep disorders.

160
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:07,880
So they follow these individuals. They they assess different components of things that are known to cause obstructive sleep apnea.

161
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:13,700
And they're looking at the quality of sleep, a longitudinal survey.

162
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,970
In addition to this information, there is the sleepyhead study.

163
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:27,670
The Sleepyhead study is kind of a a subgroup of a look ahead study.

164
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:36,280
To look ahead study was an intervention action of health and diabetes, which was a lifestyle modification.

165
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:46,180
And they followed the people who had diabetes or how that lifestyle modification affected their their diabetes incidence, their longevity and so on.

166
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:53,260
Well, a subgroup of that study was evaluated for their their sleep quality as well.

167
00:20:55,270 --> 00:21:02,890
So these are longitudinal studies and they're looking at changes in weight,

168
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:10,270
whether weight loss or weight gain, to see whether or not that had an effect on sleep disordered breathing.

169
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:19,630
So at the time of publication, this is the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2000.

170
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:27,340
They didn't know if there was concrete evidence about this change in weight and sleep disorder.

171
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,540
So this is a longitudinal study of moderately change,

172
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:47,110
and to do so is actually managing risk associated with sleep in some of the largest study conducted to look at this association.

173
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:57,460
So the objective here was to measure independent longitudinal association between weight change and change in sleep disorder breathing.

174
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:12,070
And this was a prospective study conducted between July of 1989 and January 2000 and had almost 700 participants.

175
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:22,600
And these were people employed in Wisconsin under about 46 years of age, 55, 56% of them were men.

176
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,880
And they were valid valuated twice at four year intervals for sleep disorder.

177
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:28,220
Three.

178
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:40,740
The main outcome here was the percentage in apnea hypertension index or the HHI and odds of developing moderate to severe sleep disorder breathing.

179
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:46,410
In this case, they're looking at more than 15 hours.

180
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,990
With respect to change in weight and hair stuff, the baseline condition of these individuals.

181
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:01,200
So here's to the individuals who were invited at baseline here serving age.

182
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:05,000
Here's the follow up, participant's baseline and follow up.

183
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:11,800
And you can see if four years later, 46 years of age to 50.

184
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,810
The value in parentheses is the standard deviation.

185
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,400
Most of these were men, 385 men.

186
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,450
This is the number of events per hour.

187
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:37,100
And then they're looking at the percent of individuals who had this events less than five, five, 15 and more than 15.

188
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:42,920
And then they looked at their their weight change and kilograms.

189
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:50,120
And in general, this population, we see a three kg increase in body weight.

190
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,210
They also look at it and a little bit as well.

191
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,890
So they're starting out at a BMI of 29 and increased to 30.

192
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:09,860
The next birth here was the same 38 centimeters that reached girth.

193
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:16,910
Waist to the growth of the hip to two ways to earth to hip ratio was the same the point nine.

194
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:24,709
But they also made this measurement that was usually calculate percent body fat.

195
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:30,290
But in this case they give you values in terms of the skin fold total.

196
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:35,360
So this is a skin fold measurement, 81 to 81,

197
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:45,320
106 is an increase indicating that the increase in their body weight was probably due to an increase in adiposity.

198
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:53,510
The number of hypertensive hypertensive percent went up significantly about

199
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:59,240
the same number of smokers and this the same amount of alcohol consumption.

200
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:09,190
So when they did a four year follow up, they looked at the change in weight and then estimated 2% change in age.

201
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:17,850
And they saw that in individuals who this is a percent change in weight versus no change.

202
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,840
So that was a control. The no change was the control.

203
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:33,750
So individuals who lost a fair amount of weight had a lower percent of those who had gained this percentage of weight, five, ten and 20%.

204
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:44,940
There was an increase in. And when they express this data with this figure, this is kind of what it shows.

205
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,520
So this is the main change in H. II events per hour.

206
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,630
And all the access. Access, you have a change in bodyweight.

207
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:00,810
So we're having minus ten, -20 fewer events.

208
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:09,990
And as we go up, that's been five to a greater than five or less than 5%.

209
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:16,589
This is up a little bit from 5% to 10% and then 10 to 20%.

210
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:21,450
We're seeing this increase in apnea, hypoxia index.

211
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:33,200
So the results it was that the 10% weight gain predicted a 32% increase in the HIV and

212
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:41,560
those individuals who lost weight for weight loss predicted a 20% decrease in HIV.

213
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:48,080
And so they concluded that their data indicated that clinical and public health programs that

214
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:54,850
result in even a modest weight control are likely to be effective in managing sleep disorder,

215
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,340
breathing and reducing new occurrence of sleep disordered breathing.

216
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:09,110
So this was the evidence now that has been referred to in terms of how weight change affects this endpoint.

217
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,400
Okay. So what are the mechanisms?

218
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:25,670
Well, I talked a bit about the upper airway closure, and this occurs during sleep, particularly when you're lying on your back and the pharynx itself.

219
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:36,290
It's the tissue that collapses. It's a smooth muscle. And then you have tissues surrounding the pharynx that can affect that, the airway opening.

220
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:43,160
It's multifactorial. It's there's a number of things that I'll go through that affect this.

221
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:51,080
The patency of the airway. Yeah, there are anatomical and functional alterations that we've discussed in terms of the structure.

222
00:27:51,540 --> 00:28:01,850
But if you have an increase in that capacity around this airway, it can cause a limitation or decrease the diameter of the upper airway.

223
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:10,760
We already talked about the maxillofacial structural changes that can occur, and I mentioned what happens with age.

224
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:21,629
So, um, this increase, differential collapse or the likelihood that it'll collapse and then you have this other

225
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:31,440
issue with innovation of these tissues with muscle now and with people who have a higher,

226
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:40,920
higher defense, HIV. There are issues surrounding the innovation of the tissue that maintenance maintains the patency of the opening of the airway.

227
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:47,820
And as you say, when you sleep, the innovation declines a bit.

228
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:57,150
And if there's less innovation, you have a greater tendency for that airway to collapse and cause this airway blockage.

229
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:07,410
So as you sleep, the reflex is less prominent and it has a tendency to collapse.

230
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:15,270
And this is a figure showing you what happens if you have increased adiposity.

231
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:23,760
So here's an individual lying on their back and here's the structural occlusion here in the upper airway.

232
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:31,470
So you can have an increased amount of adipose tissue deposited around the neck that can contribute to this condition.

233
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:38,700
You also have a fluid shift that would occur that can affect this as well.

234
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:45,690
So here's an individual. This is probably a male or you have greater visceral, adipose tissue.

235
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:54,510
And when this person lies down on their back, there's this shift not only in fluid but in the pressure in the diaphragm.

236
00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:03,480
This reduces the volume of the lung, can expand, also have increased leptin secretion.

237
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:12,180
Now we talk a lot about leptin earlier and leptin is something that can stimulate the sympathetic nervous system.

238
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:24,810
And it's thought that increased leptin from having increased adipose tissue mass, it's been shown to increase the severity of this condition.

239
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:40,180
So this next diagram describes the different forces on the upper airway and how it influences its collapse ability.

240
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,800
So you have active and passive things that affect the diameter of the upper airway.

241
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:58,590
You have chemo sensitivity, central respiratory neurons and wakefulness drive to breathe.

242
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,710
All of these things affect the airway opening.

243
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:06,660
So when you are awake, their responses are active.

244
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:12,299
They decline when you sleep. And at the onset of sleep.

245
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,320
And then in REM sleep, they decline. So this would narrow the airway.

246
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:28,950
When you wake up, when you're conscious, you have an increase in the activity of these neural responses that expands the airway.

247
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:37,090
So all of these these influence the pharyngeal dilator muscle activity here.

248
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:48,610
So these receive mucosal sensory reflexes and input from the vagus nerve.

249
00:31:49,480 --> 00:32:03,970
And then you have passive things that affect the airway, the bony cage, and its position affects the airway diameter, the soft tissue volume.

250
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:09,340
So if you have more soft tissue around here, it can impinge on the airway and close it down.

251
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:15,040
You've got extramural pressure and those that pressure shifts when you lie down.

252
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,220
There are fluid shifts that occur when you lie down.

253
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:22,220
You put more pressure externally on the airway and close it down.

254
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:34,450
You can have a condition perhaps causing mucosal edema that can cause this airway to to have a reduced diameter.

255
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:42,730
And there's the compliance of the pharyngeal walls that can be affected by a number of these factors.

256
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:55,110
So what else happens if you have obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension?

257
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,970
And I'll walk you through this and why this is a contributing factor.

258
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:09,480
Atrial fibrillation and other types of arrhythmias. So you have this continuous wakefulness at night.

259
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,650
You have this increased, sympathetic nervous system drive.

260
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,220
And this can contribute to arrhythmia.

261
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,670
It can influence the progression of heart failure.

262
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:30,750
It can. You often see stroke and transient ischemic attacks occur.

263
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:40,950
People who have obstructive sleep apnea. And this perhaps is due to the oxidative stress that can occur from the intermittent hypoxia.

264
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:52,140
So coronary heart disease could be influenced by having this condition from the intermittent hypoxia, reactive oxygen species.

265
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:58,830
And then you will see type two diabetes and metabolic syndrome associated with this condition as well.

266
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:07,620
So why does obstructive sleep apnea increase your blood pressure?

267
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:11,280
That's what's described in this particular diagram.

268
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:20,970
So here we have intermittent hypoxia where you're actually the O2 saturation declines during these events where you're not breathing.

269
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:27,090
This has an effect on the peripheral chemo receptors.

270
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:33,210
So you have chemo receptors and the vasculature leaving the heart.

271
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:42,299
And when that saturation of the reduction in an oxygen sensed causes an activation

272
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:48,000
of the sympathetic nervous system that increases in release from the kidney,

273
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:55,980
it increases the angiotensin. It's in release from the liver and aldosterone release from the pituitary gland.

274
00:34:56,490 --> 00:35:06,270
These are all days of constricted events and if you have an impairment in this barrel reflex,

275
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:17,249
perhaps due to a reduction in loss or nitric oxide synthase, the opposing mechanism, which would be the release of nitric oxide,

276
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:28,170
would be reduced so that it's capacity to kind of reduce the pressures activated by the sympathetic nervous system would be impaired,

277
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:40,259
leading to greater or abnormal days of constriction. So you have an increase in blood pressure which a reduction in nitric oxide this will

278
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,460
activate the endothelial cells themselves that release and they're feeling one.

279
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:51,780
And there's also an increased sensitivity to calcium flux within the vasculature.

280
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:57,510
And all of these things lead to normal basal constriction and increased sympathetic blood pressure.

281
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:06,330
So all of these things arise because of this intermittent hypoxia that occurs from this sleep disordered breathing.

282
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:13,170
So this diagram shows you what had intermittent hypoxia.

283
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:20,100
What it does in terms of the central focus here is an increase in reactive oxygen species.

284
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:35,260
And so the mechanistically you have a mitochondrial dysfunction occurring, you have an increase in nitric oxide oxidase r nox you have um,

285
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,690
the oxidase increased and you have uncoupling of the nitric oxide synthase.

286
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:50,610
In other words, instead of activating this phase of dilator, the nitric oxide synthesis uncoupled from this,

287
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:55,890
and instead of getting more nitric oxide, you get more reactive oxygen species.

288
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:10,710
And then there's interaction between this increased nitric oxide synthase and other things that are listed here are pathways leading to inflammation.

289
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:20,150
There's no greater sympathetic nerve activity activation of the angiotensin to increase kind of feeling

290
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:29,040
one leading to hypertension have an increase in ROS with increased vessel adiposity and obesity.

291
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:36,689
You have activation of things within the blood. Um, so you activate the white blood cells.

292
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:47,070
The leukocytes for platelets can become more easily formed blood clots in the presence of increased reactive oxygen species,

293
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,900
greater expression of adhesion molecules.

294
00:37:52,530 --> 00:38:01,800
And all of these things can contribute to greater risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular and cerebral vascular morbidity.

295
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:08,010
Posing. This is these things listed here are shown here in green.

296
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:16,200
We get an activation of these factors if one alpha and add up to two.

297
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:26,490
These are things that can increase the angiogenic factors to the development of new blood vessels.

298
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:33,750
So this is a response to this hypoxia that occurs, but it's outweighed.

299
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:43,890
These responses are outweighed by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, all caused by this intermittent hypoxia.

300
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:55,510
So how do you know if you have obstructive sleep apnea when you might feel tired all the time?

301
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:00,040
But to get a diagnosis, you have a sleep study.

302
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:10,900
So a sleep study is called Polysomnography and they're going to look at the number of events that occur.

303
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:23,080
So if you have more than five per hour of the index with five of these apnea hypoxia events per hour, that would be considered a mild case.

304
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:30,969
You would have described yourself as being tired all of the time.

305
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:39,830
You'd have excessive daytime sleepiness. You wake up choking, holding her.

306
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:47,450
You feel like you've been holding your breath or gasping when you wake up and then habitual snoring goes along with this as well.

307
00:39:50,570 --> 00:40:00,080
Your partner is an important source of information here because you may wake up in it's fall back to sleep and forget that you had these events.

308
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:10,130
So they may report these types of signs and symptoms. And the severity depends on this number of these events.

309
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:19,280
So 5 to 15 would be mild. Anything more than 15 would be considered moderate, and then more than 30 would be considered severe.

310
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:34,340
And the degree of the saturation of the hemostatic hemoglobin would also be a thing that would be used to determine during the sleep study.

311
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:38,450
Now, whether or not you had a more severe case of OSA.

312
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:47,640
So what is a measure in a sleep study? So Polysomnography is a lot of different measurements are taken here.

313
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:57,310
So there are probes now that are placed around your heads.

314
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:03,680
They're looking at activation of responses occurring and within the within the brain,

315
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:11,690
they're looking at responses that occur within the musculature that affects breathing.

316
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:21,560
You're looking at your eyes now, so you might have a probe over your eyes to look at ocular activity,

317
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:24,080
which is shown here so that here's the normal situation.

318
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:31,340
And then you have leads, the electrocardiogram measurements shown here, and this is the normal tracing.

319
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:43,790
And then you have another probe looking at air, going in and out of the lungs, and then a temperature sensor in the eye around your mouth as well.

320
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:53,200
I'm a respiratory EMG. So you're looking at the muscular activity in the muscles that control our respiration.

321
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:58,390
They're measuring O2 saturation movements of your legs.

322
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:04,480
Um, this is thoracic oscillations they're looking at here.

323
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,890
Abdominal pressures and changes and then snoring.

324
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,710
And they're measuring this over a ten second period of time.

325
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:18,970
So I wonder, I've not had a sleep study, but if you have all of these things stuck to your head, your eye,

326
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:24,790
your heart, your thoracic, how in the world are you going to sleep when you have all of this done to you?

327
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:31,810
There have been efforts to modify this, to have people have the sleep studies done at home.

328
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:36,009
But those sleep studies, as you can see in the reading part,

329
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:43,660
is nearly as revealing in terms of the types of measurements that you can make with a higher sleeping lab.

330
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:49,750
You can get a lot more information. This is what you see in somebody who has obstructive sleep apnea.

331
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:56,560
You see more activity in the brain, in the musculature and the eyes.

332
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:58,690
Look at the east here.

333
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:10,840
You have this weird tracing here so that during these sleep apnea events, the tracing for the electrocardiogram changes dramatically,

334
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,350
the temperatures in the mouth change indicating a cessation of breathing.

335
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:22,840
The respiratory effort now changes. So you're trying to compensate.

336
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:30,310
You're not aware of this by getting greater contraction of these muscles to open that airway.

337
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:34,930
And notice the the saturation of oxygen here.

338
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:43,420
It changes. It increases and decreases as as a consequence of having these apnea events.

339
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,370
This person's legs move a little bit more. So there's this movement that occurs.

340
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:59,260
Here's the thoracic oscillations are more erratic and the abdominal movements are a little bit different as well.

341
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:04,180
So this is the kind of information that you would collect in a sleep study.

342
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:15,100
So how do you manage this condition? Well, it's tailored to how severe the condition might be.

343
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:22,300
There are different kinds of procedures that are to be done, some being more effective than others.

344
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:27,370
There was the there's surgery that can be done.

345
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,179
There's the CPAP. There's are some is that can be done.

346
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:36,159
And then one last thing I'll mention it is this new procedure where they actually

347
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:45,220
put a stimulating device they implanted surgically so that it keeps the airway open.

348
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:52,690
And we'll get to that in a minute. So how you get CPAP?

349
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,830
This is a continuous pressure system in which to put a mask on.

350
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:03,870
And I have a picture of this in a bed. And it keeps your sort of pressure on the airway.

351
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:10,030
It keeps it open, but you have to have a more severe form of this condition to have that.

352
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:14,680
I didn't get this particular device prescribed.

353
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,600
You can have surgery for some craniofacial abnormalities.

354
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:28,240
However, the success of the surgeries isn't as effective as some of these other magic procedures.

355
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:40,560
You could wear a dental device. It shifts the mandible forward and takes it changes the diameter of the airway, and it can keep it open, doesn't it?

356
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:51,220
You can lifestyle modification. This can improve obstructive sleep apnea symptoms, but it's not a cure.

357
00:45:52,090 --> 00:46:01,810
So within the SLEEPYHEAD study, where they followed people for ten years after they had this intensive lifestyle intervention,

358
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:06,730
it reduced the severity, but it didn't completely cure the condition.

359
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:10,540
So it does improve the symptoms. But it's not a it's not a cure.

360
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:20,530
Calorie restriction and exercise can improve the condition through loss of adipose tissue.

361
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:26,650
Bariatric surgery and people who have very high damages has been shown to improve that condition.

362
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:33,310
And here's two different structures are two different ways to manage OSA.

363
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:41,100
The first is the CPAP. Here's the continuous positive airway pressure where you put this mask over your

364
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:46,739
face so tight over your nose and over your mouth and it's strapped to your head.

365
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:51,930
And then you have this device that forces or keeps the airway open.

366
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:58,880
And they're fairly quiet, but compliance is low.

367
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:07,560
But these things, let's just say people will try it out for us for for a few days and they can't fall asleep with this thing.

368
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:14,860
And they stop and. Another thing that skews is this mandibular advancement device.

369
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:20,080
If you're someone who has these structural abnormalities, you can put this mouthpiece in.

370
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:26,680
And what it does is it shifts your mandible forward and that can relieve some of the pressure on the airway.

371
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:33,430
But, you know, again, this can be a problem with some people.

372
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,870
So compliance might be a limiting factor with this procedure.

373
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:45,190
The thing that's come out recently is this type of glass on nerve stimulator.

374
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:54,640
So they implant this device surgically. So what it is is actually a pulse generator.

375
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:07,210
The pulse generator serves as a stimulus for the the airway muscles so that the smooth muscles surrounding the airway now can be activated.

376
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:14,050
And it's a mild stimulation. It's mild enough that it doesn't break up, but it keeps the airway open.

377
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:19,089
And this device is in use.

378
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:29,560
Just recently approved. And a lot of individuals who have severe forms of obstructive sleep apnea are prescribed this technique.

379
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:36,700
And this seems to be the thing that we're moving toward in terms of treatment with people severe with severe conditions.

380
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:44,640
So to summarize the first part of what we talked about, obstructive sleep apnea,

381
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:53,760
its repeated episodes of apnea and hypoxia, events that occur while you're sleeping.

382
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:59,970
About 14% of the adult population has this condition, and this is increasing.

383
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:06,420
It's caused by narrowing of the airway for a number of issues that we've discussed.

384
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:14,070
It can increase with with weight gain and can increase adiposity associated with obesity.

385
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:24,120
And it's not a simply a situation in which you have problems with having restorative sleep.

386
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:32,040
It causes significant cardiovascular issues such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

387
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:39,390
There are a number of treatments that have been used to improve the condition.

388
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:49,830
And so lifestyle modifications see past surgery and or device and hypoglycemic nerve stimulation.

389
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,430
All of these are have been used to treat this particular condition.

390
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,110
So moving on to osteoarthritis.

391
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:15,050
Osteoarthritis is a condition here that affects the weight bearing joints and it can also affect the non weight joints such as in your hands.

392
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:28,100
So here's the joint here you have the cartilage imagery of the meniscus shown here, somebody who has osteoarthritis.

393
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:35,659
You can see disruptions of the articular cartilage where there's these bony protrusions and

394
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:41,930
bone spurs that are occurring due to this abnormal bone growth within the joints space itself.

395
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:46,890
So within the joint space, you see that it's narrowed here.

396
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:55,890
And this is an important aspect of the diagnostic criteria for having osteoarthritis.

397
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:08,280
So it's a degeneration of the joint, and it can affect one or several die or die or throw joints.

398
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:12,569
And here's the definition of a die are for a joints.

399
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:19,340
It's a connection between two bones consisting of cartilage lined, a cartilage lined field cavity.

400
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:26,069
So this would be your knees and your hips and within your fingers and your toes.

401
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:32,610
These are different examples of these types of joints that can be affected by having osteoarthritis.

402
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:44,150
It is distinct from other types of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

403
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:50,390
It can affect the entire body, not just one particular joint.

404
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:56,690
In osteoarthritis, you might have one joint affected or two joints in somebody who has rheumatoid arthritis.

405
00:51:56,690 --> 00:52:01,480
It might affect their entire body all for nothing.

406
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:07,100
This is an autoimmune disease. And osteoarthritis.

407
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:11,510
Is this actually the disease occurs within the joint itself?

408
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:25,840
So what's the burden of disease? Well, it's the 11th leading cause of years of our lives.

409
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:31,600
A years lived with disability. It limits your mobility.

410
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:43,420
It limits your ability to perform work. And if you have the type of occupation where moving your fingers and moving your body is part of your job,

411
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:47,860
well, this is going to be significantly impair your ability to earn a living.

412
00:52:50,760 --> 00:53:02,490
If you look at the lifetime risk shift, 25% for the mean, 45% for the hands, about 40% of the population.

413
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:12,910
They have pain associated with this. And this is how people find out that they might have osteoarthritis.

414
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,520
It has a significant impact on the economic burden.

415
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:24,540
And it is something that is increasing and it's prevalence.

416
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,970
It's it's one of the fastest growing diseases worldwide.

417
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:38,730
So what happens in the joint to make this occur doesn't make any sense.

418
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:45,870
Why would you have a generation of a joint occurrence and both the weight bearing joints and within your fingertips?

419
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,960
Well, here is the cortical bone.

420
00:53:52,050 --> 00:54:00,690
Here's the knee joint. So you have the cortical bone, the actual regular bone, the fibrous layers, the cartilage within the joint.

421
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,860
And then you have the synovial membrane.

422
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:15,660
And then you have this space inside here. And if you were to zoom in on the articular cartilage itself, you'd find a very ordered structure.

423
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:22,770
So you have this the conder sites that are formed, this ordered structure.

424
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:32,970
They produce collagen and they are in a fluid filled environment.

425
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,560
And this predicts the joint from damage.

426
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:40,920
The fluid provides lubrication during movement.

427
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:49,680
And then you find that there's an ordered structure in terms of the number of these condor sites that are positioned throughout the tissue.

428
00:54:50,910 --> 00:55:03,360
So you have lots of sites right at the articular surface and a few as you get deeper into this, some of the tissue.

429
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:11,340
And then you have this this trademark, which indicates a difference in the density of the tissue in calcification.

430
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:18,660
And then beneath this trademark, you have the sub condor bone and this of condor bone marrow.

431
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,370
They become important when you develop this condition.

432
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:32,100
So if you were to take a biopsy of somebody's articular cartilage and from articular partnership, it was normal.

433
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,780
It would have this type of appearance. This is what it really looks like.

434
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:42,450
Here's this trademark. Here's the condor sites. Here's the articular cartilage.

435
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:47,460
And just underneath this trademark, you have some calcified cartilage and bone.

436
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:53,760
When somebody develops osteoarthritis, the structure changes.

437
00:55:54,660 --> 00:56:01,500
And you notice that there's this particular cartilage that has these fissures.

438
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:05,180
It, um, yeah. That's present.

439
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:09,730
So you don't have this order of structure when you look at the position.

440
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:13,230
The contrast sites that change quite a bit as well.

441
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,730
They're clustered instead of being spaced throughout the tissue.

442
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:21,840
They can have a greater size in their appearance.

443
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:28,410
So there's a disruption of the structure and the distribution of the sites.

444
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,350
There's some fibrosis that can occur here.

445
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:43,830
There's this change and the appearance of this trademark that in this particular case, you have two trademarks.

446
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:50,950
And remember, the trademark marked the spot between the cartilage and the deposition of calcium within the cartilage.

447
00:56:50,970 --> 00:57:02,190
So you have a trademark here and one here. So the other thing that you notice is that there's this vascular invasion.

448
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:06,570
And in other words, the tissue is a vascular here, in here.

449
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:13,800
For people who have osteoarthritis, there's this invasion of this issue now with a vascular supply.

450
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:20,760
So that would indicate there's some changes in tissue growth there.

451
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:30,750
There can also be now an increase in innovation of the tissue, which can provide a sensation of a greater sensation of pain.

452
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:41,520
And you can have a lot of cells recruited to the area that can contribute to this inflammatory environment within the joint itself.

453
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:54,530
So. It's in the subsequent slide chief and time marker interchange on the right is American trademark infringement travel.

454
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,980
So. Yeah, I would think so.

455
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:05,570
Tide mark here. Um. Trademark.

456
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:12,800
Trademark. Hi, Mark. Now trademark. I may have misspoke.

457
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:23,510
So pain is the first symptom and you may have to have a joint and undergoing the process of degeneration before you have the sensation of pain.

458
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:29,429
You might experience when you get up first thing in the morning,

459
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:35,550
some stiffness and it takes you a while now to have a full range of motion within that joint.

460
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:44,670
And so as you wake up, as you move around, that the range of motion starts to return to what it would be normal.

461
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:49,500
So I think this is something that can affect your fingertips.

462
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:52,530
Well, that might have the beginning signs and symptoms.

463
00:58:53,520 --> 00:59:05,250
The other classic symptom with OSA is this decrepit is the sounding of its grating sound associated with movement of the joint.

464
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:11,490
You might hear this in your knee joints or feel it in joints and maybe perhaps your hip joints as well.

465
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:19,920
There could be, as a consequence, some instability.

466
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:25,410
So you can have a misalignment of the bones surrounding the joint.

467
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:30,600
And this can be painful. It can make your gait unstable.

468
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:34,570
If you're walking, it can make your movement less sure.

469
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:47,850
And this could cause more falls. And because of the limited mobility, because it hurts to move in certain ways if physical activity declines,

470
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:54,899
your quality of life declines as a consequence of this and this is significantly debilitating for people who are trying to earn

471
00:59:54,900 --> 01:00:04,830
a living and people who are perhaps their advanced age and they have a difficult time keeping up with their normal activities.

472
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:12,990
Getting up and down stairs is difficult. Being able to prepare meals for yourself is difficult.

473
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:20,610
Doing your laundry is difficult. All of the things that you would normally do or engage in now become significant

474
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:24,840
in terms of the effort and pain that is associated with those activities.

475
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:43,410
So it's it's fairly common. It's more common in people with white European ancestry, in people who are 65 years and older, it's fairly common.

476
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:57,240
So 60% of people who are 65 years and older will have osteoarthritis of the hands, particularly closer to the distal bones.

477
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:03,630
So it's right before the tips of your fingers and the tips of your toes where you see this disease process developed.

478
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:08,760
30% osteoarthritis of the knee and 5% of the shift.

479
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:21,620
And then the frequency of pain associated with the condition varies 15% with the hand, but a greater degree in osteoarthritis of the knee.

480
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:26,030
About half of people who have osteoarthritis at the knee will experience pain.

481
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:34,280
There are structural changes that occur that lead to disability.

482
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:40,100
So half the people who have the condition will have the disability lose physical function.

483
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:49,880
It's likely that it's going to affect not only the joint, but several joints shift the hands and so on.

484
01:01:50,690 --> 01:02:02,960
And you can even find a lumbar spine, which shows the same type of abnormalities that would indicate the development of this condition.

485
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:20,140
So what are your risk factors? Well, increasing age women have a greater risk of developing arthritis for reasons that are not clearly understood.

486
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:36,180
Mechanical joint stability. So if you have some kind of a misalignment of your tissues, specifically the weight of joints such as your feet or yes,

487
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:42,340
this can increase structural damage when there is a weight bearing that can occur.

488
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:55,720
So the reading talked about this condition in which the socket in which the hip it's entombed can be incomplete.

489
01:02:56,730 --> 01:03:05,290
This could be due to a genetic differences that the area around the ball joint in the hip doesn't doesn't form completely.

490
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:10,510
And as a consequence, there's more mobility within that particular joint.

491
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:15,850
And this puts pressure on certain areas of the joints that can contribute to tissue damage.

492
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:22,110
Yeah. There are differences in like a female like pelvis compared to like a male vulvas.

493
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:27,440
I wonder if like that could add some type of, like, just general architectural differences?

494
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:31,970
Possibly. Possibly. But the knee joint is not different.

495
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:36,459
And you still still see the angle of the head. You know, perhaps.

496
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:42,150
Perhaps. Genetic factors.

497
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:48,090
If your parents, grandparents had osteoarthritis, that should be an indicator.

498
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:54,900
While you need to maintain your physical activity muscle strength to prevent this perhaps from occurring to you as you age.

499
01:03:57,350 --> 01:04:03,140
Increased amount of mass body mass obesity not only from increased load,

500
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:10,970
but a low chronic state of inflammation associated with having excess adiposity is a significant risk factor.

501
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:22,760
So joint injury. So if you are a person who engages in activities now and put excessive strain on a particular joint,

502
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:37,340
this can damage the tissue and over time it can cause that development of the abnormal repair process that can occur and contribute to this condition.

503
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:42,580
So the classic example is football, where linemen,

504
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:53,840
these are really big people to put excessive strain on their joints and many of them develop osteoarthritis when they come off when they get older.

505
01:04:55,160 --> 01:05:06,270
I remember not too long ago they had team members from the University of Michigan Football who played under Beauchamp

506
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:15,230
that where the 1969 team and the guys were all lined up and all of the linemen had canes for most of them did.

507
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:17,630
So as a consequence of that,

508
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:29,210
increased pressure and load on the joints and perhaps in their ships as well from the years they played college or professional football,

509
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:37,280
repetitive joint use. And it's the type of joint use that matters here.

510
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:45,799
So if you are a runner or somebody who gauges in regular physical activity, that's not what's going to cause this condition.

511
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:59,070
It's when you have misalignment, when you have an abnormally high load on the joint that causes the problem, that's a big factor.

512
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:09,559
All right. This is from a Dutch population study and you're looking at distal and differential articulations and the orange.

513
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:16,490
Here are the dip and you're looking at men and women and you're looking at osteoarthritis, prevalence.

514
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:22,100
And after you get about 50 years of age, we start to see this big increase.

515
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:30,680
And the prevalence for both for men and for women starts at a younger age, about after 40 years of age.

516
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:36,440
We're seeing this increase and there's a higher prevalence of women particular in this particular sample.

517
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:44,660
So this is occurrence or I should say prevalence of osteoarthritis in the top two graphs for men and women.

518
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:52,940
So we have knee and blue screen for the hip and this gray line for the hand shown here.

519
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:59,590
So this is osteoarthritis incidence per 100,000 person years and we see that

520
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:05,079
it increases in men after the age of 50 and for women after the age of 40.

521
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:15,490
And there's a higher prevalence of women compared to men. And again, people of European ancestry have a greater risk for this particular condition.

522
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:24,820
So this distal enter phalanges, articulations, this little.

523
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:29,120
Diagram that I put in here shows you where this is occurring.

524
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:34,219
So in the hand, the disk or the distal inter phalanges articulation,

525
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:43,510
it's occur at the end of the last bone within the hand, the joint between the the distal bone and the next bone.

526
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,820
This is where the osteoarthritis.

527
01:07:51,340 --> 01:08:05,610
So talked about how body weight in terms of BMI, body mass index affects the occurrence of knee ah, incidence of knee osteoarthritis.

528
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:11,590
So this is incidence of knee osteoarthritis per 1000 person years in the Y axis.

529
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:25,240
Now on the X axis, you have H. Then you have different classes of BMI, normal weight, overweight type one obesity, type two obesity.

530
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:34,120
And as you go up the BMI scale, you have a greater incidence of knee osteoarthritis.

531
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:42,260
So the diagnostic criteria for knee osteoarthritis is listed here.

532
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:46,490
And again, you might have the development of the condition,

533
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:54,470
but not experience the pain until you get to be a little bit older after 50 years of age for man and perhaps after 40 years of age for women.

534
01:08:55,130 --> 01:09:02,360
So there's this presence of pain in three or more characteristics morning stiffness.

535
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:11,880
You have a full range of motion. You have that gravitas, that sound, the grating, grinding sound when you start to move.

536
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:21,630
You might have bony tenderness of the knee and there's no detectable warrant for the tissue.

537
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:29,090
This is what distinguishes osteoarthritis from rheumatoid arthritis with rheumatoid arthritis.

538
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:35,970
You might feel some warmness around the joint, which is different than with osteoarthritis.

539
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:41,310
So in terms of the structural changes that would occur.

540
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:51,090
So after 50, have you have perhaps some you have crumpets, you have osteoarthritis that would be present.

541
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:55,440
And those are the bony projections that form within the joint itself.

542
01:09:55,830 --> 01:10:07,020
And that can be noted on an X-ray, and they can cause some pain to the osteoarthritis that develop within the new joint.

543
01:10:09,090 --> 01:10:15,060
So in terms of how does having excess adiposity or obesity contribute to this condition?

544
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:22,140
Well, there's the loading. And leading to increased loading.

545
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:34,500
And then you have this inflammation. This is the increase in the chronic low state of inflammation that can be measured within the knee joint itself.

546
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:40,350
So if you were to take a fluid sample from the joint that's affected,

547
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:45,990
you could find higher levels of LT, you could find higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines,

548
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:50,220
you could find higher levels of matrix of the cattle protein acts as things

549
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:55,440
that degrade the tissue at a higher level and people would have a higher BMI.

550
01:10:56,490 --> 01:11:00,840
So here's the bone that is starting to be remodeled.

551
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:05,280
You have stiffening of this structure here.

552
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:09,720
This is the sclerosis that's occurring within this particular area.

553
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:19,830
There's the breakdown of the cartilage that occurs, inflammation of the tissues surrounding the joints here.

554
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:29,340
And then these bony projections are the osteoarthritis that can contribute to this sensation of this crap of this that you might sense.

555
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:38,850
So here's this the cycle. So with increase out of poverty and obesity,

556
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:45,510
we have this chronic state of inflammation that can lead to these structural changes that contribute to pain.

557
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:50,010
And as a consequence, if you don't move around,

558
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:58,139
it's much less physically active and there's less energy expenditure and you lose muscle

559
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:03,450
mass and you gain adipose tissue mass as a consequence of having less physical activity.

560
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:11,490
And when you move around less, this has a tendency to increase your body mass.

561
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,880
And increased body mass through an increase in fat mass.

562
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:20,080
And this increases the joint bloating.

563
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:24,250
And if you're not moving around too much, you lose muscle strength.

564
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:32,560
This can contribute to not only inactivity, but potentially the misalignment of the joint itself,

565
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:41,620
especially the weight bearing joints in the hips and knees. And this is a vicious cycle that can occur if it isn't interrupted.

566
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:51,120
So in terms of mechanisms that occur, you know, why does this happen on a mechanistic level?

567
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:56,850
Well, you have the center here is the sites now,

568
01:12:57,310 --> 01:13:09,880
the cells within the articular cartilage now that become activated in a way that leads to the generation of the tissue.

569
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:13,709
So here is mechanical or step stress.

570
01:13:13,710 --> 01:13:25,110
And here you have a dip, a kind of perhaps leptin that's affecting the ability of the cells now to produce things that are pro-inflammatory.

571
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:32,970
So you have chemokines cytokines and chemokines that activate these cells, but the destruction.

572
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:36,690
So that would cause the inflammation more fluid accumulation perhaps.

573
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:46,090
Here you have things that are produced systemically, the receptors for the advanced glycation products.

574
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:51,750
This is what could be formed during somebody who has diabetes.

575
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:56,160
This can activate these cells to produce these mediators.

576
01:13:56,790 --> 01:14:03,750
It's the matrix metallic protein ases that cause destruction of the tissue itself.

577
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:12,120
So it breaks down and the the fragments of the articular cartilage can be pro-inflammatory as well.

578
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:20,340
And then you have this phenomenal membrane that can also produce these pro-inflammatory agents as well.

579
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:28,260
So there are particular cartage structural damage or change, the undersides of attempt to repair.

580
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:36,120
There's a failure to repair the tissues. There's the secretion of these matrix degrading enzymes here.

581
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:41,760
There's reactive oxygen species, which is not noted here.

582
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:51,690
There is this increase in the cytokines that are produced by the sites themselves and the assignable membrane can actually produce these as well.

583
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:59,610
You get inflammation and further cartilage degradation and within the knee joint there's

584
01:14:59,610 --> 01:15:05,010
actually a higher level of the different kind lectins so there's underneath the patella,

585
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:13,770
there's a adipose tissue. And studies have been done looking at the levels of leptin within the knee joint.

586
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:23,850
And during this disease process, leptin levels can increase substantially above what you would see from a serum or a blood sample.

587
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:34,860
And then underneath you talk about this in great detail about what happens within the bone itself.

588
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:44,100
So you get structural changes to the bone itself. And that's where the the let's go back there because we're running out of time.

589
01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:50,220
The clone structure changes as well in response to these disruptive events.

590
01:15:51,660 --> 01:16:01,020
Okay, so what do you do? So in terms of as you age, you want to prevent weight gain.

591
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:08,760
You want to manage your body weight. But this can slow down the progression of the disease.

592
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:14,670
So this is a nonpharmacologic invention intervention.

593
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:26,190
And. If you have an individual who has the ability to to lose the excess adiposity, this is associated with the better outcomes.

594
01:16:26,970 --> 01:16:34,440
Physical activity is critically important for somebody who might be who has the condition or has a risk for the condition.

595
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:43,770
Even if you experience some joint pain. It's important to engage in activities that you can do without experiencing the pain.

596
01:16:44,130 --> 01:16:48,360
This will help you maintain your current body weight.

597
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:53,610
It strengthens the muscles around the joint. It keeps you physically active.

598
01:16:53,880 --> 01:17:06,540
It maintains your quality of life. So beyond that, there are medications that control the inflammation and the pain associated with the condition.

599
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:11,070
There are no medications that can stop the progression of the disease.

600
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:16,260
So you control the pain and this can improve quality of life.

601
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:23,550
So a first step would be to give somebody these nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

602
01:17:25,170 --> 01:17:32,400
So something like cyclooxygenase inhibitors would be the first step.

603
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,360
A high enough dose to effect that sensation of pain.

604
01:17:38,370 --> 01:17:45,719
Acetaminophen or paracetamol. Tylenol is another thing that can be used in more severe cases.

605
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:49,020
People might be prescribed opioids. These can be addictive.

606
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:55,829
They can take care of perhaps some of the pain. But this is only prescribed in severe cases.

607
01:17:55,830 --> 01:18:08,729
And I imagine now with the opioid crisis that we're experiencing, that this practice is discouraged in individuals who the pain is always present,

608
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:19,920
it's really reducing their quality of life, and they have structural damage that can be repaired through a knee replacement or joint replacement.

609
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:24,630
This this can be done. And this can improve the quality of life in some individuals.

610
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:33,240
I will say having friends, family and colleagues who have had this procedure done that this isn't necessarily a cure.

611
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:44,490
There can be all kinds of complications with the surgery that can occur depending on the extent of the replacement and who is doing the surgery.

612
01:18:44,910 --> 01:18:50,730
And the types of devices that are replaced are used to replace the bone itself.

613
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:56,100
So this is not necessarily a cure all that the joint replacement.

614
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:05,700
Yeah. Are you didn't have a question. You're just fixing it, trying to figure out I'm speeding up here to finish this up.

615
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:17,670
So it's osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disorder affecting one or more of the joints so it can be your knees,

616
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:21,090
your hips or the tips of your fingers or even in your toes.

617
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:31,110
Here are the risk factors things that increase your risk of developing osteoarthritis, age, increased adiposity, genetics.

618
01:19:31,410 --> 01:19:40,710
Women are an increased risk. It's one of the most prevalent diseases that causes disability as you age.

619
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:52,079
And you can have adverse mechanical forces and other factors can that can impair the countryside function itself.

620
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:57,090
And this is where the disease process is thought to develop within the countryside itself.

621
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:58,967
That leads to the this.
