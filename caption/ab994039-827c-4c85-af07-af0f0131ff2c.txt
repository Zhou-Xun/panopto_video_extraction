1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,440
Yeah. Oh, yeah. So far.

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:13,050
I mean, there's only one single asset for ourselves.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:21,180
Oh, something that brings people together is like, I'm kind of a little bit like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:28,880
So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:33,000
Still feel like a home. All right. Good afternoon, everyone.

6
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,930
Look, you guys are doing well. Good to see you all again.

7
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,510
All right. I think we've got a full house today. Almost.

8
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:55,320
It's good. All right. So today we're going to talk about gas data a little bit more, talk about different types of data in terms of their formats,

9
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,280
which is important to know if you want to use this applications.

10
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,790
But we'll also talk about where does this data come from?

11
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:11,730
Uh, to give you guys an idea of the multitude of places where we can find just information for public health purposes,

12
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,550
and then we're going to do similar discussions and we will end the class with a couple of

13
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:25,560
lab activities which will focus on exploring this data within the MMORPGs Pro platform.

14
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,549
And actually, we'll try to make maps today that you'll maybe start making your own maps or one

15
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:38,640
map today and try to use different features in the system for producing maps.

16
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,669
Okay. So we're going to start with the N first in a way that said, not making the last step for using gas,

17
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:51,420
but it's good to start with that because you feel like you're getting something out of it right away instead of just managing data and all that,

18
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,499
which could be a little less fun. Okay.

19
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,830
So logistics, again, I want to encourage you to find your project team members.

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,330
I think people have started to fill this out. Let me see where we're at.

21
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,640
Yesterday I checked and it was only one or two groups.

22
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,890
I think they had put their names down.

23
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:23,490
When you see who's who's done it, if you haven't if you have a team member already, see two folks, two teams for four people.

24
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,360
So if you have your team members already decided, please fill out this table,

25
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:36,629
it'll help me keep track of what's going on with your team setups and what also you might be interested in doing for your final project.

26
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:42,720
So I can maybe give some guidance and pointers and so forth. How many folks out there are looking for teammates?

27
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,930
All right. Raise your hand high so you can see each other. Okay.

28
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:56,820
So, you know, I guess to touch base with these folks, if you want to make and identify them as a teammates,

29
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,340
would you guys like a few minutes in class maybe today or next week to solidify teams?

30
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,239
Would that help you? Yeah. Okay, so let's do that.

31
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,890
Maybe today, if you have some time, we can do that and we can continue that next week until we finalize them.

32
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,630
My goal for you all will be to have teammates by the end of next week.

33
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,620
Okay.

34
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:24,150
Because it'll be it'll be very important to get that all started and it'll help you as you think about your first assignment and what to do for that.

35
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,610
So you can focus your first assignment accordingly, right?

36
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:35,760
So please fill this out if you had a teammate and if not, talk to folks and identify your teammate.

37
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:43,350
And the second thing is just to remind you, when you send emails, please put HB 86 six in the subject line.

38
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,670
I got a couple of emails over the last week. That was it in the subject line.

39
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,110
I may have missed them, you know, if I wasn't paying closer attention.

40
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:59,640
So sometimes it really does help to me to be more responsive to you if you do add that to them.

41
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:07,590
So those are just a couple of logistical things. And so from that, let's just move on to more content.

42
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,480
So let's just do a little bit of recap from last week, right,

43
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:18,540
just to see if we we kind of got some information in your minds about what's

44
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,340
going on in the class and just to see if we're all on the same page about stuff.

45
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,709
So we talked a lot about layers and layers of data in guys.

46
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,860
We gave some examples of what that is in class.

47
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:38,310
I just like somebody to use your own words to describe the function of layers of spatial data.

48
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:45,750
Engineers like ArcGIS, for example, uses different layers and provide some examples of what different layers might be in a

49
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:51,300
specific project you might take on a map you might make in our of searches in general.

50
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:59,850
So one person, please, you know, just in your own words, what are what is the function or purpose of layers of spatial data in.

51
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,420
Yeah. So each layer is different, data visualization.

52
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:11,390
So like last week, what we did, we had like the boundaries of the states and within that one layer,

53
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:17,960
another layer of roads, another layer of rivers, and then depending on how the layers are stacked,

54
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,740
they can overlay each other or they can even cover up other layers and intentionally

55
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,730
so it's just kind of building off of each other to see more and more of that.

56
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,760
Great, excellent, excellent description.

57
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:41,720
What layers are usually, you know, what we call one set of feature classes will be one layer in a ArcGIS or just project.

58
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:47,810
We'll talk about feature classes there, but state boundaries would be one feature class,

59
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:53,240
so that would be one independent layer and another layer might be the interstate highways.

60
00:05:54,050 --> 00:06:01,520
So that's another layer, etc. And you stack layers on top of each other to create a map that has meaning, right?

61
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,600
Usually maps will have more than one layer, but sometimes it can only have one layer.

62
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,420
So it's really important to work with layers. And then what was your name again?

63
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,860
Sam. Sam and Sam describe. It's important to figure out how to stack the layers,

64
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:22,100
because sometimes you can cover up information if the layers, the layers and that stack properly.

65
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:27,110
And then you just have to kind of play around with that. Just figure that out for yourself for your specific map project.

66
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,290
All right. What is the function of geo databases in guess what are they?

67
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:50,450
What do we use them for? Yeah.

68
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:57,830
It's like where we get our data from. We can also do data management inside of it, which is great.

69
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,130
Great. Excellent. Anybody want to add to that?

70
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,720
Yeah. It's not just a way to store the files.

71
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,860
It's great. It's a way to organize your files.

72
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,170
Specifically the data used to create your maps. Anybody else?

73
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,290
I think that gets at the essential aspect of geo databases.

74
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,340
Each MAP project could have a geo database associated with it.

75
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:39,910
What I do sometimes have I have like several geo databases that I just go to many, many times for different map projects.

76
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:45,399
That's where I house all my spatial data and what we call attribute data,

77
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:52,540
table data and the boundary data that we were talking about, like for states or logging data or point data.

78
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,070
It's a place to organize all the data you might use for your work.

79
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,140
Ideally, you organize it by project or by map, the map you're making.

80
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:07,540
Okay, so you'll be using geo databases all the time in this class when you start making maps.

81
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:13,690
And it's a way to pull in data, to create your map, to restore data.

82
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,820
And it's a way to manage your data.

83
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:23,440
And then we'll talk about that a little bit more today and talk about different types of geo databases that are available in our gas.

84
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:30,640
Okay. And what are projects in our gas prove?

85
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,560
We talked about something called a PPR X File last week.

86
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,420
Right? It's called a project file.

87
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,750
We made a project file when we started the project, the PR X file.

88
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:02,600
We made that lung cancer mortality map and then I created a folder where everything was included.

89
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:16,860
Yes, but. Is it where you work to create your visualization when you bring in different pieces from your database and your other parts?

90
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:28,910
But it's not actually the map itself. I remember you said that you can't just send our files and expect the data to be attached, so you work on it.

91
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:35,620
Great. Great. Yeah. So the press file is the kind of visualization file.

92
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:45,669
It's the file that includes the map information that you want to create or you will create, but it doesn't house the actual data you will have.

93
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:53,080
It will include all of all the symbology, the different, the ways, the way different elements of anatomy look.

94
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,620
We'll learn about layouts. This will have layouts in there.

95
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:04,900
It may have your toolbox information in there, but it's really linking all of that to a geo database or a toolbox file and things like that.

96
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:12,250
So a project file is the Apex file, and that's the main file you will do work with to create your maps.

97
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:21,840
But a project includes the apex file clustered your database file plus your toolbox file, and there's index file and so forth.

98
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:30,729
All of that together is a project, and when you share things among each other, you want to share your whole project folder with people, right?

99
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,070
Because that includes not only the Apex file,

100
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:38,920
but the data that's being visualized and all the index information so all the fans can communicate with each other.

101
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:44,410
So if you just said one element of the project folder to your colleague, it's not going to work.

102
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,980
You need to send all of it together in one package. Okay.

103
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,300
So the ideal thing to do is zip up your project file.

104
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:58,239
You can create a project package file. In our case, I don't do that very often,

105
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:05,049
but you just zip it up and you send it to your colleague and they can open up that folder and then open the Apex Web in there.

106
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:12,810
So everything is working. So this will be a little bit trial and error because a lot of students forget that nothing is working on my map.

107
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:18,190
Everything is a red exclamation point. That's because you just send the AP experiments in the data with.

108
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:25,360
Okay. Excellent. All right. So again, today, we'll talk about where does the I just did that come from?

109
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:31,600
We'll talk about vector and raster data models. We'll just dig a little bit deeper than we did last time about that.

110
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,800
Well, we'll talk about what is what our features and attributes.

111
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:41,830
So we all understand those words because that's used all the time in our guys and years lingo.

112
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:51,610
We'll talk about storage formats for gas data like geo databases and something called Shape Files, and then we'll do some student led discussions.

113
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:57,190
We have two papers that will be discussed in class today, and then we'll do several lab activities.

114
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:07,390
We'll explore data, we'll learn about something called layouts as part of the pro application, and we'll learn how to share your layout file.

115
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:18,340
And then we'll do a classroom kind of activity where you'll work on your own to create a map layout using the data that I gave you.

116
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:25,450
Okay. And if we don't get to number six, which I hope we will, you can do that at home just to practice what we learned today.

117
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:33,430
Okay. Well, before we get started, are there any questions you guys may have for about anything so far in class?

118
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:41,260
Are folks getting their systems going at home with our guest pro?

119
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:47,290
I know some Mac users may be finding that a little bit of a challenge, but is it you're getting there?

120
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:55,330
Okay. Excellent. All right. So let's talk about where GI status comes from.

121
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:07,600
All right. So, guys, data is the one major element of GST that are geospatial information.

122
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:14,210
Meaning, where are the landmasses on the planet Earth?

123
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,580
And where are the water ways on the planet?

124
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,050
Okay. Where are the streets located?

125
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,240
All of that type of information. What's the shape of the planet?

126
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:35,800
There's some the term called geodesy, which means the study of the shape of the planet,

127
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,370
including the gravitational variation across the planet and so forth.

128
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,400
And that is kind of the core information that we use to create the maps that we work on in day to day basis.

129
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,860
And that includes things like, you know, satellites flying above the earth, doing remote sensing work.

130
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,599
Okay. A lot of those satellites are used now just to create the boundaries that we

131
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,100
need to know about the shape of the continents and countries and so forth,

132
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:11,140
but also all kinds of other information like, you know, wilderness areas, elevation, temperature, gravitational pull.

133
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,870
All of that information can be sent to the remote sensing satellites.

134
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:26,800
Other things that are used are aerial photography. We have these planes flying over the earth and taking pictures.

135
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:34,750
In the old days before we had satellites going up there that. So we were mapping out things and that still continues to happen all the time.

136
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:42,820
And that type of information is fed into creating pieces of land surveys.

137
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:52,660
Okay. Once you do this higher up imagery, there are people on cartographers on the ground and at the sea mapping optics.

138
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:58,060
Okay. And that that that data could be digitized.

139
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:06,910
Right now, land surveys, remote sensing, get a digitized into creating maps and use GPS systems to do some of that work.

140
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,930
So all of that work is trying to just gather information about the variation in the shape of the earth,

141
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,140
all the different features around the planet and so forth.

142
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:25,809
And that information is is processed through computer aided design software that you might use,

143
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:32,920
too, for architecture and things like that in engineering, right? To draw buildings and draw machines and stuff like that.

144
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:41,670
That same technology is used to translate this geospatial geodesy information into the maps that we see everyday and use everyday.

145
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:49,660
Okay, so it's not only so it digitizes this information and then it located on the planet.

146
00:15:50,830 --> 00:16:01,270
So each of the nine point pixel so forth in a, in a cad of of a map is a reference to a location on the planet.

147
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:08,660
So that's where the basic maps come from. And those are feed into what we call gas today.

148
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:14,110
But there are other sources of information that we require to do public health work.

149
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:23,140
For example, in terms of public health information, we can get health data that now can be linked with the CAD digitized maps.

150
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:33,520
We can have vital records, information like death rate death records and birth records that could be used as part of genius.

151
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:41,290
You can see birth rates, death rates, age specific death rates, case specific death rates,

152
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:47,290
those kinds of that kind of information can be included along with the line and

153
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:52,510
point and polygon drawings that you get from from CAD or even raster data.

154
00:16:53,770 --> 00:17:02,020
We have health surveillance information like we have national health interview surveys.

155
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:06,140
We have the Michigan Department of Health Surveys of the country.

156
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,130
We have disease registries that are also surveillance systems.

157
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:20,560
All of that are that are geographically linked to the drawings that are created through this part of the the figure here.

158
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,030
These sources. So these kind of work together to create maps.

159
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:31,770
The US Census is another powerful tool where we get this information that's public health related,

160
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,440
and we'll learn how to access some of this information. In this course.

161
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,800
We'll look at disease registries, where the cancer registries in this class,

162
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:46,990
and we'll look at the US census and try to bring in data from those sources to create these projects in this place.

163
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,980
And you will also do some of this yourself and look at other sources of health data

164
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,020
that might be relevant for your specific projects in your work beyond this class.

165
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:06,040
There may be also data about resources in the community that are not necessarily health focused but are related to health.

166
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:16,710
Right. Where are schools located? Churches, hospital clinics, community centers, parks, green spaces and so on.

167
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,870
So many different resources could be mapped out because all of these things are they have addresses, right?

168
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,979
And you can look at them on a planet earth and then you can do something with them

169
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,000
in trying to understand where are these resources distributed in your community,

170
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,870
how accessible they are, and are the clustering similar or not, etc.?

171
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:44,230
And you can also get information about health hazards that could be linked to a gas.

172
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:59,470
Environmental hazards like air pollution, chemical pollution in the waterways or the land itself fires, you know, extreme weather patterns.

173
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:05,590
Those kinds of things are hazards, and they can have spatial information embedded within them,

174
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:12,760
which you could link to information you get from your kid, drawings that are spatially referenced.

175
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:20,920
And then you can get information that is not available from existing sources that you collect on your own because

176
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:27,580
you can find data about things that you care about for your specific project or your interest in public health.

177
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:33,530
So you collect that data on your own. For example, had the student in class who collected data on edible plants.

178
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:39,470
They were interested in, you know, issues around finding edible plants in the public space.

179
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:40,730
All right.

180
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:49,430
So they would go around town and map where trees are hanging in the public places and where fruit may be available or you may find herbs and so forth.

181
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:54,530
Um, so that kind of data is hard to find in existing data source.

182
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,420
So you really need to collect it yourself.

183
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:09,460
Some of them I work in India with not much tobacco outlets or tobacco retailers in the US and many places like Michigan, California.

184
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:20,690
They have retail licensing laws for tobacco, so you can get a generated list of addresses from those licenses and get a secondary source mapping out.

185
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:27,830
But in India, we don't have that type of legislation in many parts of the country.

186
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,009
Exclude most 99% of the country. So we have to map ourselves.

187
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:40,550
So we have our field workers go out and map out all the different tobacco outlets in the city neighborhoods.

188
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:47,510
And we use that information with some surveillance data to understand the link between outlets and behavior.

189
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:54,080
So you can collect all kinds of data yourself and then bring that into NCIS.

190
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,160
So guys is consist of many different data sources.

191
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,960
Some of them are health related. Some of them you will never really see.

192
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:10,640
For many of the work that you do, that's more of the raw data of of a GIS that comes through remote sensing,

193
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:17,150
which is turned into lines and points and polygons and and raster data.

194
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:23,840
So all of this is where we bring this stuff together to to in our guys work.

195
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:29,120
So part of what your job will be in class is to not to this part of the work.

196
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:29,870
Right.

197
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:42,470
These are things we can download from and from, from and through the census to get information about the US boundaries and roads and things like that.

198
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:50,780
You can get them from other governmental sources like local or other country sources for your actual base.

199
00:21:52,940 --> 00:22:03,679
That might be smart because that means something else in the U.S. but as a the draw maps that you work with and you link those with health records,

200
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:08,180
resources, hazards and data, you may collect yourself.

201
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:23,270
So now when you get this type of data, the data from here, this part of the diagram, you can get that data in vector formats or raster formats.

202
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,820
And we talked a little bit about this. These are two different data models that are computerized, digitized images of maps.

203
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:38,550
And the vector model is basically made up of lines, points, lines and areas of polygons.

204
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,919
And it uses a Cartesian system with ex wife coordinates and Z coordinates.

205
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:51,480
If you have a 3D map for elevation, but especially the coordinate system that based on the Cartesian system that we all grew up with,

206
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:56,940
and he uses that basic system to draw maps.

207
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:02,940
So in this system, the surface is always cleaner, meaning it's flat, right?

208
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,590
So it's either a line polygons or all flat.

209
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,709
So there's no much curvature in the system.

210
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:15,900
So you can't really do good work with data on elevation and things like that.

211
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:25,740
And each line, each point, each area is geo referenced, meaning you know where it is on the planet Earth.

212
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:31,400
So there's a geospatial coordinate assigned to each point, each line.

213
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,880
So each point on the line is referenced geospatial in each.

214
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:40,260
Each point that will make up a polygon or an area is also geo referenced.

215
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:48,500
And the other thing is each point line an area will have other information linked to it.

216
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:54,620
For example, a point may represent points, may represent schools, for example.

217
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,580
So we will have information about those schools, like the name of the school or the address of the school,

218
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,510
or how many kids go to school there, that type of information.

219
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:11,810
So each line will have been associated with, for example, if a line is representing a street,

220
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:19,910
it will have the name of a street, maybe, you know, the east side or the west side of the street.

221
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:25,250
How wide the street might be. That type of information link to.

222
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:33,799
So each or each of these features will have attribute data associated with them.

223
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:39,740
And we'll talk about those words in a few minutes. So this is what a vector data model would look like.

224
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,450
All right. We could have had this x y graph.

225
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:52,340
You have points that may represent something. You will have a line and you will have an area representing something.

226
00:24:53,750 --> 00:25:00,320
And these are the location on this Cartesian grid indicates the location of the plane.

227
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:11,960
So all of these geographic geometric features are have a coordinated system attached to it, and there are multitude of different systems.

228
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,300
We'll talk about those in class, as class and on.

229
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:22,370
And that's the way we figure out where things are located on the grid and how those things are located in relation to each other.

230
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,150
So what are some pros and cons of a vector data model? Some pros are.

231
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:39,830
The maps can be had the same resolution no matter how close you zoom in or how far you zoom out.

232
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:50,450
I don't know if any of you guys have worked with Photoshop or Illustrator or things like that in terms of graphic design.

233
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:57,200
But in those programs, you can save the images you create in a vector data model.

234
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:03,530
And when you do that, you can zoom in and out of whatever picture you create and not lose any resolution.

235
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:09,260
So in the same way, when you use vector data models in making maps, the same benefit applies.

236
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:16,580
Okay. So it creates esthetically pleasing maps with no jagged edges and stuff like that if you need to zoom in.

237
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:24,170
Okay. And most of the jazz maps, especially in the public health world, will come in vector formats.

238
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:33,500
But the cons are continuous data like elevation and all represented.

239
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,490
Like I was saying, you know, the surfaces are plain or they're flat surfaces.

240
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:43,160
So if you have one point indicating, you know, a base of a mountain,

241
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:51,380
another point indicating another base point on a mountain and a third point indicating elevation, you can only get one elevation point.

242
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,660
You need multiple elevation points to get a contour. Okay.

243
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:02,270
So that kind of stuff is really hard to represent. You have many times you see contour lines for for mountains and hills like that.

244
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:10,120
Right. So those counter this one way represent elevation in and using vector models.

245
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:20,780
Now then location of vertices, if there is a two lines crossing each other or pothole or two polygons intersecting somewhere,

246
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:30,320
that data sometimes need to be held in a separate store explicitly that there is an interaction between vertices in order.

247
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:36,920
And that spatial data analysis can be very CPU intensive in vector data models.

248
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,580
Luckily, computers are amazing.

249
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:49,280
Now they're super fast and we don't really suffer from too much computational difficulty when we learn our geospatial analysis.

250
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:55,990
But you will find that when we do work in this class, some of the stuff we do will take a little bit time to run it because it does.

251
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,470
It is computer intensive,

252
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:07,520
so it's nice to have a more modern machine in your machine or a lot of ram on your machine so that your your work is more efficient.

253
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,110
So don't get too discourage if it takes a little time. Nothing is wrong.

254
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:17,389
You just have to wait until the process runs and it's all going to be okay and usually doesn't

255
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:21,140
take more than like 10 seconds and stuff like that to do the stuff we do in this class.

256
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:28,930
Raster data models are a model that use pixels to draw a computer estimate.

257
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:38,750
So, so it's basically a photograph. So each pixel in the photograph is a point.

258
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:51,380
So the way you create points, I mean, lines and polygons in a raster model is you link points to create lines and you link lines to creates areas.

259
00:28:52,010 --> 00:29:01,219
Okay. So it's like in the problem with well again in this situation, the surfaces are also quite cleaner.

260
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:06,390
It's hard to represent elevation in raster data models to that.

261
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:13,160
The thing about the Raster Mall in terms of geo referencing is I see you took a aerial picture of this university,

262
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,079
the School of Public Health, for example.

263
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:23,450
In the surrounding areas, you will only need to really know the resolution of that picture and your reference one point on that picture,

264
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:29,749
and then the computer can geo reference all the other points based on where that one point is located.

265
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:37,160
So it's good for geo referencing aerial photography and communication on the planet.

266
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:46,670
And again, each pixel or series of pixels will have information associated with it, just like in a vector model.

267
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:55,970
So this is a raster data model for the same thing we saw earlier, where instead of a Cartesian,

268
00:29:56,030 --> 00:30:01,970
x y system or x, y, z system, you just have a grid of many, many pixels.

269
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:09,890
And so each point, each pixel in the grid will be a point.

270
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:14,570
So this is all dependent on how high of a resolution you have for your image.

271
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:19,730
So lower the resolution of the image the larger each point needs to be.

272
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:29,990
And, and so there should be a lot of error in terms of GIA referencing a specific area on a map if you don't have a high resolution raster.

273
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:41,060
So the pros and cons of raster data models and or the pros are, like I said earlier,

274
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:46,940
you can all you really need to geo reference one point to one pixel and the image and the

275
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:53,149
rest of them will be to reference in the implicit way and spatial data analysis is less

276
00:30:53,150 --> 00:31:01,040
computer intensive interested in a model versus a vector model and discrete and continuous

277
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:09,500
to a better accommodated in the raster model as opposed to the cons are as I said,

278
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:14,150
the pixel size is limited to the resolution of maps or the point.

279
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:21,740
An individual point is really limited by how well that image is in terms of resolution.

280
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,280
And the output resolution is also limited by the original image.

281
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:35,210
And when you zoom in, things can get very blurry in a master data model as opposed to a vector data model.

282
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:43,580
It's hard to represent linear features. For example, do you see this line if you don't have a good resolution?

283
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:48,649
This line has a lot of jagged edges to it as opposed to a vector model.

284
00:31:48,650 --> 00:32:03,140
You can get nice curved lines because each line is a point that has infinite resolution and the kinds is the most data are in vector format.

285
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:12,230
So if you need to work with the raster data for some reason, you'd have to convert the rest vector data into a master data model and then use it.

286
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,510
So you may have limited access to raster model G as data are out there.

287
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:28,940
So this is looking at the same image to say this is the real world and turning it into a raster model versus the vector model, right?

288
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:38,690
So the river here is represented by a series of pixels and a raster model and here it's a series of points.

289
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:46,430
In a vector model there is a park, so the areas are a series of points as well.

290
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:51,140
And here how this the park might be shown.

291
00:32:52,580 --> 00:33:01,700
Here is a house and this is also, I guess another neighbor park or something like that.

292
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,239
So you can represent the real world in an raster data model.

293
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:11,480
We're about to do the model and for this class will be exclusively using vector models.

294
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:17,450
But I just want you to be aware of these types of models out there when you do run into them and

295
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:26,450
some of you guys who may have a project in class that is maybe more environmentally focused,

296
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:33,620
for example, have students do work on flooding and fires and climate issues.

297
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:40,610
Those data sometimes you get in a master format and then if you do come across, then we'll talk about how to use that.

298
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,510
But almost all the maps we'll use in class are a vector model.

299
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,500
So yeah, do you have a personal preference between these two when you're doing your work or.

300
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:54,649
Well, the project I have always used vector models in my work.

301
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:58,730
I think it's a set of preference really. It's really what's available out there.

302
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:09,350
So in all our work, we'll be linking, you know, most of the survey data, surveillance data with existing maps in terms of,

303
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:15,770
you know, states, census tracts, schools, all of that stuff is available in vector formats.

304
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:26,479
Yeah. Because your hand up over your pocket or so let's talk about the word feature.

305
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:33,650
What does that mean? Because I use it in the class and it's used all the time in the in the work that we'll do in class.

306
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:45,290
So a feature is a representation of a real world object ornament that means that the say the real world object is a clip.

307
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:56,060
So the feature on the map would be that specific clinic, that one clinic on the and or the school of Public Health,

308
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:05,990
one building the speech, one that will be one feature usually represented by a point or polygons because it does take up space, right?

309
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:13,040
More than just a point. So you can represent the school, the polygon, the footprint of the building could be a polygon.

310
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:17,460
And that would be one feature. One of the. Okay.

311
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,330
And so rivers, parks, houses and schools.

312
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:28,200
Just in the previous image, we saw river one river, one park, one house that might have been a school grounds.

313
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:34,160
So those are individual features on that map.

314
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:45,870
Now, what is a feature class? So feature classes as defined by history or homogeneous collection of common features,

315
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:53,280
each having the same spatial representation such as point line or polygon in a common set of attributes.

316
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:58,620
For example, a line feature may represent rude center lines.

317
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:07,080
So in this new map that we just saw when we talked about raster and vector data models, there was one river.

318
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,340
But if you expanded that map out and zoomed out and looked at the area around it,

319
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:16,890
there could be multiple rivers on that map and those rivers would be one feature class.

320
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,420
And they say there were multiple houses on that map.

321
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:30,940
So all those houses would be a feature class, many parks and all those parks would be one feature class.

322
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:35,050
And each feature class really translates into one layer of data.

323
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:45,310
Okay. So if you drew that map, this this map, this map, you would have three layers of data, one representing rivers,

324
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:53,170
one representing parks, maybe for actually one representing homes and one representing school campuses.

325
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,080
So each feature classes translates to a layer.

326
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:04,630
You talk about layers. What's an attribute?

327
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:13,000
Well, so attributes are non spatial information about a specific feature in a GI,

328
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:25,480
and this information is usually stored in a table and that table is linked to that feature using a unique, unique identifier.

329
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:31,000
Okay. So let's say there were ten homes on the map we just looked at.

330
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:37,180
Each home will have a unique identifier associated with the number one, two, three, four, five,

331
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:46,500
etc. and that information will be linked to a table that tells you, well, the address for this home is this okay?

332
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:53,770
Well, the age of this home is something else. If you have the number of people living in that home, there's another attribute.

333
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:59,890
So attributes and features work together when we create maps.

334
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,100
So in this example, it talks about a river.

335
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:12,910
So river might have that river that we looked at may have a name, sediment, load, etc., that type of information.

336
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:19,660
And that information is not stored in the spatial data stored in the non spatial data in a table.

337
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:32,890
Okay. Then we looked at lung cancer mortality last time, right at the state level and I think it was county level sorry.

338
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,920
And the counties were the feature classes.

339
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:46,540
A specific county is a feature and the lung cancer rate for that county is the attribute in that

340
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:53,800
lung cancer rate data is housed in the table when we looked at those attribute tables and class.

341
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:02,140
Okay, so, so in the table attribute table, the feature is stored in a row.

342
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:09,280
So each row is a feature, each county, for example, in the United States.

343
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:16,090
And that attribute the characteristic of that row where that feature is stored in the column.

344
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:23,650
Yes, it is analogous to other data you might see for your projects in public health,

345
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:28,570
where you have each rule might be a participant in a study or a pro program,

346
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:41,230
and then each variable will be a column active participant, sex, age, race, health status, etc. We call those fields or variables.

347
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,570
We call those things attributes. In fact, this label.

348
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,320
Any questions or thoughts so far?

349
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,830
Probably pretty clear. Okay.

350
00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:03,510
Now, let's talk about how these guys see this store and how this market is store data.

351
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:13,320
Specifically, you are going to find the distorted view of databases that we talked about a bit,

352
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:22,110
and those are newer formats of spatial in attribute data and what we call shaped files which are older.

353
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:26,010
4 minutes. Well, the same type of information.

354
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:37,260
So it's you database can store information about features or future classes attributes separately, just tables independently.

355
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:41,040
And then it would be linked to the feature by a unique identifier.

356
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:54,750
People hold other data bases as well, like Microsoft Access databases, for example, or relational databases.

357
00:40:55,530 --> 00:41:01,440
They give or hold all the mapped documents that you may have created through other mapping projects and so forth.

358
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:12,810
So it's a place to hold all this information in one easy to use spot and it has an extension GDB for GM databases.

359
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,260
There are three types of geo databases.

360
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:29,070
In our case, file your bases, mobile duty databases and enterprise view databases and ties will be using file dual databases exclusively,

361
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:37,480
so they use multiple files and folders and the max size of that as your database is one terabyte.

362
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:44,070
If you have a bigger due date, more information will have to create to geo databases to work on a single project.

363
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:55,620
Mobile geo databases are used for mobile applications and so forth, and we will be using those in class.

364
00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:03,480
An enterprise duo databases are virtually limitless and they're used for doing guest services.

365
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:15,330
For example, uh, Google Map is an enterprise is, is a, is a, is a j a service because you talk to it, you ask it something.

366
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:24,690
It's, it's something that's out, right? And those types of maps which you interact with use enterprise databases.

367
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:31,350
We will be just using file duo databases. So you kind of need to know that because you have to choose options when you do

368
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:35,340
your work and you know which one to choose when you try to create a geo database.

369
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:40,230
All right. Let's talk about shape files for a few minutes.

370
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:50,490
Now, suppose, you know, store the same kind of information that you databases do in many ways, but they hold them all in separate files.

371
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:54,610
And they're they're hard to organize.

372
00:42:54,810 --> 00:43:00,930
They're cumbersome to work with. Okay. So the whole, you know, information about feature classes, attributes,

373
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:07,800
projection information, index files and so forth, they'll come in a collection of files.

374
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,500
So these are all shape files. What I've listed here is,

375
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:21,720
is something called a shape sheet by there's an attribute shape file with an index sheet file projection, simple spatial index.

376
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,820
You'll find other types of shape as well.

377
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:31,620
And you need to you will need at least these for that I've highlighted to make your project work.

378
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:44,280
Okay. So the feature class information is held in a shape shape that in part in GIO databases, they're just called feature classes.

379
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:51,270
Attribute information is holding a a dbf file, a database for a shift in baseball.

380
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:58,569
And it has information about what's in the shape sheet bottom right and index shape

381
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:05,540
file for the the DB of the message people communicate with each other in a projection.

382
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:14,280
Simple, not always necessary, but good to have. Tells you how to project the data so you can map it properly on the surface of the pool.

383
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:25,800
So when you work with shape files, you have to download all of these files together to to make that specific the shape file.

384
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:32,220
The shape shape file actually work. All right. So you will find shape files when you do your work out there.

385
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:36,330
You may not find everything in your database. And especially if you're looking at older information,

386
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:43,190
you just need to convert that into and put that into your database before you work with it in practice.

387
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,310
Look, if you are using the desktop version of.

388
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:51,880
You can still work with chip files directly, but we're not doing that anymore.

389
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:56,530
And it's relatively easy to turn cheap files and put them into databases.

390
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,270
You just have to go one extra step, right?

391
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:16,549
Okay, great. So just to summarize this information, our data consist of cartographic data created by remote sensing and surveys,

392
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:25,490
all kind of stuff into turn into a digitized maps using the CAD software in the company in either vector arrest or formats,

393
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:42,649
we'll use mostly vector formats and class and feature classification data, meaning where all the feature classes on a map, meaning drivers, schools,

394
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:48,050
etc. Their location data is also held in vector formats,

395
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:57,829
attribute tables and data tables or databases such as census data, surveillance data, business data, data.

396
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:05,780
You will collect yourself during different projects. Those are all attribute data and they all can work together.

397
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:14,900
These three work together to create a gas in our most data is currently stored in two databases in shape,

398
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:22,120
and over time I've noticed that more and more data are now in fewer databases and I see less and less sheep.

399
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:26,600
But as time goes on, I think over time the shape of will just disappear.

400
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:32,090
But you'll just need to be aware of them because you may encounter them and you just need to know what to do with them.

401
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,410
Any questions or comments and confusions.

402
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:51,080
All right, great. So that ends my little lecture section of the course today.

403
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:56,479
We're going to move on to doing the student led discussions and then we'll take a

404
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,920
break for about 10 minutes and then we'll do lab work for the remainder of the class.

405
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:07,190
And that way you'll get to kind of exercise some of the stuff we talked about today and last time and try to create a map.

406
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:13,819
So you think we're pretty good on time? Yeah, it's been about 15 minutes.

407
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:18,170
So let's do the two student led discussions. We'll start with Megan Lewis first.

408
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:22,849
I don't have your slides. I just. You just shared it with me.

409
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:34,040
Did you email them to me? Yeah. Okay, let me open them up and then you can come up and then Shelby can come next and let me get on my email here.

410
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:57,500
Okay. I think that I'll get better in a few seconds.

411
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:11,120
Hmm. There you go.

412
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:16,610
Okay, this is Margaret.

413
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:22,460
And take it away with your. You.

414
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:33,970
All right. Hi, everyone.

415
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:44,650
My name's Megan, and I'll be presenting on the probably the book reading, which chapter one was just titled Geographic Information Systems.

416
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:55,390
So starting with some definitions of GIS, the author talked about how there's really not like a consensus definition of goals,

417
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,450
as the acronym has several different uses.

418
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:04,180
Some people will talk about it as a technology, others as a research field, and others still as a community.

419
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:13,540
The author did define jazz as a technology, as computer based systems for the integration and analysis of due to geographic data.

420
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,440
So we'll kind of move through this presentation using that definition.

421
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,530
Um, but a first kind of discussion question no wrong answers.

422
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:30,729
It's kind of an opinion. QUESTION Do you think it's important to have a universal definition of GIS and kind of a follow up to that.

423
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:37,740
What are the implications of defining it as a research field or as a community in addition to or like rather than a technology?

424
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:49,950
I think it's not from my personal perspective, it's not as important to have a universal definition that's just one definition,

425
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:56,410
because clearly it does a lot of things and can, you know, reach into a bunch of different sectors.

426
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:01,030
So it would be more confusing then, I think to have one universal definition.

427
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:06,220
Yeah, it's a good that. Yes.

428
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:08,410
Just further implications.

429
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:18,220
You'd probably just have to take some extra care to specify what you're referring to in terms of guidance when you're presenting just sharing data.

430
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:25,870
Yeah, I agree. I think I thought it was interesting that it has these kind of additional definitions.

431
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:30,000
I definitely came into this class thinking of it more just as a technology.

432
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:35,400
So especially the idea of it being a community was kind of interesting.

433
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:40,770
So this was definitely the most technical part of the reading.

434
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:47,280
But basically the author laid out these three broad categorizations of just functions.

435
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:53,580
And he noted that there's like different ways that you can classify or arrange these functions.

436
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,979
But he did it by user terms.

437
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:04,950
So that's basically saying practically what people, particularly public health professionals for this chapter might want to do with spatial data.

438
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:13,260
Um, so the three main functions you can see there, and we'll start with spatial database management.

439
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:19,650
So this would include activities like creating databases of health events,

440
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:28,260
keeping track of changes by adding or deleting events from those databases and also adding the location of these events.

441
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:37,060
Um, so functionally database management systems or DB arms are used to store or retrieve and manipulate data in a database.

442
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:43,020
And I won't go into all three types of these for kind of time purposes.

443
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:53,639
But to give one example of relational DB VMs, they basically manage data as a collection of tables and data,

444
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:58,170
and different tables can be linked when there are common attributes among the tables.

445
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:05,820
So tables could include things like, you know, an individual diagnosed with a certain disease or disorder.

446
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:09,000
And then also another table might be like a hazardous waste site.

447
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:17,220
And you can see here kind of that, um, the figure shows how these different sources can be linked,

448
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:21,210
um, when there are these common attributes and different tables.

449
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,410
So the next main function that the author talked about was visualization and mapping.

450
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:36,780
So we know that gas obviously makes it possible to view data in the form of tables, graphs, maps and statistics.

451
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:46,710
We also know from other classes doing readings, it can be really difficult to see trends when it's just presented in tabular format.

452
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:55,590
So the author provided some examples of tables, graphs and maps using, I think like fictitious data.

453
00:52:56,490 --> 00:53:05,190
So another question for the Class one and why might you want to use a table to report data versus graph versus map?

454
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:10,920
One, would it be kind of appropriate or best to use these different forms?

455
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,450
I could do maybe one or two of them.

456
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:31,210
So I spin the table like in a paper or you're talking to like another group of, like, researchers.

457
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:38,079
Like a map. Or if you're doing a presentation presentations like a community partners or either like less interested or like,

458
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:42,840
listen, admitted with like this one data. I'm not sure about.

459
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:50,749
You take the third one? No, that's that's a good answer.

460
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:57,470
So, like, thinking of your audience can change maybe one, you'd want to use these different formats if you have anything.

461
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:01,400
Yeah, I mean, I really view the community finance piece.

462
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:09,320
I think graphs and maps are often more helpful in that regard for people who are less familiar with academic people,

463
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:17,330
but I also think for maps and particular spatial components.

464
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:23,600
So you're really trying to understand the geography of this area that's particularly

465
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:30,389
helpful and you're just not going to get that from a table or anything. I do.

466
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:32,190
It depends on what you're trying to portray.

467
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:38,679
So, like, trying to over time would be a lot easier on a graph so you can see how it changes versus like a table.

468
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:46,260
And it's important to know exactly the amount or the difference in change or the correlation versus like a map would show you,

469
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:51,300
like a snapshot in time where things are geographically.

470
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:55,680
So and I think it also depends on how like what you're trying to show. Yeah.

471
00:54:56,490 --> 00:55:02,070
So I just wanted to avoid I think tables are useful because that's how you actually start to graph data.

472
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:10,350
So you compile a data like that and then you go into the graphs and the maps for, you know, for more visual purposes.

473
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:15,260
Yeah. Great. I think you all hit on a lot of good points.

474
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:26,389
I think the reading also talked about how one critique of using maps could be that they might be misinterpreted by certain audiences,

475
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:30,110
or if it's not mapped correctly, that can be obviously problematic.

476
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:36,200
Um, so moving on to the third function, spatial analysis.

477
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:44,149
Um, so this function would include things like analysis of spatial relationships among health events stored

478
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:49,730
in these databases and also creating new classes of health patterns based on those relationships.

479
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:58,910
Um, so spatial analysis kind of a definition. It's the ability to manipulate spatial data into different forms and extract additional meaning.

480
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:09,690
Um, and again, for time purposes, I'm not going to go into all of these, but there are five different classes of spatial analysis injuries.

481
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,400
Um, and to kind of pick one that I thought was interesting.

482
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:21,740
Network analysis is defined as or it investigates flows through different networks.

483
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:29,030
So the example here is like in a network of streets, finding a the quickest path for an emergency vehicle to use.

484
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,720
That would be an example of network analysis.

485
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:43,110
Can anyone remember any of the other classes of spacial analysis or if you can't define it, like give kind of a broad example.

486
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:53,850
Give example for the measurements you're going to think of, like have a measurement between like every refinery,

487
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:59,840
like elementary schools or something like that, and measuring how far apart they are.

488
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,690
Yeah, that's a great example.

489
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:12,110
Measurement was the type of class that basically allows you to like calculate distance between points and I think also along like curved lines.

490
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:16,310
I believe anyone else remember any of the other ones?

491
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:26,650
I know they're kind of technical definitions. We'll stick with the measurement example.

492
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:37,749
Okay. So the author also provided some history on both kind of general trends and applications of jazz,

493
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:42,520
as well as specific public health applications of jazz surgeries.

494
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:51,160
Look through this pretty quickly at the state level, transportation and environmental management agencies were the earliest adopters of jazz.

495
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:59,500
So in most states, the rating was saying it was one of those two departments that kind of took the lead on implementation.

496
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:05,350
Applications of jazz in public health expanded rapidly during the 1990s,

497
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:11,320
particularly due to this growing interest in environmental health and things like risk assessments.

498
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:17,020
Another date that I thought was important or interesting to note by 2000,

499
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:24,670
international organizations like the UN had initiated jazz programs in the W.H.O. and other kind of major agencies.

500
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:32,950
And then kind of a main theme I thought throughout these sections was the author really called Attention to like the

501
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:41,110
rapid growth and diffusion of jazz really depended on developments in these kind of hardware and spatial databases.

502
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:50,590
So that would be things like larger hardware batteries for lower costs or like improvement of graphics performance, I think was another one.

503
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:58,390
So a good portion of the reading kind of focused on these historical trends in Greece.

504
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:04,380
So another kind of an opinion question. Do you think it's important for public health practitioners, I guess,

505
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:14,100
who like more like practitioners who might use judges to have a basic understanding of these histories, of these trends and why or not?

506
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:31,919
That's right. I don't know if it's important for them to necessarily understand the history of jazz and kind of how it came to be in the South.

507
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:42,060
But more definitely understanding that is a tool that they can use to express different trends and stuff that's easy to read and understand.

508
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:51,240
Yeah. I it's the you mentioned something about some of its origins in the military.

509
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:57,889
I kind of find that it's like, Oh, that's an interesting way to use this technology.

510
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:02,390
And I think there should be some awareness of like it may seem like it's a neutral tool,

511
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:10,490
but that you can't assume that just because you're putting this seemingly neutral data onto a seemingly neutral whatever form of visualizing it,

512
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:14,630
that it could be used in that way. Like, yeah, think about complications, I guess.

513
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:18,130
Yeah, that's a really good point. I agree with.

514
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:24,229
That's just how new it is. I think that if you go into a technological field,

515
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:30,770
sometimes people assume that everyone has heard of it or everyone understands it, because to you it feels really old.

516
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:37,790
But when you look at the actual history of it, I mean, it was only in 2000 when government agency started to use it.

517
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:43,670
And even now it's just finding its way into all of these more like colloquial spaces and.

518
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:55,700
Any other last thoughts on this? Sounds like maybe understanding kind of a super basic timeline as well as a game saying more like

519
01:00:56,210 --> 01:01:01,160
applications and how it's been applied is more important than having like a thorough history.

520
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:10,610
Okay. So wrapping up, there is also a section again, pretty technical on jazz and the Internet.

521
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:17,180
Kind of the most important point that I pulled from it personally was that publication

522
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:22,270
and dissemination of spatial data are also really important jazz related activities,

523
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:26,690
and obviously the advancement of the Internet has further enabled that.

524
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:34,669
A good example from the reading about kind of the Internet drawing attention to maybe maps and

525
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:41,300
cartography and some of these technologies would be Google Earth and Google Maps or Street View,

526
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:49,010
and particularly not only their publication on that, but their availability to the general public, I think has been really helpful.

527
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:56,870
So kind of thinking about the implications of this in the Internet.

528
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:05,830
What are some examples of ways that jazz and the Internet can be used for advocacy efforts or to work towards health equity?

529
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:09,950
So kind of applying this to some of our other classes in HPC.

530
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:20,190
So I was thinking about how long we've been seeing. I think a lot of people,

531
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:25,739
a lot more people maybe are more familiar with like guys in the sense that we like when we were seeing like Corbin Reid and stuff

532
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:32,400
like The New York Times was updating that like United States Mountain with like the colors of where cases were more concentrated.

533
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:38,490
So I think in applying that to advocacy, that that's where like public health departments can look to where to center efforts

534
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:42,960
because they can see where higher rates are concentrated to disperse resources that way.

535
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:49,080
Yeah, that's a really good example. I didn't think of that like the those coconuts are so common.

536
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:54,000
Any other ideas going on, which I never said,

537
01:02:54,480 --> 01:03:02,700
like even just to identify where resources currently are showing me about things like whether people have access to

538
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:10,919
COVID resources or like mental health resources are continually and equitably distributed across the United States.

539
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:14,370
And so like, you know, identifying where those are.

540
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:22,730
And then so as a way to help you all find them, if they're like trying to through them, but also to talk about like look,

541
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:30,240
visualizing that an equitable distribution and thinking about ways that we can increase resource heavy places.

542
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:39,540
Yeah. That's a good example. Um, something that just I kind of thought about, too, was just like social media being part of the internet.

543
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:45,390
Like disseminating information using basic maps via social media could be another way.

544
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:52,410
Any last thoughts on this one? All right.

545
01:03:52,420 --> 01:04:01,810
So just to wrap up. Strengths and weaknesses of the reading, I thought it gave a really strong overview of these kind of three main functions,

546
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:09,520
particularly for public health practitioners. I also thought the graphs and maps were really helpful,

547
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:15,190
particularly in that visualization and mapping section where he gave like the fictitious data examples.

548
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:23,410
Potential weaknesses like that. Parts of that might be overly technical depending on the audience.

549
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:27,700
It was of it was hard for me to understand the really technical definitions.

550
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:35,920
And then I also noticed for kind of the historical trends. I know this was published in 2012, so it's a decade old,

551
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:43,690
but I thought they focused a lot on the nineties and early 2000 and didn't really lead up to like the publication date.

552
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:49,630
So I think I'd be interested in kind of an updated version of this and seeing where things are now.

553
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:56,590
And I think that's it. Yeah. Any other thoughts on chapter one?

554
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:21,370
Right now, right. The question about Internet was great.

555
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:27,640
All the questions are great. But just to kind of add a little bit, too, there's something called, you know, crowdsourcing data.

556
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:34,000
So now they're crowdsourcing apps, which is really kind of interesting way of thinking about map making.

557
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:40,899
I think that's another way to think about advocacy and thinking about how you may engage

558
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:46,090
communities into kind of understanding their environments from a health perspective.

559
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:48,840
There's even something called Open Street Maps,

560
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:57,520
which then actually exists for the whole world in being populated and continuously updated by the people on the ground.

561
01:05:58,090 --> 01:06:03,790
Regular citizens creating maps. Because remember, all the maps we see now are created by businesses.

562
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:07,660
So what do they put on there? Things that make them money.

563
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:15,790
So we need maps out there created by regular people and maybe other types of features becoming prominent, stuff like that.

564
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:21,430
So there's the Internet and just that whole intersection is really, really exciting.

565
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:26,890
So I'm really glad you asked that question. So just one of two bits.

566
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:31,450
Where are you? Very.

567
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:45,880
Let's hear it. Okay.

568
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:52,170
So. Hi, my name's Shelby. The article that I'll be talking about is mapping the racial equity in place,

569
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:56,970
using your perceptions to identify unequal exposure to neighborhood environmental hazards.

570
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:03,030
So first, just a little about the study setting. So this study took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

571
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:10,860
More specifically from the neighborhood of Homewood, which is a low income black community on the east side of Pittsburgh.

572
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:18,690
So I'll quote from the article Homewood is plagued by gun violence, high rates of school failure and disproportionate social services involvement.

573
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:29,730
Around 55% of parcels, including land structure and homeware, are vacant, and 22.3% of all buildings in Homewood had correlation to 2010.

574
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:33,360
There's also some stark racial disparities in Pittsburgh.

575
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:40,140
Only 3% of poor white children live in Pittsburgh's high poverty neighborhoods, compared to nearly 40% of black children.

576
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:51,630
And they use this information to determine that Pittsburgh was the place to do this study on racial inequality and neighborhood context among youth.

577
01:07:52,830 --> 01:08:04,620
So the data methods the data was collected between 2010 and 2014 using a mixed methods, community based participatory research approach.

578
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:13,320
They did participatory photo mapping, which combines photography and to neighborhood tours, in-depth interviews with youth and spatial analysis.

579
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:19,260
The sample were youth who are members of two summer youth programs and Homeward,

580
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:23,560
and a majority were from a program that included daily activities related to environmental issues.

581
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:32,829
So really key part of why they chose this group and remaining youth were from academic enrichment programs and the products they came out with.

582
01:08:32,830 --> 01:08:37,290
For 15 hours of transcribed interviews, over 100 youth authored photos of neighborhoods,

583
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:42,170
children, witnesses and youth generating maps and presentations.

584
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:51,270
These created to highlight their research findings. So I split up the youth, identify themes, and I'll talk about each one separately.

585
01:08:51,270 --> 01:09:00,720
But the first one they identified was stereotypes about race and poverty and their relationship to environmental strategies and disparities.

586
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:04,950
Number two was high prevalence of vacant and deteriorated land and housing.

587
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:09,630
Number three was symbols of disorder, including litter, and number four was exposure to violence.

588
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,770
So this is the first thing they kind of addressed in the article.

589
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:20,010
So you've reported that Homewood and other predominantly black communities in Pittsburgh are very stereotyped

590
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:27,900
who describe these stereotypes by outsiders using distinct racial undertones such as Ghetto and a few others.

591
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:33,960
And they mention that the stigma attitudes around the communities are a cause for environmental disparities.

592
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:39,630
And 20 low poverty, predominantly white neighborhoods.

593
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:42,779
But there's only one low poverty black neighborhoods.

594
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:46,320
And then they also found that two predominately white neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, not high poverty.

595
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:52,950
Yet there are 17 high poverty black neighborhoods, and they use the map to visualize that.

596
01:09:54,750 --> 01:10:03,270
So the second one, symbols of disorder youth reported their perceptions that the city doesn't really adequately care

597
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:08,080
for the property and that residents not care about the physical conditions in the community.

598
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:13,889
And they also accounted for the social context of neighborhoods and how their

599
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:18,600
perceptions of it affect what services and resources community communities get,

600
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:24,600
and that the presence of litter and garbage stigmatize the community and hurts the overall impression of the community.

601
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,810
And it's an indicator of environmental problems and public neglect.

602
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:31,770
However, even though they've got this information from the youth that they're working with,

603
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:35,759
they found no statistically significant correlation between the number of

604
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:40,170
illegal dumping sites in the community and the percentage of black residents.

605
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:46,980
And I kind of put these next to each other to kind of compare and maybe talk about the maps if

606
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:53,460
anyone had any notes or anything that they found particularly interesting or stand out about them.

607
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:13,020
I know it's kind of hard to see the the far right corner where you see the darkest color like this kind of sticking out.

608
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:16,040
That's where Holmwood is as well.

609
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:27,460
But. So it just seems like the areas you described.

610
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:37,750
Mm hmm. Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking as I was comparing the two, for sure.

611
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:46,040
So the third one is housing abandonment and vacancies.

612
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:52,040
You've reported that many of the housing in the area is neglected and identified

613
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:55,190
abandoned vacancies of properties as a prominent issue in the community.

614
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:59,840
They said that they can see it facilitate crime and negative health behaviors.

615
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:05,479
In the article, they talked about substance use and how they can practice opened up opportunities for

616
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:11,780
people to use them to engage in substance abuse and how that affected the community.

617
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:20,060
And you also felt know that they felt that their communities like homeowner marginalized by local government and policymakers.

618
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:26,450
And this map indicates housing. That vacancy is associated with neighborhood racial makeup.

619
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:33,560
There are 19 predominately white look at vacancy neighborhoods and only three low can vacancy strongly black neighborhoods.

620
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:41,960
In contrast, there are three predominately white neighborhoods in Pittsburgh are high vacancy and 21 high vacancy predominately black neighborhoods.

621
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:49,240
Yeah. So the last one was exposure to violence.

622
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:54,000
So you've reported on how crime and violence affect their daily life and community.

623
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:58,540
They've reported how it affects how they interact with their environment.

624
01:12:58,570 --> 01:13:03,580
So example they were talking about in the article was a young man talking about

625
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:08,620
his experience the first time he experienced like a neighborhood shooting,

626
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:17,169
a shoot out, and how that affects his interaction with the environment as well as like even just riding bikes in the neighborhood,

627
01:13:17,170 --> 01:13:20,830
they don't feel safe because of these type of issues.

628
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:25,540
And they found that violent crimes appear to be concentrated in black neighborhoods.

629
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:32,260
In Pittsburgh, there are 21 are low violence, predominately white neighborhoods and only one low violence predominately black neighborhood.

630
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:36,639
20 of the neighborhoods with the highest rates of violent crime are predominantly black,

631
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:40,570
and only three predominately white neighborhoods have high level crime.

632
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:45,940
And you've reported that the community faces a cycle of crime and violence that forces home

633
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:51,700
residents and members of their homes and thus becoming sites to facilitate more crime.

634
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:59,080
And again, just this to the period again against each other.

635
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:08,889
And I found on that last point, I found it interesting when they're talking about vacancy and how that can open up opportunities

636
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:13,450
for like more crime and talking about how it's pushed crime is pushing team members out,

637
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:21,850
looking at where there's high percentages of vacancy and black communities and also high levels of crime.

638
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:30,640
And in a lot of areas, they're very similar. So I don't know if there's anything else in this that they want to mention.

639
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:41,680
So you can kind of see a pattern across all those three pictures, specifically the areas that have high poverty rates and black residents.

640
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:49,930
So the darker colored areas and all three pictures, that's where the illegal dumping is at high crime rates and housing.

641
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:59,910
Yeah, for sure. So some of the conclusions.

642
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:08,320
So the study examines racial inequalities in environmental health in two key ways.

643
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:12,899
So this is the perception to inform the understanding of community well-being.

644
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:20,580
And then they use these to find indicators using local data to create features that the youth found important.

645
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:25,560
And this allows us to understand what is important for communities and for communities for you.

646
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:32,670
One limitation that they did mention on is that the data that they put together isn't necessarily

647
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:38,160
generalizable to all Pittsburgh communities because they were specifically focused on Homewood.

648
01:15:40,170 --> 01:15:46,499
Some implications that they talked about was it provides evidence to better understand what aspects

649
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:50,250
of the neighborhood are important for young people's well-being by taking their point of view into

650
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:56,760
account and future research can connect this evidence interventions that may help organizations

651
01:15:56,970 --> 01:16:04,980
nonprofits with funding to drive interventions that support community needs and similar questions.

652
01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:13,410
So how could using youth identified or community identified themes to map data and community involvement and progress?

653
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:28,349
Anyone thinking that when I was reading this was I think it's it's in part like I guess when you're all for like CPR,

654
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:33,690
like you've experienced during, if you're using like themes that the community has identified,

655
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:36,089
they're more likely to actually be involved in,

656
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:39,990
like improving those things because it's priorities that they've identified that they want to focus on.

657
01:16:40,290 --> 01:16:43,110
So I think it's very important that like they I think they mentioned it in the

658
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:46,890
introduction to was like that's precisely kind of why they were talking to you because

659
01:16:46,890 --> 01:16:50,040
they wanted to see their perceptions of what the issues were and seeing if the like

660
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:53,790
statistical data matched their perceptions of what was going on in their community.

661
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:06,590
I also think it's interesting that the youth were it I mean,

662
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:13,850
they were able to identify results that they saw happening from the data that they were observing.

663
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:25,020
A lot of times. Researchers can also look at those results before you are able to explain it in the context of their own experiences and terms,

664
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:29,640
which makes it more useful for them identifying appropriate solutions,

665
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:39,270
because they're they're saying that this is exactly what we see happening and they can lay out the steps and it's recording as well on those maps.

666
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:53,059
But that's a better explaining factor. Um, yeah, definitely.

667
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:57,320
I think in like the contest when I was like coming up this question,

668
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:01,880
I thought it was really interesting, even like my own experience in my internship, how,

669
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:06,139
you know, when you're working with the community specifically,

670
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:13,070
you can really see more progress in like supporting like involvement in the work that you're doing.

671
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:22,820
So they were definitely as you go through the article, like mapping out experiences and using like quotes from the children and that and the youth.

672
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:25,190
And then you were seeing like the map and how that matched up.

673
01:18:25,190 --> 01:18:30,919
And I thought that was really impactful and having like youth being able to explain like this is what we experience.

674
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:33,620
The community I think could be really important,

675
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:41,960
like in using like these type of information or maps even to show the community what's going on in their own neighborhoods.

676
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:50,330
Um, and then my other question was what other public health issues should we use this approach to mapping data with?

677
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:14,760
One is you could be like a black.

678
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:24,510
Maternal mortality, particularly around issues like discrimination with centers or hospitals and things like that.

679
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:28,260
So having those kind of talk about their experiences are impacting these things,

680
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:32,100
essentially like publishing in the West to put more pressure on hospitals to

681
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:35,490
address those issues that they've had a similar experience with the settings.

682
01:19:36,690 --> 01:19:41,370
Yeah, I was kind of thinking of that as well and like reflecting on past experiences.

683
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:46,020
And I worked with a nonprofit that was a maternal health program and having

684
01:19:46,410 --> 01:19:51,629
information and data showed like it specifically in Detroit where like they're

685
01:19:51,630 --> 01:20:04,350
missing like resources and health centers and grocery stores for even mothers to get the use their work or whatever or just get healthy foods like.

686
01:20:04,410 --> 01:20:12,540
I think this could be a really impactful way of getting their input and what could be used to improve in the future.

687
01:20:12,910 --> 01:20:20,340
Yeah. Yeah.

688
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:25,069
I was just going to add, I think with the article it the show because it focused on Hollywood,

689
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:31,549
but I think in other instances where you're focusing in on a county or specific neighborhood where you're going to have a smaller sample size,

690
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:33,020
like maybe using this way,

691
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:39,530
where you're including that qualitative data could be more impactful because you're not going to have like a large statistical data set.

692
01:20:39,770 --> 01:20:43,459
So using that qualitative information, can I think kind of a double statement,

693
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:47,600
put pressure to get like if you're trying to get your like local representative to

694
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:52,280
make changes like using that qualitative data to develop its power to make change.

695
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:58,190
Yeah, I think even though it's not like generalizable to like a larger portion still really impactful in that community,

696
01:20:58,190 --> 01:21:02,030
it can make a huge difference. So it's still like super important for sure.

697
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:11,090
Yeah, I, I think I wrote an article recently actually for another class that talked about similarly like mapping using

698
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:21,560
youth in the community to help out for like resource access issues or thinking about like the built environment.

699
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:29,480
I think this one is talking specifically about places for youth to like do physical activity,

700
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:33,950
kind of the the structure is like community health needs.

701
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:47,270
I think that could be an interesting. And other comments also.

702
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:54,070
Understanding health resources and.

703
01:21:56,120 --> 01:22:05,410
Challenges are the areas in which. Just exactly how we understand physical space is very much.

704
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:12,430
For that. Yeah, for sure.

705
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:29,700
That's it. Thank you. Yeah.

706
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:32,720
Great job to the presenters into the class.

707
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:36,720
I'm really loving the interaction and discussions. You guys are doing great.

708
01:22:36,850 --> 01:22:42,600
Let's keep that up. I thought this is a great example of what was planned is a great needs assessment, right?

709
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:52,339
You take qualitative data and you apply maybe what we call quantitative information to make that more real to the observer,

710
01:22:52,340 --> 01:23:00,620
the reader, many times qualitative information is denigrated for maybe generalizability issues and things like that.

711
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:09,290
But I was really impressed by the immense amount of validity in the perception of one neighborhood children and what's going on across the whole city.

712
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:12,770
It's kind of astounding to me with this show,

713
01:23:13,610 --> 01:23:18,980
and I think it gives you an idea of how we may approach needs assessment in the future where you try to do a mixed method approach.

714
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:24,819
The other thing I liked about this paper was the bivariate color maps that you observed,

715
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:31,430
that you had two variables that were cross tabulated and then mapped.

716
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:36,500
And that's a nice methodology to look at the correlation between two variables in a map.

717
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:44,549
We can't easily sow correlation coefficients on a map, but by very complex maps are a nice way to do it and we'll learn about them,

718
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:51,890
about how to make those types of maps in this class too. So excellent work, both of you guys, and excellent work for the class.

719
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:59,450
Let's do this. Let's take a nice ten minute break and we'll come back and we'll start working on the computers.

720
01:24:00,010 --> 01:24:03,360
And during the break, maybe you want to start ArcGIS guys up.

721
01:24:03,380 --> 01:24:16,730
So it takes a few minutes to load up and maybe start also downloading the HP 1866 lab folder from our canvas website and put it into the C drive.

722
01:24:17,330 --> 01:24:23,750
And then when we come back, we'll be all ready to go. So let's come back at 4/10, 358 now.

723
01:24:23,750 --> 01:25:28,650
So 12 minute break. Okay. You continue to do that?

724
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:40,710
Yeah, if you were a model and I think this is a same plan.

725
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:46,120
Thank you. It's the same name, but different content.

726
01:25:46,330 --> 01:25:49,690
That's all. Are you changing the content for me? I do.

727
01:25:49,690 --> 01:25:54,590
Because if I put everything in there, it is too huge. Okay, I saw that.

728
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:58,190
But if you look at, I'll keep the old stuff in there.

729
01:25:58,210 --> 01:26:01,590
So you have it in the web? Yeah.

730
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:15,790
Just in case. Yeah. Oh, I. Send your email.

731
01:26:16,330 --> 01:26:20,280
Yes, I know that kind of. What? Oh, yeah.

732
01:26:20,290 --> 01:26:24,160
I'm sorry. No, that's okay. It's okay. I don't mind to send you some more.

733
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:34,660
I will send the photos. Yeah, no problem. I'm sorry.

734
01:26:35,100 --> 01:27:12,390
Said I didn't quite. Yeah.

735
01:27:20,370 --> 01:27:23,380
Oh, my God.

736
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:13,590
I think. Yeah.

737
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:10,910
Oh, yeah. Yeah. So.

738
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:25,720
And I said, Yeah, yeah.

739
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:45,290
I said. Right now, it's kind of like, really?

740
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:49,950
And so it's like but I mean,

741
01:29:50,190 --> 01:29:58,880
I feel like the end because people like that and I think a over hundreds of this is true and I think that's my demo origin.

742
01:29:58,890 --> 01:30:05,370
But I think, yeah, it's like saying, I'm telling you the top of this every year.

743
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:14,420
Like, I think like 80%, 90%. What I want to do, everything that I've ever seen goes on to be like, do that.

744
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:18,990
Because I feel like I live in this year, year run. Like I just I'm ahead of the game.

745
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:25,740
I'm just like, oh yeah, well, you know, like on a day like when he and yeah.

746
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:36,070
Anyway, because it's easy. I don't know. It's like, it's like women don't get anyone to want to take for another one of those people, you know.

747
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:43,590
But you know, he's and he made us Olympic and never beat the system but he didn't correct for that.

748
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:51,870
So I'm just like, I made it through the right time. Yeah, but I hear what you're saying.

749
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:59,550
You know, I think, like, at the rate right before the semester started, because I'm in like neighborhoods and we're just like hearing that.

750
01:31:00,090 --> 01:31:12,870
So let's keep doing that and then yeah, adjusting to everything and then like deciding like, okay, I'm going to go over there.

751
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:20,500
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

752
01:31:21,650 --> 01:31:25,440
And that's something that was important to me later.

753
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:31,160
Load. Yeah, yeah. I feel like a lot you don't want to take the whole thing.

754
01:31:31,170 --> 01:31:38,120
I just. I really think like, I mean, it's just kind of like.

755
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:46,320
So I just. I find with something, I just think it's like, okay, yes.

756
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:49,860
That's like synchronous presentation classes.

757
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:54,270
But then like, actually I'm sorry, I didn't really to about this class.

758
01:31:54,450 --> 01:32:02,150
Yeah, I keep talking about like senior. I just like like someone coming to class, like I was supposed to get the cards right.

759
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:06,990
Oh, yes, you're right. And I'm like, today.

760
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:10,080
I mean, I hear all day. Yeah, well informed.

761
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:13,400
That was like one hour and a half double over.

762
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:22,530
My answer would be like, yes, I'm going to keep I drive more than I, but it's just like even there.

763
01:32:23,220 --> 01:32:30,710
But I really want some of people to report. They don't have to be almost like I will have to come to class like here at all things they all have.

764
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:35,520
What is his name, right. I guess. Oh yeah.

765
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:39,870
That's what I think that close.

766
01:32:39,870 --> 01:32:49,230
And I'm just like I'm just watching people and of course in terms of resources versus office.

767
01:32:49,770 --> 01:32:53,870
So, you know, the research teams are one now.

768
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:59,340
So we saw this one here, the third. So yeah, I have no idea who's on the ballot now.

769
01:32:59,370 --> 01:33:08,740
Okay, so it goes on then. I usually like yeah, that's kind of odd, you know, concerning to me and Karen servicing office.

770
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:12,030
Yeah. Okay. So the office is like right across the stairwell.

771
01:33:12,570 --> 01:33:18,870
If you look at it, there's like that whole sections of the community that whole streets are like right in front of it.

772
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:22,140
Or if you tried to like do that automatically.

773
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:26,010
So it's a human being, okay, let's do it.

774
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:44,780
I have a person class, so they pass in class because like these are people like I don't know if I'm familiar with what I'm going to try to illustrate.

775
01:33:44,790 --> 01:33:51,580
I mean, the Dallas Morning News, but it wasn't like just take the finals and take them to.

776
01:33:51,930 --> 01:34:04,730
Oh, oh, yeah. So obviously you celebrate probably be here this Thursday night, but that's going to be out now.

777
01:34:04,740 --> 01:34:20,690
We have like three right before his last three questions that I saw or anything like that before get like that.

778
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:22,690
So that's also the reason why I'm doing this.

779
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:38,640
I mean, the level of the kinds of things, you know, I think there should be like I feel like we we're trying to out that was our deadline but.

780
01:34:42,350 --> 01:34:45,680
A little bit. And I'm going to let you translate smarter than that.

781
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:50,960
Yeah, sure. I don't know what to do.

782
01:34:51,950 --> 01:35:01,639
Oh, well, we're almost out of the report, so. Yeah, I think I recorded a visual examiner's report from the early days when they were designers.

783
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:08,600
Just kind of like walking across Europe that Friday is all over again.

784
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:14,340
So the other day, your voice downloaded that?

785
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:18,120
Yeah, I believe anywhere.

786
01:35:18,230 --> 01:35:25,030
So he uses the same every day. But honestly, less than a minute.

787
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:30,139
Yeah. I finally figured about making it that maybe we can't.

788
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:33,960
Really. I appreciate that.

789
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:34,640
It's for the game.

790
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:54,680
But that's not how she likes to make people like, you know, this is like this is like I don't want to, you know, I mean, this kind of behavior.

791
01:35:55,250 --> 01:36:01,459
Yeah, I know. And I feel that for I was like, yeah, it was like, I mean, I know.

792
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:05,340
I don't really know either. That's my last. I don't know.

793
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:09,920
Right. But, like, we didn't have, like, prison in Texas. Yeah.

794
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:13,740
I don't like people, like, I. Yeah, I think so.

795
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:19,730
Yeah. So there's a reason why, how stressed or something was like.

796
01:36:20,630 --> 01:36:29,990
Yeah, I went from like some stress like, like this preschool like because of it and that, like I said, it was hard.

797
01:36:30,140 --> 01:36:33,670
I mean, you need good support everywhere that it's been like, yeah, yeah.

798
01:36:33,670 --> 01:36:38,090
It's it, it was interesting. I wasn't doing anything interesting.

799
01:36:38,090 --> 01:36:45,090
You said it was important to figure out how to do it first.

800
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:50,720
Gave me such a nice way to put it.

801
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:55,159
I mean, is the truth. I think it's just the wording.

802
01:36:55,160 --> 01:37:02,570
I think, I don't know, maybe it's not the most important.

803
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:07,220
Right. Yeah, but I mean.

804
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:10,489
I mean, anything else? So there's a lot to do here.

805
01:37:10,490 --> 01:37:22,310
But yeah, you know, we look at that so.

806
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:27,040
Yeah. Either our attention. And get started.

807
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:33,830
A couple of people are still missing and I guess they'll have to catch up when they get here.

808
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:45,919
Okay. So the first thing to do is again to download the HP HD 626 lab folder from canvas modules is the first thing and third modules.

809
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:53,930
The first thing you see and extract the files is zipped file right and put it into your C drive.

810
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:58,880
Please replace the old HP 86 to 6 flat folder.

811
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:07,110
I'm updated with new data and what I what I'm doing is I'm adding new stuff every week so that the

812
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:14,060
two files that you see on module will be will have all the data you need to do all the labs so far.

813
01:38:14,270 --> 01:38:20,509
Okay. And then the next thing you want to do is turn on parts pro.

814
01:38:20,510 --> 01:38:28,100
You may have to log in again. Okay, so let's get that started and I'll just give you a one or 2 minutes.

815
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:32,240
Some of you may not have done that during break.

816
01:38:35,150 --> 01:38:42,560
And if you have another screen or printer, I get to the lab activities.

817
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:49,790
Lab activity number three is what we're doing today, three, four and five.

818
01:38:51,110 --> 01:38:57,880
Okay. And we're going to be exploring data today and learning about results.

819
01:39:00,550 --> 01:39:06,600
All right. Is everybody ready?

820
01:39:07,890 --> 01:39:11,250
Anybody not ready? All right, let's do it.

821
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:16,379
All right. So let's start with the step number one in lab activity.

822
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:20,490
Three, it says Log on to canvas. Uh, get the data.

823
01:39:21,810 --> 01:39:24,840
You know, that link probably doesn't work. I should have fixed that.

824
01:39:25,140 --> 01:39:26,010
Sorry about that,

825
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:40,320
because it's an old link in Start Pro and open up this file called Lung Cancer Mortality that AP or VIX and that should be in the projects folder.

826
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:49,950
So you can go to the left bottom corner of this entire screen for a jazz pro says open another project.

827
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:55,950
You can click there and from there you would navigate to your C drive.

828
01:39:59,730 --> 01:40:11,490
And each PHC 66 lab and there is a folder called projects and there is a project folder called Lung Cancer Mortality.

829
01:40:13,030 --> 01:40:16,290
Okay. And within that folder there are multiple files.

830
01:40:16,290 --> 01:40:21,540
You don't see them all because right now you're only seeing the apex file and the index

831
01:40:21,540 --> 01:40:27,540
wants to just double click on the lung cancer mortality paper x file and it should open.

832
01:40:32,570 --> 01:40:40,550
The project. If you see something like this.

833
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:55,339
Oh, I know you're just walking in, but we're working on lab activity three and we're on step number two, which is to open the lung cancer mortality.

834
01:40:55,340 --> 01:41:04,310
EPR x five And this is similar to what you saw last week, except I removed all the links and interstate highways and all that kind of stuff.

835
01:41:04,970 --> 01:41:08,090
And what we're looking at is the continental United States,

836
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:15,410
all those little polygons or shapes are counties in the US, so all the counties in the US are there.

837
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:27,350
And what you're seeing visualized is, uh, lung cancer mortality rates per 100,000 white men in the year 2000 to 2004.

838
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:33,770
So these are all data almost 20 years old or little less for some counties.

839
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:40,250
And you can see that. Why are we looking at old data? Well, what you're going to do later on in class is look at new data.

840
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,950
So I want to teach you how to download this data,

841
01:41:44,270 --> 01:41:48,860
the most current data available through the National Cancer Institute, and you'll be working with that later.

842
01:41:48,860 --> 01:41:56,180
Right now, we're looking at this. All the left hand side is the contents pain, right?

843
01:41:56,900 --> 01:41:58,780
There's a few different things here.

844
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:06,320
We have states which is not ticked, so you can take it just to see the state boundaries and labels, which I've added here.

845
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:11,240
You can take it because sometimes that information could be a little bit distracting.

846
01:42:12,050 --> 01:42:22,250
The second layer here is a female edit household percentage or female headed household with children, percentage of that per county.

847
01:42:22,790 --> 01:42:29,410
If you tick that, you'll see some there some graduated simple the circles are actually they're

848
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:37,520
colored so and bigger if they're higher rates and redder if they're higher rates,

849
01:42:38,510 --> 01:42:42,319
you can then take that, too. But the one we're visualizing now is the last layer.

850
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:49,220
So this next project involves three different modes, but we're only looking at one so far,

851
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:59,240
which are the county layers, the county boundaries with the rates of white men with lung cancer who had passed away.

852
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:11,540
All right. So next to in the catalog pane, it says, connect to each page 6 to 6 lab in the seed drive.

853
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:13,670
So you want to make sure that folder connection is there.

854
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:24,950
It may still be there from last week, but if it's not, all you could do is right click on folders and say Add folder connection.

855
01:43:25,910 --> 01:43:31,490
And if you push that folder connection, it will ask you, Well, which folder do you want to connect to?

856
01:43:31,610 --> 01:43:36,559
And you go to your c drive and just push.

857
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:42,320
Okay now if you go to see drove HB 50, 66 lag and then push.

858
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:45,320
Okay all right so I've already done that.

859
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:52,430
So it's right there in this to the lab lung cancer mortality project folder is already

860
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:57,560
connected because that what be open now if we open the apex file in the field.

861
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:03,889
All right so we looked at the contents pane so we did number four but let's do a

862
01:44:03,890 --> 01:44:11,780
little bit more that the list the left is the first little I guess we call this.

863
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:18,139
The list of leaders was like a tree, right? Forest planting.

864
01:44:18,140 --> 01:44:23,330
You see that tree? The list of the drawing layer on the top estates.

865
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:30,860
Underneath that is the the 20 female head of household with children raped and who below

866
01:44:30,860 --> 01:44:39,020
that is a county with the lowest cancer mortality per woman in terms of what it means.

867
01:44:40,370 --> 01:44:45,810
Well, and then the second tab here looks like a cylinder, right?

868
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:54,829
If you go to that tap, it tells you the source of each of the data in all of these are from the same source.

869
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:57,890
It tells you where that's coming from.

870
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:11,750
Okay. So in the 63 inch and 80, 66 lab projects blend cancer mortality folder and the data in this lung cancer mortality geo database.

871
01:45:14,510 --> 01:45:25,309
And if you had not sourced the data for the year properly, you would see red exclamation points here and would say,

872
01:45:25,310 --> 01:45:32,990
Well, I can't find the data I'm looking for in the location that the paper tracks what I see.

873
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:40,610
So that will happen to you sometimes. So it just means that you have to go look for it again and source it properly and we can do that in class.

874
01:45:40,610 --> 01:45:48,890
If that ever occurred to you in the last thing I want to look at right now, the contents bin is this list of selections.

875
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:55,700
So this is telling us that each of these layers are checked means that they're all selectable.

876
01:45:56,330 --> 01:46:02,270
Okay. So you can select some of them if you need to in place.

877
01:46:02,810 --> 01:46:07,730
You want to select something that's underneath it, and we'll be doing that later on in today's class.

878
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:11,870
All right. So these are the three main things that we look at in the contents vein.

879
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:25,760
And let's go back to the first one, which is the drawing board under maps right here on the top is this map or let's look at the bookmarks.

880
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:27,590
So make bookmarks already.

881
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:36,980
So there is a bookmark here for the southeast of the country in a bookmark for what we're looking at now, which is the continental United States.

882
01:46:37,700 --> 01:46:40,770
So click on southeast, okay?

883
01:46:41,450 --> 01:46:47,570
And then it goes to the southeast where you see a lot of high rates of lung cancer mortality in white men.

884
01:46:48,170 --> 01:46:51,740
You may be interested in this area to see what states they may be in.

885
01:46:52,400 --> 01:47:02,810
Right. You can turn on the states with Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, uh, Arkansas,

886
01:47:03,410 --> 01:47:08,180
high rates of lung cancer mortality there as opposed to other parts of the country.

887
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:17,150
If you click on bookmark again and push us, it'll go back to this extent, which is the whole continental U.S.

888
01:47:17,210 --> 01:47:26,570
Just a question to you all. Why do you think the lung cancer mortality rates are so much higher down here in the south of the country versus,

889
01:47:26,570 --> 01:47:29,899
let's say, the west or the northern part of the country?

890
01:47:29,900 --> 01:47:34,610
Any ideas about that? You Yeah. Could it be more acute?

891
01:47:35,210 --> 01:47:38,360
So like master infections and stuff like that. Okay.

892
01:47:38,420 --> 01:47:41,809
More respiratory infections over the lifetime of certain cancers.

893
01:47:41,810 --> 01:47:49,770
Interesting. Okay. Now there's a coal mining operations group like West Virginia Association especially.

894
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:54,950
Excellent. So some of the industrial kind of work might be leading to lung cancer.

895
01:47:55,970 --> 01:47:59,690
Yeah. Yeah. This is similar to other industries that.

896
01:48:04,970 --> 01:48:08,990
Great in other industries, the tobacco industry,

897
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:15,860
a lot of tobacco is grown in the southern part of the country, particularly in West Virginia, Kentucky.

898
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:19,670
Those areas and rates of tobacco use are much higher there.

899
01:48:20,570 --> 01:48:25,850
And the other issue might be access to cancer care and cancer screening and stuff like that.

900
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:33,290
So if you have low access to care, you may be detecting the problem later and then your higher rate of death.

901
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:42,170
Right. So those things working together to create maybe a higher risk of lung cancer mortality in that area, this is for white men.

902
01:48:42,890 --> 01:48:47,120
So we should be looking at women and other ethnicities as well.

903
01:48:48,290 --> 01:48:52,280
Great. So let's create a bookmark for Michigan.

904
01:48:52,490 --> 01:48:58,310
Okay. So what I would like you to do is pan to Michigan and you can just zoom in.

905
01:48:58,610 --> 01:49:02,840
If you if you if you roll up on your little mouse, you can zoom, right?

906
01:49:03,290 --> 01:49:16,760
Or you can use this button up here, fix zoom, or you can put shift down and make a little box and it will zoom into the where you made the box.

907
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:25,670
So I'm just going to zoom in. So I have the Upper Peninsula and the lower Michigan area in my map.

908
01:49:26,270 --> 01:49:32,870
Maybe I'll center it a little bit. And you know, let's say I'm interested in Michigan a lot, so I'm going to make a bookmark for it.

909
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:43,610
So the way you do that is good bookmarks under map and you say new bookmark and then you say Michigan, you can name it Michigan.

910
01:49:44,150 --> 01:49:50,630
And by the way, in social care lists, they go back to bookmarks.

911
01:49:51,180 --> 01:49:59,080
Have three different bookmarks. You can go back to U.S., you can go back to Michigan, can get to the.

912
01:49:59,120 --> 01:50:05,570
So that's how you create bookmarks. So let's explore the data a bit.

913
01:50:06,170 --> 01:50:10,560
Okay. Well. Yeah.

914
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:19,210
Excellent. So let's have states look at the select list by selection in the contents page.

915
01:50:20,060 --> 01:50:31,590
That's select states. And the reason I did that is if I click inside to select the tell me how the layer of states is on top, right?

916
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:36,190
It will select the state, not the county. And I won't be able to do what I need to do.

917
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:44,740
So that's what I'm selecting, state. And click on the highest mortality counties in Michigan now.

918
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:50,620
Okay, so let's see. The highest mortality counties are the the darker the black, the higher the rate.

919
01:50:51,220 --> 01:50:59,370
So if you have like a finger pointing up like this right on your cursor, if you see here, this is the highest rate county.

920
01:50:59,410 --> 01:51:07,930
So if you click on that, it will happen. Okay.

921
01:51:07,980 --> 01:51:11,020
Turn off the guests under the driving order.

922
01:51:11,020 --> 01:51:15,400
Makes you turn states off too. And you have states are not selectable.

923
01:51:15,580 --> 01:51:23,890
And then click on the can. So once you click on it, it tells you more information about the county from the attribute table.

924
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:27,430
So there is an attribute table associated with the drawing you're seeing.

925
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:32,020
Right. And these are the variables in the attribute table, the ones listed here.

926
01:51:34,860 --> 01:51:39,690
All of these variables in the first one is the name of the county, so that's Claire County.

927
01:51:41,190 --> 01:51:51,150
And the data that's being visualized is r m no rwm00 underscore zero four.

928
01:51:51,330 --> 01:52:12,000
So I'm going to go down to it r w and this one right here var w n rate are white men wm00 is 2000 underscore is two and zero four is 2004.

929
01:52:12,570 --> 01:52:15,880
That's the rate in white men from 2000 to 2004.

930
01:52:15,910 --> 01:52:23,910
That's what that's showing. And if you look right below it, that's the rate of white females from the same time period.

931
01:52:23,970 --> 01:52:33,820
If you look one row below, this is the count, the count of white female who have lung cancer mortality deaths.

932
01:52:34,630 --> 01:52:40,360
And the one below is the rate in black men. And then there's a count of black men.

933
01:52:40,990 --> 01:52:44,710
And then there's a rate in black female count in black female.

934
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:53,770
So you can you know, you can see that there's very few there's no deaths in black men or women, but there are deaths in white.

935
01:52:54,490 --> 01:52:58,920
The reason is white people smoke a lot more. Yeah, I just put.

936
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:03,480
Yes. It is recording?

937
01:53:03,550 --> 01:53:07,990
Yes, it's working. It's recording. And it'll be uploaded after class.

938
01:53:10,680 --> 01:53:20,130
Right. So we're. So what I would like you to do is click on all the high grade clouds you see in this, write down the name of the county and the rate.

939
01:53:20,670 --> 01:53:26,340
Okay, so this is just the way you explore the data to figure out what's going on in what you're seeing.

940
01:53:26,340 --> 01:53:39,720
So you may select these three over here. This one is Lake County and the rate is 92.6.

941
01:53:40,170 --> 01:53:45,240
Okay. And then this one is new.

942
01:53:45,420 --> 01:53:50,549
What Newaygo County and the rate there is 51.3.

943
01:53:50,550 --> 01:53:55,740
No one over 3.3. Sorry. Okay.

944
01:53:55,740 --> 01:54:03,150
So just to just for like the top five or six. So just to get an idea of how this works and how you can explore data in this way.

945
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:24,880
And let me know if you're having any problems. I'll come by and help you.

946
01:54:49,050 --> 01:55:00,120
Yeah. Okay.

947
01:55:14,070 --> 01:55:37,760
The children. Know.

948
01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:47,140
You know, know.

949
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:12,190
Yeah. I was exploring this when.

950
01:56:20,590 --> 01:56:30,640
And I think that's good news, just like for us to be forced to, you know, do this.

951
01:56:34,780 --> 01:56:39,060
Is. They could move.

952
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:49,830
Myers I think it was. Okay.

953
01:56:53,970 --> 01:57:08,630
Basketball shooting. So I mean, you can then also explore other military families to write to to see, hey, these are some Lori counties.

954
01:57:10,310 --> 01:57:16,010
What are they? This is Washtenaw County right here. This is one of the lower rate counties for lung cancer.

955
01:57:20,940 --> 01:57:30,520
This one is Ingham County, the low rate, and then Eaton County has a lower rate of lung cancer mortality and.

956
01:57:32,550 --> 01:57:36,250
Now, this is a little tedious, you know, clicking one at a time to figure this out.

957
01:57:36,270 --> 01:57:39,330
But there's a better way to do it. Which is number seven.

958
01:57:40,050 --> 01:57:48,420
He says Go to map and click on Select. So go to the map and click on Select, which is this.

959
01:57:51,740 --> 01:57:58,110
And here, if you hold shift, then you can select more than one penalty at a time.

960
01:57:58,130 --> 01:58:07,700
So let's say I want to select all of the the dark counties, the black one and the dark gray ones, all of them that I see up here.

961
01:58:08,900 --> 01:58:12,050
Okay. So I selected them all.

962
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:19,850
And then if you click on the right, here is the attributes.

963
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:27,270
Under selection maps, the selection area attributes.

964
01:58:27,270 --> 01:58:37,890
If you click on that, it will show you all the attributes for each of these counties in alphabetical order.

965
01:58:38,130 --> 01:58:42,570
So starts from first, you know, and the list.

966
01:58:43,940 --> 01:58:52,259
See, see. Did all of that in one go right by selecting a bunch of them and going to attributes in other way you can do it is to open the

967
01:58:52,260 --> 01:59:03,150
attributes table so you can right click on the link cancer mortality layer in the conference pane and go to attribute table.

968
01:59:06,060 --> 01:59:15,030
And I will open up the attribute table for this data in all the counties in the country are here 3055.

969
01:59:15,750 --> 01:59:17,159
We've only selected 11.

970
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:26,370
And then if you want to see the selected counties, you go to the bottom left hand corner of that table and they show selected records.

971
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:38,820
These are all the selected methods. So you have the names right here of those counties, and then you have the all the rates over the years over here.

972
01:59:38,970 --> 01:59:52,220
Okay. In the columns. And we were looking at. Or is it much w00 underscore zero four?

973
01:59:53,240 --> 01:59:59,000
So that's a more efficient way of getting all the data for the high rate counties.

974
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:04,790
Another way you can do it is you can sort by this column, right?

975
02:00:04,790 --> 02:00:07,820
You can see sort decent.

976
02:00:09,140 --> 02:00:13,280
And if you if you go back to view all records, show all records.

977
02:00:16,910 --> 02:00:26,510
All right. Okay.

978
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:31,160
So the highest is at the top and the lowest is at the bottom.

979
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:37,040
And if you just scroll to the left, you know, the top ten or top 12 in my view of 12.

980
02:00:38,090 --> 02:00:41,090
Right. Midland cancer rate counties in the state.

981
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:46,780
So it's just two ways of exploring the data that you're looking at.

982
02:00:47,620 --> 02:00:55,210
One important thing to also do is once you select something and you want to move on to something else, it's really important to clear your selection.

983
02:00:55,990 --> 02:01:04,720
So there's a button appear on your map in the selection area that says clear and that will clear everything you selected.

984
02:01:06,130 --> 02:01:13,660
It is important to remember that because when we do spatial analysis and if I was doing spatial analysis and had those can be selected,

985
02:01:13,660 --> 02:01:20,290
only those counting data would be used in the analysis and not all the other counties want to use.

986
02:01:22,370 --> 02:01:29,560
Uh hmm. You know, where you can select them one by one, just by clicking on them again.

987
02:01:29,570 --> 02:01:34,220
Right. So. All right. Now, let's look at the search function.

988
02:01:34,610 --> 02:01:40,280
Okay. So let's say you wanted to figure out the rates for specific counties that you know.

989
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:43,990
You know, my my hometown. What is the rate in Washtenaw County?

990
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:49,790
I don't know where it is on the map, but I know plutonium closing after the table.

991
02:01:50,660 --> 02:01:57,460
So we do it as you go to map and we will inquiry the inquiry area and go to local.

992
02:01:59,690 --> 02:02:05,720
And then on the right hand side, the looking pane will show up and go to layer search.

993
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:14,600
And you can type you can see this little dropdown menu next to the search field.

994
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:18,860
It shows a variety of options in the field.

995
02:02:18,870 --> 02:02:23,990
I just want to search in one layer, which is the lung cancer mortality layer.

996
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:33,020
So you click on that, okay? And then you want to search in a specific field in that layer.

997
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:44,120
The field we're interested is name to see select down search in a layer search within lung cancer mortality layer.

998
02:02:44,420 --> 02:02:50,840
And I want to look at the attribute name to underscore and then you can just type Washtenaw.

999
02:02:54,430 --> 02:03:00,650
Josh Turner. Push, return the spotlight.

1000
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:06,070
Maybe it was too hard.

1001
02:03:06,160 --> 02:03:11,730
Spirit Right. Did you guys find the classic?

1002
02:03:17,520 --> 02:03:28,530
You know, it's cap sensitive, you know, so tells you where it is and then you can click on it to learn about,

1003
02:03:31,590 --> 02:03:45,600
you know, what's going on in that county. Show details, right click through details and it'll tell you all the information for the sale.

1004
02:03:45,750 --> 02:03:49,630
As you know, I lived a lot in Orange County.

1005
02:03:53,830 --> 02:04:05,620
When I was younger, boring. And there are many orange counties in the country, but the one I lived in was in California.

1006
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:13,330
So you can you can just search for some counties that you may have some interest in.

1007
02:04:17,020 --> 02:04:23,230
And then. And then see the data for that came to right clicking and going deeper.

1008
02:04:25,450 --> 02:04:28,540
Another place I lived at a lot is Los Angeles County.

1009
02:04:28,540 --> 02:04:35,419
Los. All right.

1010
02:04:35,420 --> 02:04:40,400
Click on the Los Angeles show details. And then what's 30?

1011
02:04:40,730 --> 02:04:48,590
50 is half of what it was in some of the highest counties in Washington up there, not in Washington and Michigan.

1012
02:04:50,990 --> 02:04:54,870
Because there are just two ways to explore the data and.

1013
02:04:58,180 --> 02:05:03,400
Okay. So now let me give you just a couple of minutes to explore.

1014
02:05:04,390 --> 02:05:12,380
Saginaw is another one I have in the lab activities that you can just explore some other ones you may have interest in searching.

1015
02:05:55,550 --> 02:06:04,820
Look, I'll give you maybe one more minute to just play around with some of the functions we use so far, and then we'll move on to number ten.

1016
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:28,840
Okay. So now we're going to look at the percentage female head of household with children variable.

1017
02:07:29,140 --> 02:07:38,760
Okay. So go to your contents pane when you're still in the Michigan area of the map and just take on

1018
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:48,310
percentage female headed household and you'll see that some small circle show up on the map there.

1019
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:54,970
Go from green to red and the red surfers are a little larger than the green ones.

1020
02:07:55,780 --> 02:08:01,780
And that variable indicates that it's a proxy for socioeconomic status at the county level.

1021
02:08:02,380 --> 02:08:09,520
Higher number, percentage of female head of household with children indicates that that county may be a little Essex County.

1022
02:08:10,270 --> 02:08:18,969
So just visually look at whether you think there's any pattern are higher than Kansas or

1023
02:08:18,970 --> 02:08:25,750
that counties in white men also have higher rates of female headed household with children.

1024
02:08:26,720 --> 02:08:34,660
Doesn't really look like it in Michigan. Right. And so maybe there is no visual correlation between those two variables for Michigan.

1025
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:39,490
So let's go and go to look at the bookmark and go to the US as a whole.

1026
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:52,300
And here you see clearly that there is some correlation between county level seats and lung cancer mortality rates.

1027
02:08:52,900 --> 02:08:58,960
The redder counties are at the south and the lung cancer mortality rates tend to be higher there.

1028
02:09:01,420 --> 02:09:07,100
So that's one way to kind of think about correlation. And guess what?

1029
02:09:07,290 --> 02:09:13,959
You can correlate these two variables using just a correlation coefficient with Pearson correlation

1030
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:19,750
coefficients and get a correlation coefficient and you probably see a positive correlation.

1031
02:09:22,450 --> 02:09:28,060
But you should also look at a map and see if there is any visual overlap between the two variables.

1032
02:09:30,270 --> 02:09:34,929
Hmm. All right, so now let's do this.

1033
02:09:34,930 --> 02:09:43,840
Let's create a layout from this as you've created this map in our kids row,

1034
02:09:44,230 --> 02:09:48,670
but you can't really share it easily in the presentation or with the colleague.

1035
02:09:49,090 --> 02:09:51,730
Just the map. You'd have to share the whole project, right?

1036
02:09:52,390 --> 02:09:56,680
So many times you want to just share the map you create or put it in the document that you're working on,

1037
02:09:56,680 --> 02:10:02,049
like a paper or send it to a colleague or as a PDF file or something like that.

1038
02:10:02,050 --> 02:10:05,920
And you can't really do that at the current moment. So let's do that.

1039
02:10:06,700 --> 02:10:12,220
Let's first create a layout, and here's where you create a kind of a map for sharing purposes in the future.

1040
02:10:13,780 --> 02:10:22,330
So these are layouts where you can take this map and turn it into something you may see in a report.

1041
02:10:23,620 --> 02:10:33,010
So it's going to insert. And on the left hand side, there's a new map and new layout.

1042
02:10:33,150 --> 02:10:36,810
Going to do new layout, but click on a little arrow next to me layout.

1043
02:10:37,740 --> 02:10:43,020
And you can get all different options for layouts that you can create.

1044
02:10:43,170 --> 02:10:48,420
We're just going to use eight and a half by 11 letter layout.

1045
02:10:49,050 --> 02:10:52,590
So a new tab will open up in the middle here.

1046
02:10:53,340 --> 02:10:57,000
The tab for the map is still there. You can go to see the map.

1047
02:10:57,430 --> 02:11:02,040
Now you also have a tab for layout says Layout three,

1048
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:12,420
because I was playing around with it yesterday and I deleted the other two layouts and then under insert.

1049
02:11:14,980 --> 02:11:19,950
Let's see where does it. Create a map frame.

1050
02:11:20,220 --> 02:11:24,970
Right. This is map frames. There's a button for my frame.

1051
02:11:24,990 --> 02:11:35,969
Click on that. And we want to create a frame for the whole U.S. so you can select that and then draw

1052
02:11:35,970 --> 02:11:40,980
a box where you want that map of the continental United States to kind of show up.

1053
02:11:42,100 --> 02:11:54,870
Okay. So I'm just going to create a map big box here with the top two thirds of the page and then the map of the whole U.S. will show up there.

1054
02:11:56,310 --> 02:12:06,760
Okay. You can move that around if you didn't place it properly just by holding it and moving it around.

1055
02:12:08,530 --> 02:12:15,060
Oh. Okay.

1056
02:12:15,600 --> 02:12:18,990
Now, let's say you wanted to mess around with this frame a little bit.

1057
02:12:19,380 --> 02:12:26,280
You have to activate it right click on the map frame you just created, click on Activate.

1058
02:12:27,720 --> 02:12:32,129
And that means that you can now kind of move this to see it in position and properly.

1059
02:12:32,130 --> 02:12:35,700
Maybe it was like this so you can move it around and position it.

1060
02:12:35,700 --> 02:12:43,380
Maybe you need to zoom in more so you can roll your mouse and zoom in and out more or even go to this.

1061
02:12:45,410 --> 02:12:54,230
Stent or you can draw a box. I wanted to be really tight in foreign blocks all around the United States.

1062
02:12:57,700 --> 02:13:00,130
Okay. So you get a nice close picture.

1063
02:13:02,070 --> 02:13:10,320
I'm just going to zoom out a little bit, to be honest, because we need some room at the bottom second position, things like that.

1064
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:15,420
Okay. Down here, we're going to put the legend and things like that in a few seconds.

1065
02:13:15,420 --> 02:13:18,990
So make the map a little higher in the box.

1066
02:13:21,120 --> 02:13:26,400
And now we're kind of done with this map frame work at the moment.

1067
02:13:26,970 --> 02:13:41,460
So you got to deactivate it so that you do by going to lay out on top and there's something called close activation.

1068
02:13:42,780 --> 02:13:47,790
So now you can zoom in and out and things like that and readjust that location on the map.

1069
02:13:49,270 --> 02:13:52,340
In next, we're going to add elements to this map. Okay.

1070
02:13:54,060 --> 02:14:00,110
Bring it down just a little. So one thing that's important to add. His.

1071
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:09,320
If you go to insert, it's always important to add a north arrow in any map you make just to make sure people know where North is.

1072
02:14:09,650 --> 02:14:16,970
Sometimes they may be not oriented in a, you know, an easy to understand way.

1073
02:14:17,060 --> 02:14:23,630
So one way to do that is go to map surrounds and insert and click on North Arrow.

1074
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:32,350
If you click on the bottom little arrow next to North Arrow, you can choose different types of north areas.

1075
02:14:32,360 --> 02:14:38,150
I'm just going to choose the third one and make a little box at the bottom here.

1076
02:14:40,230 --> 02:14:43,350
And that's not there and that's clean.

1077
02:14:43,980 --> 02:14:48,930
Okay. Another thing you could add is a scale wall. It's always important at a scale.

1078
02:14:48,930 --> 02:14:53,070
But when you make a map, right. So people know how far things are from each other.

1079
02:14:54,120 --> 02:14:59,490
So if you click on that little arrow next to scale bar and have different options for square bars.

1080
02:15:00,390 --> 02:15:06,600
I'm just going to choose the first one and I could make a little scale bar next to the north there.

1081
02:15:08,250 --> 02:15:12,840
It's not a really good one. You can expand it. So it's a little more clear.

1082
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:20,430
Right. The other important thing to have on any map is a legend.

1083
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:28,290
So you know what you're looking at. Okay. So a legend is the third thing in maps around.

1084
02:15:29,430 --> 02:15:36,350
If you click on the new arrow that gives you different options for legends, it's going to click the first option.

1085
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:45,060
When we draw a box underneath Texas and Florida, we want to have the legend.

1086
02:15:46,050 --> 02:15:50,130
So this is the legend. Looks a little big. I can resize it.

1087
02:15:52,850 --> 02:16:05,040
That there needed to be bigger. And we need to expand this a little bit.

1088
02:16:09,340 --> 02:16:17,680
Okay. So now there is a lot of stuff in this legend if you need to zoom in to really see there is a little on the bottom left.

1089
02:16:17,680 --> 02:16:23,100
This is 70% on my screen. You can just say maybe 100%.

1090
02:16:23,150 --> 02:16:28,360
It's a little closer or 125, you can type in 125.

1091
02:16:30,280 --> 02:16:33,819
So this is your legend, but it's not really clean.

1092
02:16:33,820 --> 02:16:41,139
Right. There's the name of the field is here are WME zero zero underscore four.

1093
02:16:41,140 --> 02:16:50,580
That's not very helpful to a viewer looking at this so you could adjust this stuff and one this is important.

1094
02:16:50,680 --> 02:16:54,249
No, you can't really change any text right now.

1095
02:16:54,250 --> 02:17:00,940
If you double click on it, you can just maybe change the word legend, but you can't really change any of the other texting.

1096
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:09,610
So the way you do it is you right click on the legend and you go to convert to graphics.

1097
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:18,610
Okay, so now it is a graphic that you can manipulate, but all the elements are in one big graphic,

1098
02:17:18,610 --> 02:17:22,060
so you want to right click again and go to one group.

1099
02:17:23,260 --> 02:17:27,340
Okay, so the legend is a simple one. One little graphic.

1100
02:17:28,720 --> 02:17:36,070
The female head of household variable is one graphic, and lung cancer mortality variable is one graphic.

1101
02:17:36,070 --> 02:17:38,740
And even within that, these are all these cool graphics.

1102
02:17:39,220 --> 02:17:46,720
So, you know, I don't want to see this are w1004 so I want to right click on that and I want to delete it.

1103
02:17:46,900 --> 02:17:54,550
So it's gone and I don't want to see f f, f, h, h underscore child.

1104
02:17:54,910 --> 02:17:59,470
It's not very helpful. Right click that and then delete that too.

1105
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:09,390
I may want to just move this element to the right and this element a little closer.

1106
02:18:10,890 --> 02:18:13,890
I don't really need the word legend. What's the point of that?

1107
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:18,180
So just get rid of that. So make a nice queen figure.

1108
02:18:19,350 --> 02:18:22,350
This is a little higher up percentage female.

1109
02:18:22,360 --> 02:18:32,420
And also I can lower it down a little bit. And they can make this lung cancer mortality in line with that.

1110
02:18:32,780 --> 02:18:38,570
So it looks a little cleaner. Let's say this is a little to be female, this test.

1111
02:18:39,230 --> 02:18:48,290
So you can select just a percentage female and it has to double click it and then you get some options on what to do here.

1112
02:18:48,770 --> 02:18:54,390
So I think under. Where is it?

1113
02:18:54,560 --> 02:19:06,970
Under text. General? Well, maybe I have to do this right click properties.

1114
02:19:12,930 --> 02:19:22,889
They are text symbol appearance and you can change the font size to say I want it to be a little smaller and you

1115
02:19:22,890 --> 02:19:33,330
push apply so the font size get smaller and then right click on blue cancer mortality properties text symbol.

1116
02:19:35,550 --> 02:19:39,110
Make that also ten and then apply.

1117
02:19:41,170 --> 02:19:50,070
We can then we can move these around. So they're in line with each other.

1118
02:19:56,040 --> 02:20:00,840
So just play around with that so you get it the way you like it.

1119
02:20:04,490 --> 02:20:05,629
Each of these elements,

1120
02:20:05,630 --> 02:20:14,840
you can even right click on this lung cancer mortality box and and group that to and then all of these elements of that graphic

1121
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:23,749
are and grouped so you can mess with each one of them you know you can even move you can move this text around if you needed to.

1122
02:20:23,750 --> 02:20:32,870
But I don't want to do that with the system option. So that's the way you kind of mess around with the graphics in a layout view.

1123
02:20:36,940 --> 02:20:41,320
The other thing you can do is add text to your math layout.

1124
02:20:41,500 --> 02:20:46,450
So this doesn't have a title right now.

1125
02:20:46,620 --> 02:20:59,470
Right. So every map, you have a title. So one way to do that is go to this graphics and text option under insert and you can create some text.

1126
02:21:00,550 --> 02:21:08,680
I'm just going to create a little rectangle text, the first one to make a box on top of the map.

1127
02:21:10,390 --> 02:21:32,770
And you can type in one or two more with two and one men per 100,000.

1128
02:21:37,310 --> 02:21:42,690
Except for. Now that's a little small.

1129
02:21:45,420 --> 02:21:56,060
I can right click on that for the properties, then text symbol and increase that font size and say I want it to be 24 ply.

1130
02:21:57,530 --> 02:22:03,950
Okay, it's too much the 13 point.

1131
02:22:10,480 --> 02:22:15,520
Within in the center transition center.

1132
02:22:16,510 --> 02:22:19,540
Why they wanted ball.

1133
02:22:20,410 --> 02:22:38,400
So from start ball. If you go to the slides or the lab activities, I have an example of one that created like this.

1134
02:22:38,430 --> 02:22:48,650
Right. It has had lakes and states also in this layer, but we don't have those.

1135
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:06,990
And if you look on the left hand side in the contents pane, it's added a lot more of elements here.

1136
02:23:07,140 --> 02:23:13,830
So each of these elements we added to this layout are part of layer three.

1137
02:23:14,670 --> 02:23:29,260
Okay. So you could conceivably kick out these select some of these elements to turn them on and off to.

1138
02:23:36,020 --> 02:23:45,350
If you get a lung cancer mortality and you turn off females in a household and you go back to the layout, that data is not there anymore.

1139
02:23:53,970 --> 02:24:04,800
Okay. So that's how you create maps for putting into PowerPoint presentations or reports and so forth.

1140
02:24:08,410 --> 02:24:17,400
So just, you know, take a take a few moments to just mess around with, you know, more and maybe try a different north around different skill bar.

1141
02:24:18,130 --> 02:24:23,320
A couple of tips have added here. Right. So you're right click on an element.

1142
02:24:25,270 --> 02:24:32,890
Yep. Okay. And go to properties to change things.

1143
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:41,080
I think one nice tip is if you need to nudge things, you can use control.

1144
02:24:42,320 --> 02:24:52,690
If you select something just like selected lung cancer, use control and use your arrow keys to nudge things up and down that sometimes is useful.

1145
02:24:54,030 --> 02:25:05,030
Be I want it to be nice and false. You know, the better way to do it is that.

1146
02:25:05,490 --> 02:25:09,060
And that's the bottom line. Oops.

1147
02:25:09,930 --> 02:25:17,910
Anyways. And so you can spend many, many minutes messing around with the way formatting works through to your pleasure.

1148
02:25:19,950 --> 02:25:24,480
So let's take a couple of minutes to check, look around and we'll move on to the question.

1149
02:25:31,340 --> 02:25:38,900
One thing to keep in mind is all maps that you create, like the layout, view and share and put in reports should have a title,

1150
02:25:39,710 --> 02:25:49,250
should have a legend, should have a naught there on the scale bar and ideally some source data like where is this data coming from?

1151
02:25:49,640 --> 02:25:53,600
Okay, so we put a little text box underneath that indicates.

1152
02:25:53,690 --> 02:26:01,190
Source National Cancer Institute. Institute State Cancer Profiles 2000 to 2000.

1153
02:26:23,130 --> 02:26:31,320
So once you feel a little comfortable with the few things we learned right now I do the same thing and create a layout for Michigan.

1154
02:26:32,830 --> 02:26:41,390
Okay, so the way you would do that is you would go to new layout.

1155
02:26:42,300 --> 02:26:47,430
All right. You had a new layout, so new layout will come out.

1156
02:26:49,020 --> 02:26:52,140
And then you say, add a map frame.

1157
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:57,930
Go to Michigan and then draw that frame.

1158
02:27:00,060 --> 02:27:05,580
So now we just have it for Michigan. Okay. And then then you would add other elements.

1159
02:27:05,580 --> 02:27:09,930
You can put the legend and stuff down here if you wanted to. There's a lot of white space to use.

1160
02:27:12,600 --> 02:27:14,740
And there's it's not ideal, but we're getting started.

1161
02:27:14,760 --> 02:27:22,380
You'll learn how to get rid of all the other counties that are in, like Wisconsin and Chicago and Illinois and Indiana.

1162
02:27:23,310 --> 02:27:27,840
It's a little confusing right now because we have all the states here.

1163
02:27:28,710 --> 02:27:38,670
But we'll learn how to get rid of those later. So take about 5 minutes and do the same thing and create a layout like this for Michigan.

1164
02:27:38,670 --> 02:27:45,770
Add a title at a scale bar at a near North Arrow and add the legend of.

1165
02:29:26,230 --> 02:29:31,840
One thing I didn't mention is you can add more than one map frame to one layout.

1166
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:38,410
For example, here I have Michigan. Let's say I wanted to show the whole United States on this layout, too.

1167
02:29:39,070 --> 02:29:45,280
So you can add another map frame and say U.S. and see on the bottom here.

1168
02:29:47,320 --> 02:29:56,650
I want the whole U.S. you know, it's not very useful right now, but in some cases, it's nice to have multiple map frames in one layout.

1169
02:32:58,380 --> 02:33:09,120
I guess if you if you draw a box around multiple parts of your legend or any other element, you can select them all.

1170
02:33:10,140 --> 02:33:13,260
And then you're merging them up right now.

1171
02:34:49,020 --> 02:34:53,590
Okay. We have about 12 minutes.

1172
02:34:55,320 --> 02:34:58,530
How about you guys work for maybe three more minutes?

1173
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:02,970
We will finish up lab activity five and we'll call it a day.

1174
02:35:03,140 --> 02:35:07,770
Okay. I don't think we have enough time for the sixth activity, which is quite okay.

1175
02:35:12,270 --> 02:35:15,570
You want to practice, you can create another layout for another state.

1176
02:35:15,810 --> 02:35:36,540
Okay. Yes, sir.

1177
02:35:39,120 --> 02:35:47,889
So the same elements. So I just wrote things and everything's all different.

1178
02:35:47,890 --> 02:35:52,330
Size and what not is a little to scale with each other.

1179
02:35:58,560 --> 02:36:06,020
Tomorrow we'll come together by selecting the mall during the boxing.

1180
02:36:10,680 --> 02:36:17,010
Did you people? Yeah, I did. Deacon. But then.

1181
02:36:21,020 --> 02:36:29,530
Just click on that how you do and you can move those things over.

1182
02:36:30,640 --> 02:36:37,200
Control message. Congratulations. It's okay. But they're call for of in their own right.

1183
02:36:37,240 --> 02:36:41,560
And you sounds like other friends that lined up differently.

1184
02:36:42,250 --> 02:36:46,450
One thing I recommend is not to change the size of business.

1185
02:36:47,020 --> 02:36:57,460
Yeah, it was hard to move it without doing that. So there was no time limit because the size is misrepresenting what's on the net.

1186
02:36:57,470 --> 02:37:05,200
There's nothing this size. Looking again.

1187
02:37:05,230 --> 02:37:08,390
You can control these and do okay too.

1188
02:37:08,410 --> 02:37:16,600
And do some. The.

1189
02:37:33,620 --> 02:37:36,620
Yeah. Once you kind of are happy with what you've done so far,

1190
02:37:36,710 --> 02:37:40,610
don't you know you're not going to make something that looks super pretty in like 5 minutes in?

1191
02:37:40,610 --> 02:37:47,780
Cause it takes a little time. But, you know, you kind of know how these elements work and how to get started with it.

1192
02:37:48,380 --> 02:37:53,420
Once you're satisfied for class, you can save this math project.

1193
02:37:54,380 --> 02:38:01,190
If you go to project and then save as you can create another math project.

1194
02:38:01,880 --> 02:38:07,160
If you just click on lung cancer mortality projects, the world will pop up.

1195
02:38:08,120 --> 02:38:10,690
And then you can put, let's say, Michigan in for a name.

1196
02:38:11,060 --> 02:38:21,920
You just put your name to the trash, underscore and save, and then either you're not writing over or ceiling over what we just did.

1197
02:38:22,370 --> 02:38:26,810
You can keep your word. And if for some reason you want to take this home with you,

1198
02:38:27,680 --> 02:38:39,860
what I would do is zip that folder and the projects folder or the or the page 66 lab folder.

1199
02:38:39,860 --> 02:38:45,860
Now you know, it's yourself might be easiest just to zip that specific project folder.

1200
02:38:48,350 --> 02:39:05,840
I don't have it in the steps but here and your C drive of projects and lung cancer we can zip this seven zip to.

1201
02:39:07,400 --> 02:39:23,120
You can just push okay. You know, zip it and you can email it to yourself or you can you can put it in a cloud drive or something like that.

1202
02:39:26,430 --> 02:39:38,610
You know, I would recommend you do add to I don't know if your max will open up a 47 zip file if you have Macs.

1203
02:39:40,500 --> 02:39:49,800
I haven't tried it yet. I need to try to when I get home. You can do add to lung cancer mortality dot zip.

1204
02:39:50,280 --> 02:39:53,970
I'm pretty sure that can be compressed by your Mac.

1205
02:39:54,170 --> 02:39:57,750
Okay, so if you want to play around with some more at home.

1206
02:39:58,200 --> 02:40:03,570
So now the next thing you want to do is let's say you don't make your Mac in layout view.

1207
02:40:04,080 --> 02:40:07,050
It looks nice when you like it. You want to share it with somebody.

1208
02:40:07,800 --> 02:40:12,460
You can just send them the apex file with this layout in it because it's not going to work for them.

1209
02:40:12,480 --> 02:40:15,840
They need to your pro and all that stuff to work.

1210
02:40:17,010 --> 02:40:20,670
You can't just pick this up and put in a PowerPoint presentation.

1211
02:40:21,060 --> 02:40:23,160
What you need to do is you need to export it.

1212
02:40:23,460 --> 02:40:32,070
So in lab number activity five, the share layout we're going to share, let's say this Michigan layout that I just made.

1213
02:40:33,360 --> 02:40:40,210
So just continue working with what you are working on right now and go to work.

1214
02:40:42,570 --> 02:40:51,210
Ignore number two. Okay. Because in the view pane, I'm just going to layout for not continental US layout.

1215
02:40:51,990 --> 02:41:01,890
You can do the portfolio layout three. You can rename these layouts to if you just go over here and click it twice.

1216
02:41:02,580 --> 02:41:09,960
You can call this column to mean for U.S.

1217
02:41:12,650 --> 02:41:18,800
Uh, and then you can go here. I think you could even name it up here.

1218
02:41:20,420 --> 02:41:24,920
No, they are for it in Michigan.

1219
02:41:27,500 --> 02:41:33,740
You want to name their layouts so they can do the Michigan one or the other one doesn't matter.

1220
02:41:34,190 --> 02:41:42,140
But the way you share it is you go to a share and then you go to export layout.

1221
02:41:43,320 --> 02:41:51,720
Okay. And then a new export pane will pop up on the right hand side and you can select different types of files.

1222
02:41:51,740 --> 02:41:59,570
I'm just going to use a PDF file and that's not the same.

1223
02:42:01,100 --> 02:42:08,840
Okay. Okay. So in their name, you know, it gives you the default name of the layout, but you can change that if you want.

1224
02:42:08,900 --> 02:42:15,830
I'm going to keep it, Michigan. It tells you the path that it's sending it to, which is your the lab folder.

1225
02:42:15,830 --> 02:42:27,110
But you can change the path by clicking the browse button and you can put it somewhere else if you like and take a thing.

1226
02:42:27,140 --> 02:42:34,490
It's already tip or output as images, not output as image.

1227
02:42:35,600 --> 02:42:43,730
And you don't want any compression which to learn and then push export.

1228
02:42:45,500 --> 02:42:58,860
Okay. And when it's done, there'll be a little green message that pops up at the bottom of the page with a link to the file.

1229
02:42:58,870 --> 02:43:04,390
So you can say view exported file and then open up the PDF reader.

1230
02:43:05,290 --> 02:43:10,530
And here is the PDF right here. Oops, they're going to work this.

1231
02:43:11,890 --> 02:43:16,000
And then you can share this pdf with somebody else so they have your name.

1232
02:43:16,120 --> 02:43:24,490
Okay. So that's that's it for today, I think, because we can't finish that at 56.

1233
02:43:25,180 --> 02:43:31,900
But if you want, you can try to do it at home. The basic idea for the sixth activity is for you to apply what we learned today

1234
02:43:32,530 --> 02:43:38,680
to create your own layout for a different state and kind of visualize not,

1235
02:43:39,250 --> 02:43:44,110
you know, Reagan white men, but really maybe black men and black women and things like that.

1236
02:43:44,920 --> 02:43:48,069
And so read this activity.

1237
02:43:48,070 --> 02:43:53,350
You're pretending to be a project director of a cancer control plan.

1238
02:43:53,470 --> 02:44:01,990
Every state is supposed to have a comprehensive cancer control plan that's funded by the CDC, and it's it housed in the State Department of Health.

1239
02:44:02,590 --> 02:44:13,750
And these cancer control planners, quote, unquote, have to develop a prevention treatment and management plan for for their state.

1240
02:44:13,920 --> 02:44:19,420
Okay. So you're going to pretend to be dealing with lung cancer for your state and try to

1241
02:44:19,420 --> 02:44:25,000
communicate what are the high rate counties in your state to your stakeholders.

1242
02:44:25,330 --> 02:44:28,840
So that's what this activity is. And we'll do this one next week. Okay.

1243
02:44:30,670 --> 02:44:34,750
Any questions? All right.

1244
02:44:35,230 --> 02:44:39,280
Excellent. You guys have a good week and stay healthy.

1245
02:44:39,280 --> 02:44:43,840
And I'll see you guys in about seven days. Exactly 10 minutes.

1246
02:44:50,210 --> 02:44:51,250
But I have fun with.
