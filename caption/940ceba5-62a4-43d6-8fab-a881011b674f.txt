1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:14,300
big homey.

2
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,440
later. bye. hey. hello

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,540
everybody. sorry we had sent military technical difficulty. but

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,780
we're ready to get started now and it is my pleasure. and I used today's seminar

5
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,820
speaker Doctor Marissa Isenberg. there's so many interesting things to know about

6
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:40,040
Melissa. I just went in today that her undergraduate degree

7
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,140
and UCLA in cyber net X is due. I did not know

8
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,700
how to get in under five hundred and seventy. so she went on and

9
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,880
to obtain her PhD in biomedical engineering in two thousand nine. just following up

10
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,951
stock in Ohio state. she came see her in two thousand twelve Doctor

11
00:01:00,951 --> 00:01:06,191
Isenberg. as part of the interest is very close to your hiring program. the diverse city

12
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:11,631
and complexity of biological Network. also very successful.

13
00:01:11,631 --> 00:01:17,391
closer fire and but what I mostly wanna tell you about today.

14
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:28,691
we should congratulate her because she's loaded to.

15
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:33,751
so I was not here when she did her initial job talk but I'm sure she brought the same excitement

16
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:38,951
and enthusiasm that she brings to everything and with today's talked to Dennis

17
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:44,091
Fidelity and modeling. think you think you. yes.

18
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:49,991
so I talked to him about. I just was really busy it's Marlene.

19
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:55,051
these dynamic in this message and in time. this time because I feel

20
00:01:55,051 --> 00:02:05,607
like with people

21
00:02:05,607 --> 00:02:10,667
hello this is Lisa. I

22
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:16,427
thought maybe it would be nice to like dive in a bit and talk a little bit about it. okay. so

23
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:21,587
we'll start. okay. so we'll send

24
00:02:21,587 --> 00:02:26,707
an introduction to identifiable and we'll talk little bit about what it is and what it means. it is in a general

25
00:02:26,707 --> 00:02:32,347
sense I'm not gonna dive into a_lot_of this is not necessary but

26
00:02:32,347 --> 00:02:37,427
if you decided to Fidelity. are things that I think all of us are thinking about you but if we don't necessarily

27
00:02:37,427 --> 00:02:51,407
use that word and so then we'll still talk a little bit about that. we'll talk about

28
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:56,587
some ongoing work that we're doing on this. it's all in full academic. that haven't his roast

29
00:02:56,587 --> 00:03:01,681
in twenty thirteen twenty fourteen. okay. so this

30
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:06,681
is not Molly. I love. talk to you briefly about why you

31
00:03:06,681 --> 00:03:11,681
think about doing that house tomorrow. so why do you not

32
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:16,821
home. usually are. bye.

33
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:22,941
good luck to you about changes in time. see how

34
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:28,321
you were feeling. call me back. thank you

35
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:33,961
for integrating a wide range of prices date. you can use another model and

36
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:39,401
connectors appreciate that. otherwise might be difficult to put into one

37
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:44,481
unified conference thing working so useful for both of those kinds of things.

38
00:03:44,481 --> 00:03:52,001
they have us calling you.

39
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:57,981
call me back. seven sixty six. the newly mobile small

40
00:03:57,981 --> 00:04:04,377
calling hey there. I'm waiting here.

41
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:10,877
when you get you started in nineteen twenty seven.

42
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:16,177
first about the birth birthday. I our time tomorrow and he said

43
00:04:16,177 --> 00:04:22,837
tomorrow this is Rosie. I really commonly used to. I'm

44
00:04:22,837 --> 00:04:29,037
today in my control wrong I don't go then. if your

45
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:34,037
mama been in up in a wide range of areas in Public Health it really becomes of this they probably

46
00:04:34,037 --> 00:04:39,137
use tool for trying to figure out what matrix

47
00:04:39,137 --> 00:04:44,497
is doing. happy understanding mechanism. all these different times of the day. okay.

48
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:49,677
so yeah. so here are some of the things we can do in missing skip

49
00:04:49,677 --> 00:04:54,817
pass. so yeah. so I was rebuilding these models

50
00:04:54,817 --> 00:05:00,507
and as you're trying to connect with Peter. so

51
00:05:00,507 --> 00:05:05,607
structure in the more detailed way. you know your typical rest of all.

52
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:10,767
have a very standard structure and you decide you know the house will begin with and also sorry for your

53
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:15,947
Morris. statistical for math. decision

54
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:20,947
to be made. which is the second that it allows you to cast your mechanism. and I love you to

55
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:27,067
send you later. bye. I love you a_lot. bye.

56
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:32,407
roll up. a_lot_of issues. I know you actually have the right baptism.

57
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:38,087
you know how much he tells me all of you.

58
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:43,267
we're doing a different frame or tomorrow. this is very we're interested in. it's not

59
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:50,467
necessarily the one we measure. so you know maybe measure. you know if this is

60
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:56,767
at a meeting. it's how much transition is happening right

61
00:05:56,767 --> 00:06:02,309
then. love you. what we actually find out

62
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:07,749
from models and becomes really important question. because if you want to connect your mom's data

63
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:13,649
and use that could use them in. you need to know what's possible and what's not

64
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:18,989
happening and what happens

65
00:06:18,989 --> 00:06:24,529
in terms of letting all the data in different ways.

66
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:29,689
alright. me but you have_to be really careful about how you do this what your assumptions

67
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:35,629
are all these kinds of things. so that brings us to the question is I got a fidelity

68
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:41,067
and I only do a survey when I use hello. haven't heard.

69
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:48,147
I believe you was gonna there.

70
00:06:48,147 --> 00:06:55,487
how are you guys. how are you doing. you have a decent handle on what it is.

71
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:01,987
hey how you work. so

72
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:07,027
something will be used for you and you. this is

73
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:12,127
addressing this question whether or not it's possible whether it's

74
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:17,407
possible to meet your friend from you and mom Lindsey. we were asking if

75
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:22,407
you have some more information on what parameters

76
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:28,507
can you actually extract from that company.

77
00:07:28,507 --> 00:07:33,687
you could bring over about thinking about whether or not your math is actually

78
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:38,708
you your model was the that program is based today they have one

79
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:44,128
two one. so if you get it a sec can you pull back and find the parameters

80
00:07:44,128 --> 00:07:49,208
and this is like a_lot useful. I need for addressing the question

81
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:57,568
that has very practical of the case. so we can

82
00:07:57,568 --> 00:08:02,868
talk about your mother's birthday.

83
00:08:02,868 --> 00:08:07,988
this is one of the names of the year. Michael it's

84
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:13,448
Russell. so grab

85
00:08:13,448 --> 00:08:18,648
your brothers. one reason that you might not use this is

86
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:25,368
your day. bye. I love you. love you baby.

87
00:08:25,368 --> 00:08:31,048

from Mid Star Bright

91
00:08:49,184 --> 00:08:57,624
House. probably hope

92
00:08:57,624 --> 00:09:02,644
that's one side something called structural I believe. this is

93
00:09:02,644 --> 00:09:07,884
where you're identified really problems might actually be put a bid in to the insurance

94
00:09:07,884 --> 00:09:13,384
from your model. I need you

95
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:18,544
to read. okay and all.

96
00:09:18,544 --> 00:09:24,164
well and one slip and two ten. okay.

97

so it doesn't matter how good your date is Mike. Mike Lee on

98
00:09:29,204 --> 00:09:34,226
the line. bye you're never gonna be right

99
00:09:34,226 --> 00:09:40,226
because. let's see this phone. bye. use this is Julie three one four

100
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:47,606
four one. bye. use the same overall.

101
00:09:47,606 --> 00:09:52,866
this is the model that you. this is Pam Russo.

102
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:57,886
please do give us a on I actually just some stuff

103
00:09:57,886 --> 00:10:03,106
from the mall. and when you can. I love you. love you here. we take

104
00:10:03,106 --> 00:10:08,966
Christina is a strange names. anyway. okay.

105
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:14,126
so we can get you know right here right

106
00:10:14,126 --> 00:10:21,266
this weekend is busy now.

107
00:10:21,266 --> 00:10:26,386
like just combine these two friends and someone. call and

108
00:10:26,386 --> 00:10:31,526
then just have_to be slow and that.

109
00:10:31,526 --> 00:10:37,968
so this message..

110
00:10:37,968 --> 00:10:44,608
one five and two. you get a chance. bye. hello. this cool.

111
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:54,428
you know just figure out what our needs

112
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:59,568
mission. please. maybe you know this is really critically important. maybe

113
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:04,588
this makes the difference in what you treat. you know what you should do or

114
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:10,068
you know what have you. we need to know.

115
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:16,448
we should be using something else. that's right.

116
00:11:16,448 --> 00:11:21,468
so the kind of questions that I like you get to Atlanta. the goal

117
00:11:21,468 --> 00:11:29,048
was identified to let you know now. okay. you know you don't need any.

118
00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:34,288
you can just read it off of the mall right away right. so like real

119
00:11:34,288 --> 00:11:39,994
small the combination for are much more settled they're not necessarily even in the same equation.

120
00:11:39,994 --> 00:11:46,674
call me for no other reason. won't necessarily get medicine. so you need

121
00:11:46,674 --> 00:11:52,074
to try and figure out what are the dependency between from there. what information can we get.

122
00:11:52,074 --> 00:11:57,274
what can we get that in. so that basically the idea behind identify

123
00:11:57,274 --> 00:12:02,274
ability. and just maybe in a more

124
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:07,514
visual way. love. bye

125
00:12:07,514 --> 00:12:12,534
now. okay.

126
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:20,574
love you. here's basically that.

127
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:25,654
think about you. I

128
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:30,814
just sent you note. your brother. it's

129
00:12:30,814 --> 00:12:36,224
not your direction

130
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:41,864
how you doing. are you up from the one from you.

131
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:47,684
you moving along. you don't see any change in your.

132
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:54,564
you know problems or something in that or you know the number.

133
00:12:54,564 --> 00:13:00,024
so you don't see anything there. so that means that those two friend is on identifiable.

134
00:13:00,024 --> 00:13:05,324
but it doesn't mean that the whole thing is a lost calls and that there's no you know information

135
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:10,424
to begin. because if you move your friend in the right direction. have

136
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:16,464
case number one. this is normal from

137
00:13:16,464 --> 00:13:21,582
now this is Shane. and what happened. your system right and so basically

138
00:13:21,582 --> 00:13:26,602
what's happening is that you have heard

139
00:13:26,602 --> 00:13:32,842
from you. what your mom. you all..

140
00:13:32,842 --> 00:13:38,922
I did the exact same thing. okay so that's that's basically the idea.

141
00:13:38,922 --> 00:13:49,362
okay. and so as possible.

142
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:55,582
this is for you to hang out a_lot

143
00:13:55,582 --> 00:14:01,002
well no you know if you work

144
00:14:01,002 --> 00:14:07,022
for business. this is this is the first May.

145
00:14:07,022 --> 00:14:12,042
we're gonna be late. this is Ms. Israel. this is possibly

146
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:20,075
your phone. there's some really

147
00:14:20,075 --> 00:14:25,215
I don't know how the message. is the one I'm gonna talk about right now.

148
00:14:25,215 --> 00:14:30,235
I'm actually waiting for purpose. Lauren for

149
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:35,275
things for doing the call. no no no okay. okay so

150
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:40,555
this is new. okay I was afraid of maybe having to be like. I know go away and sudden

151
00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:45,995
you know. okay. alright so usually you.

152
00:14:45,995 --> 00:14:52,275
but we had a PDF apology. you can just ignore the phone

153
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:58,235
call bro..

154
00:14:58,235 --> 00:15:04,275
so have

155
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:10,035
happy house whether you can get this thing

156
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:15,135
down. love you. bye. see you.

157
00:15:15,135 --> 00:15:21,591
bye right. but you have

158
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:29,571
my if you wanna know. really not

159
00:15:29,571 --> 00:15:36,531
you know what the best..

160
00:15:36,531 --> 00:15:41,691
love you. hey one brother. you school.

161
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:48,071
they need to be down the lobby. whenever you get

162
00:15:48,071 --> 00:15:55,031
here. love you again.

163
00:15:55,031 --> 00:16:00,171
if you get something nice birthday. that that's the really is only

164
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:05,671
one. we just need to hear courtesy.

165
00:16:05,671 --> 00:16:11,231
so like I got one

166
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:16,409
place. we should

167
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:21,589
hello this is your friend Ashley. so

168
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:27,229
you should be. and you can actually use this account you when you call. so

169
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:32,729
we can figure out what should be for sale ninety five. call me back.

170
00:16:32,729 --> 00:16:37,809
I mean basically where are this person is dropped down

171
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:45,729
in your house.

172
00:16:45,729 --> 00:16:51,709
you can you can. you can. you may have seen it

173
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:59,649
and who the hell is wrong.

174
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:04,689
so we're well more from March and right. so when

175
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:11,669
you have foreign

176
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:18,769
and then on mission and so then the probably

177
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:24,201
will better

178
00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:29,681
something. did you know. yeah.

179
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:34,841
happy Saturday. so

180
00:17:34,841 --> 00:17:40,501
then I say something wrong.

181
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:46,121
you get that. this is a reminder you are. you definitely can't stay here

182
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:52,981
should be. there's no_one that place. bye. it's for Fred. Fred

183
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:58,701
Prater this is this is Rosalie.

184
00:17:58,701 --> 00:18:05,601
bye. hey this is what we were not home.

185
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:11,381
we just we're outside the house.

186
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:18,821
actually available right now.

187
00:18:18,821 --> 00:18:24,087
we're gonna have this as long as hi Linda

188
00:18:24,087 --> 00:18:29,547
this is ninety five percent. this is

189
00:18:29,547 --> 00:18:35,287
I really

190
00:18:35,287 --> 00:18:41,187
I like more information. this.

191
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:47,427
so if you think about what the other parameters are doing.

192
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:52,527
if this installation. we it. bye.

193
00:18:52,527 --> 00:18:58,907
hey this is. and so you know the problem is. how are we getting.

194
00:18:58,907 --> 00:19:04,647
we should from today right. so something has_to be changed to call to see

195
00:19:04,647 --> 00:19:12,867
and I just

196
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:18,147
have really considered a relationship with me.

197
00:19:18,147 --> 00:19:23,257
it's probably the one was in a combination with our first day. so if you can figure out what

198
00:19:23,257 --> 00:19:28,357
your identifiable combinations are and then from that you can try and reduce your model right end and you

199
00:19:28,357 --> 00:19:33,437
know combine like we did with and one percent right in so that's it. okay.

200
00:19:33,437 --> 00:19:38,637
so that's all I like the message the intro. see how much time.

201
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:43,997
I had a question about the message part maybe before you know if you gonna be.

202
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:49,257
so if you wanna wait. so

203
00:19:49,257 --> 00:19:56,313
then the next piece I wanna talk about a couple of examples. don't answer the phone.

204
00:19:56,313 --> 00:20:01,493
is for the parent or medical bills or something happened.

205
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:09,133
all.

206
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:14,713
so this is this is it's a really nice I think example of

207
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:19,813
both seeing this message in process and also seeing you know what implications they

208
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:26,773
might have as you as you work with your model. okay. so

209
00:20:26,773 --> 00:20:32,593
with this project planning to do some online today and get it in.

210
00:20:32,593 --> 00:20:37,893
so probably most of you're pretty familiar recently.

211
00:20:37,893 --> 00:20:42,933
you going to see if it's transmitted by mosquitoes eighty that you I need double pictures. there

212
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:48,053
are force with you later. you know usually people are familiar with

213
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:53,253
because they have interesting relationship. high fright work. if you have one.

214
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:58,350
you may actually be more susceptible to getting them ready if you have another one.

215
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:06,110
this is not a

216
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:12,250
simple matter. more more

217
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:17,730
more more people develop

218
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:22,790
some work with your version which is get him registered fever which is both full and

219
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:28,970
ready for on that much higher mortality.

220
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:34,110
so up to three percent of DHS patient. you. bye. and so

221
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:39,570
in so much there's there's they have the regular

222
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:44,890
sort of seasonal academics of which there has been some you know perhaps the

223
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:49,910
date or a question about whether or not those are imported or existing

224
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:54,970
in the population and we were still interested in this questions and and had been wanting to see if you get

225
00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:01,386
this but as we dive into the problem. we should have realized that actually

226
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:06,406
just about to identify commonly used to the mall

227
00:22:06,406 --> 00:22:11,526
for a few words he hasn't really been established and it turns out that

228
00:22:11,526 --> 00:22:16,926
it's more complicated than what might have. bye. or whatever. so

229
00:22:16,926 --> 00:22:23,366
and so we're driving so. so all.

230
00:22:23,366 --> 00:22:30,046
happy

231
00:22:30,046 --> 00:22:35,626
birthday and if this is Ms. Lindsey. you're

232
00:22:35,626 --> 00:22:40,666
yours. you're probably talking to Gary. so we have_to be human right. we have

233
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:45,986
such human. this is happening.

234
00:22:45,986 --> 00:22:51,286
this is Lee. you mentioned people were going to get for not

235
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:56,734
getting back to. I love you. this is not and in the recovery class

236
00:22:56,734 --> 00:23:02,294
we need to think about. right before they

237
00:23:02,294 --> 00:23:10,694
walk away. and so we have a promise to represent you in the shower.

238
00:23:10,694 --> 00:23:15,714
you exposed an infectious mosquitoes as well. and so the way it happens

239
00:23:15,714 --> 00:23:20,854
in the mall. if that comes in contact

240
00:23:20,854 --> 00:23:26,054
with you and my friend. you know give you and this is Beth

241
00:23:26,054 --> 00:23:31,094
calling. you may transmit to the human right. so that's your

242
00:23:31,094 --> 00:23:36,114
basic model. I'm sorry. this is probably one of the only ones that will have

243
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:41,194
of us. whenever you can write down the grades for this is soon different locations is

244
00:23:41,194 --> 00:23:46,474
what we're gonna go with for now. many of you just wondering if you can just wanna figure out from

245
00:23:46,474 --> 00:23:51,674
existing things in the literature. there's an old lot of work right on a_lot_of these content of things.

246
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:57,602
so. so we ended up only to sign I love you.

247
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:03,262
bye. you know maybe from

248
00:24:03,262 --> 00:24:09,802
last service now. so this is me.

249
00:24:09,802 --> 00:24:14,942
happy birthday Jeffrey.

250
00:24:14,942 --> 00:24:21,482
I love you aquatics mosquito form. and then also

251
00:24:21,482 --> 00:24:26,942
we're gonna be some of what we're looking at and in terms of what we do see a note holder.

252
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:32,082
so you know that we have is incident date a weekly incident. so

253
00:24:32,082 --> 00:24:37,262
we're gonna assume that that we're measuring. so this is it this is in the hospital.

254
00:24:37,262 --> 00:24:42,402
and this is gonna represent the reporting

255
00:24:42,402 --> 00:24:47,762
rate. probably not. I mean certainly not.

256
00:24:47,762 --> 00:24:52,782
okay. so you can use only the structural identified and

257
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:58,352
show that the model is structurally identifiable and then to look at possible identified ability.

258
00:24:58,352 --> 00:25:03,392
we wanted to use. so we use them data and then we wanted to use this profile as we had approach that

259
00:25:03,392 --> 00:25:08,512
we were talking about right. and so here's the model said to the data and then

260
00:25:08,512 --> 00:25:13,532
use the promo.

261
00:25:13,532 --> 00:25:25,412
so if you

262
00:25:25,412 --> 00:25:31,092
really terrible. so you might like.

263
00:25:31,092 --> 00:25:39,212
if you do in our

264
00:25:39,212 --> 00:25:44,992
home. right

265
00:25:44,992 --> 00:25:50,152
now on the run. there are

266
00:25:50,152 --> 00:25:55,370
there just way way way below this man. I called

267
00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:00,670
answer phone. it's actually identifiable but quickly it is very not

268
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:06,650
identifiable right. and so life is sad. we are unhappy et_cetera.

269
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:12,170
there's a question. you know when you think about this. the first I guess I

270
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:17,490
if you want. you gimme a call

271
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:24,790
here. if you can. you can find a combination structures. that makes your

272
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:30,190
way home. this is you put from you you and get the facial

273
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:35,256
because it's cycling around. you know from you you you can

274
00:26:35,256 --> 00:26:40,696
have that for the average. that when you can. you could this is it

275
00:26:40,696 --> 00:26:45,696
and have it worked out that you get the same overall. you can

276
00:26:45,696 --> 00:26:51,076
also listen to between

277
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:56,256
you and the ones you got right you know things like that that you could imagine would make

278
00:26:56,256 --> 00:27:01,496
it a sense if you up birthday but you also up the death rate. you're probably gonna get about the same number

279
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:06,696
of overall mosquitoes right and so. so those things make some sense. now the question

280
00:27:06,696 --> 00:27:12,556
is. this actually not. so we can't really estimate our parameters.

281
00:27:12,556 --> 00:27:17,696
maybe that's okay. maybe we can still make things that we really care about right. and

282
00:27:17,696 --> 00:27:25,676
so. Princeton. one thing that we can

283
00:27:25,676 --> 00:27:33,133
the. right. so

284
00:27:33,133 --> 00:27:38,253
yeah. okay. so

285
00:27:38,253 --> 00:27:46,073
if you if you will have the profile and remove you from this Brown. you can see that actually

286
00:27:46,073 --> 00:27:53,713
pretty. so you know we can estimate most of you.

287
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:59,053
we're just concerned

288
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:04,073
because of the way home from work. I'm using inside

289
00:28:04,073 --> 00:28:11,193
the form. work out. you have a product between.

290
00:28:11,193 --> 00:28:16,613
you know human. you and Chris wanna decrease the other.

291
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:22,313
you keep your house and so yeah. so you can estimate or not.

292
00:28:22,313 --> 00:28:29,253
but if you wanted to use the smallest

293
00:28:29,253 --> 00:28:34,467
levels that we wanted to call when you mentioned

294
00:28:34,467 --> 00:28:39,827
maybe you know removal open. one

295
00:28:39,827 --> 00:28:44,827
of our five things like that

296
00:28:44,827 --> 00:28:49,927
right. and so if that's what you're doing. well we can still wait. potentially

297
00:28:49,927 --> 00:28:55,267
house you know how. Mike says an intervention be right

298
00:28:55,267 --> 00:29:00,887
time. so we just want you to

299
00:29:00,887 --> 00:29:05,887
use the exact name of it. you can see here in red and

300
00:29:05,887 --> 00:29:10,927
black white. they both look exactly the same right. because are going right.

301
00:29:10,927 --> 00:29:15,947
you know in terms of there but probably

302
00:29:15,947 --> 00:29:21,387
mostly in a direction where we supposed that we are filling up. love you quite

303
00:29:21,387 --> 00:29:27,867
a few population a day okay. which is a_lot but just to see what happens right. so

304
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:32,927
what happens in the rapid. you get the exact same

305
00:29:32,927 --> 00:29:39,043
incident you had before. right.

306
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:44,523
you get a very effective interest rate. which means that parents

307
00:29:44,523 --> 00:29:49,683
was. Missus Willis competition. how who this intervention

308
00:29:49,683 --> 00:29:54,683
is gonna work right and so that could potentially be a problem. and so it's something that you

309
00:29:54,683 --> 00:29:59,683
want to you know bare in mind when you're working with this model that you're using parameter

310
00:29:59,683 --> 00:30:04,743
estimation. okay. so then we thought. okay. well so if

311
00:30:04,743 --> 00:30:10,403
if if we really are not home maybe you know very well.

312
00:30:10,403 --> 00:30:19,003
love you Alison. so once

313
00:30:19,003 --> 00:30:24,823
we have a few different scenarios.

314
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:29,823
so wanted to just what we have_to do. maybe

315
00:30:29,823 --> 00:30:34,929
we could measure every Wednesday. you know baby.

316
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:40,389
I miss you I miss you and you know maybe we could actually take a ride over if you

317
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:45,589
have somebody out between

318
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:50,669
you. this if you could actually do.

319
00:30:50,669 --> 00:30:55,729
if you will get all these different stereos and you try them out. again you find that structurally it's

320
00:30:55,729 --> 00:31:00,749
identifiable. but if you look at the house. it's still pretty sad

321
00:31:00,749 --> 00:31:06,089
right. actually help you. really. I just kind of data into the mix.

322
00:31:06,089 --> 00:31:11,969
it does help a little. so happy

323
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:17,029
you later. this is more and more to you later. you

324
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:22,189
get better but it's still not enough. basically

325
00:31:22,189 --> 00:31:27,809
what we went from was a really late flight minimum like this two one is going like this

326
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:32,829
this is flapping out here. even though it's very nice and height in that very local

327
00:31:32,829 --> 00:31:38,395
routine. once you do about a ninety five percent off and suitable for

328
00:31:38,395 --> 00:31:45,535
it doesn't really help you that much. and so it turns up that what's more useful.

329
00:31:45,535 --> 00:31:51,115
you. this is. you can never do for

330
00:31:51,115 --> 00:31:56,255
from something like that. that'll actually

331
00:31:56,255 --> 00:32:03,555
give you. I really need

332
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:08,875
you and you're. this is a large panel where we tried a bunch of different

333
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:13,955
possible. and it turns out. yeah.

334
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:19,055
you can actually do it and get it. you can see your profile. you know process

335
00:32:19,055 --> 00:32:25,835
as well. you can actually estimate your parameters and so. so that's that's that.

336
00:32:25,835 --> 00:32:31,555
okay. so. so yeah. so anyway we

337
00:32:31,555 --> 00:32:37,535
wanna leave works actually identifiable but it's really not possibly identifiable

338
00:32:37,535 --> 00:32:43,171
from the outside. you really wanna be you wanna be getting friend or information by other means.

339
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:50,551
you wanna ask of you. when you have your model and

340
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:55,671
for the figuring out what it is that you need to know because all you

341
00:32:55,671 --> 00:33:00,791
needed to know you're actually fine right. but if you need to make predictions for this about

342
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:06,191
how well in your best work. then you might be in trouble right and so depending on what question

343
00:33:06,191 --> 00:33:11,311
you're asking is the model changes the other about whether or not you care. I was

344
00:33:11,311 --> 00:33:17,105
in identifiable numbers see how you and Susan.

345
00:33:17,105 --> 00:33:22,225
okay so in the interest of time I think I'm actually gonna I talked about cancer at the last day

346
00:33:22,225 --> 00:33:27,345
of the MSP stuff I talked with them at the last my last summer. so I'm gonna skip ahead to.

347
00:33:27,345 --> 00:33:32,425
I don't know with the links work. they were in my slide deck and

348
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:38,465
now it's in the PDF. I hate to. okay.

349
00:33:38,465 --> 00:33:45,785
so I wanna talk about anything that we're doing with

350
00:33:45,785 --> 00:33:51,005
our project. Joe and

351
00:33:51,005 --> 00:33:56,045
James and

352
00:33:56,045 --> 00:34:03,505
Andrew Brower who has done a_lot_of work on this research investigator.

353
00:34:03,505 --> 00:34:08,666
in particular because I also like straight up still a couple of this line. sorry about that.

354
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:15,051
so yeah. okay so Paula this is you know.

355
00:34:15,051 --> 00:34:20,091
alright Harris. only

356
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:29,071
because the process is all

357
00:34:29,071 --> 00:34:34,250
ready and hold the reservation is on going.

358
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:39,351
three hundred remaining. there's been a_lot_of thinking into the polio

359
00:34:39,351 --> 00:34:44,390
and games and yes of what are the things that we'll need to consider as we have kind of got

360
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:50,311
this. you know this is almost done. but we're we're not quite there yet.

361
00:34:50,311 --> 00:34:55,771
and so one thing that comes up. pretty

362
00:34:55,771 --> 00:35:01,170
thinking about which vaccine. and this is different banking options.

363
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:15,292
so.

364
00:35:15,292 --> 00:35:21,452
we'll protect you from the process. this is not you from transmission. you can still transmit the virus.

365
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:27,333
even though. so

366
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:32,833
it will protect you. we'll give you got in unity as well and so we can protect you from transition.

367
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:37,992
however you know in some cases. you know

368
00:35:37,992 --> 00:35:43,212
but vaccine bartender to be in very. and actually called for houses.

369
00:35:43,212 --> 00:35:49,633
in some cases and it also is it's. so

370
00:35:49,633 --> 00:35:54,692
you can be transmitted to us people hope to go the back right. so it's good because on the one hand I need.

371
00:35:54,692 --> 00:35:59,772
if you get vaccinated. well you know you're. hey will be made for tested because they

372
00:35:59,772 --> 00:36:04,873
may also test the vaccine right and then become protected but on the other

373
00:36:04,873 --> 00:36:10,212
hand. this is VA you know where that

374
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:15,299
actually call phone as well as an

375
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:22,579
a considerations and so one of the big things is that was

376
00:36:22,579 --> 00:36:29,079
long. you know eventually

377
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:34,159
we will let's see. and so hiring

378
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:39,299
on that hasn't been something that people have been thinking about a_lot but

379
00:36:39,299 --> 00:36:44,479
more probably need to get

380
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:51,239
you in a little sooner. if you use

381
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:56,639
our vendor. we're already. hello. hey this is

382
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:03,279
this is a very birthday. as we get closer to graduation.

383
00:37:03,279 --> 00:37:09,399
if you get a smaller more

384
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:14,559
people actually you know having Mike Susie. I

385
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:19,598
just wanted to see how that people have been moving

386
00:37:19,598 --> 00:37:24,999
towards environmental surveillance and part of the reason that they can move in for tomorrow.

387
00:37:24,999 --> 00:37:30,098
if this happens. that was detected through

388
00:37:30,098 --> 00:37:35,658
through Sue AC with arms around some sort of a deal that this is maybe something we really want to do and so

389
00:37:35,658 --> 00:37:42,259
that's what we've been working on so there was an operate. just wanted to see if

390
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:47,858
this is the reason it was originally

391
00:37:47,858 --> 00:37:54,618
through through the region but but it was June of December

392
00:37:54,618 --> 00:38:00,039
twenty third. so there was

393
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:07,138
no birthday sounds happening.

394
00:38:07,138 --> 00:38:12,713
so Wendy

395
00:38:12,713 --> 00:38:18,933
with from manager.

396
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:25,313
they started seeing. happy birthday.

397
00:38:25,313 --> 00:38:31,713
your evening. this is Dorothy

398
00:38:31,713 --> 00:38:36,733
Rise. this is Sheila. we're

399
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:45,073
able to track her. so.

400
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:50,453
so it's not been done and then

401
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:55,993
and then they found in Israel in February. made time

402
00:38:55,993 --> 00:39:01,373
and then later you know. thanks.

403
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:07,213
appreciate it. okay. and the reason I had to initiate

404
00:39:07,213 --> 00:39:12,444
this world. okay. only one this hi the reason the transmission

405
00:39:12,444 --> 00:39:17,464
was the thing is ten years prior.

406
00:39:17,464 --> 00:39:23,385
you know Israel had switched over to the Annapolis. and so there was a court

407
00:39:23,385 --> 00:39:28,724
case right then you know were susceptible to transition.

408
00:39:28,724 --> 00:39:33,984
even though they said that was. they then wanted to do silver touch

409
00:39:33,984 --> 00:39:39,724
up and then give everyone the world call me back. okay. so that's the story

410
00:39:39,724 --> 00:39:45,404
right.

411
00:39:45,404 --> 00:39:50,596
one for both of them. well this is

412
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:55,937
but if you're trying to use the status of our own. this is a friend work essentially for

413
00:39:55,937 --> 00:40:01,836
how you connect tomorrow. bye. not really

414
00:40:01,836 --> 00:40:06,876
but because you know him. as we approach the end. we need to work more and more with the bottom

415
00:40:06,876 --> 00:40:11,996
of the balance because apparently the case is not gonna be done right. and so

416
00:40:11,996 --> 00:40:16,996
if we wanna do that then we need to have a framework for how we're gonna work with it. and so

417
00:40:16,996 --> 00:40:22,136
what you saying. only you're working with. based

418
00:40:22,136 --> 00:40:27,177
upon your population. you are collecting all of the sewage or gray water

419
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:32,636
or whatever it is that you're selling from right and you don't know how many people are treating

420
00:40:32,636 --> 00:40:38,197
into that pool right. so if you find that there's a_lot_of polio in the school.

421
00:40:38,197 --> 00:40:43,356
you don't know if it's one person shedding a_lot or many people setting a little right. and so

422
00:40:43,356 --> 00:40:49,016
this question of exactly how many people does. just to chat with you. it's pretty unknown

423
00:40:49,016 --> 00:40:54,105
open. so that's one thing this is kind of a big open question and as part of what

424
00:40:54,105 --> 00:41:00,406
we want if use our model to look at it in time. I saw a little time. alright.

425
00:41:00,406 --> 00:41:05,706
so really been a model. I'm worried about how house and actually

426
00:41:05,706 --> 00:41:11,265
for questions. okay. alright.

427
00:41:11,265 --> 00:41:17,005
yeah. okay. remodel.. awful

428
00:41:17,005 --> 00:41:22,005
stool. but the still samples for convenience sample.

429
00:41:22,005 --> 00:41:27,226
and we're very very highly uncertain. so here it's plot here in one way. but here

430
00:41:27,226 --> 00:41:32,265
this is Paul with. you can see

431
00:41:32,265 --> 00:41:37,805
that you know there's a_lot_of uncertainty here in

432
00:41:37,805 --> 00:41:43,926
this department we don't have any data. if you can. bye. bye. actually happens right.

433
00:41:43,926 --> 00:41:51,122
how you doing. this is just to relieve you since we can't write and

434
00:41:51,122 --> 00:41:58,702
birthday happening. you know

435
00:41:58,702 --> 00:42:03,922
how the Medicare and social of hard to know exactly what to do with that.

436
00:42:03,922 --> 00:42:09,242
and so we were decided we were gonna use the environmental sample.

437
00:42:09,242 --> 00:42:15,382
so we have samples that were taken across the country. we're gonna focus here on one specific

438
00:42:15,382 --> 00:42:20,502
Senior High. the main one is the City Financial at the centers of the

439
00:42:20,502 --> 00:42:25,502
of the Jamaican message. using the right now. so please

440
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:30,562
again our work

441
00:42:30,562 --> 00:42:36,382
from home. refused your date it's your mom. right. it has_to do this interesting

442
00:42:36,382 --> 00:42:41,622
thing and so that's part of what we were trying to build so that we can set build a framework for using in formal

443
00:42:41,622 --> 00:42:46,942
surveillance data for in Brunswick with models. so we we put together a simple

444
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:56,855
model. it's very

445
00:42:56,855 --> 00:43:05,276
shed this is Sue it's raining so that's what we measure. maybe measuring the sewage.

446
00:43:05,276 --> 00:43:10,596
you can figure out what the lease between the sewer concentration would be and what you was

447
00:43:10,596 --> 00:43:19,496
from your side.

448
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:24,516
basically the idea here is that you you you duplicate your

449
00:43:24,516 --> 00:43:29,716
account. copies of your of your virus cycle.

450
00:43:29,716 --> 00:43:35,476
you know you tell how many are there roughly. then

451
00:43:35,476 --> 00:43:40,836
you then you just tell us how many cycles for you to get something right.

452
00:43:40,836 --> 00:43:46,496
which means that Laura Michael Gresham. the lower number of cycles is a higher concentration.

453
00:43:46,496 --> 00:43:52,226
you get there. bye. right back. so it's kind of an interesting day to sort

454
00:43:52,226 --> 00:43:57,306
anyhow. you can

455
00:43:57,306 --> 00:44:03,326
always talk to you Lisa. and exactly how people work

456
00:44:03,326 --> 00:44:08,326
that. you

457
00:44:08,326 --> 00:44:13,986
can figure out the proportion of people who were who were setting at any given time.

458
00:44:13,986 --> 00:44:19,865
and so we thought we were able to actually. so here are some of our model. this is Adina. I'm interested.

459
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:24,906
hi. well and then this

460
00:44:24,906 --> 00:44:29,946
is. bye. see how see

461
00:44:29,946 --> 00:44:37,186
how that all goes with that. we're able to actually citizen that. to.

462
00:44:37,186 --> 00:44:42,826
was infectious. you know as a function of time and from that we can actually compare

463
00:44:42,826 --> 00:44:48,446
our model versus

464
00:44:48,446 --> 00:44:54,261
earlier. we are here hey

465
00:44:54,261 --> 00:44:59,501
Megan this chance Brian it down. if you support them side by side.

466
00:44:59,501 --> 00:45:04,562
I mentioned to you earlier. that back

467
00:45:04,562 --> 00:45:09,701
is actually not really even from our. you could figure that out just from looking at the date

468
00:45:09,701 --> 00:45:14,761
you don't necessarily need a model. if you earlier

469
00:45:14,761 --> 00:45:21,042
too. so you know like well using the model two of Lucy.

470
00:45:21,042 --> 00:45:26,662
using the model the right.

471
00:45:26,662 --> 00:45:31,701
you can you can. I need basically. bye if if it's in the date already. that is

472
00:45:31,701 --> 00:45:36,842
speaking earlier and so that's that's kind of an interesting thing. as a result of that if you need to just

473
00:45:36,842 --> 00:45:42,162
get this if you will at service in the back because if he happens earlier.

474
00:45:42,162 --> 00:45:48,481
that means that most of the piece. the vaccine can start later. which means in event.

475
00:45:48,481 --> 00:45:56,285
we actually have been a few cases. you might have thought. otherwise

476
00:45:56,285 --> 00:46:01,445
this is an in progress thing we're in the in the works in developing a framework

477
00:46:01,445 --> 00:46:06,745
for linking environmental surveillance there with models. I don't I think has an exciting direction. as

478
00:46:06,745 --> 00:46:32,617
we move forward. so with that in the interest of asking questions I will say thank you and

479
00:46:32,617 --> 00:46:42,617
yeah hey honey.

480
00:46:42,617 --> 00:46:49,958
bye-bye. love you. bye. you're right.

481
00:46:49,958 --> 00:46:55,498
I believe you have prior than your mall. bye.

482
00:46:55,498 --> 00:47:02,018
you're right. not getting any

483
00:47:02,018 --> 00:47:10,958
anyway rainy

484
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:16,318
