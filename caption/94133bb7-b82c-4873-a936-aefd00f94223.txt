1
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:17,300
Oh. Oh, yeah.

2
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:41,010
My mom. She said right after.

3
00:00:45,150 --> 00:02:02,990
I know. I think I.

4
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:25,980
And I know it's just heartbreaking and I can't understand why not sure why is you know I really that.

5
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:41,880
There. I was trying to.

6
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:25,100
I there like I have. I.

7
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:52,990
I. I'm.

8
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:13,460
I don't know what it is about people that.

9
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:27,700
The. I.

10
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:37,150
You are aware? Yeah.

11
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,300
Right. I didn't know that.

12
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:55,660
You. So let us know.

13
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:57,920
You just want to say.

14
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:15,610
See that. Variety.

15
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:31,290
Right. Just like.

16
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:53,800
Yeah. One.

17
00:10:43,600 --> 00:17:52,490
And. That's good.

18
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:16,930
Yeah. I.

19
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:25,460
There. Now.

20
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:38,660
Yeah. I'm worried.

21
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:51,420
33. Yea. Yea, yea.

22
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:08,930
I'm not here. I.

23
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,760
We hired about 950.

24
00:20:47,680 --> 00:21:02,480
Half. We're not doing this on trains now.

25
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:25,040
There's nothing. It's just like that. And if you go back.

26
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:45,970
I don't think she lives in.

27
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:20,270
Yeah. For anyone.

28
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:35,270
We're happy. I have nothing to say about that.

29
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:49,090
So I would say. It's like.

30
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:57,590
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

31
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:13,640
I 25 year.

32
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:30,480
Yeah, I think that's. I didn't.

33
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,700
Right now as a grandmother.

34
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:57,910
I. I think that.

35
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,600
Yeah. But the police say that.

36
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:39,810
Right now. Oh, my God.

37
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,980
Yeah. Well, I.

38
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:57,740
Yeah. Great to have another topic.

39
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:09,360
Always thought about why do I want to do that?

40
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:15,210
People like me their whole life.

41
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:37,190
Really? Yeah. Now I know that you're not like me.

42
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:45,450
I can't have you.

43
00:25:54,210 --> 00:26:08,040
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

44
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:19,909
I don't know what I was thinking about and so on.

45
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:44,270
And I was like, No, you can't use the word that people are now to them the work that I doing way.

46
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:57,870
Yeah, I'll say that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,740
Yeah. There's no. Yeah.

48
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:57,840
Yeah. We're not there yet.

49
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:54,030
Perhaps. Now we're.

50
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:09,780
I would add no how. I don't believe.

51
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:56,180
Really? Excuse me.

52
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:45,790
Down. I heard.

53
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:59,630
We're not ready for that. So I guess meeting Sunday, make policy details you think need to be done.

54
00:31:59,750 --> 00:35:57,010
Yeah. And I'm going to work on that a little. Yeah.

55
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:47,870
You're. Okay.

56
00:39:31,970 --> 00:40:00,910
There any? You're.

57
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,950
I think now.

58
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:54,620
I. That I know of any.

59
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:39,790
Yeah. No, you're right.

60
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:46,300
We can do.

61
00:43:23,370 --> 00:45:04,280
Yeah. Yeah.

62
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:57,780
The. Yes.

63
00:46:13,320 --> 00:48:25,210
And the fact that we're. Yeah.

64
00:48:40,160 --> 00:49:42,180
A I of that. I.

65
00:50:28,710 --> 00:54:26,330
Right now. Guess.

66
00:55:10,490 --> 00:56:07,470
They have no. Some people.

67
00:56:18,980 --> 00:59:35,220
You. I.

68
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:57,440
Actually. Yeah.

69
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:41,640
Yeah. I mean. I think that.

70
01:02:26,560 --> 01:03:28,410
Great. I.

71
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:38,780
I don't want to seem like. I just feel so.

72
01:03:42,060 --> 01:04:02,290
Maybe that's that. Hear.

73
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:44,860
My father. Yeah.

74
01:09:48,640 --> 01:10:23,340
I. Oh.

75
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:54,790
I. I don't know that.

76
01:12:45,800 --> 01:16:14,700
There. There.

77
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:54,740
I. Yeah, absolutely.

78
01:18:54,740 --> 01:19:00,720
Breaking like, 3 hours.

79
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:06,380
You know, I just might have to watch, like, you know.

80
01:19:15,410 --> 01:19:23,490
There are no.

81
01:19:48,480 --> 01:21:16,940
For you. I.

82
01:21:35,500 --> 01:22:00,850
30. I have you.

83
01:22:03,850 --> 01:22:07,780
