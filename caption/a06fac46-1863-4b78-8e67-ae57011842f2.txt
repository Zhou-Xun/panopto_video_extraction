00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,790
Welcome to the second episode of Open Air, a discussion of the impacts of climate change on rural communities.

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,290
In the last episode, we discussed in general terms, the idea of climate change, what it is,

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:19,950
what is causing it and what changes are happening because of it and how those changes might impact life in rural West Michigan,

4
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:27,450
extremes of temperature and extreme weather events are the main components of climate change that impact Western Michigan with hotter summers,

5
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:33,480
lakes we use for recreation and fishing warm and there's an increased risk of toxic algal blooms.

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,070
Increases in extreme rainfall lead to more runoff of nitrogen and phosphorus from agriculture,

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:44,370
leading to increases in these nutrients in our inland lakes and streams, further worsening the algal blooms.

8
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:54,030
These blooms are caused by the extreme overgrowth of cyanobacteria that produce a number of toxins, most notably a liver toxin microsystems.

9
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:02,340
In 2014, a significant toxic algae bloom occurred in Lake Erie, causing the Toledo, Ohio, drinking water to become contaminated.

10
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,060
And residents could not use tap water for drinking, cooking or even brushing their teeth for a significant period of time.

11
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,360
Direct contact with the toxic blooms is not recommended, impacting recreation use of these bodies of water.

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,780
In 2019, the Hardy Dam right here in the Waco County, a highly used site for recreation in the area,

13
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,190
suffered a significant bloom, limiting use of the water there for several weeks.

14
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:31,450
Along the Lake Michigan Lake Shore, most drinking water is drawn from Lake Michigan.

15
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:35,710
Significant algal blooms have been recorded in Lake Michigan over the last decade,

16
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:43,910
and it blooms similar in size and scope to that in Lake Erie in 2014 could pose a major threat to public health and safety.

17
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,710
And more inland parts of rural western Michigan, most drinking water comes from groundwater wells.

18
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,300
Well, water quality can be affected by climate change in two major ways.

19
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,920
First, overall,

20
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:03,050
drier summers leads to more evaporation from the surface and decreases the recharge of the groundwater system that the well waters draw from.

21
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:08,230
Increasing the risk of a well drying up.

22
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:18,430
Second, extreme weather, sporadic heavy rainfall leads to more runoff from agriculture, increasing bacteria and nitrogen and phosphorus in the water.

23
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,350
This leaches into groundwater through the ground, the surface water, lakes and streams flood more frequently,

24
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:28,280
risking contamination of wells from the same nutrients and bacteria.

25
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,890
Additionally, longer, warmer summers lead to a worsening and prolongation of the pollen season,

26
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:43,010
impacting those with chronic lung diseases like asthma and emphysema. These impacts and impacts are disproportionately felt by old and the very young.

27
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:50,720
Worsening air quality can lead to increased levels of ozone at the surface, also posing difficulties for those with chronic lung disease.

28
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,630
In our area, there is only one hospital within a 35 mile radius and a maximum of three ambulances.

29
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,660
Ambulances serving our county at any time.

30
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:06,140
We saw recently with COVID 19 surges that an unexpected increase in individuals requiring ambulance transport,

31
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:11,690
emergency care and or hospitalization significantly stresses the local health care system.

32
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:19,790
More people wait for 9-1-1 calls. People wait longer to get into the emergency department and admitted patients sit in the E.R. for hours or days

33
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:27,200
waiting to get a room in the hospital or an ambulance to often take them more than an hour away to an available bed.

34
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,380
As the summers get warmer and longer, the increased burden of respiratory illness threatens to stress the local

35
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,850
health care system on a more regular basis as the system faces these stresses.

36
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,590
It is not just those with respiratory illness that suffer people having heart attacks,

37
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:48,650
strokes and suffering from appendicitis and having been involved in motor vehicle crashes wait longer for services as well,

38
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,690
threatening their well-being and the well-being of our entire community.

39
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:58,760
The mating season for mosquitoes and ticks, as well as the extension of their range into our area,

40
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,350
leads to a higher risk for diseases spread by these pests. Lyme disease,

41
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:07,940
West Nile virus and types of encephalitis infection of the brain become more

42
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:14,120
likely when these insects are allowed to reproduce and more frequently by humans.

43
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,810
And then the impacts of the heat itself from the hotter summers and more extremes of temperature have an impact on the health of people in this area.

44
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,300
The elderly are particularly at risk from heat stress and heat stroke.

45
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:32,800
Over one quarter of the residents of Newaygo County are 65 and over, compared to just one in five for the state of Michigan as a whole,

46
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,630
the burden of heat related illness in the county is expected to be higher due to that statistic alone,

47
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:42,130
potentially further burdening the local health care system.

48
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,450
I hope that this podcast has helped to make a connection between the very real and massive crisis

49
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:52,310
that is climate change and the impacts of climate change are having and will continue to have.

50
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:58,520
On a rural area of West Michigan, while we all have busy lives and many responsibilities here and now,

51
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,890
we must understand the real impacts of climate change is having on our lives and the lives of those we love.

52
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:11,510
It is imperative that even in rural West Michigan, we treat climate change as a threat that it is and do everything we can to minimize this impact.

53
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,390
Thank you for listening, and please tune in to our next podcast,

54
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:19,100
where we will explore how farmers in the area can help decrease the impact of their farming practices

55
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:24,080
on water quality amid the challenges that climate change has brought to their way of life.

56
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,310
All while increasing the quality of their soil and the yield of their crops.

57
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,472
Thank you again.
