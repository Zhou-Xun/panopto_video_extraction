1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,680
I was like, okay, guys, before we get started today.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,720
I have a so soon to be Dr. Mulcahy.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:17,610
Here comes the announcements slash request the that you hear me.

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,840
Yeah so I'm here to give you first opportunity for interested folks urgently are

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,890
looking for an MBA student you probably saw you go out about two weeks ago,

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:36,149
but i am the p.i. And underneath bridges and alison meyer who is the second year we read in the press pregnancy related eating,

7
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,280
sleeping and stress study, which is a clinical research study run out of live in hospital across the way there.

8
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,739
And we are currently looking for a part time research assistant to do hourly work on chart extraction.

9
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:54,720
So you'll be working on pulling data out of participants charts, making sure that participants are getting emails as they go through the process,

10
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,740
and if you're interested in any of these types of health outcomes,

11
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,829
so majority of it is like eating, timing, stress disorder and eating dietary quality.

12
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,750
And all of this is done in a pregnancy cohort where we have access to medical data from the mom and from the baby.

13
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,610
And so if this is something that's interesting to you and you would be interested in even having a conversation about this,

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,120
I would love it if you would send us an email about the study email here,

15
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:24,389
which is press dash study at the that you do send us a CV or resume and then just tell us why you're interested.

16
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,370
And so we're hoping to get this person onboarded, hired fairly soon so we can get working on this project.

17
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:34,080
And we would love to have you. So if you're interested or, you know, other folks might be interested, please share the opportunity.

18
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,299
They barely had a great start to that. Just have to acknowledge said it's mostly a remote asynchronous thing so it's

19
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,280
not that you don't need to be added by any given time but many hours with you.

20
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,490
So we just had it's probably up to ten, but it is a limited.

21
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:02,720
Once the data is fully abstracted and the participants are done several times.

22
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,730
Yeah, we have like we have like a budget of a number of hours.

23
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,760
So it's over the coming days? Yeah. Okay.

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:23,120
Okay. Okay. All right. So we're going to move on today to look at and triglycerides and cholesterol will be the number.

25
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,490
So I've shown you this slide once already on the show one more time.

26
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:35,740
So as I said before, as you have two extra powers, that excess energy is generally going to be stored as fat.

27
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:43,040
Right? So you give this example, which is this massive overfeeding of carbohydrates and hopefully find it easily maxed out.

28
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,790
And then eventually there was some left, you know, whole level chemicals.

29
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:53,330
Next class, I'm going to tell you why there's something wrong with the weight and turn it on Monday to find out.

30
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,750
So I want to make two very clear distinctions at the onset.

31
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,210
Sorry. We have no more of. No, no, no.

32
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:15,740
So two important distinction. So one is it's tempting to say that when you synthesize fat that causes obesity.

33
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,819
That is not true because it causes fat.

34
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:25,430
Synthesis does not cause to be like it does not it can affect where the fat is stored, which is important.

35
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,700
That's very important. And that is important part of the genetically. But it does not.

36
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:37,970
If you have improved fat synthesis, it is not. You know, this really does one second thing because you need more dietary fat.

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,250
That alone also does not cause the fat, does not become fat doesn't make you fat the calories and fat.

38
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,710
Right. So if you're eating fat and that causes, again, a lot more energy now that is what will cause obesity.

39
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,869
It is not just the perception of having fat does not result in higher tendency to obesity.

40
00:03:53,870 --> 00:04:00,529
In fact, there's effectively no difference between fat and carbohydrate intake on a calorie per calorie basis on obesity proteins.

41
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:07,030
And we're not getting that. But that being said, as we talked, the type of dietary fat does matter and it will affect one.

42
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,860
Those are two. Let me be very clear about those two. Pretty important differences.

43
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,480
Okay. So two main aspects of of lipid synthesis.

44
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,990
So one is, are we making fatty acids? That's the first piece.

45
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,450
Right? So we have fatty acids or are we making them?

46
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:29,270
Most of this is going to come from glucose, a food, potentially different protein, but it's going to be coming from glucose.

47
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,710
And then the second step is, are you regulating triglycerides?

48
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:40,999
Right. So the former is entirely dependent on the noble lipid genesis, whereas the latter could be important for both the noble look.

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,960
The genesis and what are you doing with the dietary fat? Right.

50
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:51,020
So we're going to talk to all of these, some of them. So I'm going to has a report anywhere.

51
00:04:51,050 --> 00:05:04,510
Try and see if you guys can try says this is important because it has been noted since there's 3.3 things I haven't.

52
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,540
Okay. So the people who said dietary fat are correct.

53
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:36,750
It only comes with dietary that we cannot make omega three fatty acids know we can't take any other type of acid and turn it into omega three.

54
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,889
And towards the end of the lecture today, I'll try to have you prove to me why.

55
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,050
That's why that's actually the case. Okay.

56
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:50,700
So one major form of omega three fatty acids is the number one food as ranked by the nutrition security class of 2022 avocados.

57
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,930
So today, our food, very fittingly, is your whole favorite food.

58
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,660
All right. So, like Dr. Burgess said, within a day is the avocado.

59
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,540
You guys, you heard that? No, no, I'll. Okay, I'll talk to the lab.

60
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:23,460
Okay. So the history of the avocado, it's a little bit kind of contentious on where exactly it originated.

61
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:32,129
There is some discussion about it actually coming from the African region about 10,000 years ago and coming into the South American,

62
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:38,220
Central American, where most people have decided where it was developed and domesticated.

63
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:47,310
But either way, it was domesticated and around 8000, 7000 B.C. in the the star is not in the middle of the ocean.

64
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,230
A little messed up. So the Puebla region is there's a cursory look.

65
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,099
Yeah. So it's like by Mexico City.

66
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,250
So you can see here the state. Oh, never mind.

67
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,490
You know, it's up there. Okay.

68
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:12,210
So it was domesticated in the previous state and it's spread across Mexico through Guatemala and Central America, along the Pacific Ocean.

69
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,940
And it was developed as wild types and or cultural mixing across Central America,

70
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:23,550
led to the wide variety of avocados that we see today, which we'll talk about in a couple of slides,

71
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:30,150
the all the different types of avocados that you might see in the grocery store and how some of them are a lot more common than others.

72
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:37,020
The European contact during the initial colonization in the 1500s with Columbus

73
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,090
led to the spread of it through the Americas and just all over the world.

74
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:50,460
Avocados are very common. So the significance in Espanol and avocados are about that.

75
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:55,139
So because of the region where they were domesticated in the Pueblo State,

76
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:59,760
they were beloved by the Kolmogorov and Mayan people and became part of the

77
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,350
mythology and cultural practices of these groups in addition to the Aztecs,

78
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:09,200
as it was also very common for them to be part of, um,

79
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:16,710
for avocados to be part of cultural practices as they were fascinated by the shape of avocados, including,

80
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:26,990
you've seen them drawn on temple walls and also used on stamps for fabric because they were touted as almost like an idol to some of these,

81
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,750
these groups and included within their culture. So like I said, there are a lot of types of avocados.

82
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,190
So you can see within my little word, cloud of avocados.

83
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:45,480
Hass is the biggest one there because that's where 90% of U.S. avocados are, has avocados.

84
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,469
And there are two different types of U.S. varieties that we see.

85
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,750
So there's California and Florida. Oh, and we're in secondary.

86
00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:01,440
Okay. So there were words. So the top one here is the horse, which is the most common one we see.

87
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,840
And then we have the Pinkerton, which is another common California variety.

88
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:16,709
And then these two here we have the left and the right that those are common Florida Floridian varieties.

89
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:21,900
And the main difference between the California and the Florida varieties are the amount of insoluble fiber that they have.

90
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,640
So the Florida varieties have more fiber than the Californian.

91
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:32,640
But like I said, in the grocery stores, most often you will see California varieties, specifically horse.

92
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,170
Oh, okay. Okay.

93
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:50,310
Okay. Okay. So the nutrient profile from the food database is that avocados are very calorically but also nutritionally rich.

94
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:58,169
So per 100 grams, which is about like two thirds of an avocado, there is 160 calories.

95
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:04,500
And as we know, the majority of the calories that come from are from that are lipids.

96
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:12,120
So there's 14.7 grams. So there's a little bit of saturated fat, mostly monounsaturated fat.

97
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,780
And as you can see, it's a majority of them over 81.

98
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,560
So that's oleic acid, which is also very common in olive oil.

99
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,999
And then there's a little bit of the pufas that we talked about with those omega

100
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,960
three and omega six is there's a good majority or there's a a good amount of fiber.

101
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,860
And that's what makes up the majority of the carbohydrate load for avocados.

102
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,170
And there is a little bit of protein in 100 grams of avocado, so two grams of protein.

103
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:52,260
And then the micronutrient profile, it's very rich in potassium and magnesium, making about 10% of those minerals and then vitamins.

104
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:58,470
It's high in vitamin C, vitamin E, very high in vitamin K and also full weight.

105
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:06,310
So we'll talk about how these. Nutrients specifically lead to some of the health benefits that we see for avocados.

106
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:12,490
So some of the overall health benefits, obviously with the amount of fiber, there's good digestive health,

107
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:17,500
especially with the ratio of insoluble to soluble fiber for the different varieties.

108
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,110
The high amount of folate supports fetal health vision help with the phytochemicals.

109
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:30,160
And there's also a good a lot of beta carotene. So those vitamin A's that are helpful for retina health.

110
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,650
And then the two main health benefits that I'm going to talk about are heart health.

111
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:41,710
So the fatty acid sterols and also the vitamin K and then the cognition which relates to the model unsaturated fatty acids.

112
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:50,250
So for her health, I just have a little diagram. It's a good source of vitamin K, which is a fat soluble clotting vitamin.

113
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,640
I won't talk much about that, but that's just a piece of it.

114
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,460
And then the importance of monounsaturated fats.

115
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:05,310
So reduced triglycerides, the effect on cholesterol and increased adiponectin expression, which I'll talk about in these next studies.

116
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:17,520
So for Lipid Labs, this was a study conducted within mouse models, and they took a bunch of ethanol and extracted all the avocados,

117
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:25,620
reduced it down, and then combined that with ethanol to create a hydro alcohol to extract of Persia Americana.

118
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,840
So Haber Project Americana is the scientific name for avocados,

119
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:39,420
and they found that it lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels for the people control.

120
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,890
So they just had the control diet in addition to adding in that paper.

121
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:56,130
This was non-significant. However, when combined with the high fat diet, the high fat diet, you can see with the different beta beta estimates,

122
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:05,250
you can see that it increased both cholesterol and triglycerides, but when combined with the HEPA, it decreased those significantly.

123
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:11,520
So if someone were to eat, be eating a high fat diet, including just avocados in there,

124
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,730
can reduce some of the negative health effects that we can see within that.

125
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:19,919
And we can also see that there's increased expression of adiponectin for both control.

126
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:29,579
Again, non-significant and high fat. The high fat diet plus the hyper adiponectin similarly to leptin and grow in is an

127
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:37,860
important hormone for regulating different fat levels and also is related to obesity.

128
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,790
So having increased expression is a positive in this case.

129
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,530
And then the meta analysis of overall heart disease risk,

130
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:54,090
some risk factors for cardiovascular disease and heart disease are obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes or hypertension.

131
00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:04,530
And within this meta analysis, they found no significant difference for avocado overall avocado intake within these studies on total cholesterol,

132
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:11,220
LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. But they did find a significance and good cholesterol, HDL.

133
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:20,880
And we can see here within this little triangle overall, it favors avocado intake, although not significantly.

134
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,630
And then the next portion is cognition. So again, good source of lutein.

135
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:32,140
That's the beta carotene that I was talking about, which I hope which has potential links with cognition.

136
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:38,420
Again, not going to cover that too much, but again, the importance of monounsaturated fats with reduced inflammation,

137
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:43,940
the fatty acids on brain structure, and also the importance of fatty acids within cell membranes.

138
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,640
So for this NHANES sample, within a representative sample of older adults,

139
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,500
they found improved condition in all of the five cognitive assessments that they were doing,

140
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:05,120
including immediate learning, delayed recall, animal recall, which is like a picture memory, a substitution test, and then also global cognition.

141
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,910
So within the sample of older adults, avocados were a protective factor for cognition.

142
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:17,940
And then within this randomized controlled trial sample, within a cohort of young, timid adults.

143
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:24,200
So 18 to 45 year olds, a 12 week intervention of intake of avocados.

144
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:29,450
So 140 grams and 175 grams offer that in women.

145
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:40,549
So that's about 1 to 2 avocados a day they found improve cognition in the flanker test, which is a memory test, the overall lutein levels,

146
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:49,430
again, which may be associated with cognition and then but they didn't find anything for the eyeball test, oddball task or noble task.

147
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:59,120
And these are specific cognitive measures. But we can see here that the concurrent ex accuracy for the flanker test was improved with baseline

148
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,370
and post for the intervention groups and also for the concurrent and incongruent accuracy.

149
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,830
And we can see the the different waves.

150
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:14,120
It's significant for the flanker test for the intervention group, but insignificant for the eyeball in the no go task.

151
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:20,270
Sorry for the little the mess of the test test text.

152
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:25,910
So overall avocados very beneficial for cognition and our health.

153
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,739
And so just some preparation and uses, we ranked it as our best.

154
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,460
So we want to eat it. So it's very guacamole.

155
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:38,750
It's the biggest one, avocado toast. You can put it however you want.

156
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,640
If you want extra good fats, you can put a well smoked salmon on there.

157
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:50,299
It's very fancy. You can just cut it up and have toppings for enchiladas, chicken, tortilla, soup,

158
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:56,600
tostadas, and also can be included within the beaches or just on top of a salad.

159
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:02,210
So overall, eat your avocados, kids. Are there any.

160
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:22,760
Could you speak a little bit about kind of going back to our carbohydrates portion, how why avocados might be considered a fodmap food?

161
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:31,430
Yeah, that's a great question. So if we went back to the macronutrient profile, we could see that it's very high in fiber,

162
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:35,240
especially the the insoluble fiber for the Florida varieties.

163
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:45,530
And so including a lot of just introducing a lot of fiber into your diet with like by eating you start eating one avocado a day,

164
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,650
you're going to have eight grams of fiber introduced at one time.

165
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:57,050
So that's going to relate to the the disaccharides portion of the fodmap just because of that, that high fiber load.

166
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,390
So that's why it's kind of within caution if you're not used to eating them.

167
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:18,890
For the pupils who knew what was it once they made three as many as sixes or mostly of mega.

168
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,610
Mostly inmates. Yeah.

169
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:32,690
So which is common? Most pooper bats or most types of foods are still in majority, I guess.

170
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,040
Yeah. I'm going back to the first study that you talked about with.

171
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,560
Combining the avocado take on a high fat diet.

172
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:54,730
Is there kind of like do they have reasoning for why they decrease in swimming when it was combined with the high fat diets?

173
00:18:55,060 --> 00:19:03,160
Yeah, I'm not sure. They didn't touch much on like why it was non-significant for the control and significant for the high fat.

174
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,309
Yeah. I don't know if they just. Yeah.

175
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:14,830
I found that like introduction or like in combination. If the high fat diet was mostly saturated fat,

176
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:20,980
which they usually are with in the mouse models and then introducing a lot of mono and saturated fat was beneficial for them,

177
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:26,590
but they didn't talk too much about why they didn't see it within the control group.

178
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:33,340
So for most most studies, even though it's a high fat diet, the fact that it's fat is like not that relevant.

179
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:38,260
It's a it's a really obesogenic diet. And so it's probably more of a model of like metabolic disease.

180
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,420
And then this a leading insight as humans work that is not necessarily.

181
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:53,170
Just remember. The other question I brought up.

182
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:04,970
Okay. So I'm going to start with the role of Genesis and then move on to triglycerides and then finish up with this one.

183
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,950
So as I said before, there's two sources of fatty acids.

184
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:14,270
So I would assume your body comes in one or two sources, either dietary or from synthesis.

185
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:21,740
So what where we get them from synthesis is these are derived from primarily from citrate, right?

186
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,950
So citrate being part of the tertile.

187
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:32,710
That's the main source. We could in principle generate fatty acids directly from a sun away.

188
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:38,360
The challenge of getting them directly from a subtle coin is if you get them from a sort of way,

189
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,410
they're probably coming from glucose because for reasons we'll talk about it next class.

190
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,370
There's very little reason that you would generate the sun equating fatty acid

191
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,570
breakdown and then turn around and then turn them back into fatty acids. Right.

192
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,700
It's kind of the same as the gluconeogenesis because this dichotomy.

193
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:52,910
Right.

194
00:20:53,030 --> 00:21:00,080
So in principle, you could get them from various ingredients in a cool way, but in practice you generally get them from glucose derived acetylcholine.

195
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:06,740
And again, primarily glucose. Is that the main places where this occurs, our liver and adipose tissue?

196
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,470
And one of the big challenging steps here is that the TCA cycle people,

197
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:19,969
as we talked about a lot is inside the mitochondria, whereas fatty acid biosynthesis actually occurs in the site itself.

198
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:23,150
Actually it's in the deposit reticulum. So we have this challenge.

199
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:32,450
If you've got to get the citrate which is in the mitochondria out or that sort of way straight out of the mitochondria into the into the cytosol.

200
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,840
Now it turns out we don't have an acetyl Kohei transporter.

201
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,750
There's no way that a sort of way you can directly get transported.

202
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:43,490
So we have to take this sort of way, turn it into citrate through citrate synthase.

203
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,820
There is a century transporter so no citrate can be transported out.

204
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:51,890
And then we turn it back into a subtle way using this other enzyme called subtle coils.

205
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,260
All right, so this is one of the first rate limiting steps. Here is what is the activation of ATP citrate?

206
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:02,900
Right. And the reason we have that is we've got to get the away of the mitochondria where it's generated.

207
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,649
So there's really three critical regulatory steps. The first one,

208
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:11,059
I thought global growth in the next little while is that ATP citrate is the second

209
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:14,560
set of so called carboxyl plays that's going to generate the monarch away,

210
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:18,650
which is the precursor to fatty acid synthase, which does all of the rest of us.

211
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,820
Right. So again, you're getting it out of the mitochondria through the somewhat complicated process.

212
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,640
So if you're doing that over the biogenesis from glucose,

213
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:31,129
it's glucose pyruvate into the mitochondria citrate out of the mitochondria and then back to a all right.

214
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,060
So maybe not the most efficient way of doing this, but that's how we have evolved to do this.

215
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,919
Okay. So the first enzyme, like I said, ATP citrate plays a problem.

216
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,330
As always, it's cytoplasm, but it's currently in the mitochondria.

217
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:48,270
There's no transporters. So the solution is to convert it into citrate and then convert it back.

218
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:55,010
Here there's two sets of regulation of ATP to realize it's regulated by insulin, by protein phosphorylation,

219
00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:01,129
and it's also transcriptional, regulated by SRP, BP, one C, which I'll talk about in a minute,

220
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:05,690
and I repeat, which is, okay, so going back to everybody's favorite word,

221
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:13,180
so insulin is going to be in it and so they're going to activate ATP citrate lines and it's going to do this by protein phosphorylation.

222
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,549
So how would you characterize these effects of insulin?

223
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:20,090
It's going to promote its phosphorylation. Is it antipyretic or counterpart?

224
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:57,230
And it's going to promote or reduce. Look at Genesis. Okay.

225
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,700
So the answer is these people.

226
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,440
So it is Caterpillar, right? Because what it's doing is pulling straight out of the textbook.

227
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,610
Right. So every time you take something out of the cycle, it's going to be possible.

228
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:15,560
So that's what we've talked about citrate a couple of times already.

229
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:21,320
But just as a reminder, citrate is the key node that provides negative feedback to false positive finance one.

230
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:28,280
So citrate when you have citrate that is elevated, that's going to inhibit glycolysis, right?

231
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:34,220
So that's sort of this negative feedback can give a lot of my calls as you have a lot of corrosive citrate is what regulates that too.

232
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:43,100
To start this slide says on the it's one thing that maybe when I showed this slide before it wasn't

233
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,839
as clear but it's clear now is it's actually not the citrate in the mitochondria that does this.

234
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,960
It's actually the citrate that's in the cytoplasm.

235
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:56,690
That's right. And so now, you know, citrate has to go through this complicated step.

236
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:01,010
So citrate is actually really an indirect center of a subtle way in the mitochondria.

237
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:07,640
This also means that if you undergo a lot of fatty acid biosynthesis, so if you're going in this direction quite a lot,

238
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,510
what's going to end up happening is you're going to deplete the citrate because you're

239
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:16,850
generating a lot of fatty acids and then that's a signal in the other way to promote glycolysis.

240
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,270
Right. So if you're pulling out of here, citrate is going to be lower.

241
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:27,499
That's going to make all of this happen more. So that's how you can sense the amount of fatty acid synthesis and you can couple that to like,

242
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:32,120
all right, so you need more pyruvate coming through glycolysis, you need to make more fatty acid.

243
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,930
There's a lot of fatty acid demand. That's how that's accomplished through citrate as well.

244
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:44,890
And then I was like, Wait a minute, citrate is also a positive feedforward regulator of acetylcholine carboxyl Yeah.

245
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,550
And again, this is only true for glucose, but not for produce.

246
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:56,900
Okay, so, so quick apoptosis is enzyme number two. So it's, it is actually the leading enzyme.

247
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:02,510
So in almost every case, so quick modulates is is regulated step four by acid biogenesis.

248
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:07,280
It is regulated both allosteric or possibly regulated by citrate.

249
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,840
So again, when there's high levels of TCA,

250
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:16,850
it's like really it's subtle immediately just suggest making more fatty acids and it is inhibited by the presence of long chain fatty acids.

251
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,540
Specifically, long chain ace is avoiding the activity of one.

252
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:28,850
So that's one set of our regulation involves this kind of interesting polymer, but it's also regulated by protein phosphorylation.

253
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,319
So it is inactivated by adrenergic and energy requiring stimuli, right?

254
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,100
So if you are using fatty acid, so it's not going to kick it.

255
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,370
And if there's adrenaline present, you're using the fatty acid, you're going to want to oxidize fatty acids,

256
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,729
you're going to want to turn off the normal of the genesis, right?

257
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:50,270
So that's why energy demand and peak able suppressed against kinases is very energy consuming.

258
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,990
So you want to make sure you have sufficient energy there.

259
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:58,970
And that's mediated by EMT, which is the same enzyme that regulated I do for cancer patients.

260
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:04,959
Okay. So the product here of some Quaker box leaves is this milk away, right?

261
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,920
So it's a subtle point, but now with an extra carboxyl group on it,

262
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:16,299
but a lot of it turns out to be the most important small molecule of this entire environment, and that's cow's milk.

263
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:21,400
And Kuwait has both a regulator, fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation.

264
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:25,060
So we'll talk more, of course, about the oxidation in the next class.

265
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:32,080
But on the synthesis side below Kuwait is the substrate for fatty acid synthase and is going to be the thing you need to make fatty acids.

266
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:40,270
But at the same time a lot of Kuwait is going to burn off CF81 CPG one being the regulator of fatty acid oxidation.

267
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:45,729
So we'll talk about this more later with the balance of away. If you have a lot of in Kuwait, you're going to go in this direction.

268
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:52,390
If you don't have a lot of more plates, you can go in that direction. And a long way is the key regulatory step for both of these things.

269
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:56,770
And if you can draw it out, it might actually recommend it.

270
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,610
You could probably do some projections here.

271
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,120
What would happen, say, in the context of adrenaline, how would that affect HCC?

272
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,330
How would that effect both fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid oxidation?

273
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:10,680
What would happen with insulin? How would that affect both of these? Right.

274
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:18,100
So like I said, this is the sort of key regulatory unit that we'll talk about the second half of that because those are the first two steps.

275
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:24,090
Luckily, all of the rest of the steps are contained within one enzyme called fatty acids in this.

276
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:30,489
Right. So in humans, all of the rest of the activities that take the language or the stomach away in a lot

277
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:37,900
of way and then do likewise recurrent additions to carbons at a time to meet quality.

278
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:42,880
Right so this is study has it since this study hasn't synthase does all of the rest of it.

279
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:51,399
It's a super complicated reaction it consumes to make one palmitate and a subtle Kawase ATP 783 ATP equivalence

280
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:58,450
to get the citrate another seven to make more liquid and then seven just as we talked about before,

281
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:03,180
if you're undergoing a genesis, you need also a supply of reducing levels, which is eight.

282
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:06,940
And all of these are shown in the various stages of this one.

283
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:15,600
Extremely complicated reaction. It's not a super energetically costly costs 224 and a half ATP equivalence to make 100.

284
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:23,920
Right. So this is very, very, very, very energy makes that one fatty acid that you're using 22 or 24 divided by 32.

285
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,819
So like eight glucose is going through a cycle.

286
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:34,570
Just the power of this reaction. The is just your storing that's quite strong.

287
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,000
Yep. So there's a huge cost of storage.

288
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,960
So the analogy to this is when we talk about glycogen synthesis, you use two ETPs every time you put a glucose under glycogen, right?

289
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,370
And so that was a part of that. And you saw in Genesis there's an energetic cost to that storage.

290
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:53,800
This has, by orders of magnitude, quite like almost 100 times more energy costly to make this.

291
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:57,640
So you definitely don't want to make fatty acids unless there's plenty of energy

292
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,420
and it is going to increase energy expenditure if you think that a written okay.

293
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,750
So the energy age as we've talked about before, are really two sources.

294
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,010
The first we've talked a lot is the people's phosphate pathway.

295
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,610
I'm not going to go over that again.

296
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:18,820
We don't understand that the setting is through this complicated when not talking to this other topic, whole family enzyme.

297
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,890
So if I go back to the beginning here, when we took this tunnel away and we transported it out to 83 lives,

298
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:34,330
we actually released an alcohol acetate at the same time. So the product he the drink was a tell us in a sort of way that makes it get

299
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:38,460
potent back down into okay and it's somewhat well so these are labels oftentimes

300
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,250
you know a lot of weight some quantity for the external acetate rather than

301
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,960
being recycled back in the mitochondria goes through this Malhi dehydrogenase,

302
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,549
which means every time you go through this process,

303
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:54,490
you kick out some quite you're going to generate an EPA here through the activation of Maliki HYDROGENASE Right.

304
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:59,200
So this, this pathway here provides a lot of the energy that is needed, not all of it,

305
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,590
but it provides a lot of whatever's left that you can't produce through this

306
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:10,459
decarbonization of luxardo acid is going to be provided by the phytochemicals,

307
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,120
possibly. Right. So it's kind of helpful through this process.

308
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:20,530
You're already helping to generate the ATP with this kind of think this is a bit of a byproduct, but so that is that.

309
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,440
Okay, so I've mentioned a couple of these things before.

310
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:30,400
So the main way in this fatty acid synthesis is controlled sort of long term is fatty acid being a long term sort of thing.

311
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:36,690
The transcriptional regulation seems to predominate is through two transcription factors what is called C,

312
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:42,400
H, R, EVP, and once called S or EVP once in. So we start with C, H, ABC, c, h r.

313
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:48,010
BP is the cholesterol response element binding protein, so it responds to high levels of carbohydrate.

314
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:53,799
So if there's high levels of carbohydrates chronically in the cell, it responds by activating a bunch of these enzymes.

315
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:59,320
Part B kinase. But in for the context of this lecture, more importantly at some point from oxidase and fatty acid.

316
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:03,240
Days. Right. So as there's more glucose lying around, it'll promote that.

317
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:09,100
Sorry, BP one C which sounds light and is going to look a lot like sorry.

318
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,090
BP to which we talk about last pass is responsible for fatty acid biosynthesis.

319
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:21,420
So as already BP too is important for cholesterol as a result, one is important for fatty acid and triglyceride to users.

320
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:26,400
And you can see this transcription factor has many of the same targets as see.

321
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:31,980
So both of those who give an excessive assertive P or even excess of glucose you're going to activate

322
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:38,370
in order to allow the signal to activate as high BP is through insulin and through a protein kinase.

323
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:43,440
We haven't talked about much yet. We're going to talk about a lot more, get the proteins called and torc1.

324
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:51,360
So this is what that is going to look like. So as a repeat one see its activation is very similar to as already BP too.

325
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:57,240
So if you recall from last class, SRP, BP two is inactivated because of the transcription factor here.

326
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:07,200
The transcription factor part, you're called Hlah is stuck on the plasma or on your membrane so it cannot go to the nucleus for SRP, BP two.

327
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,540
What happened was when you have low cholesterol,

328
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:18,209
this gets cleaved off and then you can go into the nucleus and activate cholesterol transport, which has been talked about for a sort of BP.

329
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,050
But it's the same thing.

330
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:26,730
You get the cleavage of of the act of one vessel at BP two, and that's going to go off and make the fatty acid biosynthesis genes.

331
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:31,710
But instead of responding to cholesterol, it's going to respond to high levels of saturated fats.

332
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,660
And then, like I said, the insulin signaling pathway, particularly this protein kinase called Mtorc1,

333
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:42,780
this process is suppressed somewhat by high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids.

334
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,450
So when I say saturated fats and polyunsaturated fatty acids, in fact, the mechanism by which they activate sorry, BP one is not known.

335
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,020
It's actually something that we've spent a lot of time trying to figure out.

336
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:59,459
I never really could, and I think the reason for that is what it's actually sensing here is the rigidity of the of the air membrane, right?

337
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:05,910
So if you have a high pupil membrane, then it's going to stay in there just like if you had high cholesterol that has hurt BP to it stay in there.

338
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:11,860
Whereas if a more rigid membrane, which is going be more of a saturated fat based membrane, that you're going to promote more activation of it here.

339
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:17,250
Right. And it just turns out memory measuring membrane rigidity in cells is quite difficult.

340
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:22,950
So it's hard to test this hypothesis. But right now I think that's what's going on here is it's really a function of the final physics of the look.

341
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:26,130
It's not a particularly signal property of either of these.

342
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,200
In the case of tau, there's it's a pretty well established pathway volume.

343
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,640
This thing called called in sick.

344
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:40,320
So the long and the short of this is what I'm saying is that when you high levels of insulin over time you're going to have more noble

345
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,629
looking chances and that's going to happen because insulin is going to activate these processes again because they're transcriptional,

346
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:50,610
they're going to be pretty slow and pretty irreversible. Right. Because again the cost of various about Genesis.

347
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:57,170
Okay. So you notice there's a bunch of different fatty acids we could have made, but we only make at the beginning.

348
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,209
We only make one right fatty acid synthase.

349
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:04,370
Actually, all that remains palmitate even though there's all these different fatty acids that exist in our bodies.

350
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:10,220
So what happens after we make the quality? Now there's a few different options in undergrowth further along Asian.

351
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:18,139
The enzyme that is most important for that is this elongate is called evolve yield six or it can be desaturated.

352
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:22,010
So we have a particular desaturated in our bodies called SCD one.

353
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:29,780
It is 8009 SATs. Technically it could undergo further D saturation by the delta 6.25 and 40 saturated,

354
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:35,330
but for reasons I'll explain after we get through this activity, that doesn't really happen that much.

355
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:43,310
Now, two steps to think about here. One is when you do elongation, you can only elongate two carbons at a time and some guy has two carbons.

356
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:47,420
So every time you add a subtle way on to a fatty acid, you can only add two at a time.

357
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:55,370
So if you start with C 16, you can make 16 to 18 to 22, 22, but you cannot make C17 take 19 C 21 right?

358
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:59,380
You can only make even numbered analysis. So 21 cases will do so.

359
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:08,750
It could generate primarily make C 18 a tiny bit of C 20, very little C 22 but it doesn't make any C 17 work for the D saturation.

360
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:13,710
It can only work at the Delta nine position, right? Yep.

361
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:18,200
So it's only going to work with those types of. Okay. So that's going to bring us into some of this group activity here.

362
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:25,910
So what I want you guys to do in groups, this is the sort of proving that we can't make pupil activity which a drug accommodate.

363
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,410
So which is C 16. Okay.

364
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:34,940
And then I want you to guess which activity is closest to the metal and which is the opposite of the carboxyl figure with which metal is,

365
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:42,370
that is and what fatty acid you would form if you desaturated poverty repeat the whole process to theory which is 18.

366
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:46,580
What is the goal for down the pipe?

367
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,379
And then when you come through these two,

368
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:58,610
then I think you should be able to explain to me why we cannot make omega three or omega six who indigenous people can hope to deliver success.

369
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:19,250
We'll spend probably 15 minutes or so on this and I'll certainly around how many people who are think you want to back?

370
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:23,830
Yeah. Oh, my God.

371
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,020
I mean, that's one thing that.

372
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:36,910
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

373
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:47,900
I don't know what this is one of the arguments for this one for three years.

374
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,530
I wish you know, I do. I'd like I said, I wish they would just somebody suggested this.

375
00:37:51,750 --> 00:38:00,299
It was an activity. But I mean, the noise, if we absolutely thought something was it's not really any of our statement.

376
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,730
Yes. As a person or people.

377
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:16,200
But I think there's a reasonable outside of the environment.

378
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:29,899
So I thought, you know, from my mind, I don't fight with always start with the carboxyl because if you do that,

379
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:33,850
then I can just be like, oh, whatever you're drawing, it's okay.

380
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:53,210
Yeah. And then the number one thing that I thought you were trying to do this increase the possible thanks to the size of the nine is close to seven.

381
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:58,460
That would be very tiny carbon dioxide.

382
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:21,750
Okay, let's go to the main course as you can get to college students want to do everything right.

383
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:30,530
Oh, my God. We're going to have a section of hair, right?

384
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:36,280
Yeah. So this is always there and this is not the same.

385
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:50,060
And that thing might not.

386
00:39:51,170 --> 00:40:00,960
You're doing what I think is closest to success and you're counting down the

387
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:11,710
consequences and that you have to on the street every year that we have to.

388
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:24,170
So now you continue to do so.

389
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:32,850
I'm going to go to 96 now. So I think I'm going to trust you to listen to me.

390
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:44,360
So it's not like you're going to be nothing. Let's just start with things like primarily Chinese women, which I wanted to mention.

391
00:40:44,360 --> 00:41:02,020
One was from the, you know, the longest and then is now 36,000 years.

392
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:07,640
Good. So which side? Left or right? What is that?

393
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:12,610
So. So what that means here to get the building right now?

394
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,360
If only. And then to get the old mayor.

395
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:20,510
Now, you would count which one do which ones?

396
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:29,730
Why is there a lack of security for so long?

397
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:36,770
And it's almost exactly. Yes, it's like this.

398
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:41,470
It's like, you know, it's like, where are you from?

399
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:53,990
And it just turns out sometimes are you know, if you're in housing, practically nothing.

400
00:41:54,290 --> 00:42:05,290
So maybe we should be doing something.

401
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:26,270
We counted on this question because it's a it's a shame because as you know, you know, you can't you can't count.

402
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,590
Just so you just count. So that's where you for a couple of hours.

403
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:51,430
So I was just wondering, you know, so many of these go away and then come back on the subject.

404
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,880
You've got here 67.

405
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:05,160
Yes. Well, so like I said, this is part of the government's responsibility for exactly what he said.

406
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:33,150
Yes. That's what I don't understand about you know, it doesn't seem like this is not so that we run and these are private citizens.

407
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:40,320
So this is built on those agencies, and one doesn't see it that way.

408
00:43:40,620 --> 00:44:05,410
I think it's just not possible to get involved in something like this for the first time, as, you know, something like that.

409
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:26,280
Now, I know you don't ask me to make you feel like this.

410
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:36,150
So now try to do something about this. Yeah, something.

411
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:39,880
Something that.

412
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,650
Yeah. Yeah.

413
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:56,819
But when you start, you know, so far it's easier.

414
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:00,600
County. It's okay.

415
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:27,560
It's not like 6000 views on me right now.

416
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:37,350
I hope you're on the right track. I think, you know, driver, the point is, you get all these questions.

417
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:49,920
Okay. So what was your answer to this? Okay, so now she's doing nothing.

418
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:54,990
So now we're trying to make a single site.

419
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:10,410
Okay, so we have that. Honestly, that's been nice because he has so many resources.

420
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:19,310
Yeah, that's like like it's been a while before that.

421
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:32,640
So you're going to take some time from now and then going this way.

422
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:36,930
I don't know what I think.

423
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:55,530
I was wondering, you know, why they're doing something like that.

424
00:46:56,310 --> 00:47:04,370
All right. Let's try and take a step back. So it's kind of like I even see it on the right.

425
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:11,210
So I guess what I was trying to get at is let's say you had any idea what happened to,

426
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:20,810
you know, like I said, I think it was mentioned that there is somebody else you can draw.

427
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:28,530
And I thought, I still like this idea, but it's not a 9 to 10.

428
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,600
But on the other hand, as a trick, if you just add up these oversights.

429
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:50,420
So why can't we make sure to just turn it over to the U.S. House?

430
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:56,600
And you can see the same logic I might do.

431
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:08,180
I was like trying to be funny right now because I can't remember how many people.

432
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:27,290
And so I still I'm wondering why I don't like to make something else that I know somebody else is doing a seminar comment.

433
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:35,030
Yeah. So I was like, you know, like, yeah.

434
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,430
See, that's waiting. That's.

435
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:49,270
I was like, Oh my God, cheering and all that.

436
00:48:49,720 --> 00:49:01,300
What's the answer to the third one? Yeah, I like to smoke, but it's the same one we can.

437
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:11,530
So I don't like me. Even like I like to be like this way.

438
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:16,360
So the way I do it, the way I answer that, is I draw out the advice.

439
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:22,280
I don't know what to say.

440
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:26,470
And then it's like to look at that.

441
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:37,340
We got. We got. It was good. Nothing romantic or anything like that.

442
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:44,570
That's what this is. All right. Anything or is it? I don't think it's wrong.

443
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:57,690
I just you know, I saw I think it's easier to draw the because I was because I would just start with the carboxyl and then account left to right.

444
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:07,660
But if you can't write all of those things, like you sort of always put it in, I think it's okay.

445
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,210
So I think most people are either there or almost there.

446
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:16,310
So let's let me start with the sort of second bullet point to the first question.

447
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:21,020
So politics C 16, colon one, Delta nine, what omega is that?

448
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:28,700
Seven, omega seven. Right. And in fact, I've seen like products at the store that sell like omega seven fatty acids,

449
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,940
as if that's like a really important thing, but then it's not.

450
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:36,640
But like a6c 16 is something we can make very, very easily ourselves.

451
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:47,750
It's the second most abundant fatty acids in almost all of it. Okay, how about for steering for, let's see, 18 colon one, delta nine, omega nine.

452
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:52,729
And I've also seen products that are sold as omega nine, very special omega nine fatty acids.

453
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:56,200
And again, whether they have some benefit or not, maybe, maybe not.

454
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,720
Probably not. But they're definitely not dietary essentials we can definitely make.

455
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:06,560
Okay. So for the third point, what was the answer to what fatty acid would you need to make an omega six, Delta nine?

456
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:13,950
The team. Right. So you would need to have a secret team.

457
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:18,510
So why can't we? Why don't we just do that to make our omega six fatty acids?

458
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:24,990
I mean, not too much, you know, because we build them as even numbered fatty acids.

459
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:29,160
Right? So if it turned out we could make sea fifteens, then we could make our own omega six,

460
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,740
and then omega six wouldn't be as dietary essential as they are now.

461
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:40,740
Right. So that's why we can do that. If we had a Delta 12 or Delta 15, that desaturated, then we could go ahead and make it ourselves.

462
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:47,280
You should also you could probably do the same third bullet point for what would you need to make Omega three move up?

463
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,970
And what are the fatty acids that you could use to make omega three move?

464
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,579
And then again, why would that not be a useful source of the three fatty acids?

465
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:59,370
Right. So that sort of biochemically while the omega three and omega six is we cannot make the omega nines in the mega.

466
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,200
We can't. Right.

467
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:10,690
Like I said, maybe there's some health benefit omega nine mega sixes, but like, you know, two people in one week and I was like, oh, okay.

468
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:15,990
So that's the fatty acid part of today's class. So I'm going to move on to Triglyceride is perfect.

469
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:23,639
So just remember whether you're making a fatty acid sort of depends on you a surfeit of glucose and that's going to be going into fatty acids.

470
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:30,959
You only want to do that if you a lot of energy. It's really, really inefficient and really, really energetically costly for most cases.

471
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,710
Triglycerides, acidification for people is going to be there.

472
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:40,080
Dietary fatty acids being really terrifying. We've already gone through an example of this when we talked about kind of microns,

473
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:45,430
where you break down a triglyceride part of digestion and then you reassert it in a column, right?

474
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:50,980
So that's already happened at least once in this class. So the process for this is, again, a little bit weird.

475
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:56,190
So with the glycerol, you phosphorylated glycerol, then you add the first two fatty acids,

476
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:59,730
then you remove the glycerol and then you add the third triglyceride, right?

477
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:04,380
So that's sort of the biochemistry of this once you get to this part here was to take acid.

478
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:07,320
This is just a phospholipid. This is this simple as phospholipid.

479
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:14,240
This can then be diverted off to make all sort of salaried or possible all the intercostal and also to all our cardio lipid, right?

480
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:19,010
So if you're making phospholipids, you get to this step and then go off to make other possible.

481
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:26,640
But for most lipids, we're going ahead with defaults for lead this through lipid and then that makes our triglycerides.

482
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,970
And so we need two things for this to happen. We need to have the fatty acids either from our diet or from a genesis.

483
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:40,950
And we need a good supply of glucose specifically for sports towards glycerol, specifically phosphorylated glycerol.

484
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:47,970
And it turns out we get that glycerol differently depending on whether or not we're in the liver or in the adipose tissue.

485
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:55,740
So we to start with adipose tissue. So the only place we can get glycerol from in our adipose tissue is from the breakdown of glucose.

486
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:00,719
About halfway through glycolysis there is a thing called dihydroxide dye hydroxide,

487
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,470
acetone phosphate that can then become glycerol three phosphate, right?

488
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:10,410
So this is just you go through glycolysis and be regulated by glue for hex, SPF, K one and all the stuff from the first unit.

489
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:14,040
Then once you get to this point, you would divert off to make glucose three phosphate, right?

490
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:20,090
So for fat tissue, you're entirely dependent on your glucose supply to make the backbone, right?

491
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:23,850
So if you don't have a glucose supply in your adipose tissue, you cannot make triglycerides.

492
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:30,480
All right. So if you're eating a diet that is purely fat and no glucose, you're going to be drawing glucose out of your Google angiogenic reserves.

493
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:38,250
Just start by that fat. And in the case of liver, there's a second pathway, which is maybe a little bit a lot more straightforward,

494
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,910
which is the liver can just forcefully glycerol with this thing called glycerol.

495
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:47,129
Chinese glycerol kinase does not normally exist in adipose tissue, but it does exist in the liver.

496
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:52,230
So the liver has a couple of options. It can either use glycolysis or it can use glycerol phosphorylation.

497
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:57,600
That means in the liver there's not as much demand on the glucose to make those product.

498
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:01,830
It can just rely on glycerol that is released when fatty acids are legalized.

499
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:07,670
Yeah. That's everything I had to in that order.

500
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:14,870
Any question about this role? Neurogenesis, where they exist in production is great.

501
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:18,380
Okay, so I'm going to move on to a couple of examples as I want to do.

502
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:20,960
Like what happens if this does not work that great?

503
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:26,000
And so in the context of here, where you're not able to make triglycerides and store them effectively,

504
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:29,390
that is a collective set of diseases called lipo distribute.

505
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:33,890
So like dystrophy is what happens in fat cannot be stored effectively in a different light.

506
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:38,480
Now sometimes you might think, I don't know, I don't love fat being stored in fat tissue.

507
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:46,309
That is the best place for adebola for lipids to be. That is designed specifically to safely stored lipid pretty much in every other tissue.

508
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:49,730
If there is extra fat in that tissue is going to damage that tissue.

509
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,829
Maybe the brain is the other exception. Right?

510
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:57,950
But like Adipose is specially designed that as these lipid containing droplets to safely store adipose tissue which you cannot

511
00:55:57,950 --> 00:56:03,709
store triglycerides in adipose tissue that is going to go somewhere else and then generally it's going to go to the liver,

512
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:10,940
the pancreas, the muscle, blood vessel, walls. All of these are going to cause various types of pathogenesis depending on where it ends up.

513
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:16,520
So as an example, if the extra fatty acids can be stored in adipose tissue, they're going to end up in the liver.

514
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:22,940
That is one primary cause of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and that is, as we talked about quite a bit.

515
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,150
So there's several genes.

516
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:31,430
So there's two types of lipid distributors, familial, bittersweet, which just means basically monogenic hurdle lipid dystrophy.

517
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:45,350
There's two genes here. A lipid and ag cud are lipid and and pat is the same name as Al Pat for a those cannot make triglycerides.

518
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:51,620
And then there's another one, lemon. Lemon. Which is a little harder to explain why that does it.

519
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:56,360
It has more to do with sort of the biology of the adipocytes. I'm going to take a bit of a diversion.

520
00:56:56,570 --> 00:57:03,950
So this is media reflection, which is I think my favorite media reflection of the year is a story about primarily this woman here.

521
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:07,520
So this woman has a lipid familial liver history.

522
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:15,110
And so it was late onset. So she grew up normally, but then as she progressed, she had a loss of lipid in her tissue.

523
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:18,350
She also has a male skeletal distribute, too, right?

524
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:22,490
So she also had muscle wasting. So she had both fat and muscle wasting at the same time.

525
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:28,160
So she was going through this debilitating disease where she was losing fat. And you kind of see there's very little fat stored on her body.

526
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:35,419
And at the same time, she was watching the TV. And this woman here, who is a Canadian Olympian, she was watching this TV and she said,

527
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:38,510
you know what, I think this woman here has the same disease as me.

528
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:45,260
This was like a lead level hurdler. And the reason she thought that is she was looking at the fat on her arms and she realized

529
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:49,280
that they had a similar lack of fat where most people have fat deposits on their arm.

530
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:53,780
And so she became convinced that even though this person also had a muscular dystrophy,

531
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:58,450
this person and this person were suffering from the exact same disease, and she actually was able to get in contact with this person.

532
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:04,070
It turned out she was actually right. This person did actually have the same disease ad and when this person stopped being an athlete,

533
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:08,509
immediately their triglyceride levels went through the roof and would have been at high risk of cardiovascular

534
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:15,350
disease and was probably her life was saved by this person's wildly acute observation of sort of lipid deposition.

535
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:22,090
And there's a podcast in the New Yorker article because was the whole story.

536
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:28,150
It's kind of a fascinating story of how this sort of more commonly so these are double

537
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:32,510
sort of familial lipid dystrophy more commonly is what we call partial lipid dystrophy.

538
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,750
So again, you can imagine some people where they just cannot store any fat at all.

539
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:39,649
That's like the one extreme. But then there's a bunch of people that are like just not that great at it.

540
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:44,210
They can do it a little bit, but not super well. Right. Just like with all the other diseases we talked about.

541
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:49,220
So this study here I'm showing you is a really interesting genome wide association studies.

542
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:55,190
So rather than looking at people who are at higher risk of diabetes or fatty liver disease, which people have done a lot when they looked at,

543
00:58:55,190 --> 00:59:03,379
is people who specifically had a normal body mass index but had elevated paddy and elevated insulin and glucose.

544
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:08,870
And it turns out they also have elevated fatty liver disease as well.

545
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:13,159
So this is just some characteristics of these people. You can see their body fat is lower than normal.

546
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:19,400
The waist ratio is normal and lower than normal, but they have higher fasting into their blood glucose in higher appearances.

547
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:24,469
So you could argue that these people are people who have diabetes but do not have diabetes.

548
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:28,020
What you would expect for their BMI. Right. So we're skinny ish, diabetic people.

549
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:32,100
And so what they found when they looked at what Abeles calls this,

550
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:37,040
they found a bunch of genes that were associated with this with this sub phenotype, almost all of those.

551
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:48,000
Genes that that were associated with this particular partial of the dystrophin phenotype are expressed in adipose tissue, right?

552
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:51,810
Most genes that affect BMI are expressed in the brain because they're mostly appetite, gene.

553
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:57,840
But the genes that expect whether or not you get diabetes independent of your BMI tend to actually be the in the adipose tissue.

554
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:02,010
And so the theory for that is something that we call the battle theory of diabetes.

555
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:05,910
So it's a bit of a weird analogy, but the analogy is that we all have a certain size.

556
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,750
Right. And maybe it's genetically defined. Maybe it's developmental. It's hard to say.

557
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:15,450
But we all have a finite amount of fat storage. Different people can store different amounts of fat on their bodies.

558
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:20,520
Right. If you have a larger bathtub, you can put more fat into it where you can safely store that much fat.

559
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:26,580
But for every single person, there's a point at which if you put more water in the bathtub or more fat in your storage,

560
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:32,669
it starts to spill out to other places. Right. And so now in the case of the bathtub, the water was falling on the carpet.

561
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:35,900
In the case of fat, the fat would be spilling out into their tissues. Right.

562
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:37,890
And so everybody has a different sized bathtub.

563
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:44,250
And so the theory here is the predisposition to diabetes is going to be dependent on what is your personal fat surge.

564
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:48,690
This also explains something that's a little bit people have known for a long time.

565
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:54,480
But I kind of mentioned right at the beginning is that if you have more fat cells and or you are able to make more fat,

566
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:57,960
that actually makes you metabolically much healthier than the opposite.

567
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:05,220
Right. Because you have a much, much larger potential. Better. If you can just keep expanding your fat stores indefinitely without any repercussions,

568
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:09,690
then you are much less likely to get metabolic disease compared to somebody who cannot expand their bedsores.

569
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:13,140
Now, this is like something to do as well with.

570
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:22,710
I think in the seminar we had last week, they mentioned about fundamentals of how you store fat in that area.

571
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:28,290
Does this have anything to do with how fat is stored in different areas of the body?

572
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:33,930
Right. Yeah. So the access to different depots. So again, that's part of the backup is like a conceptual backup.

573
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:38,819
But you can imagine that we have different places where we can store fat and some people can really expand their visceral fat.

574
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,580
And so people can store a lot of fat on their subcutaneous version.

575
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:45,570
Wherever you're storing, it is probably better than not being able to store it, right?

576
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:53,040
So yeah, it is related to that. So is this why we see like populations such like Asian populations where they have much lower BMI

577
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:59,430
eyes and are developing diabetes sooner just because their bodies just don't have as much fat too?

578
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:04,380
Yeah. So what I was mentioning is, is this here? So what this is showing is white.

579
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:10,780
Black. Chinese and South Asian.

580
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:13,900
These are all in American populations, but different ethnicities.

581
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:20,380
And what I was mentioning is, if you look at the curve of BMI on the X axis to in this case, this is diabetes risk.

582
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:24,360
These different populations have very, very different diabetes risks depending on that.

583
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:30,580
So, for example, I'm Caucasian descent, so for me to have equivalent diabetes risk of somebody of South Asian descent,

584
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:36,770
there's a huge difference in our lives where we're at 50% elevated risk of type two diabetes.

585
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:41,410
This is all tied to family and specifically here. Yes. And here.

586
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:48,670
Yeah. So the theory one theory here is that these different ethnicities underlie differences in the size of their available fat storage.

587
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:51,130
Right. So if you are unavailable to store more fat,

588
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:57,640
but you still see that this person is you would consider still normal weight because there are a BMI of 24.

589
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,510
But for their bathtub size, they are they are not able to store fat.

590
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:04,149
Right. So this person would now be at high risk of diabetes.

591
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:08,290
And these curves also exist for Napoli and hypercholesterolemia, risk of cardiovascular disease,

592
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:12,100
kidney disease, all the various comorbidities of I'm not sure about sleep.

593
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:15,320
I don't think this is true for all the other medical conditions.

594
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:23,960
So that's the sort of working theory out right now about why different people can carry different amounts at a policy and different levels of disease.

595
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,460
Right. But again, to be clear, everybody's bathtub is at some point finite.

596
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:31,510
Right. So once you get to a certain BMI, like if you're a BMI of 35 or 40 at that point,

597
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:39,190
almost everybody has some kind of going up even more so with like Android versus obesity.

598
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:45,400
Is it more like are the fat having better fat stores or like more fat stores in the guy to guy?

599
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,280
No obesity like better than Android obese.

600
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:54,460
It is almost always better to store fat in a subcutaneous region, but that's because the subcutaneous region is more expandable.

601
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:59,440
Right. There's a finite amount of space in the right because it can only grow so much where it's pushing into organs,

602
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:02,919
whereas like you could keep cutting fat, theoretically indefinitely. All right.

603
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:06,790
So the idea of having more subcutaneous fat is beneficial is that's why.

604
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:10,690
But again, not everybody can do that. Some people just don't store fat lives at all, you know, the source of the waste.

605
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:17,300
Right. And that's probably also, you know. Close arm is there.

606
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:22,280
I mean, most of research is Isaac Newton. It's like the weight perspective.

607
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:23,260
So what?

608
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:34,070
Like when it comes to risk for diabetes and other metabolic, like, shouldn't this be impacting our recommendations for like the general BMI range?

609
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:36,110
Yeah, for sure. Right. So.

610
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:44,850
So one of the challenges here is that so as people become more mixed race, right then like where does somebody who's mixed race fit?

611
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:50,210
Do we know? Do we need to know their entire genotype to know? Eventually the answer is probably going to be yes.

612
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:56,269
But if you talk like a more homogeneous population, for example, my understanding is correct me if I'm wrong,

613
01:04:56,270 --> 01:05:01,010
my understanding is the BMI cutoff recommendations in China are not the same as ever here because of this different trajectory.

614
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:01,330
Right.

615
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:06,800
And I think if I was a public health official in any other country, I would want to know what this curve looks like for the majority of my population.

616
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:13,879
Right. Because if you're really worrying about metabolic risk at a BMI of 27, that's not a huge risk in a Caucasian population.

617
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,340
Right. But it's a really, really big risk in other countries.

618
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:22,100
And so that should be sort of targeting public health advice and guidance for the next year.

619
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:31,520
So you're saying that like siblings can have different so like they can have the same BMI, but like one could be more at risk?

620
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:36,260
Yeah, exactly. Because the genetics are going to be different between your siblings. Right. And that's why, you know, it gets a little hard.

621
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,839
You know, this oversimplifies things very well for the like.

622
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:43,430
If you imagine across all South Asian populations, there are certain people who are large by a couple of people.

623
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:47,690
Right. So these are generalizations across different populations, schools where people is getting at.

624
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:52,040
But eventually we should be able to get to more precise recommendations based on genotypes, meaning like,

625
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:56,090
all right, this person actually you can actually be like 31, 32 is not going be a huge problem.

626
01:05:56,420 --> 01:06:04,490
But based on your profile, you're this other person maybe at a BMI 25 or 26, it starts to become more problematic for you.

627
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:09,320
And these curves are you know, they're generally the same trends, like I said, across different metabolic diseases.

628
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:15,229
But those are the genes that would affect the risk of, say, hypercholesterolemia wouldn't necessarily be the same as ones like diabetes.

629
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:18,850
Right? So it gets a little more confusing depending on what you look like.

630
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:23,310
Okay. So that was liquid dystrophy, right?

631
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:26,000
And so like, like I said, think of liquid history as a continuum.

632
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,559
There's the extreme, which is that woman from the from the we have a podcast versus everybody else.

633
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:33,920
We are all on some somewhere on that name. So all of us have really big match up.

634
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:37,990
Some of us are on the right now. We don't really know what they are. We can make some guesses, but we don't really know.

635
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:44,770
Okay. So I'm going to finish off in the last 15 minutes here today with cholesterol synthesis and cholesterol biogenesis.

636
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:46,729
So as I mentioned before, most of the diet,

637
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:52,400
most of the cholesterol in our bodies is made indigenously about 2 to 1 margin, cholesterol versus dietary cholesterol.

638
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:57,559
So this is, again, one reason why restricting dietary cholesterol can only get you so far out of your body,

639
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:03,980
just creating plenty of cholesterol, then it doesn't really matter if you restricted the biosynthesis of cholesterol.

640
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:07,340
It's super complicated. There's like 25 steps of which I could probably only name the first two.

641
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:10,700
But the key thing is here you start from the excess, a subtle coating.

642
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:14,330
So this could be the same as the way that came out of the citrate shuttle.

643
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:23,970
So it'd be centralized system and it's going to be diverted towards cholesterol through this one very limited step, which is called three.

644
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:28,999
This this one really means that which is called HMG Coa reductase.

645
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,149
Right? So that's the limiting step. There's like 15 other steps after that.

646
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:39,140
But this is the most important sector is HMO GCR. So HMO GCR Decoy reductase is the target of that.

647
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:45,170
So statins are one of the most used medications in the world, probably one of the most demonstrably beneficial medications in the world.

648
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:48,530
And they work by looking somewhat like HMG. Correct? Right.

649
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:56,149
So this is Pravastatin. You can see if you squint out and look at a funny product that kind of looks like it's on the right and so premise that it

650
01:07:56,150 --> 01:08:03,110
binds to the active site in this way reductase and because it binds to the active site prevents endogenous cholesterol begins.

651
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:07,640
Right. So that is turned out to be much more useful in reducing cholesterol than dietary

652
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:11,890
interventions because it affects the two thirds of the cholesterol that is made indigenously.

653
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:17,570
Right. General is always, of course, recommended along with dietary cholesterol restrictions in the case of hypercholesterolemia.

654
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:22,400
So that's where statins fit. All right.

655
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:27,020
Took up my lifetime of my breakfast.

656
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:32,120
So cholesterol since biosynthesis is regulated on a couple of points.

657
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:38,030
So of course, since age and PCR is the most important is that that's the site of all the regulation.

658
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:43,219
So the most one step of regulation is there's some feedback from some of these other products.

659
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:48,110
Like I said, once you make HMG, COA, then there's a bunch of these other steps that even this diagram didn't show them.

660
01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:54,590
But some of these steps can allosteric inhibit. HMG coherence is just sort of classic negative feedback inhibition here.

661
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:59,750
Some of these also affect sorry, BP, to which you mean to talk about in a minute.

662
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:05,750
So we do know that there is some feedback of having high intracellular cholesterol,

663
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:09,829
but we don't exactly know which mid products are the most troubling here.

664
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:12,830
First, I think it helps there, but we do know that most.

665
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:17,960
The regulation is through through as far as we're going through.

666
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:20,360
Again, you may think this is the same slide I showed you,

667
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:26,570
but it's not because now it's very easy to ascribe to is, as I said, last class is inhibited by steroids.

668
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:30,650
Right. So if there's a lot of cholesterol in the membrane, just like in the intestinal system,

669
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:36,170
if there's lots of cholesterol there, then SRB is maintained an inactive state.

670
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:44,060
However, when it's activated because cholesterol levels are low, you then get a transcription of a few different enzymes.

671
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:50,060
Most importantly right now HMG, Coa, reductase, and most importantly for next pass the LDL receptor.

672
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:53,570
Right. So there's a lot of regulation here. Again, transcriptional, and I want to be clear.

673
01:09:53,720 --> 01:10:01,860
Sorry, BP too is for cholesterol transport and for cholesterol synthesis, as already one is for the noble gases and triglycerides.

674
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:09,530
But they're both regulated by this similar membrane sensing cleavage mechanism.

675
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:14,200
All right. So that is, I think, all I have to announce today.

676
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:18,190
Well, actually, I'm not going to go yet, because I do have one thing which I had a slide which I took up here.

677
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,430
So there's this thing called reasonable read.

678
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:31,900
You will read to the newsstand, right?

679
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:37,480
Just read space these. Really?

680
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:48,479
Yeah. Okay. So there is a particular type of East Rice, so you claim of rice that is permitted.

681
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:52,350
And so we had a fruit of the day three or four years ago where somebody was telling me about this particular type of rice.

682
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:56,940
This was their food. This was definitely not what it was. It was so this this red, right?

683
01:10:56,940 --> 01:11:02,670
Red yeast. Rice, which apparently is more common, but it is more common in some areas of Southeast Asia,

684
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:06,750
has been associated with lower cholesterol levels in certain populations.

685
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:13,680
And there was the thought there was some magic natural product that people could find if they looked into this reduced rice estrogen.

686
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:17,010
They've done a lot of studies where you could supplement people with just the rice and it had some effect.

687
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:21,100
It actually turns out that the red yeast rice would help determine it.

688
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,719
Here is the chemical in red yeast.

689
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:29,760
Rice is actually exactly the same thing as Pravastatin. It just indigenously makes protein.

690
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:36,120
So you may hear of Reggie's rice as people might want to reduce their cholesterol and they want to like, oh, I read about this Reggie's red thing.

691
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:41,160
I'm taking that to reduce your cholesterol. Maybe, maybe not. But effectively, whether they know it or not, they're taking Pravastatin.

692
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:45,570
That's taking a non prescribed version of Pravastatin, the exact same thing.

693
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:57,209
And I pulled it for the right reasons for that. That's one of the reasons that some studies about this like supplement that you know,

694
01:11:57,210 --> 01:12:00,690
because generally just put people in the stands like people have high cholesterol

695
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:03,840
and I would argue that this should be to is if you have high cholesterol,

696
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:09,300
you should be put on some of what people that food and they might argue that they would prefer that.

697
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:13,200
And I know, Steve, also let me just close up so you can see what I'm looking at here.

698
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:17,760
There I produce for a three year and this is on the and disease website.

699
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:22,710
But now people, of course, as is your watch, you can go to the grocery store, you buy supplements already.

700
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:29,740
But again, all you're doing is applying a standard without a prescription. Okay, I'll see you guys.

701
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:33,840
Let's do that with an unknown variable. You're not going.
