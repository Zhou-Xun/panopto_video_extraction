00:00:02,534 --> 00:00:03,614
SPH Classroom: Good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:04,934 --> 00:00:15,073
Welcome to the 2022 Brachman memorial lecture of the 57th summer session in Epidemiology at the University of Michigan.

3
00:00:15,074 --> 00:00:24,133
My name is Eduardo Villamor, I'm a professor of Epidemiology at U of M, and currently serve as the director of the summer session.

4
00:00:24,134 --> 00:00:34,274
It's a deep honor to host this lectureship and I would like to start with a few words about the Philip Brachman on who's memory this lectureship is endowed.

5
00:00:36,164 --> 00:00:40,909
A physician by training, Dr. Brachman was a legend in public health.

6
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:47,943
He joined the CDC in 1954 where he held many positions until his retirement,

7
00:00:47,943 --> 00:01:00,404
including director of the field epidemiology training program,

8
00:00:53,414 --> 00:00:59,024
and director of the epidemiology program office from 1970 to 1981.

9
00:01:00,404 --> 00:01:08,594
After retiring from the CDC in 1986, Dr. Brachman joined the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University,

10
00:01:08,594 --> 00:01:15,823
where he taught epidemiology, biostatistics, public health surveillance, and infectious diseases.

11
00:01:15,824 --> 00:01:19,956
He also directed the Hubert Humphrey fellowship program that brought

12
00:01:19,957 --> 00:01:27,704
countless public health practitioners from all reaches of the globe to Emory each year.

13
00:01:27,704 --> 00:01:34,686
As a result of his 62 years as an outstanding educator thousands of professionals around the world

14
00:01:34,686 --> 00:01:41,018
are able to help politicians, community leaders, service providers, and public health officials

15
00:01:41,018 --> 00:02:34,429
make data-driven public health decisions in many areas from AIDS to Zika.

16
00:01:50,894 --> 00:01:56,954
I'm pleased to introduce the 2022 Phillip Brachman memorial later Dr. Helena Hansen.

17
00:01:58,364 --> 00:02:12,764
Dr Hansen is a professor and incoming chair of psychiatry and bio-behavioral sciences at UCLA's David Geffen school of medicine, and interim director of the semel Institute for neuroscience and human behavior.

18
00:02:14,414 --> 00:02:25,484
She earned an MD and a PhD in cultural anthropology at Yale University and completed a clinical residency in psychiatry at NYU Medical Center bellevue hospital.

19
00:02:26,924 --> 00:02:34,428
Her research encompasses the understanding of addiction from many different perspectives, including clinical, moral, and social,

20
00:02:34,429 --> 00:02:50,294
and its implications from broad social and political viewpoints. She's the author of three books:

21
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:44,084
Addicted to Christ: Remaking Men in Puerto Rican Pentecostal Drug Ministries

22
00:02:50,294 --> 00:03:12,914
Structural Competency in Medicine and Mental Health: A case-based approach to treating the social determinants of health. With co-author Jonathan Nelson,

23
00:03:12,914 --> 00:03:24,764
She has received numerous awards, including an honorary doctorate from Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, she was elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2021.

24
00:03:25,964 --> 00:03:30,254
Please join me in welcoming Dr Helena Hansen to the Brachman Memorial lecture.

25
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:40,664
Helena Hansen: Thank you so much for your generous generous introduction and it's really an honor to be with you and to give the memorial lecture today.

26
00:03:42,344 --> 00:03:46,064
Helena Hansen: I want to start off by saying that.

27
00:03:48,224 --> 00:04:01,334
Helena Hansen: That I am an addiction psychiatrist and also a cultural anthropologists and i've long been fascinated by addiction as something about which we don't have a cultural consensus in this country.

28
00:04:01,994 --> 00:04:14,474
Helena Hansen: Is it a biological problem of nerve receptors or genetics, is it a problem of morality or personal character is it a problem of social.

29
00:04:15,494 --> 00:04:20,564
Helena Hansen: social inequalities and unemployment problems with housing.

30
00:04:22,154 --> 00:04:28,124
Helena Hansen: it's really it's a very dynamic field for someone like me that has taken on incredibly.

31
00:04:30,134 --> 00:04:33,164
Helena Hansen: incredibly important time sensitive.

32
00:04:35,294 --> 00:04:48,644
Helena Hansen: significance and i'm going to show you in just a moment a graph that of graduate students that I work with here at UCLA has generated with regard to changes in overdose related death rates in the United States.

33
00:04:49,184 --> 00:04:56,114
Helena Hansen: Just to underscore that point, but I think that's something that we are now aware of, let me see if I can share my screen.

34
00:04:58,724 --> 00:04:59,114
Helena Hansen: Okay.

35
00:05:00,374 --> 00:05:09,374
Helena Hansen: And so I don't have disclosures just that I put that up front and I do have learning learning objectives, which I think you were given.

36
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:14,624
Helena Hansen: But let's get straight to this path, this is what I was referring to that.

37
00:05:16,694 --> 00:05:31,214
Helena Hansen: At this point, under covert in 2020 that was an inflection point at which not only word death rates by overdose in all racial ethnic categories in the United States greatly accelerated under coven.

38
00:05:31,694 --> 00:05:40,634
Helena Hansen: For myriad reasons which we can get to, hopefully, in the course of the hour, but it was also the inflection point where.

39
00:05:41,504 --> 00:05:59,384
Helena Hansen: death rates among black Americans exceeded those of white Americans and death rates among Native Americans, which had always been quite high and generally higher than those of white Americans accelerated even to higher rates, so this is.

40
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:08,594
Helena Hansen: A really pivotal time when we look at drug use overdose and the importance of drug policy and drug treatment.

41
00:06:10,124 --> 00:06:23,594
Helena Hansen: But, of course, what makes the overdose crisis of the past 20 years really different and many people's minds in this country is the extent to which the crisis was identified as a white crisis.

42
00:06:24,404 --> 00:06:36,584
Helena Hansen: And so that's where this image comes in this has really been the image that has been propagated in the media and the kind of the surprise of white deaths by overdose.

43
00:06:37,724 --> 00:06:38,474
Helena Hansen: So.

44
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:45,524
Helena Hansen: The end, this is the moment in time, when I started the research that i'm going to present it was a moment in time, when.

45
00:06:45,914 --> 00:06:59,714
Helena Hansen: The media was publishing stories about the surprise of white, suburban and rural opioid addiction and I quickly put quickly turn my study to how the story of how the US opiate crisis came to be seen as white.

46
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:12,764
Helena Hansen: i'm going to approach race and health from an angle that is unusual in medicine still which is by examining the mechanisms of whiteness so i'm going to share a study of the hidden.

47
00:07:13,304 --> 00:07:18,404
Helena Hansen: Of the hidden but active maintenance of white exclusivity in medicine.

48
00:07:19,154 --> 00:07:27,164
Helena Hansen: As a cause of what we often call health disparities quote unquote health disparities among critical underserved minorities.

49
00:07:27,464 --> 00:07:33,944
Helena Hansen: Groups typically described in a passive manner i'll get to that in a moment as lacking access to care, so this is.

50
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:37,334
Helena Hansen: The way that we talked about it is quite passive in a way.

51
00:07:37,844 --> 00:07:49,814
Helena Hansen: But i'm going to argue that whiteness is central to our environment of profit motives commodification and the use of racial hierarchies to segment an open markets and that's what this slide really alludes to.

52
00:07:50,234 --> 00:08:07,064
Helena Hansen: It involves the mutual racial ization of drugs and people so drugs can be white as in targeted to white people and they can pharmacy pharmaceutical enhance the whiteness of people whose privileges and question because of stigmatizing diagnoses like addiction.

53
00:08:08,294 --> 00:08:22,604
Helena Hansen: So I first encountered office based medication for opioid dependence and in general the medical response to the opiate crisis in the late 1990s, I was a medical student working on the early clinical trials of peep an orphan.

54
00:08:23,054 --> 00:08:31,844
Helena Hansen: which would later be manufactured when the lock zone and commercially branded suboxone and, at the time, my attendings my professors.

55
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:38,534
Helena Hansen: In the clinic were excited about being an orphan which they said was about to quote change the culture of medicine.

56
00:08:39,134 --> 00:08:46,424
Helena Hansen: By defining addiction as a chronic disease treatable alongside diabetes, hypertension and asthma in the same clinics.

57
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:56,864
Helena Hansen: And in the same way with pharmaceutical maintenance long term pharmaceutical maintenance and this caught my ear as an md PhD student cross training and cultural anthropology.

58
00:08:57,404 --> 00:09:03,614
Helena Hansen: So I started to ask what could it mean to change the culture of medicine and what would drive a change like this.

59
00:09:04,934 --> 00:09:14,174
Helena Hansen: As it turns out my professors in the clinic we're right in the course of my career i've seen a profound change in the way that clinicians frame addiction.

60
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:25,154
Helena Hansen: And my field of addiction treatment swing from a drug free philosophy in the early 1990s to opioid maintenance as first line of treatment by the 2000s.

61
00:09:25,724 --> 00:09:30,404
Helena Hansen: And, as I finished an addiction fellowship and I took a faculty position and psychiatry in anthropology.

62
00:09:30,884 --> 00:09:47,084
Helena Hansen: I also documented stark differences between people orphan patients, on the one hand and methadone patients, on the other, by race and class so What began as a study of the culture of medicine became a study of how the opiate crisis came to be seen as white.

63
00:09:48,554 --> 00:10:00,104
Helena Hansen: And that's the the white dots are represented largely in this graph ironically, at the same time that racially targeted drug war policies led to mass incarceration of black and let next Americans.

64
00:10:00,404 --> 00:10:13,544
Helena Hansen: Giving the US, the highest incarceration rate in the world, so that this this graph of incarcerated Americans really peaked in 2008 which was well into the the political white opioid crisis.

65
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:20,714
Helena Hansen: So i'm going to give you today and analysis from my forthcoming book.

66
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:32,054
Helena Hansen: On, which is based on research, supported by night of the Robert wood Johnson foundation, the American psychiatric association in New York state office of mental health and I have two co authors.

67
00:10:32,474 --> 00:10:39,704
Helena Hansen: Policy analyst Jules netherland at the drug policy alliance and also David hershberger drug historian of drugs and race.

68
00:10:41,354 --> 00:10:51,974
Helena Hansen: Now I want to start off by saying that, while narcotics have long been criminalized through association with marginalized racial groups So these are images of over 100 years from over 100 years ago.

69
00:10:53,474 --> 00:11:01,364
Helena Hansen: This is Chinese opium dens that we're learning unsuspecting white women into sex slavery, according to the media.

70
00:11:01,934 --> 00:11:20,624
Helena Hansen: cocaine crazed Negroes in the US, South that were attacking their work supervisors and then a little later Mexican marijuana madness So these are images that were used to build public support for prohibitionist drug policies that we have in place to this day.

71
00:11:21,884 --> 00:11:28,184
Helena Hansen: But what we don't often look at is how symbolic association with white middle class markets.

72
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:44,024
Helena Hansen: As legitimated widespread prescription of narcotics, including post World War Two episode and and also the consequences post World War Two epidemic overdose from prescribed barbiturates and benzodiazepines that haunted white middle class America.

73
00:11:44,744 --> 00:11:50,444
Helena Hansen: So we rarely asked how a drug can assume whiteness within a pharmaceutical logic, based on race.

74
00:11:52,604 --> 00:12:08,534
Helena Hansen: But, yet this process of pharmaceutical whiteness is at the core of the widely asked question why is the life expectancy of white Americans falling, or at least, why was it in this time period 26th 2015 at the time of this report.

75
00:12:09,914 --> 00:12:14,054
Helena Hansen: Why is white life expectancy in the US falling.

76
00:12:15,284 --> 00:12:17,714
Helena Hansen: When, at the same time, at least as of.

77
00:12:19,604 --> 00:12:26,834
Helena Hansen: The life expectancy of almost every other racial ethnic group that is excluding Native Americans rising.

78
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:35,444
Helena Hansen: And I and how did drug overdose become their the leading immediate cause of excess death.

79
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:44,324
Helena Hansen: So I want to go beyond the received wisdom that unemployed white Americans in the post industrial rustbelt turned to opioids for solace.

80
00:12:45,104 --> 00:12:57,644
Helena Hansen: That might be true, but it begs the question of why opioids why white Americans and why at this moment in time so i'm going to argue that the generation of opioids that.

81
00:12:58,214 --> 00:13:17,174
Helena Hansen: led to the increased white life expectancy reported here, they were designed to have white identities and that in our stratified healthcare and justice systems, the social technologies shaping opioid consumption reinforce racial inequalities, while at the same time, harming white Americans.

82
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:23,234
Helena Hansen: And key to the story key to the stories and unrecognized form of ethnic marketing that.

83
00:13:23,564 --> 00:13:27,764
Helena Hansen: Because it targets white Americans works by not marketing itself is racial.

84
00:13:28,004 --> 00:13:39,494
Helena Hansen: So the story is invisible by design and it was only through years of observation and interviews with key actors that i've been able to unravel the threats so i've observed drug policy and addiction science meetings and clinical interactions.

85
00:13:39,764 --> 00:13:57,014
Helena Hansen: For over a decade I interviewed almost two over 200 addiction scientists treatment advocates pharmaceutical executives policymakers administrators and prescribers so let's start where I started the steady, which is with beacon orphan commercially named suboxone.

86
00:13:58,214 --> 00:14:10,544
Helena Hansen: And it's easiest to see its racial identity by comparing it to its predecessor methadone so here's a bar graph from the first nationally representative steady to compare be been orphaned patients to methadone patients by race and class.

87
00:14:11,474 --> 00:14:18,194
Helena Hansen: While I was at nyu I mapped buprenorphine where people are from patients lived in relation to methadone patients and saw the pattern.

88
00:14:18,464 --> 00:14:30,704
Helena Hansen: Was reproduced in the five boroughs of New York and then arriving in La of collaborator and colleague of mine, did the same mapping and in Los Angeles, found the same pattern a.

89
00:14:32,024 --> 00:14:34,544
Helena Hansen: Report in JAMA psychiatry.

90
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:45,644
Helena Hansen: Basically, showed that this pattern has not changed in the past couple of decades that white Americans were still three to four times as likely as black Americans.

91
00:14:46,244 --> 00:14:58,394
Helena Hansen: who have opioid use disorder to be prescribed beep an orphan and that the most common method of payment is out of pocket for very expensive medication that costs thousands of dollars over the course of a year to maintain.

92
00:15:00,224 --> 00:15:05,354
Helena Hansen: followed by private insurance and then much further down medicaid reimburse reimbursement.

93
00:15:06,344 --> 00:15:25,604
Helena Hansen: What we don't know from grass like this, however, is by what process did be an orphan and methadone gain their racial identities so for that we have to go back in time let's go back to 1965 race riots have burned through Harlem Philadelphia and what's Los Angeles.

94
00:15:26,684 --> 00:15:30,704
Helena Hansen: And the unemployment rate for black Americans is twice that of white Americans.

95
00:15:31,184 --> 00:15:40,424
Helena Hansen: Organized crime gains control of Asian heroin imports and recruits a salesforce from the black and that next inner cities that have such a high unemployment.

96
00:15:41,264 --> 00:15:59,114
Helena Hansen: And meanwhile Rockefeller university metabolic researcher Vincent dole who thinks of heroin addiction as opiate receptor deficiency analogous to insulin deficiency and diabetes, he published his findings, but this call is co authors from the first clinical trial of methadone maintenance.

97
00:16:00,134 --> 00:16:12,254
Helena Hansen: For heroin addiction and the studies subjects are African American heroin injecting men from Harlem its outcomes of reduced arrest and increased employment at six months brings it national attention.

98
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:23,534
Helena Hansen: So by 1970 news of methadone as a pharmacological answer to urban heroin reaches President Nixon who appoints pioneering methadone psychiatry strong drafi as the nation's first drugs are.

99
00:16:24,824 --> 00:16:33,704
Helena Hansen: So next and targets inner city black and latinx Americans, as well as returning Vietnam veterans with methadone is major weapon in the war on drugs.

100
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:43,454
Helena Hansen: And to prevent diversion and St sale of methadone the DEA regulates methadone clinics very closely, requiring daily observe dosing and regular urine testing.

101
00:16:44,444 --> 00:16:48,554
Helena Hansen: Due to Community resistance nimbyism Community resistance to locating methadone.

102
00:16:48,914 --> 00:17:01,514
Helena Hansen: clinics and neighborhoods the clinics are located in marginalized neighborhoods in the city remote from other medical services so from it from the beginning methadone has only had a partially medical medicalized status.

103
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:14,984
Helena Hansen: So now let's fast forward to October 2000 to a new kind of opioid problem has developed falling purdue pharmaceuticals aggressive marketing oxy cotton as a concrete minimally addictive pain reliever.

104
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:21,104
Helena Hansen: Most of the newly dependent people are white and many of them are middle to upper income.

105
00:17:22,004 --> 00:17:30,134
Helena Hansen: The FDA has just approved the synthetic opiate given orphan commercially packaged in the locksmith suboxone for maintenance treatment of opiate.

106
00:17:30,404 --> 00:17:39,314
Helena Hansen: dependence in people orphan certified doctors offices so pharmacologically similar to methadone and that it blocks opiate receptors in the brains of addicted patients.

107
00:17:39,944 --> 00:17:48,164
Helena Hansen: beep an orphan can be prescribed monthly for use at home, while methadone is still restricted to DEA regulated clinics with directly observed dosing.

108
00:17:48,464 --> 00:18:00,974
Helena Hansen: So office based buprenorphine represents a reversal of national policy it's the first time since the 1914 Harrison at the private doctors are permitted to use opioids to treat opiate dependence.

109
00:18:01,544 --> 00:18:18,404
Helena Hansen: And to accomplish this the manufacturers have been an orphan and the architects of people are foreign policy had to distinguish between orphan symbolically and spatially from methadone so people orphan pharmacologically in the same drug class as methadone had to be whitened.

110
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:26,744
Helena Hansen: So this is Mike in an Internet ad for suboxone he's seated in his Ohio diner so he's the owner of the diner.

111
00:18:27,344 --> 00:18:39,704
Helena Hansen: he's flanked by American flags talking about returning to coaching his son's baseball team and sitting in his church and singing in his church choir after people North and rescued him from a prescription opioid habit let's go back to my.

112
00:18:41,924 --> 00:18:43,814
Helena Hansen: And this is following a back injury at work.

113
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:56,774
Helena Hansen: So this is a real real shift in the race and class imagery of who is an addict you know there's a lot of cultural work being done by this ad to redefine, who is the addicted person.

114
00:18:57,194 --> 00:19:06,464
Helena Hansen: But I argue that the Ad was just the tip of the iceberg, and that the whiteness of people an orphan was actively achieved by specific social technologies.

115
00:19:06,704 --> 00:19:14,384
Helena Hansen: So i'm going to give you an analysis of the contempt of the white opiate crisis of the past few decades in terms of what I call technologies of whiteness.

116
00:19:14,624 --> 00:19:24,824
Helena Hansen: And that is social technologies of neuroscientific metaphors policy and industry strategies that maintain racial boundaries around biomedical uses of opioids.

117
00:19:25,154 --> 00:19:40,784
Helena Hansen: And this scheme is informed by whiteness studies, which is an offshoot of critical race theory and it proposes that one whiteness is a category of exclusion, you know, in the US not anyone can just claim to be white and partake of the benefits of whiteness.

118
00:19:41,984 --> 00:19:45,164
Helena Hansen: It requires cultural and political maintenance of its boundaries.

119
00:19:45,704 --> 00:19:55,004
Helena Hansen: Number two white race is unmarked it's the assumed norm in the US so for many decades, if you read a newspaper article in which an individual was referred to as an American.

120
00:19:55,424 --> 00:20:00,734
Helena Hansen: You could assume that that person was a white American if race was mentioned, it was non white race.

121
00:20:01,694 --> 00:20:12,284
Helena Hansen: So the fact that over the past six years or so we've seen much more explicit identification of white race in media reports that's the exception that proves the rule.

122
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:22,154
Helena Hansen: And then three whiteness is defined by its other white, on one hand, or black slash non white, on the other hand there interdependent.

123
00:20:23,384 --> 00:20:30,464
Helena Hansen: Punitive American drug policy has long had a mutually defining twin of legal narcotics for white Americans who have had.

124
00:20:30,704 --> 00:20:39,494
Helena Hansen: access to personal doctors, starting with morphine and over the counter heroin from middle class Victorian housewives, then moving to post war World War Two barbiturates.

125
00:20:39,794 --> 00:20:47,744
Helena Hansen: stimulant diet pills and valiant, otherwise known as suburban mother's little helper now back to prescription opioid pain relievers and then for.

126
00:20:48,134 --> 00:21:03,884
Helena Hansen: Poor white privilege has its costs, not only do not only do white Americans pay inflated prices for patented prescription opioids they pay with their lives in the form of overdose by legal substances to which they have quote unquote privileged access.

127
00:21:05,504 --> 00:21:17,744
Helena Hansen: So the four technologies of whiteness that i'll be discussing include addiction neuroscience new bio technologies regulation and marketing and i'll start with the least visible technology race making, which is that a brain science.

128
00:21:19,334 --> 00:21:22,154
Helena Hansen: So let's please keep an orphan development.

129
00:21:22,724 --> 00:21:32,954
Helena Hansen: buprenorphine, otherwise known as suboxone on the backdrop of President Bush, the first decade of the brain, this was an era in which the National Institute on drug abuse was directed to look for.

130
00:21:33,164 --> 00:21:41,444
Helena Hansen: neuro molecular basis for addiction in anticipation of breakthroughs from the human genome project and in the process night a renamed addiction.

131
00:21:41,864 --> 00:21:52,424
Helena Hansen: Chronic relapsing brain disease, and this was supported by night at leading night of researchers who published this article highly cited Article in the year 2000 at the end of the decade of the brain.

132
00:21:52,994 --> 00:22:06,524
Helena Hansen: In it, they argued that narcotics dependence was comparable to diabetes, hypertension and asthma in terms of its heritability treatment adherence and relapse rates and, as such, it should be treated as a chronic medical disease.

133
00:22:07,664 --> 00:22:21,704
Helena Hansen: The scientists involved in the movement this movement had a social justice intent they wanted to D stigmatize addiction by demonstrating that it's a legitimate biological condition and not a problem of morality for choice.

134
00:22:22,184 --> 00:22:37,844
Helena Hansen: But what they didn't anticipate was that the scientific universalism because it implied a standard white male subject would help to open white markets to new opioids and that the unequal ways that by technologies are disseminated would enhance the social stratification of addiction.

135
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:46,664
Helena Hansen: So, for example, rain images like this, by taking out the subject and his or her trappings of gender, race and class out of the picture.

136
00:22:47,204 --> 00:23:05,174
Helena Hansen: And, by taking the offending Oregon the brain out of the body altogether, but the image symbolically conveys an unmarked universality of addiction physiology neuroscientist further reduce causation to molecular action of neural receptors the ultimate disembodied myth of addiction.

137
00:23:06,464 --> 00:23:18,854
Helena Hansen: So the apparent universality of this molecular model implied and assume like norm, it took a problem long associated with black and brown crime and gave it a new implicit association with white subjects.

138
00:23:19,574 --> 00:23:34,214
Helena Hansen: But in the process it excluded social conditions, the scientists involved wanted to counteract the drug War mentality by erasing the social context of drug use, but they paradoxically set the stage for renewed racial stratification of opioids.

139
00:23:35,534 --> 00:23:47,654
Helena Hansen: So for that story let's turn to new bio technologies, the neuroscientist that I just described unwittingly aided corporate strategists the capitalized on the ratio of the social.

140
00:23:48,734 --> 00:24:00,044
Helena Hansen: Building on the neuroscientist ideology of technological solutions for addiction in 1996 purdue pharma got FDA approval for oxy cotton as clinical minimally effective opioid pain reliever.

141
00:24:00,284 --> 00:24:13,304
Helena Hansen: suitable for product management of moderate pain and this was based on its patented sustained release capsule technology, which in theory lowered the reward for users by preventing an initial rush of oxy code onto the brain.

142
00:24:14,234 --> 00:24:25,964
Helena Hansen: The manufacturer influence the national joint Commission on hospital accreditation call for pain to be aggressively monitored and treated treated as a fifth vital sign, you know, alongside blood pressure, respiratory rate pulse.

143
00:24:27,194 --> 00:24:35,954
Helena Hansen: And as an additional safeguard drug REPS advised new opioid prescribers to direct oxy cotton, to quote unquote trustworthy patients.

144
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:51,344
Helena Hansen: Which in a national clinical workforce that's been shown to suspect non white patients of drug abuse this implied white patients, along with all the marketing materials which they they use which featured by patients this, this was the trustworthy patient.

145
00:24:52,364 --> 00:24:59,204
Helena Hansen: Of course, with the model of addiction proof biotechnology, such as the sustained release cancel left out of the picture.

146
00:24:59,954 --> 00:25:09,254
Helena Hansen: Was the social inventiveness of drug use oxy cotton users interested in a rush quickly learned to crush and snort or inject the oxy code on each capsule.

147
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:18,434
Helena Hansen: And after steep increases in opioid non medical use of opioids and overdose public pressure mounted for intervention.

148
00:25:19,244 --> 00:25:28,394
Helena Hansen: So, in August of 2010, just as the original patent on oxy cotton ran out purdue pharma introduced its tamper resistant time release formulation.

149
00:25:29,024 --> 00:25:37,364
Helena Hansen: Which embedded oxy cotton into polymers that convert tablets into gametes should users attempt to crush and dissolve and inject them.

150
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:50,294
Helena Hansen: By keeping prices high and representing oxy cotton is technologically sealed off from this use the manufacturer strove to keep oxy cotton symbolically, a step ahead of urban non white street markets.

151
00:25:51,254 --> 00:26:00,344
Helena Hansen: So another biotechnology developed specifically in response to white, suburban and rural prescription opioid non medical use is be an orphan itself.

152
00:26:01,304 --> 00:26:09,344
Helena Hansen: Combined with opiate antagonist locks on and branded suboxone recommend keizer farm pharmaceuticals promoted this combination as a smart trump.

153
00:26:10,064 --> 00:26:26,024
Helena Hansen: Although peep an orphan is an opioid the naloxone with which you've been orphan was combined cause is combined causes withdrawal symptoms if it's injected, but not if dissolved into the tongue as prescribed since naloxone can't be absorbed under the tongue.

154
00:26:27,344 --> 00:26:31,994
Helena Hansen: Up North and also poses a lower risk of overdose deaths than other opioids.

155
00:26:33,014 --> 00:26:42,314
Helena Hansen: So in the 1990s night as subsidize the ducks boxes manufacturer with $23 million to test it for use in addiction treatment sharply distinguishing it from methadone.

156
00:26:43,364 --> 00:26:56,534
Helena Hansen: And lobbying Congress and the DEA to lower the abuse potential rating of suboxone from narcotics scheduled to which is where oxy cotton and methadone fall to narcotics scheduled three alongside coating cough syrup.

157
00:26:57,494 --> 00:27:02,114
Helena Hansen: This is what made it possible to prescribe suboxone in private doctor's offices.

158
00:27:02,624 --> 00:27:14,444
Helena Hansen: The manufacturer also lobbied Congress to get suboxone included under an orphan drug clause designed to promote pharmaceutical development for unprofitable diseases in low income countries, such as malaria drugs.

159
00:27:15,104 --> 00:27:21,824
Helena Hansen: suboxone designation got it a patent extension through 2009 on a drug initially developed in the late 1960s.

160
00:27:22,844 --> 00:27:41,834
Helena Hansen: In a race and class stratified healthcare system such as we have in the US, where access to general doctors is often limited to those who can pay patented expensive technologies for private general doctor office delivery in themselves and code white race and middle class.

161
00:27:42,974 --> 00:27:45,464
Helena Hansen: Okay, the third technology whiteness is regulation.

162
00:27:46,184 --> 00:27:56,414
Helena Hansen: Although by 2004 prescription opioids overtook heroin as the primary opiate abuse in the US, the arrest rate for their illegal possession was one fourth that for possession of heroin.

163
00:27:56,774 --> 00:28:04,304
Helena Hansen: and arrest for illegal sale of prescription drugs was less than one fifth that have a rest for selling heroin not coincidentally.

164
00:28:05,054 --> 00:28:17,264
Helena Hansen: The Non medical use of opioid pain relievers was twice as high among white Americans as black Americans at that, at that time, while rates of here when US among black black next and white Americans were almost identical.

165
00:28:18,434 --> 00:28:23,894
Helena Hansen: Since, suburban and rural white opioid users were not politically popular targets for drug law enforcement.

166
00:28:26,804 --> 00:28:36,644
Helena Hansen: The DEA and other regulators focus their surveillance and enforcement on prescription opioid prescribers and pharmacists instead instead of users.

167
00:28:36,854 --> 00:28:44,024
Helena Hansen: And one side of this one sign of this has been the spread of prescription Drug Monitoring programs, which were ultimately enacted in all States half of.

168
00:28:44,234 --> 00:28:54,944
Helena Hansen: Which mandate prescriber participation with threats of loss of license and prosecution for prescriber who doesn't check escape database to see a given patient has already been prescribed narcotics elsewhere.

169
00:28:56,744 --> 00:29:03,794
Helena Hansen: Returning to be an orphan, otherwise known as suboxone the drug addiction treatment act that was passed by Congress in 2000.

170
00:29:04,844 --> 00:29:12,074
Helena Hansen: otherwise known as data 2000 enabled any certified physician to prescribe suboxone in the privacy of their own office.

171
00:29:12,554 --> 00:29:24,764
Helena Hansen: And Congressional debates leading to the passage of the to 2000 there's a clear emphasis on a whole new kind of drug user when this young, suburban and not hardcore so that's coded language for white.

172
00:29:26,294 --> 00:29:39,344
Helena Hansen: White and middle class actually recorded testimony from federal officials stressed that buprenorphine was uniquely appropriate for a new kind of obo user, as opposed to methadone quote which tends to concentrate in urban areas.

173
00:29:39,614 --> 00:29:44,174
Helena Hansen: And as a poor fit for the suburban spread of narcotic addiction and of quote.

174
00:29:45,254 --> 00:29:58,604
Helena Hansen: Then, health and human services director Donna shalala was one of many officials who noted that beep an orphan as an alternative to methadone would Sir quote a new kind of addict including citizens who would not normally be associated with the term addiction and, of course.

175
00:30:00,464 --> 00:30:15,434
Helena Hansen: With this racially coded language in which, suburban and new kind of addict referred to middle class white Americans data 2000 past Congress and reversed 80 years of federal prohibition of private physician opioid maintenance for opioid dependence.

176
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:28,514
Helena Hansen: Data 2000 kept the restrictive methadone system intact, it did nothing to alter the drug laws that mandated inner city heroin users to prison, but it did, create a new treatment track for those with the resources to use it.

177
00:30:29,084 --> 00:30:34,394
Helena Hansen: And to give additional assurance to the DEA that we've been orphaned would not spill over into elicit markets.

178
00:30:34,784 --> 00:30:40,034
Helena Hansen: Between orphans manufacturer, along with the Federal substance abuse and mental health services administration Samson.

179
00:30:40,664 --> 00:30:54,644
Helena Hansen: developed an eight hour certification course that required Dr was required for doctors to prescribe the benefit So this was the first and only prescription drug in the US to come with this additional certification and training requirement.

180
00:30:55,844 --> 00:30:59,084
Helena Hansen: Public Sector doctors told told me that certification.

181
00:30:59,804 --> 00:31:08,294
Helena Hansen: was a major barrier to making beef an orphan available to low income people, because public clinics don't provide time or incentives to pursue certification.

182
00:31:08,594 --> 00:31:23,834
Helena Hansen: While prescribers in the private sector can charge fees have up to $1,000 for an initial visit for buprenorphine induction so the shortage of public sector prescribers along with the cost of buprenorphine itself have long kept beeping orphan in the private sector.

183
00:31:25,454 --> 00:31:28,814
Helena Hansen: So the last technology whiteness media and marketing.

184
00:31:30,104 --> 00:31:36,284
Helena Hansen: oxy cotton is legendary commercial success hinged on his designation as men minimally addictive and.

185
00:31:37,364 --> 00:31:47,864
Helena Hansen: When oxy cotton was under review the FDA purdue estimated the addictive potential have actually kind of be less than 1% based on testing among terminally ill cancer patients for three month period.

186
00:31:48,464 --> 00:32:01,814
Helena Hansen: So in 96 the FDA accepted this claim it enabled produce to open an opioid market that had previously been restricted to those with severe acute pain like post surgical or cancer pain, so all of a sudden, an enormous much.

187
00:32:02,114 --> 00:32:19,304
Helena Hansen: An enormous new market of patients with moderate chronic pain like lower back pain that we're seeing general primary care doctors was opened to opioids and purdue hired almost 700 drug REPS in canvas to call us 700,000 physicians in the first few years alone.

188
00:32:20,324 --> 00:32:29,564
Helena Hansen: purdue targeted general doctors and white, suburban and rural areas, serving patients that the public and the DEA did not think of as at high risk for addiction.

189
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:44,144
Helena Hansen: So this strategy was successful it led to a tenfold increase in prescription opioids nationally with disproportionate uptake of oxycontin by prescribers in white, suburban and rural areas of states like main Ohio Kentucky and West Virginia.

190
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:58,934
Helena Hansen: In a newspaper content analysis that I completed with colleagues, I found that, in contrast, articles about the criminality of black and Latin extra users suburbanites addicted to oxy cotton were portrayed sympathetically in the media.

191
00:32:59,414 --> 00:33:05,384
Helena Hansen: as victims of overprescription or as people struggling with physical or emotional pain.

192
00:33:07,094 --> 00:33:16,454
Helena Hansen: Ironically produce technological response to the first wave of white prescription opioid overdose deaths their tamper resistant formulations of oxycodone.

193
00:33:16,754 --> 00:33:20,684
Helena Hansen: Combined with new prescription Drug Monitoring programs, the ones I just described.

194
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:30,644
Helena Hansen: These led many of the new opioid users to look for heroin prescription opioid users to look for heroin when pills became hard to get and harder to use.

195
00:33:30,974 --> 00:33:38,024
Helena Hansen: One consequence of this was a whitening of the media coverage of heroin users who had long been portrayed as black or brown so.

196
00:33:38,414 --> 00:33:52,814
Helena Hansen: This is an article about a school teacher and suburban upstate New York, and this is a college athlete from Arizona just to have myriad images in the media at the at that time, the new face of heroin.

197
00:33:53,954 --> 00:34:02,534
Helena Hansen: The targeted intervention for these new heroin users buprenorphine, otherwise known as suboxone was marketed to middle class insured patients over the Internet.

198
00:34:03,284 --> 00:34:18,284
Helena Hansen: And manufacturer sponsored web based public service announcements featured white professionals and business owners on suboxone maintenance, so you get some of the the race and class coating of the marketing online marketing that was done from this website.

199
00:34:20,234 --> 00:34:31,394
Helena Hansen: This website sponsored by the manufacturers but zone features a link to a suboxone prescriber locator service that was created by the Federal substance abuse and mental health.

200
00:34:31,784 --> 00:34:37,754
Helena Hansen: federal substance abuse and mental services, services administration samhsa So you see in the lower left hand corner.

201
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:47,924
Helena Hansen: browsers can enter their zip code to generate a list of certified suboxone prescribers most of them in private practice so you can get a list of those practicing near you.

202
00:34:48,224 --> 00:35:02,594
Helena Hansen: The vast majority will be in private practice, these strategies created an exclusive yet lucrative segment of the market for suboxone, making it a blockbuster drug it over one and a half billion dollars a year in US sales.

203
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:10,454
Helena Hansen: alone by 2012 second only in that year to sales of oxycontin which reported us sales of $3 billion in 2012.

204
00:35:12,044 --> 00:35:13,334
Helena Hansen: So to conclude.

205
00:35:14,624 --> 00:35:22,754
Helena Hansen: The racial segmentation of drug markets into lycett and elicit white and black clinical and recreational.

206
00:35:23,024 --> 00:35:38,894
Helena Hansen: creates a moving target of time bound patents on new technologies, targeting the white middle class consumer, and this is an old cycle is started by Bayer pharmaceuticals own heroin marketed as a non addictive alternative to morphine.

207
00:35:40,094 --> 00:35:43,574
Helena Hansen: To middle class Victorian housewives in 1898.

208
00:35:45,134 --> 00:35:52,244
Helena Hansen: So what can we learn from this as clinicians epidemiologists polly's policymakers.

209
00:35:53,444 --> 00:35:54,284
Helena Hansen: I want to.

210
00:35:55,364 --> 00:36:08,984
Helena Hansen: start by saying that magic bullets are men right as the failed promises oxy cotton sustained release capsule show and the inability of unilateral beep an orphan expansion to stem overdoses has shown.

211
00:36:10,004 --> 00:36:16,994
Helena Hansen: Biotechnology alone cannot stop the harms of narcotics without systemic and social intervention.

212
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:27,074
Helena Hansen: And to underscore this point I want to turn to an international comparison that's often used by my American colleagues who advocate buprenorphine and expansion.

213
00:36:27,944 --> 00:36:35,144
Helena Hansen: So, in France, where peeping orphan was adopted for general doctor treatment of opiate dependence in 1995.

214
00:36:35,534 --> 00:36:45,824
Helena Hansen: It was built not as a stigma reducing agent for white middle class market, but as a public health intervention to stem overdose and HIV among low income largely.

215
00:36:46,274 --> 00:36:52,934
Helena Hansen: Immigrant heroin injectors buprenorphine was widely adopted among primary care doctors in poor communities.

216
00:36:53,444 --> 00:37:08,084
Helena Hansen: In a country, and I want to underscore this in a country with universal health care universal health care and big difference, the opioid overdose death rate in France dropped 80% in the first five years after people orphans approval.

217
00:37:09,254 --> 00:37:22,664
Helena Hansen: Contrast that with the US were opioid overdoses are now well over six times what they were when beep an orphan was first approved in 22,002 So this is the graph that I opened which to underscore that.

218
00:37:25,874 --> 00:37:37,904
Helena Hansen: So there are several differences between to go back to France, several differences between the way that people orphan is used and disseminated in France, as opposed to the West.

219
00:37:38,774 --> 00:37:45,104
Helena Hansen: In France buprenorphine treatment is offered in Community based addiction centers.

220
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:54,134
Helena Hansen: That offer not only buprenorphine and also methadone but they offer comprehensive mental health care physical health or social services referral to employment, housing.

221
00:37:54,884 --> 00:38:00,554
Helena Hansen: Harm reduction, they have on site not only syringe exchange but supervised drug consumption.

222
00:38:00,854 --> 00:38:09,614
Helena Hansen: facilities so it's a very comprehensive approach that also employees peers people would lived experience of problems substance use.

223
00:38:09,944 --> 00:38:20,804
Helena Hansen: it's a much in a system with the universal health care so it's a much, much different system actually have a social safety net in France, which is embedded into these addiction centers.

224
00:38:21,224 --> 00:38:29,864
Helena Hansen: radically different approach and that's a big big distinction that many of my colleagues here in the US leave out in the comparison with France.

225
00:38:31,394 --> 00:38:44,414
Helena Hansen: Another point is, if you look at the upper left hand corner of this graph 565 in 1995 and that you're making 95 565 French people died of overdose from opioids.

226
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:54,854
Helena Hansen: that's 565 and a country of 60 million Compare that to the number, it would probably be closer to 560 5000 in the United States, so.

227
00:38:55,124 --> 00:39:03,944
Helena Hansen: In France in us and that was the peak of their overdose crisis, in essence, they did not have an opioid crisis overdose crisis of the proportions that we have.

228
00:39:04,454 --> 00:39:12,464
Helena Hansen: And oxycontin was in fact never approved for use in the way that it was approved in the US, because.

229
00:39:12,794 --> 00:39:20,654
Helena Hansen: France has a national body that reviews any proposed new drugs before formulary adoption into their universal health care system.

230
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:39,584
Helena Hansen: That review body is prohibited from having any relationships with the pharmaceutical industry, before, during or after their service on the committee, unlike in the US, where a number of the FDA officials who approved oxy cotton went on to take lucrative posts with opioid manufacturers.

231
00:39:40,634 --> 00:39:49,304
Helena Hansen: So that should really make a skeptical about the ability of the market to protect us to promote public health, so to speak.

232
00:39:50,594 --> 00:40:00,074
Helena Hansen: And in our for profit health care system beep an orphan maintenance has followed the pattern predicted by theorists a fundamental causes of disease Bruce Lee and Joe failing.

233
00:40:00,854 --> 00:40:10,784
Helena Hansen: Who posited that in a system of very wide social inequalities, such as we have in the US if those social inequalities are not addressed.

234
00:40:11,114 --> 00:40:21,194
Helena Hansen: New bio technologies that are often marketed as a way to want to narrow health any qualities will actually widen those inequalities, rather than narrowing them.

235
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:33,764
Helena Hansen: Because the social drivers of health and an equal, for example, and equal access to those technologies have not been addressed okay second concluding point problem drug use his bio social.

236
00:40:34,784 --> 00:40:39,464
Helena Hansen: We should reconsider what it means that addiction is a chronic brain disease.

237
00:40:40,274 --> 00:40:49,274
Helena Hansen: Basic neuroscientists are increasingly seeing the brain as a plastic socially responsive Oregon that's evolved to adapt to complex social systems.

238
00:40:49,874 --> 00:40:58,904
Helena Hansen: And emerging life science models of neuro plasticity at the genetics and the microbiome have underscored that human biology is not fixed but it's.

239
00:40:59,234 --> 00:41:10,184
Helena Hansen: Rather dynamically shaped in interaction with the social environment and these more sophisticated biological models call on us to invest in research on the impact of social systems.

240
00:41:10,484 --> 00:41:19,784
Helena Hansen: And on the interventions that create healthy social context, including robust social services recovery support networks that give dignity, meaning and stretcher to people's lives.

241
00:41:20,174 --> 00:41:25,574
Helena Hansen: So if we were to take seriously the comparison of drug dependence with diabetes asthma and hypertension.

242
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:37,934
Helena Hansen: we'd recognize that each of these conditions, has strong social determinants and that success in their treatment and prevention requires, for example, social support access to fresh food safe unpolluted walkable neighborhoods The list goes on.

243
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:45,404
Helena Hansen: Okay, and then third concluding point this of despair call for racial, as well as economic justice.

244
00:41:46,664 --> 00:41:49,094
Helena Hansen: So this 2015 report by an case and.

245
00:41:49,994 --> 00:42:01,754
Helena Hansen: Economists and case and Angus deaton the report on the decline in US white life expectancy was unusual in that the authors were not epidemiologists they were economists and their analysis of root causes of overdose.

246
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:13,514
Helena Hansen: As well as suicides and cirrhosis lay not in nerve receptors are genetics, but in the deindustrialization of the American rustbelt towns were departure of manufacturing and mining industries left behind.

247
00:42:13,784 --> 00:42:24,524
Helena Hansen: High unemployment and social disc integration, the sociological study that followed the report showed overdose rates were linked to thin social networks, you know geographical analysis.

248
00:42:25,274 --> 00:42:32,054
Helena Hansen: Accordingly, case and beaten have popularized the idea that overdoses are depths of despair and their argument is persuasive.

249
00:42:32,234 --> 00:42:45,854
Helena Hansen: It calls on it calls for social and economic revitalization through policies that promote promote social integration, stable employment with livable wages and benefits, and not just public private partnerships to quickly develop.

250
00:42:46,454 --> 00:42:55,934
Helena Hansen: and approve and disseminate new medications prediction, as have been prioritized by the NIH he'll initiative and cures Act, the the federal opioid response.

251
00:42:56,834 --> 00:43:04,754
Helena Hansen: But case and beatings focus on white Americans makes their analysis incomplete and make splat and let next overdose deaths invisible.

252
00:43:05,354 --> 00:43:20,984
Helena Hansen: case in deaton do not have a clear explanation for why black and Latin next life expectancy did not decline in the time period of their study, I want to posit that black and latinx Americans saw an overdose crisis 30 to 40 years prior.

253
00:43:22,244 --> 00:43:33,044
Helena Hansen: To those of white Americans white white blue collar workers with the influx of heroin to inner city neighborhoods black and brown inner city neighborhoods from the 1960s 1980s.

254
00:43:33,914 --> 00:43:41,354
Helena Hansen: blue collar workers and black and let next neighborhoods were often barred from unions were last hired first fired so massive unemployment.

255
00:43:41,654 --> 00:43:53,684
Helena Hansen: much earlier than white workers who were initially protected by industrial discrimination in this earlier black and let next opioid crisis was not seen as a health crisis, it was seen as a crisis of crime.

256
00:43:54,134 --> 00:44:01,934
Helena Hansen: and led to white flight from cities and further disinvestment from black and lat next city neighborhoods and we're left with the survivors of the that.

257
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:16,034
Helena Hansen: Earlier crisis, even as now, the CDC reports that black middle aged men are the group with the highest death rate and much of this has to do with mass incarceration that I described earlier.

258
00:44:16,874 --> 00:44:24,074
Helena Hansen: The fact that the period of weeks to months immediately after release from jail and prison is incredibly.

259
00:44:24,584 --> 00:44:38,054
Helena Hansen: risky time high risk time for overdose deaths given lowered tolerance given high risk of relapse a lot of social stressors stressors very poor access to social social and medical services and often as a result of incarceration.

260
00:44:39,794 --> 00:44:55,184
Helena Hansen: In eligibility for a lot of benefits, including housing, public benefits, including housing and that coupled with fentanyl which i'm sure is on your radars has led to a massive increase in overdose these last few years.

261
00:44:57,284 --> 00:45:03,974
Helena Hansen: So fentanyl on the street markets, while we work towards race and class justice and economic policy.

262
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:13,814
Helena Hansen: We should use concern about the opioid crisis to go beyond drug development invest in number one universal health care with psychosocial interventions, including.

263
00:45:14,774 --> 00:45:23,354
Helena Hansen: trauma informed therapy attention to psychiatric look comorbidity peer navigation recovery support assistance with housing and employment, then number two.

264
00:45:24,344 --> 00:45:35,024
Helena Hansen: We need to divert people with opioid use disorder from the criminal legal system and promote treatment and harm reduction, as our national response to opioids and not.

265
00:45:35,414 --> 00:45:39,854
Helena Hansen: through local initiatives so, for example in New York City.

266
00:45:40,694 --> 00:45:52,274
Helena Hansen: There is a program called project hope that's diverted over half of those arrested on low level drug charges from sentencing towards treatment, plus peer navigation this this has happened on Staten island.

267
00:45:53,144 --> 00:46:04,574
Helena Hansen: of New York City and the problem is project hope still does not operate in the south bronx Staten island is the widest and most affluent Borough of New York City.

268
00:46:05,564 --> 00:46:16,274
Helena Hansen: The bronx where that now has the largest number of overdose deaths and which is primarily black and latinx and low income this not have project hope.

269
00:46:16,904 --> 00:46:22,634
Helena Hansen: It was project hope was the result of Community advocates partnering with the local district attorney.

270
00:46:23,054 --> 00:46:39,464
Helena Hansen: And as long as it's up to empower communities, such as those in Staten island to do that kind of intervention with district attorneys decriminalization and promotion of treatment over sentencing will continue to focus on the empowered white middle class areas of our country.

271
00:46:40,754 --> 00:46:50,564
Helena Hansen: And then third what public service resources are needed for is to be moved from drug development of magic bullets.

272
00:46:51,494 --> 00:47:04,244
Helena Hansen: toward research on and implementation of innovative bio social community based treatment approaches and preventive prevention approaches, so they include peer based recovery networks, involving the arts urban gardening Community based organizations.

273
00:47:04,484 --> 00:47:19,604
Helena Hansen: Including spiritual and religious organizations So these are approaches that necessarily integrate medications with recovery networks of support and harm reduction and social services and are delivered by trusted Community members and peers.

274
00:47:21,134 --> 00:47:38,414
Helena Hansen: We need proactive measures to move us beyond incarceration and racialized probe for profit biomedicine as responses to drugs to hoard public health approaches that reduce harm to both white and non white Americans of our racialized drug industry's.

275
00:47:39,134 --> 00:47:42,884
Helena Hansen: So much more to be said, but i'll stop there, so that we can have some discussion.

276
00:47:44,024 --> 00:47:44,534
Helena Hansen: Thank you.

277
00:48:06,944 --> 00:48:11,744
Helena Hansen: Okay, so i'm getting some questions in the chat should I begin to address those.

278
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:16,214
SPH Classroom: Thank you so much, first of all.

279
00:48:16,754 --> 00:48:17,144
Helena Hansen: Thank you.

280
00:48:21,974 --> 00:48:24,044
SPH Classroom: Well there's a question this lets you see.

281
00:48:29,294 --> 00:48:34,214
Helena Hansen: Okay, so I have a question in the chat about heroin assisted treatment in Europe.

282
00:48:35,144 --> 00:48:36,854
Helena Hansen: And it seems that.

283
00:48:37,154 --> 00:48:49,094
Helena Hansen: You know guiding principle of public health promotion here is to let go of the stigma towards certain medications and certain.

284
00:48:50,414 --> 00:48:51,224
Helena Hansen: narcotics.

285
00:48:52,274 --> 00:48:58,364
Helena Hansen: When we want to have maximal impact, you know, in the beginning of my talk I showed the images of.

286
00:49:01,154 --> 00:49:12,374
Helena Hansen: Chinese opium dens and cooking crazy Negroes and Mexican marijuana madness and what we really have to accept is that much of the demonization of certain.

287
00:49:13,304 --> 00:49:22,484
Helena Hansen: certain substances over others and criminalization of certain substances over others really is rooted in political campaigns and and.

288
00:49:22,964 --> 00:49:30,194
Helena Hansen: For the most part, quite deeply racialized and also class based campaigns so.

289
00:49:31,004 --> 00:49:37,964
Helena Hansen: Why don't mind my saying that, why is it that heroin at this moment in time is seen so differently than methadone or.

290
00:49:38,294 --> 00:49:45,224
Helena Hansen: buprenorphine or any other opioid that we might use to treat opioid dependence, it really has to do with the cultural work of those kinds of.

291
00:49:45,554 --> 00:49:50,384
Helena Hansen: media campaigns and racialized images and certainly there is a lot of evidence from.

292
00:49:50,894 --> 00:50:10,004
Helena Hansen: European trials that heroin assisted treatment, it can work much better actually then methadone or buprenorphine assisted treatment for a certain group of patients have ugly the more options, you have for treatment if you really want to have maximum health benefit the better.

293
00:50:11,054 --> 00:50:21,854
Helena Hansen: In the United States, I don't know how far we can get down the road of D stigmatizing heroin, which, of course, was introduced as a medication in 1898.

294
00:50:23,174 --> 00:50:33,374
Helena Hansen: So part of the question is practical yes heroin assisted treatment has been shown to be highly effective with patients that haven't been done as well on methadone or buprenorphine or other opioids.

295
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:41,384
Helena Hansen: Part of the question is practical, what can we do in the current political climate of the United States that's a whole other question.

296
00:50:41,774 --> 00:50:54,134
Helena Hansen: And so, for example, there's an organization called urban survivors Union that i've been doing a lot of work with they are made up of people who have lived experience of substance use.

297
00:50:55,424 --> 00:51:05,474
Helena Hansen: And many of them opioid problem use of opioids problem, meaning it's given them problems with the legal system social problems.

298
00:51:06,134 --> 00:51:09,614
Helena Hansen: They chose rather than to put all of their weight behind.

299
00:51:10,394 --> 00:51:19,034
Helena Hansen: legalization of heroin assisted treatment in the US, even though many of their Members see the data and are in strong supportive, but they chose to focus on methadone instead.

300
00:51:19,424 --> 00:51:26,654
Helena Hansen: Because they realized that even though methadone is illegal treatment in the United States, the way that it's regulated in the way that it's given to patients.

301
00:51:27,524 --> 00:51:39,944
Helena Hansen: is incredibly marginalizing and excludes a lot of people from the health potential health benefits of methadone so that was a strategic decision on their part to put their efforts behind.

302
00:51:41,054 --> 00:51:51,134
Helena Hansen: retooling the methadone regulation and treatment system so that it better serves a wider range of their members so they really they're you know they're those two aspects, the question.

303
00:51:59,444 --> 00:52:09,074
Helena Hansen: and wonder if there any other I certainly there are many other things that I did not address in the time allotted that I could also expand on but before I do that any other questions.

304
00:52:18,854 --> 00:52:20,264
Helena Hansen: So maybe one thing.

305
00:52:21,464 --> 00:52:33,164
Helena Hansen: I may have in my exchange with the planning committee for this lecture series have promised to talk about structural competency, and the reason I bring that up is that.

306
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:46,334
Helena Hansen: i've just delivered quite a bit of bad news, so to speak, and I think it's really an obligation of to myself and many of my colleagues that deliver this kind of bad news.

307
00:52:46,814 --> 00:52:54,944
Helena Hansen: to also be very concrete about what can we do, because otherwise we are paralyzed and it's counterproductive actually.

308
00:52:55,544 --> 00:53:15,164
Helena Hansen: And so I wonder if I should build to just very quickly to some slides that I had embedded on structural competency because that's been another major threat of my work so structural competency is an effort to think much more systematically and do trainings and.

309
00:53:16,244 --> 00:53:22,544
Helena Hansen: A network of mutual support for those of us in clinical medicine, who are asking how can.

310
00:53:22,934 --> 00:53:34,214
Helena Hansen: Those of How can people who work in clinical care address structural drivers of health inequalities and by structural drivers i'm talking about at the level of Community conditions.

311
00:53:34,604 --> 00:53:42,134
Helena Hansen: Institutions that may not be labeled as health institutions but haven't helped big impact on health, such as housing and employment.

312
00:53:42,704 --> 00:53:48,764
Helena Hansen: Institutions and then public policy, so how, how can clinical practitioners play a role in them.

313
00:53:49,754 --> 00:53:56,384
Helena Hansen: And I often have to start off by distinguishing structure structural drivers from social determinants because in the clinical world.

314
00:53:56,924 --> 00:54:01,964
Helena Hansen: we're beginning to talk about social determinants of health, thanks to epidemiologist thanks to public health.

315
00:54:02,234 --> 00:54:12,254
Helena Hansen: Researchers that in bridged over into clinical medicine, but that has often boiled down to well we just are screening for social needs in our clinical encounters were asking patients do you have stable housing.

316
00:54:12,584 --> 00:54:14,294
Helena Hansen: You know, do you have legal involvement.

317
00:54:14,594 --> 00:54:25,604
Helena Hansen: But what we don't often ask is the questions that an epidemiologist would ask, why do certain groups have such high rates of spend stable housing, why does certain groups have such high rates of.

318
00:54:25,814 --> 00:54:29,684
Helena Hansen: incarceration and criminal legal involvement, and for that of course we have to look.

319
00:54:30,044 --> 00:54:42,344
Helena Hansen: To public policies, for example as structural drivers, so when it comes to housing i'm in Los Angeles, the city that has really never made accommodations for affordable housing where developers have been had.

320
00:54:43,664 --> 00:54:58,214
Helena Hansen: The ability to really up the ante with with high priced housing markets, and then there are many other federal policies such as urban renewal that have regularly raised black and brown communities and displace them and.

321
00:54:58,874 --> 00:55:13,574
Helena Hansen: replace them with development projects, many other layers of public policy that explain that and we've had a two year period of public of a national conversation about any qualities and law enforcement and sentencing and incarceration so.

322
00:55:14,084 --> 00:55:22,034
Helena Hansen: So that those are the structural drivers of the what we see in the clinic as an equal group differences in legal involvement.

323
00:55:22,604 --> 00:55:36,884
Helena Hansen: And so, structural competency is a term that I and Jonathan metal and a growing group of colleagues have introduced to clinical audiences to indicate that we need instead of cultural competency, which for clinicians often means.

324
00:55:38,294 --> 00:55:50,654
Helena Hansen: Trying to address the beliefs and behaviors of individual patients and care, we need to use the term structure to shift the focus above the level of individuals towards institutional and Community level and policy level drivers of health.

325
00:55:51,104 --> 00:56:05,054
Helena Hansen: And then competency to indicate, we not only need to understand these things, but we need to figure out interventions ways that we as clinical practitioners can take responsibility and intervene on these drivers and we need to do them.

326
00:56:06,284 --> 00:56:10,274
Helena Hansen: In collaboration in partnership with people with other expertise.

327
00:56:10,754 --> 00:56:16,124
Helena Hansen: And the competencies include recognizing and articulating those structural drivers of health.

328
00:56:16,424 --> 00:56:26,144
Helena Hansen: And then the third bullet is where I spend a lot of my time, these days, observing and practicing structural intervention, so this goes against the green of clinical training for sure.

329
00:56:26,864 --> 00:56:38,324
Helena Hansen: We need many more opportunities for Medical School medical students residents other clinical trainees and practitioners to actually practice differently by intervening on structural drivers.

330
00:56:39,644 --> 00:56:45,404
Helena Hansen: And then, lastly, we need to develop structural humility, which means, seeing that.

331
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:58,634
Helena Hansen: Our clinical training only gives us certain skills and knowledge set and we need to work with others if we're going to be intervening on structural drivers, such as Community organizers policy advocates, who have a complimentary skill set we can't do it all ourselves.

332
00:56:59,774 --> 00:57:06,404
Helena Hansen: And then i'll and just with my rubric that I use to organize my thinking about levels of structure at which we can intervene.

333
00:57:06,674 --> 00:57:19,604
Helena Hansen: there's for clinical clinical practitioners there's what we can do right there in the clinic where we already are, we can embed questions about social needs into electronic medical record prompts when we assess patients they remind us to ask about.

334
00:57:20,114 --> 00:57:29,444
Helena Hansen: Stable housing about access to fresh foods legal involvement and that in itself has been shown to lead lead to a big uptick and referrals for social services.

335
00:57:29,864 --> 00:57:36,974
Helena Hansen: Then, medical, legal partnerships our partnerships between clinical practitioners and law students or pro bono lawyers that.

336
00:57:37,334 --> 00:57:43,484
Helena Hansen: will enable teams to pursue legal cases where they could really benefit a patient's health, such as in my field.

337
00:57:43,754 --> 00:57:54,614
Helena Hansen: psychiatric patients that are illegally evicted when they become symptomatic by landlords that are violating the Americans with Disabilities Act, then there's social prescribing where clinician writes a prescription.

338
00:57:55,364 --> 00:58:04,544
Helena Hansen: For a patient who has a need, such as assistance with social security disability application enhance it to appear navigator or.

339
00:58:05,624 --> 00:58:18,824
Helena Hansen: organization and agency that wants that patient through and then lastly peer navigators hiring care navigators people with lived experience of certain conditions or Community health workers who are from affected communities as part of the clinical team that's a structural shift.

340
00:58:20,144 --> 00:58:27,764
Helena Hansen: Next layer layer of or level of structure is partnerships with Community organizations, so I mentioned in my talk.

341
00:58:28,094 --> 00:58:37,244
Helena Hansen: That we can be, for example, partnering with churches and faith based organizations on the right hand side you see an image in the Center my colleague on a Jordan.

342
00:58:37,484 --> 00:58:47,744
Helena Hansen: addiction addiction psychiatrist who has been studying the impact and showing a lot of benefit of locating addiction, treatment and recovery support in black and latinx churches.

343
00:58:47,984 --> 00:58:54,584
Helena Hansen: trusted Community organizations that also employ people with lived experience it's had a big impact on.

344
00:58:54,914 --> 00:59:07,844
Helena Hansen: access and quality of care and on the left hand side you see an image from an analogous effort in native American healing spiritual centers to offer addiction treatment, then the next layer of or level of structure is.

00:59:09,434 --> 00:59:23,264
Helena Hansen: Non health sector institutions, so I mentioned, housing and legal aid and schools their cultural arts organizations and then there's urban planning, so this is an image of my mentor mentee fully love who's a psychiatrist who.

346
00:59:23,744 --> 00:59:36,374
Helena Hansen: After decades of studying the negative health impact of racial segregation and US cities turn to how can she and colleagues partner with architects and urban planners to redesign us cities.

347
00:59:36,674 --> 00:59:46,514
Helena Hansen: to integrate them taking down the highway overpasses that were deliberately place to separate neighborhoods by race and class and replacing it with green common areas and.

348
00:59:47,744 --> 00:59:58,544
Helena Hansen: and economic zones with local businesses so she's now a doctor of cities, rather than individual patients she treats the pathologies of segregated cities, then, lastly, public policy.

349
00:59:58,904 --> 01:00:09,824
Helena Hansen: So as a as an addiction psychiatrist I live in the world of drug policy and I joined this organization from punishment to public health, operating in New York City collaboration of clinical practitioners.

350
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:14,954
Helena Hansen: disenchanted law, criminal legal system, officials and people who've been incarcerated.

351
01:00:15,614 --> 01:00:24,884
Helena Hansen: they've come up with a lot of different ways of diverting people from the jail and prison system towards mental health treatment when they need it, but most importantly for this slide.

352
01:00:25,184 --> 01:00:38,834
Helena Hansen: They train clinical practitioners and also public health researchers in giving testimony to policymakers, so that policymakers understand why their policies haven't health impact and also train them to write op eds.

353
01:00:39,164 --> 01:00:53,054
