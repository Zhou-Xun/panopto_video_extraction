1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:20,730
Again, I think the government is starting to lose it in our meetings.

2
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,630
But yeah, I just mixed up the numbers yesterday.

3
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:42,930
I don't think you're going to see them and everything, but a few minutes ago, when you have a problem in Europe,

4
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:56,080
I know we're going to hear what you heard from Jersey, New Jersey, which is the best.

5
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,590
Okay. I didn't prepare an introduction. Yeah, I think we have.

6
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,680
I don't. I don't know. Okay. I think we're going to get started.

7
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,010
Good morning, everyone. My name is Mark Wilson.

8
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:22,260
I'm here as a guest lecturer, you know, but I wanted to just sort of give you a quick background about myself.

9
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,390
This used to be my course for a couple of decades.

10
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:35,700
But now, emeritus professor and you asked me to come back and give this lecture today on

11
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:43,409
a topic that I have spent a lot of my life addressing in different diseases.

12
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,270
And we'll spend some time talking about today.

13
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:55,640
Just very briefly, by way of background, my background includes training in ecology as well as in epidemiology and public health.

14
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:03,450
And I like to say I sort of came in through the back door of ecology and I feel like a lot of

15
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:10,980
the ideas and thinking and concepts in epidemiology actually have an ecological base to them.

16
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:20,370
And so that's sort of my mindset. My work has involved a lot of vector borne diseases in various parts of the world, including the US,

17
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:29,249
but also thanks to students like you, really, I've been able to branch out and do work in other domains,

18
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:35,700
other kinds of diseases, some of them not infectious in initial etiology,

19
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:43,110
although I jokingly used to say that eventually all diseases will have an infectious microbial etiology.

20
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:49,290
And we're finding more and more that that's that's true. So what I want to do today is focus on vector borne diseases,

21
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:58,620
start with a broad overview and then focus on three examples that I think are interesting and relevant and illustrative as well.

22
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:08,520
I'm not going to do what typically is done with phrasing or teaching, which is to have you discuss things in group,

23
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:16,770
but hope to engage with you as the as the material is presented and and encourage you to ask questions at

24
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:25,680
any time interrupted if it's not clear and let's see let's see what what issues arise as we move forward.

25
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:37,690
So. Let me start with some basics of what we mean by vector borne diseases and how they function in in reality.

26
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,730
Vectors, as we think of them today, are all blood feeding. They're usually arthropods.

27
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:51,879
They require blood for reproduction. They do not take blood from you in order to transmit an infectious agent that's part of their natural lifecycle.

28
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:59,830
They've evolved to be blood feeding as a source of nutrition for their development and eventually for females to lay eggs.

29
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,540
So parasitic parasite transmission is incidental to this feeding.

30
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,990
It's required, however, by the parasite for the parasite to survive.

31
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,210
And therefore there's been a coevolution of parasites with different vectors.

32
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:25,660
We're talking about hundreds, many hundreds of arthropods that are capable of transmitting specific pathogens.

33
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,580
And there's been a coevolution then of these of these arrangements, if you will.

34
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,990
This is considered biological transmission.

35
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:43,190
And it means that there is a transfer, a physical transfer of the pathogen from that vector, from that arthropod,

36
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:52,820
an insect or tick or a mide or a sand fly or fill in the blank to a host of birth control, sometimes a human.

37
00:04:53,450 --> 00:05:00,940
And we'll get into this in a minute. There are some diseases I think you've encountered the notion of our of answer for noses.

38
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:07,400
Those are ones that transmit human to human to other of others for some time, to the human.

39
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:13,339
And then those that are zoonoses and those involve non-human hosts that normally serve

40
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,720
as the reservoir for the parasite and are transmitted by these vectors normally.

41
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,630
And then there's spillover transmission to it. So this is coevolution and this host specificity.

42
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,150
These are really important fundamental features to understand the pathology here.

43
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,960
Mechanical transmission or contamination is not what we're talking about.

44
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,060
That can happen.

45
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:48,659
It's rare in terms of important diseases of humans, but it can happen where an arthropod with dirty feet, if you will, will accidentally,

46
00:05:48,660 --> 00:06:01,800
incidentally, contact an open orifice of one sort or another, or wearing a cut of of something like something like that, and then therefore transmit.

47
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,170
But that's pretty rare, and that's not what we're talking about.

48
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,600
So this is a biological process in which the vector usually feeds on this vertebrate host.

49
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,830
Transmission occurs.

50
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:22,169
Biologically, the parasite cannot survive unless it is found in this natural host, where it reproduces, sometimes develops and then reproduces.

51
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:27,390
And this process is essential for the survival of the parasite.

52
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,140
And it's incidental to the blood feeding of the of the vector.

53
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:41,100
Trans ovarian transmission sometimes occurs where the pathogen can be transmitted from one generation to the next through eggs.

54
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:48,360
This to us is rare. In most cases, it's biologically complicated, and so it doesn't happen all that often.

55
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,060
One fundamental feature that of vector borne biological transmission,

56
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:59,999
is that it's dependent on the abundance, the survival, the biting rate of these female vectors.

57
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,130
It's only the females of any vector species that transmits because it's only the females that takes a blood meal from a.

58
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,060
From from a vertebrate host and then transmits to another vertebrate host.

59
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:22,570
These interactions then are, in a sense, complicated, but at the same time restricted.

60
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,400
They don't happen willy nilly. They're not any any vector can transmit any host.

61
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,860
And this occasional transmission, transparently, as I said, isn't doesn't often happen.

62
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:40,840
But the transmission is efficient partly because of the species that a particular vector normally feeds upon.

63
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:50,110
These vectors do not typically feed on lots of different vertebrate hosts nonhuman varieties of species, including humans.

64
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,210
Typically they're restricted. And so this possibility of co-evolution exists.

65
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,700
This. That leads to the notion this is an important characteristic vector competence.

66
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:08,170
What do we mean by that? It's the vectors ability to acquire and eventually allow for the development of a parasite within it.

67
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:16,899
This competence as as I said, is very often hosts a sorry is very often parasite specific.

68
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,800
Some vectors will be infected by certain pathogens and simply won't.

69
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:26,260
The pathogen will develop inside that vector. And the same is true for vertebrate hosts as well.

70
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:32,959
Factorial capacity includes vector competence, but also has to do with the number of vectors.

71
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,160
So the more vectors there are, the more likelihood there is that they will become infected,

72
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:44,080
the more likelihood that they will infect vertebrate hosts the number of bites per day, the more often they feed the proportion who survive.

73
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,220
If they don't survive to the next day or the next week and they're infected, they're not going to transmit.

74
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,809
Remember, all we're all we're talking about here is transmission.

75
00:08:52,810 --> 00:09:00,879
This is the fundamental concern that that we face in infectious diseases, the number of days for the extrinsic incubation period.

76
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,040
This is the time in the host it start in the vector when the parasite is developing.

77
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,250
So these are all important characteristics and they're summarized in this.

78
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:18,250
The life expectancy also of the of the infected vectors, if they don't live long enough, then they cannot transmit in in the next round.

79
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:27,170
What do we talk about? Trying to intervene against different vectors? Again, this is sort of broad brush overview.

80
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:35,570
We can intervene by affecting the populations of the vectors through their abundance, either the larval or adult stages.

81
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:44,450
Typically, those are the two stages that we interact with the most and try to interfere with their development of survival through chemical,

82
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:51,590
mechanical, biological means. We can reduce their habitat so places where they normally would survive rest.

83
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:56,990
Sometimes lay eggs can be modified such that they don't do that as well or as long.

84
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:04,580
And then there are hormonal mechanisms for intervening in the egg laying process or in mating.

85
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:08,720
And this disrupts those processes such that reproduction is less likely.

86
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:13,040
They are abundance declines, the amount of feeding that they have,

87
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:18,230
no matter how many vectors you have if they don't feed on the host in this case in human hosts,

88
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,510
they simply won't transmit and eventually they won't survive because they can't reproduce.

89
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:28,969
So these are all characteristics listed here. That short list, again,

90
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:37,520
summary short list of vector feeding characteristics that we try to intervene against to interrupt the infection in those vectors,

91
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,450
even if there are a lot of them, even if they feed on us, if they're not infected, who cares?

92
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:44,940
Well, they're annoying, but they don't transmit.

93
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:51,620
If they're not infected, they cannot become infectious and lots of other characteristics.

94
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,269
And again, this is, as I say, sort of overview right now.

95
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:06,499
And so the key here is to think about including environmental and behavioral and social factors that influence any of these interventions,

96
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,630
but also influence the characteristics that I mentioned in the preceding slide.

97
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:20,410
Just a quick glimpse at some of the emerging arthropod vector borne diseases shown here.

98
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,990
And it's a short list, an old short list that's still, I think, valid today.

99
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:36,160
And it shows a number of newly emerging infectious diseases transmitted by arthropods that are becoming important.

100
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,630
And the key I want to point out here is the variety of different kinds of vectors.

101
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:51,790
I'm not even mentioning species of fleas or species of ticks or or midges, but rather that there's just a huge variety of resurgent,

102
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:59,020
sort of emerging arthropod borne diseases that are becoming important throughout the world.

103
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,520
In addition, then,

104
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:09,220
there are these resurgent vector borne diseases that have been around for a long enough time that we know them for sometimes even centuries.

105
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:16,480
They weren't named a few hundred years ago, perhaps, but they were recognized today as having existed then.

106
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:24,370
And this short list, again, shows different parts of the world where you can see they're important and the

107
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:29,950
variety of different factors that transmit these agents that cause chicken.

108
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:41,290
Crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever. That's a viral infection that I studied a lot in Africa in a few decades ago and so forth.

109
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:49,990
And so the point here is there's a huge variety of vector borne diseases in this case that are reemerging or resurging today.

110
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,740
Why or how are they emerging or reemerging?

111
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:01,340
Urbanization is a major driver of this this phenomenon, if you will.

112
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:11,510
And this is a short list of diseases that are vector borne, that are reemerging because of urbanization,

113
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:19,280
the ways in which humans live in contact with each other, modify the geophysical environment around them,

114
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:25,790
and therefore either create more proximity to vectors that transmit these infections,

115
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:31,760
more suitable habitats so that their population abundance increases,

116
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,510
or in some cases actually creating new habitats that didn't exist there before that these.

117
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:47,270
Arthropod vectors adapt to and become important in similarly deforestation.

118
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:52,849
So this in a sense is related to urbanization but has different characteristics.

119
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,419
So those habitats that are, say,

120
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:05,540
on forest edges where vectors survive well are being enhanced by cutting down forests and creating similar

121
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:12,590
habitats that are suitable for for those arthropod vectors shown here that are related to the diseases shown here.

122
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:17,510
A whole variety of different ways in which food production occurs.

123
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,999
And I'll mention this in a minute in more detail with malaria.

124
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:30,800
But this is another major environmental modification where depending on the vector and depending on its associated diseases,

125
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:38,030
either there could be an increase or a decrease in some of the intentional modifications that occur through agriculture.

126
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,829
Actually, it unintentionally have a negative impact,

127
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:48,680
but others have a have a beneficial impact and increase the incidence of those diseases, or at least the risk of those.

128
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:57,110
So again, this is the idea here is to sort of paint the broad brush picture and give you a sense of the kinds of characteristics

129
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:03,260
and environmental changes that are associated with them in reemerging and emerging vector borne diseases.

130
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,010
Okay, so what are the impacts in a nutshell here?

131
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:15,889
Vector borne diseases account for an estimated nearly 20% of all diseases and of all sorry,

132
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:22,130
of all infectious diseases and an estimated 700,000 deaths annually.

133
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:26,210
There are many, many blood sucking insects.

134
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:34,550
They transmit a variety of different infectious microbes, including parasites, bacteria, viruses and so forth.

135
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:40,460
We'll talk about those in a minute. Malaria in particular is one that has a major impact on people's well-being.

136
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:47,870
And it's not just because I happen to be studying that or have studied it for quite a long time.

137
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:58,340
But but the evidence shows that these infections by the by the Plasmodium parasites are very often high risk,

138
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:04,910
frequently fatal, and end up impacting a large number of people, particularly children.

139
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:12,170
An estimated 4 billion people are at risk of dengue as another example.

140
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,520
This is not nearly as high risk. It rarely is fatal.

141
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:23,540
But the disability adjusted life years lost can be enormous through through infection with dengue

142
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:31,730
virus transmitted by a particular species or a small group of species of of AIDS mosquitoes.

143
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:40,240
And there are a whole slew of others. You saw some of the names, if you haven't been familiar with them, from from previous exposure,

144
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:44,810
tigers, disease, for example, eastern ISIS, lymphatic filariasis.

145
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:53,230
These are among the top impact vector borne diseases that we are concerned about as as epidemiologists.

146
00:16:54,200 --> 00:17:01,070
What's interesting about these in fact, I could argue perhaps all of them, is that they are, in a sense, preventable.

147
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:08,540
And yet we're impacted globally in an enormous way by by many of them.

148
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:14,120
And so one of the big challenges is why we know so much about them. We know the life cycles of the parasites.

149
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:21,440
We know which vectors are important and why is it that they still persist as human diseases of importance?

150
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:34,939
So here's just a quick summary of the Delhi's loss to vector borne diseases by parasites and by sorry bites by diseases and associated parasites.

151
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:44,380
Malaria, $46 million lost per year, dengue AIDS 2 million and some schistosomiasis.

152
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,530
A tricky one here. Have you have you talked about Cisco yet in the class?

153
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,090
No. So schistosomiasis. Anybody know about schistosomiasis?

154
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,430
Have a have an idea. Your count. Yeah, I don't know yet.

155
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,660
Anyone know about system. Have any. Have you heard of it.

156
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:11,540
Just a symbiosis. It's actually it survives and reproduces and is transmitted from and in snails, from snail to snail.

157
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:20,420
Well, there's spillover transmission to people. And the Fillory, a worm that infects people, then causes schistosomiasis.

158
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,690
There's just the same parasite that infects people.

159
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:29,299
And and as a result, there's an enormous disease burden it rarely kills.

160
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:35,360
It oftentimes has major health impacts, but it's considered, in a funny way, a vector borne disease,

161
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:42,980
only because the vector, even though it's not an arthropod, behaves in a way like arthropod vectors do.

162
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:46,220
It's not an insect. It's not a tick, it's it's a snail.

163
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:57,529
And so there is spillover transmission to people in that zone is zoonosis that is is reflective of what vector borne disease is doing.

164
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:06,889
Some people group and group schistosomiasis in that in that class lymphatic filariasis again a mosquito transmitted infection all

165
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:16,400
coasts circuses river blindness you've probably heard of this is a sand fly transmitted worm that is now approaching elimination.

166
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:22,370
We've had huge amounts of success because of the limited location where the sand flies breed.

167
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:29,239
So one of the characteristics that you want to think about when you're trying to consider what do we do with this disease that we know so much about?

168
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:36,290
But we can't call her. We can't eliminate even locally, let alone extirpate globally.

169
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:44,060
And so this one in particular, though, is interesting because the black flies reproduce in flowing water,

170
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,709
mostly in parts of sub-Saharan Africa and a few.

171
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:56,150
There used to be a few pockets in Latin America as well in South America, and yet it still exists.

172
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:00,290
We haven't been able to eliminate the larval stages.

173
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:11,389
This is where most control takes place of the other sand fly that transmits the agent that causes river blindness or Marco psoriasis leishmaniasis.

174
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,560
Another example of a parasite transmitted in this case by sand flies.

175
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:22,470
Japanese encephalitis. This is a viral infection transmitted by Culex mosquitoes.

176
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:26,640
Yellow fever. I'm sure most of you have heard of yellow fever.

177
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,970
Many of you well know many of you have been vaccinated against yellow fever.

178
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:41,280
I'm not sure. Depends how much traveling you've done internationally, but Chagas disease and African trypanosomiasis.

179
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:49,200
These are examples, and I'm not expecting you to remember all these, but to give you a sense of the burden of these diseases,

180
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:57,060
but also of the importance in terms of public health writ large, but especially in the developing world.

181
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:02,430
Most of these we don't experience in our lives here in the US.

182
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:09,810
If you're traveling, you can be sure that you're going to be thinking about these if you're traveling internationally to developing countries.

183
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:17,330
Another way to think about this then is to look at the vector. So mosquito borne diseases, this is sort of just turning things around.

184
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:25,350
And I'm not going to belabor it. Mosquito borne AIDS associated infections that can lead to chicken gonorrhea.

185
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,870
I mentioned dengue already. Rift Valley fever, another viral infection there.

186
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:40,740
The zoonosis is human infection from mosquitoes that were infected by typically goats or sheep or cattle.

187
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:48,870
But also there can be direct transmission from herders that slaughter these animals that might be infected.

188
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:54,630
And the blood then can can infect either through aerosol or sometimes through cuts in the skin.

189
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:02,310
The person who's butchering those animals. So there can be spillover that's non vector borne even though again that's rare

190
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:10,469
culex mosquitoes that transmit and Japanese encephalitis lymphatic filariasis.

191
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:16,650
Again, we mentioned these West Nile fever. We know about West Nile virus here in North America because it invaded.

192
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,770
It's a an emerging disease, if you will.

193
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:24,720
It invaded from probably from still unclear,

194
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:34,770
probably from Israel initially or from the Middle East more broadly and has since spread throughout North America and now down into South America.

195
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:39,930
It's an emerging viral infectious disease transmitted by mosquitoes.

196
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,610
In this case, a variety of mosquitoes.

197
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:49,170
Culex in a large group, but a variety of North American mosquitoes are very efficient at transmitting that particular bird.

198
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,720
I mentioned the snails already, the black flies I mentioned as well fleas I haven't mentioned.

199
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:01,360
We'll we'll speak briefly about this with regard to pest or a return to plague.

200
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:12,550
Also, lice are important for certain particular transmission of certain parasites that cause for example typhus

201
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:19,540
is a good example since lice I've mentioned already and ticks will spend a lot of time with in a moment.

202
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,170
So again the idea is and try to make bugs as well chance disease.

203
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:33,250
These are all different groups of parasite sorry. Different groups of insects that transmit parasites that cause human disease.

204
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,400
You probably heard this before. I apologize if I'm repeating what you've been exposed to already, but.

205
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:50,210
Diseases aren't transmitted. In this case, these infectious diseases are the result of infections that are transmitted.

206
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:58,910
So parasites are what are transmitted and the diseases may or may not appear, be recognized, be important.

207
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:04,790
You can be infected without having the disease, but you can't have the disease without being infected.

208
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:09,200
So remember that when you're thinking of, oh, depends on the disease,

209
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:15,139
most most diseases will have some sort of evidence of infection, but some will not.

210
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:21,470
And you can still be infectious to other people, even if you don't have symptoms yourself.

211
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:28,040
And we know a lot about this most recently with cold sores, which is not a vector borne disease.

212
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:33,040
Let me pause and ask if anybody has comments, questions, anything.

213
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:36,780
Again, this is broad brush overview in the beginning. Any thoughts?

214
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,560
Comments, questions. Concerns. Okay.

215
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:51,880
Few minutes with malaria in particular, because I think it's, as I said, epidemiologically important and interesting for lots of different reasons.

216
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:56,540
This is not a new disease. It was recognized way back then.

217
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:05,870
And as a result, even though it wasn't called malaria way back then, it's had a huge impact on human history.

218
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:16,910
Broadly speaking, primate malaria is eventually evolved into those that are capable of causing infection in humans and therefore disease in humans.

219
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:23,720
And that's that's where this this history began hundreds of thousands of years ago.

220
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,910
But more recently, we have.

221
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:37,680
People who have studied the disease again, not called malaria then, but more recently called malaria for Italian for bad air.

222
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,129
And in particular, that knowledge was used in lots of different ways.

223
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:55,830
And interestingly, in creating what we're called bad smell maps in Egypt during battles at the time when the soldiers were dying,

224
00:25:55,830 --> 00:26:04,530
not from wounds during fighting, but through infection with Plasmodium and malaria as a result.

225
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:11,310
But it wasn't until fairly recently that a deeper understanding at a biological level occurred,

226
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:20,370
and this resulted in us ranking in the recognition that the parasite that caused malaria was being transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes.

227
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:26,939
The only genus of mosquitoes that transmits human malaria is human.

228
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:32,130
Plasmodium is Plasmodium species that cause malaria is anopheles.

229
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:42,170
Today. A couple of hundred million people are ill every year with malaria and 400,000.

230
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:45,820
GUY That's a lot for a vector borne disease.

231
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:52,450
About half of the world is at risk. About 90% of that risk occurs in Africa.

232
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,510
Under five year old children are the ones who suffer the most.

233
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,750
They represent perhaps 90% of all malaria deaths.

234
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:11,470
And the reasons for that I'll talk about in a minute. Those deaths that do occur to children, roughly 20% of them are the result of malaria.

235
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:17,290
Sorry. Specifically in sub-Saharan Africa, those are those deaths that occur to children in sub-Saharan Africa.

236
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:22,960
Perhaps a fifth of them are the result of malaria.

237
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:32,850
Which is related to the disease. Symptoms are related to a lot of factors genetic as well as environmental,

238
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:38,460
but in particular nutritional status and lack of exposure of preceding either maternal

239
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:46,950
antibody exposure or an immune system that develops responses to early infection.

240
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:53,070
This is what leads to serious complications and oftentimes death where there's no treatment available.

241
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,060
So not surprisingly, poor children are the ones who suffer.

242
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:05,700
Plasmodium species, falciparum, vivax, allele and Larry or the four prime primary ones that we that we worry about today.

243
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:10,320
The most severe cases are those due to falciparum Plasmodium.

244
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:15,660
And there are other animal Plasmodium Plasmodium species that we're not really that interested in again.

245
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:25,230
Anopheles mosquitoes are important. There are perhaps on the order of 60 species of Anopheles mosquitoes that are capable or competent of.

246
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:33,659
Sustaining an infection of Plasmodium ex and being able to transmit it eventually.

247
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,680
So they play a role in the epidemiology of this disease.

248
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:45,270
These are diverse in their ecologies, behaviors and competence, but they're all in the same genus Anopheles.

249
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:55,450
Everyone is susceptible to malaria, but some of us have a genetic predisposition to be less susceptible to symptoms to disease.

250
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:02,440
And so these many factors, as I mentioned, impact on whether or not we recognize we have disease.

251
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:08,460
Depends on the species. As I mentioned, falciparum is the one that has the most severe symptoms.

252
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:21,100
Our immunity. Interestingly, and unlike many other pathogens that we worry about in an infectious disease epidemiology,

253
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:31,360
the immune response to Plasmodium infection wanes fairly quickly and depends on frequent reinfection.

254
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:39,430
So the initial symptoms from an early infection are oftentimes severe, sometimes fatal, if untreated.

255
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:44,860
Eventually, after being reinfected and reinfected and reinfected,

256
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:54,040
you develop a partial immunity where you have essentially no symptoms and become a chronic carrier and you're capable of maintaining transmission,

257
00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:01,690
even though you're running around happy as a as a ten year old who doesn't sleep under an insecticide treated net because you're not sick.

258
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:07,240
And so what do you do? You end up infecting lots of other mosquitoes that then in turn maintain transmission.

259
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:19,150
So so the immunity of of humans to this parasite is complicated by how many reinfections occur, how often.

260
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:29,920
And the more of them you get, the more likely you are to have chronic low level impact through anemia, for example.

261
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:40,180
And I'm not saying anemia is not important, but compared to severe symptoms, it's nowhere near as bad.

262
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:45,310
And you can then become infectious to other mosquitoes and then eventually to people.

263
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:57,880
Human nutrition is important, as I mentioned as well, and the ways in which that happens occur through anemia, through iron loss,

264
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:07,270
occurs through other other forms of nutritional impact, not only on symptoms, but also on the immune system response to infection.

265
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:17,000
The children who are not immune, who are first initially exposed, are the ones who experience the most severe symptoms.

266
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:27,110
And these are typically children in high transmission settings where after maternal antibodies wear off six months, ten months, something like that,

267
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:39,890
they're initially exposed, sometimes in high transmission settings, two, three, four, ten infectious infectious bites per child per night.

268
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:47,849
So this is a lot. And as a result, it's very likely that these children will be infected.

269
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:52,589
And ideally they're infected and reinfected, reinfection and don't have severe symptoms.

270
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:58,410
But very often they're in a setting where they can't be treated for their initial severe infection and symptoms.

271
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:03,510
And this is where most of the deaths occurred. So, again, it's a it's a disease of poverty,

272
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:11,459
partly because of the way in which treatment is needed in order for survival to occur, but partly because of the geographic,

273
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:21,930
physical context in which Anopheles mosquitoes do very well and are capable of reaching people, reproducing, transmitting very easily.

274
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:26,340
And so this is, again, a disease of poverty for all kinds of reasons.

275
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:33,900
The transmission cycle very briefly, then has mosquitoes introducing spore.

276
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,410
Otherwise, through their saliva, they salivate.

277
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:42,459
Like many, virtually all vector borne disease vectors.

278
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,530
Sorry, they salivate in order to keep the blood from coagulating when they're drying it out.

279
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,910
So they salivate in the process in their salivary glands.

280
00:32:49,920 --> 00:33:02,800
Those pathogens are injected because that infected vector in its previous blood meal, it injects that parasite into the human host.

281
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,800
In this case, there's a life cycle development in the liver stage, which then in turn,

282
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:15,780
in turn leads to a circulating stage which is then picked up as meta sites by the next mosquito that comes by.

283
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,110
This usually is a week to ten days later, let's say.

284
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:27,510
So there has to be a period of development before that. In fact, newly infected person becomes infectious to the next mosquito coming by.

285
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:36,950
That mosquito then has to survive long enough where the development occurs inside the mosquito to be infectious to the next person.

286
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:46,520
So this is the biology that I introduced in early on, the intimate relationship, the coevolution of the parasite and the and the vector.

287
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:52,700
So understanding that is critical because the time involved makes a huge difference in how

288
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:59,090
long the survival takes place if this if this newly infected mosquito doesn't survive.

289
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:03,850
The extrinsic incubation period long enough to take another blood meal.

290
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:10,700
Usually in this case of ten, 10 to 14 days later, she is not going to infect anybody.

291
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:18,170
So it doesn't matter. So. So, again, this is critical that you prevent infection, but also that you might be able to impact on survival.

292
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,240
So this is briefly then the life cycle.

293
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:30,580
Which which includes in the in the vector, the egg that leads to larvae, that leads to pupae, that leads to adults.

294
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,680
As I mentioned, females have to take a blood meal to survive and reproduce.

295
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:41,270
Males typically feed on plant sugars for their source of energy.

296
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:46,070
They're around, like with most species to mate. That's about all they're good for.

297
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:51,950
And so it's the female vector in general that is important.

298
00:34:52,760 --> 00:35:01,460
Many of these, interestingly, and in particular, mosquitoes that are important to transmission of malaria specifically transmits.

299
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:07,910
I made a mistake. Malaria is not transmitted. Who are important to transmission of Plasmodium, which causes malaria.

300
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:17,540
They feed at night. And the Coevolution involves not just the parasite and the vector, but also the vector and the human.

301
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:25,640
And so people, what do we do? We are usually quiescent at night, and if we're bitten by a mosquito at night, we sometimes don't even know it.

302
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:31,520
And so as a result, these anopheles mosquitoes have evolved to bite at night and are very good at it,

303
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:37,520
which is why at night, if you sleep under an insecticide treated net, you will be at lower risk of being bitten.

304
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,880
So that's the intervention point that that's of interest there.

305
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:46,970
The females lay their eggs in water. So there has to be a suitable water source around.

306
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:56,660
Again, this is true for all vector borne diseases. There has to be the right environment for them to reproduce and this varies with different species.

307
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:00,889
Which kind of water? Is it fast flowing? Is it stagnant?

308
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:07,760
Is it tidal? Is it created by humans who are growing rice in paddies, etc.?

309
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:19,830
Longevity or length of life of each individual vector matters because that influences the goal of tropic cycle and therefore transmission.

310
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:27,180
And so the key issue here in if you look back at that equation or if you think about the important features is longevity.

311
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:31,020
If you can interrupt and reduce the longevity of these vectors,

312
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:37,320
they will be less likely to in the next blood meal, survive to that point and therefore transmit.

313
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:44,370
So we have adults that then lay eggs. I just started putting some pretty pictures up there for you.

314
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:50,140
Okay. Any of you who are falling asleep, pay attention. These are pretty pictures that lay eggs.

315
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,160
The eggs then develop in the water to larvae.

316
00:36:55,170 --> 00:37:09,330
The larvae feed on like micro algae and other microbial organisms in the water and then in turn mature to pupae,

317
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:19,010
which have a stage of maybe two or three days, depending on temperature, in which the mosquito transforms into an adult.

318
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,920
And then that adult female takes a blood vessel, lays eggs again.

319
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:33,979
And there we go. Some of the conditions for transmission of Plasmodium causing malaria that I think are really worth summarizing in this way.

320
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:38,870
Are we the people I mentioned, immune status, what we do, where we live,

321
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:44,360
what our occupation is, these are all features that will impact on our exposure risk.

322
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:55,610
The parasite itself, there are some parasites that are more virulent than others, some of them pathogenic in ways that others are not.

323
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:01,400
Some of them are resistant to treatment in ways that other strains are not.

324
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,890
So one of the big areas of research right now is the multiplicity of infection,

325
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:12,290
the number of different Plasmodium parasites, strains that any one person can have,

326
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:20,000
and how that plays a role not only in immunity but in competition between or among these different strains,

327
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,460
the vectors themselves, which species are around, how abundant they are, what behavior.

328
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:34,100
There's evidence now that because of using insecticide treated nets and spraying insides of people's houses with an insecticide repellent,

329
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:39,679
these mosquitoes are feeding at night anymore. Some of them are now much more crepuscular.

330
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:50,420
They're feeding early in the morning or or just after dusk in the in the evening, while people are still out and about cooking, having dinner,

331
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:59,660
talking, hanging out at the bar, and therefore, they're exposed in ways that they weren't before because of the selection of this behavior.

332
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:04,219
To not feed at night when you can't get a blood meal, you're not going to reproduce.

333
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:09,170
You're not going to survive the selection of it's a genetic it's not a learned behavior.

334
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:14,270
As far as we know. It's genetic selection for early evening or early morning feeding.

335
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,650
The seasonality of transmission really makes a huge difference how intense it is.

336
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:23,580
If it's only seasonal part of the year,

337
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:32,580
how essentially how endemic the transmission is makes a huge difference in terms of how we intervene when when we produce,

338
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:39,059
what kinds of interventions to try to interrupt transmission, the availability of that kind of intervention,

339
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:43,260
not just to prevent transmission, but to intervene to treat cases.

340
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:52,200
Remember that not only are you saving a life when you treat severe cases at the local clinic, but you're also interrupting transmission.

341
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:57,209
That person is no longer going to be infectious. And then more broadly,

342
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:04,560
this this issue of environmental use creating habitats or unintentionally creating

343
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:11,190
habitats that sometimes are anathema to the survival of the of the Paris of the vector.

344
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:18,900
I took this old drawing to illustrate one important point about environment here, and I think it's really interesting.

345
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:28,230
What you have is an illustration that shows from the ocean to the inland hill forest area

346
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:34,020
and different kinds of habitats where crops are grown or where natural vegetation occurs.

347
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,780
And then these are the different species of Anopheles that are found in those habitats.

348
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:44,670
So you have sandiacre that's found primarily in mangrove swamps.

349
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:54,420
You have compensate for pestis, that's found primarily in rice and sometimes in rubber plantation cultivation.

350
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:04,560
Metaphor is found principally in rubber and then sometimes swamp forest areas and so forth and up to vernaculars, which is found in highland areas.

351
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:12,060
Each species has its own environmental characteristics, and if you consider one species to be more competent,

352
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:20,700
more likely to transmit than another species, then that will impact on the likelihood of infection and of that species being important.

353
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:27,720
Similarly, there's seasonality because of the dependance on water in more arid areas.

354
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,719
It's only after the rainy season that you have concerns about intense transmission,

355
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:41,880
and this is when you really need to be most attentive to new infections and try to interrupt transmission at that point.

356
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:49,460
There are a variety of different ways to do that. Prevention through affecting mosquito abundance.

357
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:53,450
This can be through the breeding sites that they lay their eggs in.

358
00:41:54,140 --> 00:42:03,110
Sometimes this includes larva sighting. So you basically kill the larvae in the water that they or have their eggs have been laid into.

359
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:14,180
Sometimes biological control introducing larval fish is a is a classical way to impact on larval stages of anopheles mosquitoes.

360
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:25,440
Mosquito human contact if you have lots of mosquitoes, but they don't reach a human human's skin to take a blood meal and who cares?

361
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:35,160
So there are various ways to do that. Personal repellents. And of course, as I mentioned, this notion of out time, outdoor, nighttime activity.

362
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:44,500
But perhaps the most important malaria prevention device that's used today are insecticide treated bed nets.

363
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,300
These are bed nets that people sleep under.

364
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,450
They have to set them up. It's not easy. It's not fun.

365
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:58,019
But you have to do it every night and you have to keep your feet and your hands and everything inside that net.

366
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:03,210
And if you do so, the insecticide treatment repels the mosquitoes, prevents them from.

367
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,530
And the physical barrier itself of the netting prevents them from taking a partner from you.

368
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:10,870
You're protected from being infected, and you will not.

369
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:15,030
In fact, if you're already infected, you will not be infectious to those mosquitoes.

370
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:25,360
Treating an individual as an individual as well as a population level, in fact, impact, and I'm sure you understand that.

371
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:35,380
So we've got all these different interventions. But why aren't what why is malaria still killing 400,000 people every year?

372
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,860
That number is down, by the way, quite a bit over the last decade.

373
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:44,560
We've had a huge impact from what was close to 1 million deaths per year due to malaria.

374
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:50,469
We're now down to less than a half million. And the idea is it's moving in the right direction,

375
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:56,830
but it's stagnated primarily because of the lack of success of intervention in

376
00:43:56,830 --> 00:44:01,720
underdeveloped settings where people don't have the means to maintain that intervention.

377
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:07,840
Where nation states where countries aren't able to provide the resources to distribute freely,

378
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:13,390
the interventions being insecticide treated nets, indoor residual spraying, whatever that intervention is.

379
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:20,710
So it's a complicated economic, socioeconomic, behavioral and evolutionary process as a result.

380
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,390
So this is the big challenge.

381
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:31,809
When I quickly summarized this before we end malaria with the following graphic and I hope it's interesting and shows how

382
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:39,940
the cycle from human in this case this isn't an answer pronounces vector borne answer pronounces human vector human vector.

383
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:45,700
So you can start by personal protection, which we mentioned already, including bed nets and so forth.

384
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:50,950
You can treat people which will reduce the infectiousness of individuals.

385
00:44:51,430 --> 00:45:03,520
You can alter the contact frequency. You can consider the possibility that certain species of of Anopheles will feed on somebody else, not on humans.

386
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:08,050
In which case, again, that's a wasted bite from the parasites point of view.

387
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:15,880
But they will some of them will end up feeding on non-human hosts and therefore not transmitting.

388
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:25,690
Certain species of vectors have more competence than others for the parasite, their abundance makes a huge difference there.

389
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:33,910
Longevity makes a bigger difference. Where people live in relation to the breeding sites of these mosquitoes is critically important.

390
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:42,280
And how prevalent in in the in the vector the parasite actually is as well as the amount of biting that occurs.

391
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,620
And then finally the longevity.

392
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:53,500
And again, I keep coming back to that because that's probably the most critical feature of vector borne diseases in general and malaria in particular.

393
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:59,690
So we can impact through altering mosquito breeding sites.

394
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:05,060
We can think about ways in which people migrate or move around.

395
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:17,500
Might be introducing parasites. Might in. Come into areas where they are at higher risk of exposure but have little or no immunity.

396
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:24,849
The age structure of the population again, because children are at most highest risk in high intensity transmission areas,

397
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:27,880
but not in the lower transmission intensity areas.

398
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:36,129
And so the age of people is critical. Also, what their house structure is like, do they have screens on their houses?

399
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:39,490
Many people who are high risk don't. Don't even have screens on their houses.

400
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:42,760
Their nutritional status. And then the health care infrastructure.

401
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:52,870
So these are examples where economic development could improve our efforts to enter to intervene against malaria.

402
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,770
But obviously, with all these other beneficial effects as well.

403
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:08,170
So again, trying to sort of integrate economic development as part of an epidemiological approach to combating malaria.

404
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:18,610
It's one of the I guess, one of the bigger challenges that a number of nonprofit organizations are currently involved in at the present.

405
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:28,300
Let me just quickly mention here agriculture. So there are lots of different ways in which agriculture has a potential risk to increase malaria,

406
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:33,730
but at the same time might have alternate impacts that are worth mentioning here.

407
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:39,280
And I'll let you look at this and think about it. I'm not going to go into it now because we've talked some about agriculture already.

408
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:44,800
But I think it's really interesting with most of the interventions, there are benefits but also risks.

409
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:52,600
And many of the agriculture related environmental changes have lots of risks as well as potential benefits.

410
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:58,270
And so the challenge is understanding just what that agricultural change does in

411
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:04,030
order to figure out is it going to benefit our efforts to try to reduce malaria.

412
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:14,200
So what does this mean? We could be considering in fact, we are considering vaccines against malaria.

413
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:23,410
One of the big challenges is not only are there are to host the mosquitoes and the people, but also there are many different stages to the parasite.

414
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:27,100
Which one do you focus on for the vaccine?

415
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:37,540
There are various antigens even within one stage, and each sub variant of the parasite has different antigens as well.

416
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:45,520
That's how the evolution is, is creating these these variants as as different antigens that present to human hosts.

417
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,600
There is a new vaccine that's undergoing trials right now.

418
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:59,830
It's called R2 for short. That vaccine is promising, but it really does not have the kind of impact that you would hope for and that.

419
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:05,479
Immune response lasts only for a few months.

420
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,960
Really? So. So it's still a challenge. There's hope for that.

421
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:13,550
Vaccination is unlikely in the short term to have major impacts.

422
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,410
What about manipulating too? Genetically manipulating the vectors?

423
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:25,960
This is a kind of hot area that a lot of people have a hope for, but in my mind has huge limitations.

424
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:33,680
The idea here is that you modify genetically the species of anopheles mosquito that you're concerned about in an area.

425
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:40,190
And in doing so, you hope to reduce its ability to transmit.

426
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:47,570
There are lots of different ways that that could happen. One of the challenges, though, is that this has to be selectively advantageous.

427
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:58,880
If that introduction changes, the behavior, changes the survival, does anything to reduce the reproductive capacity of that vector.

428
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,600
It's not going to last. So you can release and this is being done.

429
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:12,380
I know it's hard to believe, but we're released. There are studies underway to release genetically modified vectors, not necessarily anopheles.

430
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,740
Some of them are other species, but in so doing,

431
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:24,280
hoping that they will introduce these modified genes that reduce vector, vector competence or bacterial capacity.

432
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:30,470
And the hope is that that will impact then on disease risk.

433
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:36,410
The challenge is, will that persist? Will how will you drive that genetic change through the population?

434
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,110
Lots of hope for new drugs to treat people.

435
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:51,200
There's a huge amount of resistance for certain strains of the parasite to the common treatments that are being used as that evolution takes place.

436
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:57,980
We have to keep the the war going by coming up with new new weapons,

437
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:06,230
new drugs to treat treat infections that are are no longer effectively treated by the drugs that we have.

438
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:09,860
So these are the kinds of future things that people are hoping about.

439
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:15,740
I'd like to argue that what we really want to do is a much more enlightened approach in which we.

440
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:24,989
Think more seriously and deeply about the environmental determinants of risk that we when

441
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:32,069
we go about changing environmental conditions as the result of economic development,

442
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:35,670
we think about how that will impact not just on malaria.

443
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:40,380
This is more broadly on infectious diseases and more broadly on health in general.

444
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:46,080
But we do that in a more enlightened and thoughtful manner.

445
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:50,970
Epidemiologists have to be involved in economic development, I guess is one way to think about it,

446
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:56,999
because that economic development is impacting on the environment and there has to therefore be collaboration

447
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:03,390
among different ways of thinking about our existence and the way in which we interact with our world around us.

448
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:14,040
And we have to involve people more carefully and conscientiously and consciously who are the recipients of our interventions

449
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:20,940
in hopes that they will accept that we will we will design interventions that will be more acceptable to them.

450
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,740
All right, I'm going to. Pause here.

451
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:32,980
We still have until. So we have a little time left.

452
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:36,670
In fact, we have a lot of time left. And I want to ask you, what do you think?

453
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:44,950
What are some of the questions that this arise that arise that this discussion brings to mind?

454
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:49,080
How is it similar to other infectious diseases that you've been studying in the class?

455
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:49,810
How is it different?

456
00:52:50,820 --> 00:53:01,120
Are there any themes that you recognize here that that you hadn't recognized before or that are like what you've heard about before?

457
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:05,230
Anybody who wants to sort of offer some ideas, please.

458
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:12,190
I have a question. Sure. So when a parasite like malaria, the parasite infects someone,

459
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:18,820
does the parasite die off once it reaches maturity, if it's not picked up by another mosquito?

460
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:23,210
Or does it continue to like. Replicator.

461
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:30,110
Yeah. Great question. So the question involves what happens to the parasite once it's in you?

462
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:37,520
And especially if it's not picked up. So remember that it is is millions of idiots.

463
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:45,530
Right. And so they're there at the time that they are able to infect a mosquito that's feeding on you.

464
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:55,819
They're in a red blood cell. And so at that time, there are lots of circulating red blood cells that are infected and infectious with computer sites,

465
00:53:55,820 --> 00:54:01,430
male and female computer sites. And they continue to circulate and replicate.

466
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:10,850
And in some species, Plasmodium vivax in particular, they can actually find their way to your liver, especially other organs, and hang out.

467
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:16,290
And so there are chronic infections that, interestingly, have appeared.

468
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:23,720
So those of you who've traveled internationally, you may have taken malaria prophylaxis to prevent.

469
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:32,820
Plasmodium species from infecting you. And if you didn't do a good job of that, you could have been infected with Plasmodium vivax.

470
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:40,650
That vivax infection could have caused you a little bit of fever and you felt really crappy and you took some drugs and and you got rid of it, right?

471
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:47,430
But then a year later, sometimes five years later, you have this huge fever that suddenly appears.

472
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:52,200
And you go to the doctor and I don't know what's going on and nobody looks to see

473
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,709
if you might have malaria because you're not living it in a malaria setting.

474
00:54:55,710 --> 00:55:02,970
Right. You're living here in North America, which used to have lots of malaria, by the way, before we drained all the swamps.

475
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:08,280
But we have drained all the swamps. I'm exaggerating, but.

476
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:14,280
But the point is that parasite actually has a way of hanging out in your liver for long periods of time.

477
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:21,900
And recrudescence occurs under different conditions, nutritional stress, taking an exam, all sorts of things like that.

478
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:27,780
So the idea, though, is that the parasite remains circulating within you.

479
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:35,580
Either it will kill you if it's early on and you don't have any immune response or it will remain for a while.

480
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:44,430
And that while depends on the species of Plasmodium and eventually will disappear because your immune red cells die.

481
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:49,890
Your immune system attacks those cells and will clear the infection.

482
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:53,549
But sometimes there's long term chronic infection in certain species.

483
00:55:53,550 --> 00:56:04,050
In particular, vivax is one of them. So. So the parasite can hang out there and can be infectious at low levels for weeks.

484
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:08,330
In most. In most situations. And most for.

485
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:13,130
Falciparum Plasmodium in particular for weeks.

486
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:20,900
And then eventually you typically clear your infection, especially if you have preexisting antibodies that from earlier infections.

487
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:27,530
Good question. Thank you. Other thoughts or questions or ideas about malaria in particular?

488
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:31,370
We're going to move on to another couple of diseases in a minute.

489
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:36,500
If you don't have other is again, is this notion of vector borne?

490
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:43,520
Does it seem foreign to you've all heard about vector borne diseases before, but is the is the way in which I'm presenting this useful?

491
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:51,530
Is it is it, I guess, challenging you to think about how to intervene as public health workers eventually or.

492
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:54,920
But I see heads nodding.

493
00:56:55,010 --> 00:57:05,149
It looks like some smiles underneath your masks. Yes. I have a question about just what do you think about people introducing the genetically

494
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:09,709
modified mosquitoes and what are the potential like negative side effects of that?

495
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:13,490
Cause I was waiting for somebody to ask that question. Yeah.

496
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:19,040
So this is a big challenge. I mean, so the idea here is that in modifying.

497
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:25,490
Genetically strains of particular in this case, mosquitoes.

498
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:39,260
It's not just mosquitoes, but mosquitoes and is being most effectively done with mosquitoes that transmit it is aegypti

499
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:44,330
mosquitoes in particular that transmit the age of the virus that causes dengue fever,

500
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:50,900
dengue virus. And the challenge is you're you're messing with nature.

501
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:52,070
We always do that.

502
00:57:52,070 --> 00:58:04,700
Either we do it by selection of natural mutations, or we create mutations in the lab and evaluate them in the lab under confined settings,

503
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:15,140
then further evaluate them in large cages where you determine their survival, their ability to reproduce and so forth.

504
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:23,390
And then eventually you you have limited release, usually, ideally, after asking the local community, is this okay?

505
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,690
And most of the time they'll say no until they understand what the risks are.

506
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:33,979
And the risks are that first, from the perspective of success, it's going to fail because as I mentioned,

507
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:38,840
it's hard to drive these genes into the population unless there's a selective advantage to them,

508
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:44,660
as well as being producing less transmission, which is your goal.

509
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:52,820
That's what you're really trying to do. The likelihood that there would be negative impacts.

510
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,380
Spilling over to other species.

511
00:58:56,710 --> 00:59:08,230
From this genetic genetically modified mosquito, let's say, is pretty low because there's very little means for that exchange to take place.

512
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:12,370
They're not reproducing with each other. They're not eating each other, etc., etc.

513
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:24,880
The possibility that you will unintentionally release a mosquito that's actually going to behave after it interacts with other natural,

514
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:29,440
non non modified mosquitoes in a way that's totally unexpected exists.

515
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:35,739
That possibility exists. But again, it's I think it's pretty likely, but it's pretty unlikely.

516
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:40,150
And it's more likely that that change will just die out.

517
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:54,350
So there is a concern. It's not the same kind of concern as other kinds of genetically modified organisms, GMOs that we see all the time in our food,

518
00:59:54,560 --> 01:00:03,050
for example, because those are very often plants that interact with other plants in ways that we don't always understand.

519
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:10,700
So there's the possibility of transfer to different species and then weeds that suddenly grow better because

520
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:18,650
they've got some hormone that's being produced by genetically modified organisms that accidentally spilled over to.

521
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,170
That sort of thing is very unlikely to happen.

522
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:30,440
At least in in the work that I've read, I'm convinced by the discussions of how this could happen, that it's unlikely.

523
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:35,600
But again, good questions. This is these are challenging times.

524
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:40,550
We've we're trying to find these solutions to problems with new technologies.

525
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:45,890
And those technologies can have the risk of backfiring and doing just the opposite of what we're trying to do.

526
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:55,510
Okay. Thank you for asking questions. Let's let's move on just to make sure that we are able to cover most of what I have here today.

527
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:59,800
New disease. New vector, new pathogen.

528
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:15,500
And it's one that you've probably heard about the plague or pest or pestilence is historically in some ways better recognized than malaria.

529
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:22,250
But on the other hand, just as poorly understood until somewhat more recently.

530
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:28,880
There have been many plagues of plague, if you will.

531
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:37,630
In other words, many epidemics, global epidemics that have occurred throughout history.

532
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:41,870
And you're all familiar with Black Death in the 14th century.

533
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:48,460
This is, again, one that began at that time and extended for quite, quite a while.

534
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:54,280
It's estimated that on the order of a quarter of all people in Europe died from the plague,

535
01:01:54,430 --> 01:02:03,040
died from the plague, a quarter of all the people in Europe. And so the impact of this particular infection was enormous.

536
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:13,810
There have been contemporary more contemporary epidemics, including a pandemic started in China in the late 1800s.

537
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:21,850
That actually is the source of the original introduction into the Americas through.

538
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:28,629
But it included it included the African continent, but it also included the Americas.

539
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:33,070
But through transport on ships and the transport occurred.

540
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:41,320
In most cases, it's believed most of the introductions because it happened many times with rats

541
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:46,150
that were on these ships and the rats were infected with your senior pestis,

542
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:50,980
the pathogen that causes what we call in humans the plague.

543
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:58,600
And those rats also had their transmitting vectors, which are fleas.

544
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:04,400
Yersinia pestis is a bacterium that's a gram negative bacillus bacterium.

545
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:08,690
And the symptoms aren't really very pleasant.

546
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,219
Here's a short list.

547
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:20,270
And quite frankly, initially you wouldn't necessarily suspect plague because the symptoms are nonspecific fever, chills, myalgia, etc.

548
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:28,730
Eventually, your swollen lymph nodes appear and eventually, in more severe cases, lung involvement.

549
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:32,990
And so the severity of disease takes a while to appear.

550
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:36,980
But by the time it starts to appear, you are really high risk of dying.

551
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:46,550
And back in the day, we had no means for either preventing transmission because we didn't know it was flea war or for treating.

552
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:54,370
And so all sorts of crazy treatment mechanisms were used and they mostly didn't work, of course.

553
01:03:54,380 --> 01:04:02,970
And the same is true for prevention. Pneumonic plague appears very early on in the first couple of days.

554
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:07,049
Transmission is pneumonic. That is to say by aerosol.

555
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:10,410
This is not the vector borne component. That's typical.

556
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:15,749
It occurs in people, but not typically in the rodents that serve as the hosts.

557
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:29,490
For your senior pestis, bubonic plague is when you see buboes, these swollen areas where sometimes the flea has bitten, where the lymph nodes enlarge.

558
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:37,450
And this is the true vector borne transmission cycle where fleas feed on, in this case, people.

559
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:48,240
So there's transfer of fleas from their normal rodent hosts to people that can in turn lead to a full blown systemic infection,

560
01:04:48,480 --> 01:05:00,030
which is very often highly fatal. And so the transmission cycle that involves fleas and rodents involves spillover of fleas by fleas to humans.

561
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:05,240
And then there can be human to human transmission through respiratory transfer.

562
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:11,280
So this is an interesting example of a vector borne disease that doesn't have to be vector borne in humans.

563
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:21,270
The vectors include this flea as well as a few other species, but the oriental rat simply is the one that's the most important.

564
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:27,870
The transmission cycle, again, involves small mammals of a of a relatively restricted group.

565
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:34,680
Most of them are rodents, and the spillover transmission is feeding of the fleas.

566
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:42,960
Once they leave the rodent host, the nest or the environment where rodents survives, they somehow get get to where people are.

567
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:48,269
Or rather, the other way around. People get to where those fleas are and that's where the exposure occurs.

568
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:54,330
And then there's this pneumonia that can occur through droplet transfer,

569
01:05:54,570 --> 01:06:05,400
and then sometimes hunters will be exposed as they're butchering in the field, especially animals that have have been infected.

570
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:12,180
We can reduce rat infection infestations in urban areas and human exposure.

571
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:15,780
That way we can monitor rats on ships.

572
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:18,120
And this is actually still being done today.

573
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:27,900
The idea in rural settings is to avoid contact with rodents in areas where pest where plague is known to exist.

574
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:39,190
If you have a pneumonic case of a person who's clearly infected with your senior pestis and is coughing, she or he has to be isolated.

575
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:43,500
Otherwise, there's a huge risk of other people around that person being infected.

576
01:06:44,490 --> 01:06:53,940
There's the global distribution of plague is quite widespread globally, again, because of transport that's occurred over centuries.

577
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:04,110
Here's a quick timeline. Or since the 1950s, up to almost the present, it shows parts of the world, including Asia,

578
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:09,479
in the in the sixties and seventies, as well as the Americas throughout that time period.

579
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:17,760
But then here and there, since then and then Africa that have had essentially epidemics in different parts of those continents.

580
01:07:18,090 --> 01:07:24,329
And each year there is always low level transmission in some settings that are where the rodents exist,

581
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:28,799
where the parasite exists, and where the fleas that transmit with confidence also exist.

582
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:32,780
And this is then to show the total number of of of.

583
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:42,870
Of countries where in these in these areas where where it's known to exist today.

584
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:48,540
Here's another quick summary just to show you the reported number of cases.

585
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:52,829
And you can see the vast majority of recognized cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa,

586
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:59,400
but also in Asia and in parts of Latin America and in the United States.

587
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:06,329
Here's a quick review of human plague in the U.S. up to the roughly the present.

588
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:11,580
And you can see that most of this occurs in the western part of the United States.

589
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:21,480
And you might ask why? Well, the primary reason is that the natural transmission cycle involving rodents includes animals like prairie dogs,

590
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:25,350
wild rodents and the fleas that are associated with them.

591
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:37,920
Your senior pestis again is principally associated with one species of flea, but multiple rodent species are competent as reservoirs for the parasite.

592
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:46,979
So you have this risk of prairie dogs, ground squirrels, wood rats, squirrels and other, in this case,

593
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:53,730
rock squirrels that are capable of infecting fleas and please, in turn, can transmit to them.

594
01:08:56,110 --> 01:09:04,899
Humans get in the way in a sense, because they live in areas where there's exposure to or proximity to,

595
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:08,650
I guess is the first way to think about proximity to where these rodents live.

596
01:09:09,010 --> 01:09:14,380
And if these rodents have epidemic transmission, many of them will die.

597
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:21,730
So there's low level transmission that kills a few here or there. But under certain circumstances, a lot of rodents become infected.

598
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:30,520
And in fact, just a lot of fleas exist and a lot of new deaths occur when there are lots of fleas and they're dying rodents.

599
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:36,729
The fleas look for food anywhere they can get it. They look for, in this case, in humans that are around.

600
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:41,950
And so there's spillover transmission in some contexts where humans become infected because

601
01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:49,060
the fleas leave their rodent preferred hosts and we'll take blood meals from humans.

602
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:58,120
And so that's what that's what you see here, where there can be transfer to domestic animals that we keep around our houses and eventually to people.

603
01:09:58,330 --> 01:10:03,670
So that's where you get human infection in North America. At least the bulk of it occurs that way.

604
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:14,140
Stop their questions or comments. Anyone? This one's a very different one, in a funny way, but it's very similar in most other ways as well.

605
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:21,730
Yes. Do you anticipate that any selected genetic traits in humans like hemochromatosis or other genes that.

606
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:30,950
Seem to prevent or have provide some resistance to plague would help buffer against future outbreaks or do nothing that would be like a considerable.

607
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:37,040
Yeah. This is a great question. I don't I don't have a simple answer.

608
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:47,290
My my guess is that there was a lot of selection occurring with the Black Death Plague.

609
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:58,550
So at that time, people who did survive may have had genetic underpinnings, genetic characteristics that allowed them to survive.

610
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:02,380
That was clearly, quickly selected for everybody else was dying.

611
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:08,030
They didn't have it. So this is a very strong selective pressure, how that's been maintained today.

612
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:12,440
Once that selective pressure declined rapidly, I don't know.

613
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:16,610
But but in general, this is the way to think about these kinds of problems.

614
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:23,600
If you if you know that occurred, there was a strong selective pressure occurring in the 1400s in Europe at least.

615
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:29,280
And most of the people sitting in this room today, many of us are have some European blood.

616
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:36,000
Right. Genetic material that could include that we might be better protected against severe disease and still be infectious.

617
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:39,320
That's another possibility as well. But I simply don't have the answer.

618
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:49,420
That's what the Internet is for, I guess. I'm sorry. Thank you. No other comments or questions about this particular example.

619
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:55,810
We've got a very few minutes left. Let me move forward.

620
01:11:56,590 --> 01:12:04,209
So tick borne diseases in humans. And in this case, I'm going to talk very quickly about one disease in particular,

621
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:11,020
but more generally about about ticks in general and then Lyme disease in particular.

622
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:18,400
In this case, hard ticks. It's a group of ticks that have a clear cast outer shell, if you will.

623
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:24,820
Three stages larvae, nymphs and adults, as well as as well as eggs.

624
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:32,440
And you can see this rabbit is infested with fully engorged, nearly fully engorged adult ticks.

625
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:37,180
And those adult female ticks drop off and lay thousands of eggs.

626
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:46,389
So the life cycle is is of that sort. There are different species that are important for different pathogens, at least in North America,

627
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:52,060
which I'm going to talk about in a minute here, that are, again, very closely linked.

628
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:58,360
So the coevolution of certain species of ticks has occurred with different pathogens that are linked to them.

629
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:04,990
Typically, there are one host species that have all three stages feeding on the same host.

630
01:13:05,570 --> 01:13:12,700
That's a limited group, especially of both. Alice is the genus, not one that we're concerned about because they feed mostly on animals.

631
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:17,650
None of these remember, none of these vectors normally feed on people.

632
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:20,020
So we're talking again about zoonoses.

633
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:31,600
They normally feed on nonhuman animals and we get in the way to host species include larvae announced that feed on one particular

634
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:40,870
group of an individual host stay on that host and then the nymphs drop off and become feeding adults that feed on a different host.

635
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:49,210
Here's another example of the selfless. There are there are two host species and they feed as larvae and nymph one host,

636
01:13:49,450 --> 01:13:56,319
which impacts on their ability to transmit to acquire infection and transmit because they're those two stages around the same host.

637
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:00,550
So they're not leaving us the same host. As a result, they can't transmit to somebody else.

638
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:11,440
The three host ticks. On the other hand, each stage drops off after taking a blood meal, molt to the next stage, and then hops on another host.

639
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:14,620
If it can find that host, it doesn't hop, actually. It sits there and waits.

640
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:23,080
And you, you or your dog or your mouse literally walks by and gets attached to as they walk by.

641
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:31,510
This typical three host cycle then involves larvae that feed on certain animals.

642
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:35,320
They drop off after in gorging molt and become nymphs.

643
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:39,340
They drop off after feeding on certain animals molt and become adults.

644
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:46,480
And then they eventually drop off as females, adult females and late save thousands of eggs.

645
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:53,830
Why do we care? Host Abundance is going to influence the probability of an encounter.

646
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:59,290
Again, if the ticks are out there and there aren't that many of them. You're not going to be at risk.

647
01:14:59,470 --> 01:15:04,390
Or if you're in an environment where that risk is low, the behavior of hosts,

648
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:11,920
including humans and our movement around them is critical because where those ticks drop off is where

649
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:17,650
they're going to sit and wait for us questing for waiting for an animal host or human host to come by.

650
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:24,520
And then these different hosts. Some of them are good at getting rid of the ticks and some of them are not as good.

651
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:31,870
Not all of the vectors rather than the tick vectors, will carry infections.

652
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:37,030
But not all of the hosts are capable or competent reservoir hosts for those infections that we're worried about.

653
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:45,850
And then some of the microbes are transmitted, depending on the host, to very few host species.

654
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:53,440
So this co-evolution, again, is critical. And then the number of different hosts that the species species, the ticks feed on is critical.

655
01:15:53,770 --> 01:16:01,630
So these these patterns are really important to the epidemiology of understanding risk in terms of the spillover transmission to people.

656
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:07,800
They have to be, and most of them are persistent and requisite blood feeders.

657
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:15,130
They are relatively slow feeders, unlike the mosquitoes that are done in 30 seconds or a fleas that are done in less than that.

658
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:21,540
Sometimes ticks require hours, two days to come to to complete their feeding.

659
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:25,080
So they they there's a greater risk that they'll be detected.

660
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:29,310
But there's also a longer period of time where they can hide and end up transmitting.

661
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:34,260
They are oftentimes hosts specific,

662
01:16:34,410 --> 01:16:40,920
but some of them have a very wide host range and they'll feed on basically any vertebrate that happens by including people.

663
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:47,040
Some of that is advantageous because they'll be able to take a blood meal from any host.

664
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:55,530
But then from the parasites point of view, if the host isn't competent or if it's not a person, we don't care in terms of human disease.

665
01:16:56,510 --> 01:17:00,350
There aren't that many natural enemies to the two ticks in general. Birds.

666
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:08,000
Some birds will feed on ticks, but most of the time there aren't any natural enemies and they have this huge reproductive potential.

667
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:13,820
Depending on which species we're talking about, it could be up to 18,000 eggs for female.

668
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,890
I'm going to not be able to finish all of this. I realize and I apologize.

669
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:25,010
Just quickly, let me show you this. Rocky Mountain spotted fever in the United States, silicosis.

670
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:27,410
These are distribution maps to show that.

671
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:35,540
So very similar patterns here because it's the same tick that transmits the agents causing those to the disease is a different pattern for tularemia,

672
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:41,510
a different one still for Anaplasmosis, which is similar to Babesiosis, sort of,

673
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:48,139
but again, similar tick species, not necessarily the same host vertebrate host species.

674
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:49,310
And so the patterns are different.

675
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:58,250
And then Lyme disease, which you're going to just have to read about, I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to finish all of this in this summary slide,

676
01:17:58,250 --> 01:18:01,970
I think is really instructive because it shows all of that combined.

677
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:09,260
And you can see some parts of the U.S. that are that have lots of examples of cases of infection.

678
01:18:10,650 --> 01:18:14,490
Other parts less so, but that may be population related, so be careful.

679
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:19,010
Maps. Maps can lie. You know that. In addition,

680
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:25,079
then there are patterns of colors that show which species are likely to be present and therefore

681
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:30,990
transmitting certain pathogens and other species that can't transmit even if they are present.

682
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:39,180
And so these are, again, characteristics of which ticks are there, which risk factors are associated with the different tick associated diseases,

683
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:44,790
Lyme disease, I've mentioned all these, so I'm not going to continue repeating that.

684
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:52,860
Very briefly, Lyme disease occurred initially as a and arthritic condition in Lyme, Connecticut,

685
01:18:53,700 --> 01:19:04,410
and therefore Lyme disease or Lyme Borreliosis because eventually, once it was discovered that it wasn't Lyme disease as in the sense of an infection.

686
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,579
Sorry, an arthritis that was independent of infection,

687
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:14,250
but it was rather an infectious condition that produced this arthritic condition in young children.

688
01:19:14,610 --> 01:19:18,929
It was recognized that a pathogen was involved in this case, a bacterium Borreliosis.

689
01:19:18,930 --> 01:19:26,670
And so in North America and in other parts of the world, there are Borrelia now recognized, unknown before,

690
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:33,690
basically unknown until there became enough cases of infection and now an expansion explosion,

691
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:38,730
if you will, of cases that have taken over most of North America.

692
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:44,219
I'm going to have to stop there. I apologize. I spoke to you, too.

693
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:55,890
I didn't speak too slowly, but I appreciate you asking questions and in the eyes of.
