1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:13,339
Heard. So coming in today, I have the honor of introducing Dr. Jeffrey,

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:19,910
clutching Dr. Quach as an associate professor in the Division of Colorectal Surgery at Michigan Medicine.

3
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:26,839
She's also the clerkship director for surgery and the director for medical student program.

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,860
Dr. Colter has been working in global surgery for many, many,

5
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:38,480
many years and is just a fantastic human being all around and really experienced practitioner in global health and medicine.

6
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:44,450
Dr. Crutcher, great to see you.

7
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:51,740
Hi, everyone. Thank you so much for inviting me to be here and for giving me some of your time.

8
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:59,690
I recognize in this day and age. Time is precious and so that would be 1,000,001 places you could be.

9
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,950
And this is mandatory attendance. You had no choice. I would not.

10
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,730
But if you had a choice, then I'm glad you chose to be here.

11
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,270
And I just want to say thank you for giving me some of your time.

12
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:18,350
And I would also say that of all the things I do, I love doing stuff like this.

13
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,610
I got an MPH not too long ago and I remember taking a very similar course which had the same title and stuff,

14
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:34,819
but that was part of my whole journey, trying to figure out what do I find in purpose and meaning in terms of like a lot of things.

15
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,070
But to give you a little bit of a background about myself, so I'm originally from Ghana.

16
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,110
I was born and raised in Ghana, came to the U.S. for college.

17
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:51,320
When I was coming, my whole plan was to get trained. Plus you start to get trained and then to go back to Ghana.

18
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:59,989
And then I if you say life happens, like you can't predict how things are going to go and that we can control a lot of stuff.

19
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,820
And so I find myself now is still in the U.S. 22 years.

20
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:12,740
And I found along the way creative ways of still being engaged and doing the kind of work I'm passionate about.

21
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,080
And now as a faculty,

22
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:25,190
I've been a faculty have set in my fifth year now is just given me a little bit more flexibility in order to do this work and do my MPH here.

23
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:31,610
Actually, I was fortunate to meet a bunch of Ghanian trained physicians and a bunch from

24
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:37,450
Nigeria and actually into Nigerian physicians who are getting the message over.

25
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,509
And most of them were trying to leave their home countries, and I struggled with that.

26
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,490
I know this is kind of funny. I struggled with that because I was like, Oh my God, this is brain injury.

27
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,930
And this just talks about hypocrisy because I was like, clearly, I was a brain drain.

28
00:02:54,230 --> 00:03:00,830
And the thing but talking to the it became very clear that some of their frustration was around having the knowledge,

29
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,080
not having the resources and them tools in order to be effective and apply it.

30
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:13,340
And for them, that was really tough going to work and then say, I know what to do to save this person.

31
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,320
I just can't do it.

32
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:25,339
And that's something I think we don't think about a lot when we talk about public health or some of the system level issues that affects resources,

33
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,340
human resources, movements of human resources.

34
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:37,940
The other thing that became the complaint was that they felt, as I was in a very privileged position, having trained here in the US,

35
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:44,930
it's almost like I speak a certain location of this fantastic system that they don't necessarily understand as well.

36
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:51,400
I'm able to understand the language of applying for grants or where do you get the grants from?

37
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,630
How do you write in minus bits? And they don't.

38
00:03:54,470 --> 00:04:03,140
And so then it opened up this opportunity to collaborate where I see myself more like a translator of some sort, like a bridge of some sort.

39
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,590
And it helps a lot with me build my own guilt around still being there and the U.S.

40
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,030
I love America, but there's something about home.

41
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:22,360
And at least it makes me feel better that I am able to communicate and fill those two spaces.

42
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,420
I'm happy to talk a little bit about that.

43
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:33,549
My mpca was very informative and transformative in a lot of ways and so happy to talk about that as you guys go through those similar journeys.

44
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,670
But over here these are the rules.

45
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,490
I feel I do a lot of stuff with medical students.

46
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:46,030
Right now we have students who have planned to residency programs that that's taken up a lot of our time, but I'm pretty excited about that.

47
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,180
So for disclosures, I have no disclosures.

48
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:58,930
I will say, as I mentioned a little bit, a lot of what I think and how I see the world is shaped and influenced by my own experiences,

49
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,250
and I recognize that I have my own biases because of that.

50
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:10,450
So what I will share today, my mother represents the entire truth and I will all that.

51
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,670
The way you might see, based on your lived experiences, might be very, very different.

52
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:23,320
I welcome discussions around that. I welcome you challenging me, stop me and say, Hey, we discussed that a little bit more.

53
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:32,020
Doesn't make sense. I will also ask for Grace because I recognize that I may say some stuff which I think is

54
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:37,930
completely fine based on my upbringing and based on my world experiences or my lived experiences,

55
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:44,980
but might come across completely wrong. And my intent is not to offend anyone.

56
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,110
My intent is not exclude anyone. So when I say he she,

57
00:05:50,290 --> 00:06:00,010
I don't mean to exclude all the beautiful range of words between that is just that's the way I have grown up using language and I'm still learning.

58
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,620
Okay, so if I say something, you're like, okay, we need to correct that.

59
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,200
This is just something to me. I'm very open to that.

60
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,280
Or you could shoot me an email later on and say, Hey, that was really off.

61
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:22,750
I welcome that because that's a way we all give it a. So for this class, I think we sent some readers to a suggested evidence.

62
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:30,580
And if I know anything about suggest the readers half of the time they've done, have done, you know, and these went out a little bit later.

63
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,260
So I am going to summarize what those papers were supposed to convey.

64
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,999
The message was supposed to convey to you. There were three that was suggested.

65
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,010
One was an optional was this huge document. One of them was The Art of Medicine or something by Atul Gawande.

66
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,059
So those of you who might be familiar with the title go on to he writes for The New York Times.

67
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,850
So his style is a little bit more down to earth, more like you read in a story piece.

68
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,940
So he is presenting the need, describing what surgery is global health, a global surgery is,

69
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,890
but doing it in a way that is more like the discussion you would have around the Times giving table,

70
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,460
which is what he encourages in some of the work that arises that he's done.

71
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:19,720
So that's a very simple way. If you do nothing at all, that would be a quick read to do and that will give you some good context and stuff.

72
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:29,170
The other one was around surgery as a global health need that was written by a bunch of colorectal surgeons for colorectal surgery.

73
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:36,819
General And that goes over the whole in terms of what the issue is, what the need is,

74
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:46,060
and then gives at the end a little bit of talk about who writes specific stuff and that summarizes that larger document, which was optional.

75
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:52,750
And so if you want to get a good sense of what the Lancet commission wants us to do, and that might be the reading to go to.

76
00:07:53,170 --> 00:08:00,940
And then there was another reading that was by a resident, one of my residents and myself looking at some of the work they're doing in Ghana.

77
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:05,770
And so that gives you a little bit more the specifics of taking that back and then going into specifics.

78
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:12,730
And that's what I'm going to do today. I'm going to go to The Lancet and then I'm going to tell you about the work I am doing in Ghana in this space.

79
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:21,130
And again, any point in time, you can interrupt me. So this is summarizing the Lancet commission stuff present what the need is.

80
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:27,820
And I think just based on you guys have talked about, well, global health is a theme and everyone has their own.

81
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:34,840
I ascribe to the fact that global is truly global in the sense of anything in your backyard, anything.

82
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,980
We have international health and then we have like global everywhere.

83
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Part of that is because I if you think of when you say international global as other.

84
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,250
I left my home and came here in Ghana.

85
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:56,230
This is other this is international health, you know, so it varies depending on your point or your frame of reference.

86
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:02,470
Some of the patients I see as a colorectal surgeon come from the U.P. and some of them have to travel eight,

87
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,040
11 hours because they don't have a colorectal surgeon. Where do you live?

88
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,700
That is a global public health issue, access issue, and that is an issue that we see in Ghana.

89
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,630
And it makes no sense to ignore this issue because it's in the US.

90
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,130
And then also we know about disparities in health care when we think about that too.

91
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:26,080
So that has happened here in the US and it's happening in other developing countries.

92
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:36,400
So I truly ascribe to the sense that global is global, but the need to take a percent of the global burden of disease will require surgery.

93
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,130
And that seems pretty abstract.

94
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:45,940
But I was just thinking of all the disease states that we see, about 30%, one in three of them is going to need some sort of a surgical treatment.

95
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,310
And we all know what surgery is to cut it and remove and add something to sort of treat a disease state.

96
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:02,250
And then he says 16.9 million lives may be lost annually from conditions requires surgical kids.

97
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:10,620
Before I came, ia0, let me refresh my mind on how many lives we unfortunately lost from COVID and that 6 million.

98
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:18,270
And when you think about that, I think sometimes when we throw around big numbers, it's difficult to remember what they actually represent.

99
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,330
But if you think about 6 million and how that was shocking to us in terms of COVID, we are saying that this is even more than that.

100
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:30,210
We have spent and about triple number from the fact that it can get surgical care.

101
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:37,220
And then 5 billion people worldwide don't have safe surgical care.

102
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:44,870
So if you were to burst your appendix right now, which hopefully will happen to any one of you, but some of you might have had the experience.

103
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,930
Thank goodness you're right. By Lake Michigan.

104
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:52,400
And hopefully you'll be able to get in there and get the surgery done because we've got a ton of surgeons in there.

105
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:57,320
But you could be somewhere else, and that might not be the case at all.

106
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:07,730
And so in low middle income countries like my home country, Ghana, nine out of ten people actually can't get if they appendicitis,

107
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,180
will not be able to get to a hospital and get that taken care of.

108
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,020
And we think of that. That's a really, really basic thing. The appendix is a story.

109
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,710
You walk in, you walk out, same day. You are eaten that evening.

110
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:25,970
You're fine. You're back to school, hopefully the next year or two, unless they give you like a slip to say you can skip school for like, how long?

111
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:31,040
But it's a very quick in and out when you think about the fact that other people, some people can get at as big.

112
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,180
And then if you look at these just numbers, it turn around.

113
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,500
So there are these 300 million cases, surgical cases that are happening each year.

114
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:45,070
And then this is the fraction of that that is happening in the most part.

115
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:53,129
And so the same case that we're making, some people have some people don't have the people who don't have more than the.

116
00:11:53,130 --> 00:12:00,690
People who don't have. Who do have. And then 4 million deaths occur within 30 days of surgery every year.

117
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,460
So this is the 30 days piece is something that we use a lot for research.

118
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:11,070
So you might have done some studies where we look at what are outcomes from surgery.

119
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:18,929
So sometimes we look at immediate outcomes. Whilst you're in the hospital, how many people developed a wound, infection,

120
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:25,020
etc. surgery, how many people develop a urinary tract infection whilst in the hospital?

121
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,810
We also check how many people died.

122
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:37,740
As a surgeon, we are tracking all of those numbers and that's the way we make sure people are doing good surgery and not watching things up.

123
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,290
But it's not only enough to check in terms of that immediate period whilst in the hospital,

124
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:48,059
you want to know what happens to them when they go home because some issues

125
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:52,990
don't cause a problem whilst in the hospital we might see an impact later on.

126
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:57,540
So one of the things they track, I guess when you're talking about surgical cases,

127
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,550
are you talking about cases or is it just ones that aren't elective procedures?

128
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,690
Yes. So they are talking about orcas. When they do these numbers, they are looking at all cases.

129
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:11,790
But then later on in the as because they break it down into essential surgeries,

130
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,809
the essential surgeries would be like having a baby and then being able to get

131
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,010
a C-section or a delivery that and then trauma if you've got into an accident.

132
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,810
And that includes both elective and emergency surgeries.

133
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:33,390
When you don't have a lot of resources to go around, most places will start by building emergency surgical minutes.

134
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,200
And then as you get more resources extended to the lives of staff.

135
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,970
But that doesn't play into it. But it's a great question and thanks for that.

136
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:48,490
So the 30 days is more like what happens over time. So it's going to give an example of a blood clot.

137
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:53,560
The Serena Williams had a black club in her leg and went to her lungs.

138
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,120
It was something that was all of a sudden pulmonary embolism.

139
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:02,790
And that happens from not moving around a lot when the surgeries that I do.

140
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:08,189
Sometimes we have someone to sleep for about 10 to 15 hours the whole time.

141
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:12,120
You're not moving your legs. And so blood is still stagnant in pools.

142
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,010
So there's a high risk of blood clots forming while she was sleeping and that

143
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:21,150
blood clot might not release and then go to your lungs and kill you immediately.

144
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,750
They could several days later and when you are up and move in a hole.

145
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,209
And so they have all these things that they have,

146
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:33,630
as do low income people are blessed in medication and that is one of them quality measures basically to do that,

147
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,860
I would guess on a blood thinning medication, prophylactic dose.

148
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,410
So think of all those blood clots.

149
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:48,720
And so within a 30 day period, they check how many of your patients ended up with the blood clots in your legs or whether it embolism.

150
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:55,740
So there are things that we check within that timeframe as an indication of all those quality measures,

151
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,130
all this quality improvement stuff that she said.

152
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:05,280
And then also after 30 days, you feel like the surgery you did is safe enough, the patient is safe enough.

153
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,559
So that's why they reported this measure. The 30 days is not like a random number.

154
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,049
It's been studied and that's what we use here in the U.S. So they same 4 million deaths.

155
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:20,580
These are people who got into surgery. So they managed to get to a surgical place.

156
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:28,840
Of those, 4 million of them would die. Which points to an issue with even the overall health care.

157
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,800
So it's not just a matter of doing the surgery, antibiotics, wound care issues,

158
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:42,050
ambulation and moving around some of those little things that we've instituted here in the U.S. which mean that sepsis outcomes are better.

159
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,190
So this is just seeing the outcomes even as we get a surgery support.

160
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,010
And then this talks about density.

161
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:58,720
So the number of surgeons within a certain space to take care of X number of people and they reported in different ways,

162
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:03,640
but they are saying that for general surgeons. So these are not highly specialized.

163
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:09,010
So I am double board certified in general surgery and in colorectal surgery.

164
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:16,000
I completed seven years of general surgery residency, took my boards for that and I have additional colorectal.

165
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:21,100
Just looking at general surgeons. So this I located with plastics none of those.

166
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:27,220
They have 0.13 to 1.57 per 100,000 population.

167
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:33,040
And going to your question, they would build general surgery first before you add on something like colorectal

168
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,110
or add on some like urology or some other specialty services here in the U.S.,

169
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:44,020
even if you think about rural areas, it's about 5.2 per 100,000 and you say, okay, that's small.

170
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,500
They think about the U.S. also have specialists. So today I did cancer clinic before come in.

171
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,980
So I've seen patients who have cancers and some of them have cancers in their colon, nearby colon or other places.

172
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,910
And those cancers could be taken care of by general surgeon because they are not in a tricky spot.

173
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:07,389
I didn't necessarily need a colorectal surgeon's expertise because I'm available.

174
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:15,600
I've seen straight garden variety colorectal cancers and that's not getting built or pulled into this like number.

175
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,600
So we have more access to more common general surgery.

176
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:23,200
So. And then this is how much money we spend.

177
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:33,020
So you've come across this in your MPH classes. The U.S. spent a lot of money on health care and a lot of other high income countries do the same.

178
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,380
Whereas in low middle income countries,

179
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:44,110
the number is smaller and this is not reflective of better care like we sometimes see when we look at other high income countries,

180
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:51,100
there's reflective of even the budget that the government has is not being allocated to health care

181
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:57,190
or surgical needs or you just don't have people coming through in order to spend money on their.

182
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:03,440
So I'm going to push a little bit and say, I recognize that everyone knows differently.

183
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,100
I went through it through a bunch of words on the board and some numbers.

184
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,820
And for some of you are like, Oh, I got that really sunk in.

185
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,870
I'm a visual lineman. I learned bits of pictures and stuff.

186
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,510
You draw something from me. I'm always drawing something for my patients.

187
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,209
One patient said it looked like chicken breast and they actually framed it and took a picture for me like,

188
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,560
Oh gosh, it's by your fridge and it doesn't have chicken scrap until someone takes a picture of it.

189
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:31,700
But I need to draw. I need to see it in some sort of way.

190
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,440
So I recognize that some people are more like, just hear me talk about it.

191
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,890
It's like, okay, this is the pressing need. I get the numbers.

192
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,390
And some people like to write things down, like take notes, taking some notes.

193
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,260
I tell you, if I take notes, I'll close the book and never go back to my notes.

194
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,830
So that's an issue like everybody figures out which way they live.

195
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:59,090
So I'm going to present the same data in pictures, but you just get a little bit for the different lenses in the room.

196
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,380
Basically this is it in terms of little figures and stuff.

197
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:12,150
So when you look at access to care, access to surgery, you know, in a high income country, most people are going to get care.

198
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,800
You're in a low income country. Most people are not going to get care.

199
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,340
And this is how the numbers break down. It's good to be in a high income country.

200
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:29,000
I can tell you so much information. I have a daughter with chronic illness, which is another when I said life happens.

201
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,280
And you never know if she wants to go to that right now.

202
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:38,320
No, it's looking like those in school and I just got back from a trip and everyone there was like they haven't seen her.

203
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:42,820
And that's a big deal for someone who comes from a community or a very communal.

204
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,480
And for her to know how to see somebody's extended family, that's huge.

205
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:54,280
Like my daughter was to go to Ghana and then get sick. My husband would die in Ghana to see some of the chronic health issues as.

206
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:07,230
It's a big deal. Okay. So even in Ghana, assuming you have the finances and insurance to pay for the care, even then it's difficult to get insurance.

207
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:15,750
Yeah. So the thing about a lot of the low and middle income countries organized in that middle space between lower and lower middle income,

208
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:25,820
that health care is concentrated in some areas like the big cities, but most of the country doesn't have access to good care at all to specific.

209
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:30,650
And we have a pay out of pocket system, which I'll talk about a little bit more.

210
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,160
So some things are covered by insurance. Most things are not covered by insurance.

211
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,890
If you've got money, you can get some way, then you can have things covered.

212
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:49,920
Yes. Can you provide insight on this or this, General?

213
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:58,320
In certain densities between 2.13 to 1.57, you said your your time on call.

214
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,460
You just didn't because you were available. But you're.

215
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,770
Your time would not go into that. That number,

216
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:13,410
the number of the 5.2 genocides per 100,000 the your time billable that ones

217
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:19,230
that really is that like because that would go into the density in the country.

218
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:25,380
Yes this country. So what I mean by that is the example I was given there was I am a colorectal surgeon.

219
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,750
I take care of some general surgery stuff.

220
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:35,770
I am counted as a colorectal surgeon here in the US instead of the general surgery, not as a general surgeon, because I'm highly specialized now.

221
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:43,400
So I do my take of general surgery cases and so that doesn't go into the density and not impact of that US did see.

222
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:53,370
So my point though was that the number of available surgeons taking care of general surgery cases is probably more what is being reported with that,

223
00:21:53,370 --> 00:22:00,930
more being the amount has been delivered to people here in the US potentially depending on where they are.

224
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:10,350
The thing is, most of the specialists in urban areas and because I do about a quarter of what I do,

225
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,590
is that the robots that depend on the robots and they do.

226
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:22,810
P So that means that I have to be in a big academic center, that kind buy me $1,000,000 robot to do my surgery.

227
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:29,760
And so that limits highly specialized subspecialty surgeons to urban areas.

228
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:34,230
The general surgeons are going to be even even in a rural area.

229
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:42,620
So they are going to be the first point of care people for a lot of folks and as a general surgeon in the U.S. is not quite so surgeon in the U.S.

230
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:48,970
So think about it. So what I do, I'm going to I'm going to help take care of patients.

231
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,690
I'm going to help take care of patients in centralized areas.

232
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:58,240
So the same thing in Ghana. So they are general said and they've done a good job training general surgeons.

233
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:04,570
The general surgeons at all the big city centers in the teaching hospitals there are

234
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:11,229
not in the district hospitals of their towns because they don't have all the supplies.

235
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,860
Do the work that I need to do. I need an operating room.

236
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,750
I need an equipment. I need nurses to take care of the patients.

237
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,810
So there's a whole system thing that comes with that.

238
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,070
And if you're unable to provide all that additional stuff,

239
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:35,020
then put in someone in a rural area actually does get a disadvantage because when it tends to the cane training to do.

240
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:48,389
Yes. Is there like a systematic schedule in some of these, like teaching hospitals where the local surgeons do clinics in these outpost rural areas?

241
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:56,850
Or is that what is the availability that they have, the capacity they have to take time out of their schedule to travel to do that.

242
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:02,310
So each country is a little bit different, and I can only speak for what happens in Ghana.

243
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:12,480
So what happens usually is that people come to the center because the volume even at the center is so huge that it's hard to go out.

244
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:21,560
The other thing, which we don't usually talk a lot about, is reimbursement of payment for services that are granted.

245
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:29,470
So you go through all your training, you get done as a physician unless a surgeon, and then you're not being paid much.

246
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:33,150
So most of them can't take care of their families, extended families.

247
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,140
So a lot of them, if they have extra time going to private clinics.

248
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,620
So there's a lot of either they want a private hospital or clinic.

249
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,240
It won't be a hospital clinic.

250
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:57,110
All they do for we have a lot of foreigners who have set up shops in different parts of Ghana and they offer this because it's a fee for service.

251
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:03,490
So you look for it. So if you have money, you could make a lot of money out of that, but people paying.

252
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:11,050
And so some of the surgeons moonlights or do extra shifts, then they won't go to the communities.

253
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:16,370
What the government does in general is that people do national service.

254
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:24,430
I don't know who's head up of the National Service statistical. So when you get done with your school in like when you get done with college

255
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:31,720
U.S. for a year or two to a rural assignment and then you serve in that space.

256
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,089
Then I say you finish your national service,

257
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:40,030
you come back and then you do additional training and as part of the additional training to get sent house again.

258
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:47,350
So they can also if you're training in Ghana, you go to your equivalent of medical school.

259
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,350
When you get out of medical school, we go to service two years. You come back in three years.

260
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,590
You get like this. You get sent out another two years.

261
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,540
But you come back and you do. You'll finish your training and you get sent out again.

262
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:07,540
And all of those times, us serving in rural areas where you don't have any supervision.

263
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:17,049
And that is he when on the job and that's what people want is a lot of complications of talking

264
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:22,780
to the folks who are doing that and that's one of the things that was a stress and into because

265
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:28,389
a lot of times you are doing and then in on the job because there's such a huge need and those

266
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:32,140
that would be equivalent to what you're describing terms of going out to those rural areas.

267
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:36,400
They do have people who go out. They're just students.

268
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,270
And they are providing the kids that.

269
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:46,210
And then over time, they learn some skills that they come back, get more success and a little bit of refinement and it gets sent out again.

270
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:50,710
And most of them, when they do not want to go live in a rural area.

271
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:59,080
If I asked you to go live in a place where you live in a mud house with a tin roof, and that's where you and your kids are supposed to be together.

272
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,090
Even though you're a surgeon, I does. They can convince most of you to do that.

273
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:11,220
I mean, there's a reason I'm not in the AP. I wouldn't go that one.

274
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,680
That's opportunities. But my kids also need access to great medical care for my daughter, too.

275
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,030
That's not in the campaign. I wouldn't go there like that.

276
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,650
So there are these tensions with the government. There's been talk about.

277
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,660
Giving money and people extra money. But how much do you pay someone?

278
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:37,180
How much can you pay them to forgo the community or wherever they are living to go

279
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:42,430
live in some remote place and not have all the other resources to go along with that?

280
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:51,700
Are you going to send in this? I mean, this is how you build a new hospital with antibiotics, access to stuff they get sick with taking care of them.

281
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:55,990
That's a whole nother level to it that goes into play that we don't talk about enough.

282
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,729
But those are great questions. Keep them coming. So these are just like the website.

283
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:07,180
So this is breaking it down in a bigger picture way so you can see.

284
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,090
And on this they tell us from 2010.

285
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:16,330
So you might have heard from some of your clients about the epidemiological shift that was seen in a lot of developing

286
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:23,889
countries where we initially had all these communicable diseases that NIH was investing a lot of money into there.

287
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:27,520
How do we get rid of HIV, tuberculosis, malaria?

288
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:31,180
And then we're seeing as people becoming a lot more Westernized.

289
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:38,070
When I was in Ghana, it was MTV and the T and the baby jeans which were like bolted on the bottom.

290
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:43,989
Yeah. I mean, that was the thing, you know, and we're like, Wow, this is how the US builds culture out there.

291
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:51,190
And you watch TV shows. All the movies I watch about New York with rats in the subway, they eat too, and petrified of milk.

292
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:56,250
So now it's like really sad and convinced that that would be to India.

293
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:05,260
But that was what was great about that. And now when I was recently in Ghana, the cool thing to do is go get a burger.

294
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:14,530
I had my young nieces come by and we were like, this got a new food options on it, and all they wanted to do was a burger or pizza.

295
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:21,100
That is like the cool thing to do now because we've had so many as the global exposure, there's so much good.

296
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:30,610
So it's not only like in terms of culture and norms and stuff that we are shipping out of the TV and like the programing, Twitter and stuff.

297
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:35,860
There's also the theme of cardio cardiovascular diseases.

298
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:41,830
We've seen more this. People are not used to like eating all this stuff and then just started.

299
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:49,899
Now what people have office jobs they have cause I went down and Marriott has a hotel in the Gulf and had the same experience.

300
00:29:49,900 --> 00:30:02,650
You have an American side. It is like a faculty student, but if you didn't know anything about it, you could get that same experience in Ghana.

301
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:11,290
That was not the case several years ago. So you have people who have desk jobs, the same issues that are happening here and happen and that.

302
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,540
But they don't have the health kids that my dad has never seen a primary care provider.

303
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,580
It doesn't know what his cholesterol is.

304
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:25,780
He is eating more saturated fats since then and all this because I has to cut it takes an it.

305
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,980
You know, everybody has a back in the day.

306
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,450
I used to my dad used to say you used to walk like two, 3 hours to get to school is not working two, 3 hours anymore.

307
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,700
And his diet has completely changed.

308
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:45,450
These are like, you know, a habitat could have been any point in time because we don't have any systems to check that.

309
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:55,110
So now we've seen this huge shift to non-communicable diseases in a lot of lower middle income countries because they are becoming a global village.

310
00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:03,210
And that's one of the negative things. That is a lot of positive things about us all coming together and doing some cool stuff together.

311
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:10,959
Before COVID affected the nation, a lot of agencies were moving towards investing in communicable diseases.

312
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,520
So what do we do about this? How do we build systems around that?

313
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:21,660
Doing challenging physicians and public health providers. How do we create systems to counter this thing that we can see?

314
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:24,870
We know from U.S. history how this is going to end up.

315
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:29,880
So how do we create some solutions now and incorporate happen?

316
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:36,990
And I would be reminded that some diseases are huge, especially in the global village where people can travel.

317
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,380
And so that's something we need to think about both of those things at the same time.

318
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,900
But this just shows you the stark numbers.

319
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:50,100
So when you think about HIV, TB and malaria, which are one of the top three infections that have seen in 2010,

320
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:58,770
these are the number of people who are dying from those compared to the number who are dying from such issues that are going untreated.

321
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:04,150
And that's why there's this huge movement to recognize surgery as a public health.

322
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:08,610
And because prior to that, it was all infectious diseases.

323
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:15,990
I have friends who were in school at MPH, is doing infectious disease stuff with the FDA,

324
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,680
and I think the CDC could be one of them, but that's what they do.

325
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,070
They go into different things and they have seen their diseases.

326
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:31,080
But now there's a huge natural surge century being the unrecognized public health issue because of these numbers.

327
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:39,600
Yes. You think there's a focus on infectious diseases because the cost of intervention is lower, like a surgery.

328
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,450
You would have to build an entire clinic and everything that goes with it.

329
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:50,040
You know, like sort of like malaria, like the fact that the treatments and the investment for an intervention seems to be much larger for surgery.

330
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:58,020
Yeah, I absolutely agree with you. It's you know, I think the two parts of that initially we were not thinking about surgery at all.

331
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:08,430
Surgery was seen more as a lucrative. The people who have that's what is this more like not a need or something that everyone should get access to,

332
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,230
whereas infectious stuff was seen as something that impacts everyone.

333
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:19,710
And so that was an issue to begin with. But now that we've even recognize I said to that surgery as an issue, there is that cost differential.

334
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:27,060
So if I was to ask for, I would talk about one project we're doing in Ghana around colorectal cancer screening,

335
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,190
the cost of having to screen someone and then if they need a surgery,

336
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:37,410
doing that doesn't make ten times more than what you would do if it was a malaria net.

337
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,600
And so there is that.

338
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:48,870
And so trying to ask for an NIH grant, we're writing that grant and then we're asking for $10 million for this study is unlikely.

339
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:51,840
Someone's going to give me $10 million for this at all.

340
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:59,910
They might give $100,000 to do bednets and something somewhere or think about clean water or like luxuries and stuff.

341
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:05,160
But this is huge money we're talking about. So there is something to be said about that in terms of the costs.

342
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:14,129
And I would suspect also and correct me if I'm wrong, I would suspect for under-fives it's more infection than surgical issues.

343
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:17,640
And there's such a weight placed on under-five life saved.

344
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:22,860
And you also spoken about. That's a bit more on that.

345
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:30,300
Yes, that is very true, that all the Sustainable Development Goals have focused on maternal fetal health,

346
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:34,530
which was a huge issue and continues to be a huge issue.

347
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:42,299
But the points where some of these more adult issues were not paid attention to and

348
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,350
if you think about my son in Ghana and I'll come back to that again at some point,

349
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:50,370
until recently it was like 50, 57.

350
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:54,240
So your life average lifespan was 50, 57.

351
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:59,610
Most cancers we know we start screening when you 1050 something.

352
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:08,490
So then by the time you set screening for someone's already dead, just based on the sicknesses around them and now it's 65.

353
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,720
So it's gone up a little bit, but not that much we think about here in the US.

354
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:17,550
One of the patients I saw today who said because those 85% did surgery on him,

355
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:25,530
you have another patient is 97 and he said you're on his because he's been with that lifespan his much longer.

356
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:34,979
And so we can do different things. But if you have a country where people are dying in younger age and it makes sense to focus

357
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:41,490
some of your efforts that earlier years because we're going to get more bang for your buck.

358
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,180
Okay.

359
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:52,150
So the projection is that and if you don't mind letting me know how I'm doing on time, if I'm getting it, just let me know over half an hour, okay?

360
00:35:53,650 --> 00:36:01,600
The projection is that from the last set, 20, 30 thing that we need this number of people to like even come not in terms of meet every need,

361
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:09,670
but get to a point where we are saying that, okay, we've reached some equity here where people who need basic essential surgery.

362
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,790
So we're not talking about fancy cosmetic surgery.

363
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,950
It's just basic, essential stuff like getting it.

364
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:23,940
And you can see when they talk about this, they also throwing the anesthesiologist because the agent said, you help me with anesthetic on board.

365
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:28,830
And then we also those suspicions are also considered part of that surgical team.

366
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,660
So I'm going to shift that a little bit and tell you about the work I'm doing in

367
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:39,299
Ghana so that we sort of like take you from up there to sort of like a case study,

368
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,510
as I'm calling it. So this is colorectal cancer, this one.

369
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:48,150
Scope it all. So this has got I've been talking about that, too.

370
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:53,470
And I recognize that not everyone knows where Ghana is, but this is the map of Africa.

371
00:36:53,860 --> 00:37:00,009
And Ghana is on the West Coast, visited by a bunch of French countries.

372
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:04,510
And so we're supposed to learn how to speak French by going to the IBM plantation.

373
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:09,520
So in other classes, because I can speak French, but this is gone and this is the colors.

374
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,500
Some of you may know because the World Cup is World Cup season.

375
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:20,500
This is true football, not football, but supposedly a boat with a ball.

376
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:29,860
And I saw this picture of just the rubber band. And it's those of you who remember 2010 when Ghana beat the US.

377
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,240
It was huge. I wasn't done at the time, this thing, and it was huge.

378
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,650
The president declared a national holiday. Yes. So we had a lot more things that you was.

379
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:45,280
So this is a big deal, but we hope that we have the opportunity to get to see it.

380
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,489
But I think that's a game Ghana is playing tomorrow.

381
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:51,940
So we'll see. The U.S. is still in it. We'll see how that goes.

382
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:58,000
But this is a little country, I think about 30, 30 million people.

383
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,330
It was the first game independence in the continent.

384
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,110
It's been fortunate after we had a series of coups.

385
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:16,780
We've been fortunate to have had relative peace and no coups over my entire lifetime, which I tell my kids, I'm 25.

386
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:23,350
So again, over that timeframe, we haven't had any so has been peaceful.

387
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:29,620
Well, that's meant also is that we've had the fortune of having a lot of global investment.

388
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:37,670
A lot of students and a bunch of people come into college to work because it's also this cultural stuff too.

389
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:46,730
With all the Russia with names that happened in the U.S., we had a lot of folks who are from the African diaspora go back to Ghana.

390
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:51,050
Part of that was because a lot of slave castles there.

391
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:58,870
And so there's a reason people go down because of the slave trade and know that.

392
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,520
So I'm going to share and I ask for permission from the family before sharing this.

393
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:13,530
So as I mentioned earlier on, I see myself as a translator, a communicator of some sort, and I'll read some of these aspects to you.

394
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:17,150
Some of them are medical terms, and so they might not fully understand.

395
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:23,660
But basically, this is a lady who was a senior of mine in high school.

396
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:29,180
I don't know her personally, but she reaches out to me through WhatsApp.

397
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:33,690
If you're doing anything in public health and you plan on going out there,

398
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:39,950
get WhatsApp because that's the best you can make phone calls, you know, figure chats and stuff and it doesn't cost you a thing.

399
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:44,360
So get WhatsApp. That's how everyone in the outside the U.S. communicates.

400
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:52,459
Okay. So WhatsApp. And so she sends me this message, said her dad, who is 80 years old, lives in Ghana in the capital.

401
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:56,030
So going to your question. So lives in Accra, Accra Capital.

402
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:04,040
He's been having pain. She said, you know, he has a history of diverticulitis and that's just when your colon gets angry.

403
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,030
And in schools that usually treated of antibiotics and then it goes away.

404
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,580
And she said, make me his hemoglobin since blood levels have been dropping.

405
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,670
He went, From what I talked to, you went from like walking to like fallen.

406
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:23,160
And so then was in a wheelchair over the course of two weeks. And, you know, they were a little bit worried.

407
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:27,630
They had talked to a doctor, so they managed to go to a doctor.

408
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:31,350
The lady is in the U.S., so she has resources.

409
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:36,730
So she's paying for all of these things. And then his hemoglobin was six.

410
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:41,159
They managed to talk to someone who got him a CT scan, and his hemoglobin was six.

411
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:48,560
So she sent me the results of the city. And basically the most important thing here is they said this the diverticulitis.

412
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,899
They said, but they see in the ascending colon.

413
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,139
So that we have colon is it looks like a tube profile.

414
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:58,450
It's like a tube plus me a mile to your stomach.

415
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:01,560
That's your small exercise is one of the signs going for your colon.

416
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:05,670
And it starts from the right side. So your appendix kind of stuff.

417
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:09,420
And that's why we have an appendix, Amy. But it goes up.

418
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:17,550
Who goes? It sends like Six Flags and then it goes across and then get out on screens and it comes out.

419
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:26,549
And so that's how they do the setup. So on that right side, that ascending piece, there was this massive scene, this thing that I describe,

420
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:33,620
and they say seven centimeters and then the whole bowel, it's almost like soap looks like a hose.

421
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:37,830
If someone puts pressure on it and lumen or the open opening collapses.

422
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:40,860
So this you know, the seat is good. This woman is clueless.

423
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:46,679
So then based on that, they go for a colonoscopy, which makes sense.

424
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:52,020
That's what we would do here. So they are following the standard of care, the same procedure we'll do here,

425
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:58,680
the steps we're doing here, because she has some money she's paying, everything is out of pocket.

426
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:03,510
So this C.T. scan is someone is paying money because it's not covered by the health insurance.

427
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:10,290
So they get a colonoscopy. And if you look at it, beets, they are able to pull it off real quickly because in Ghana,

428
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:17,460
a lot of stuff that you get is who knows who and who is calling in favors, which also addresses the disparities in their access to care.

429
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:26,490
And to some extent, it happens here, too. If you know someone, you can get a private room in the hospital.

430
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,860
You could get a CT scan on a weekend, even though so this happens.

431
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:38,610
Yeah. I don't want to paint a picture that this is all developing lower income and the unfairness in the system.

432
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,730
This happens here, too. If you know, someone can move.

433
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:53,050
If you've got money, you can access all. So they got a colonoscopy and this person read it as well.

434
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,280
Everything's fine. Just hemorrhoids has a dive is good.

435
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,950
They looked at the hepatic site, shed their ethnically and it was all normal.

436
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:07,390
You got to see. This is like Kansas release stuff.

437
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:16,090
So got this number drawn and is 14.4 and the reference rate of range that they use is 0 to 3.

438
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:25,840
So that's high. Makes no sense with the normal colonoscopy that some will have cancer numbers that are so off the chart.

439
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,430
The DOT said, it's always like, Oh, this is nothing.

440
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:36,890
Probably just anemia. Anemia as a general, time is roughly usually done in the face.

441
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,979
Malaria. Everything is fine.

442
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:46,360
I get treated, of course, which is part of the reason we have multi-resistant antibiotic resistance and stuff there, but everything's smothered.

443
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,750
So they, like I said, anemia. And so they said it was fine.

444
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:56,300
So she says she's educated here in the U.S., she said.

445
00:43:56,810 --> 00:44:00,530
So she got a quick test. There was no mass, as the city suggested.

446
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:06,570
I am just a bit concerned because of the discrepancy or what do I know?

447
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,010
So she is not medicine at all, but she is saying hold up.

448
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:17,160
The city says seven centimeters something. This man went for a walk in tonight in a wheelchair.

449
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:20,700
Hemoglobin is six. Jackasses bleed.

450
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:31,200
That's one of the things if you are above 40 able to see a PCP and you haven't bloody used to it is a cancer until proven otherwise.

451
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,520
That is something that is a general lesson you learn as a medical student.

452
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:41,190
Is cancer until proven otherwise? If you are past the age of 40, this hemoglobin is six.

453
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,640
His see a cancer numbers are up. These things are not talking.

454
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:50,640
And this is someone who has money and has been able to access this system.

455
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:56,490
But clearly, something is off. So they asked to someone told her to reach out to me.

456
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,040
I can tell you that in a month I might get 2 to 3 of these.

457
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:07,890
Through various channels where people are like, I know U.S. surgeon, I know you from somewhere.

458
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,170
Do you mind taking a look at this for me? Half of the time there things I have no idea about.

459
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:16,530
And so then I find someone I know and say, Hey, can you take a look?

460
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:23,030
So that's that's sort of the case. And I'm going to give you some background about colorectal cancers.

461
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:29,980
So it's diagnosable 1 million people, second most commonly caused in females and then in men.

462
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,570
2030 expected that the numbers are going to go up.

463
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:40,350
And it's the fifth most common cancer in sub-Saharan Africa.

464
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:46,300
And we are expecting that death and mobility is going to be highest in low middle income countries.

465
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:50,620
For the reasons I explained about, we are eating more Western food.

466
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,870
We are not moving as much. So we are seeing all the risk factors.

467
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:02,560
Diabetes, heart disease, cholesterol, smoking, everything is going up.

468
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:09,060
And so we are seeing more of these and we don't have any screening. This is from Kenya.

469
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:17,620
And I know I hear that you did some reading from Dr. Walsh's work that you're doing around artificial intelligence and came in and said,

470
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:24,780
Dr. Walsh and I get to putting on some. So this is one of the studies that we looked at in terms of developing some of our research in Kenya.

471
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:34,350
But what is basically shows is a trend between the U.S. and Kenya, which we don't have a lot of data from developing countries.

472
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,810
They're very sporadic, descriptive stuff.

473
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:45,110
So sometimes we take from one place and we try and extrapolated to another place that has a very similar sort of GDP or similar stats.

474
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:52,100
This what we know in Kenya. U.S. is in blue Kansas and red U.S. numbers coming down.

475
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:59,780
KEENAN Numbers are going up. What is striking is that in Kenya, cancer is happening even at younger ages.

476
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,160
So this is not a 40, 50 year screening kind of thing.

477
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:11,930
The youngest person was 14 years old. No family history, no personal respect is never smoked.

478
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:18,140
There's nothing nothing genetic. But we have seen young people and this has been replicated in other African countries.

479
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:23,660
What you're seeing young people for, I'm curious themselves so is trying to try to think is a diet.

480
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:27,600
It is environmental. Is this something about that?

481
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:31,969
The only U.S. studies to see rectal cancer in younger people.

482
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:38,850
You might have heard about that. But we have seen cancer folks in their thirties and forties.

483
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:46,070
They're trying to figure out, is this dietary. It shows those cues more for African-Americans, black patients.

484
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:51,650
So is there something about an ancestral hereditary stuff that is linked to that?

485
00:47:52,190 --> 00:48:00,050
They've done previous work around breast cancer. That is a triple negative breast cancer, which gives you a very high risk.

486
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:07,520
A very aggressive type. And they found that people in West Africa a high risk for triple negative.

487
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:13,670
Similar similarly to black skin in the US. And that makes sense when you think about slavery.

488
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:19,070
Ancestral. So now we tend to think, is this something about colorectal cancer?

489
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:23,060
As a saying, why are we seeing black folks in their thirties?

490
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,600
Is it a screening thing? But we don't start screening until 50.

491
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:33,890
But based on all of that, we've changed us clean. And that influence amounts of 4525 is the new 50.

492
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:41,660
So when you come in and get in this process, 45 here, but you can see this data here,

493
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:48,740
this basically says if you come in with early stage cancer, that's cancer that has not spread everywhere.

494
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:54,740
In Kenya, most people still end up dying.

495
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:01,959
Over five years. And if you come in with advanced disease, then you definitely advices these.

496
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:06,220
Is this and the stage one or early disease? This is data from Ghana.

497
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:11,040
So this is the U.S. numbers stage.

498
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:19,280
So stage one is cancer is in was stunted. It has its first stage three is the Kansas end, the lymph nodes, the Kansas trying to get there.

499
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:23,020
It started traveling out of this podium here. So it's on its way.

500
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:31,540
Stage one, stage two is still in the podium. If we are able to catch losses in the podium in the US, I do a surgery.

501
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:34,840
I take that out. That's it. You're cancer free.

502
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:40,870
If it's in the lymph nodes. So it's already moved from here and it's starting to spread in your body.

503
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:45,790
Here in the US, I do a surgery take out. What is that? We give you chemotherapy.

504
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:50,589
72% of people will be alive in five years. You can be cancer free.

505
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:56,410
We can make it cancer free. Or even a stage three colorectal cancer in the US.

506
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,360
A stage for the cancer is in the liver. Is in the lungs.

507
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:06,220
Here in the US, I can take a stage for patients, which I had one to do.

508
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:12,160
And then we can do surgery. We can give you chemotherapy. And 14% of people.

509
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:15,630
I don't know if you realize the magnitude of that to see.

510
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:21,860
Take some of the stage four cancer, which was a death sentence several years ago when I was in medical school.

511
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:28,760
To put those people in hospice. Now of those 20% to be alive in five years, that's huge.

512
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:45,760
Now, look at the numbers for Ghana. Someone comes in with stage two cancer, has a mood, hasn't spread it in the colon, only 34% as a surgeon.

513
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:51,190
That makes me sad. Where does the whole private jet trade?

514
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:56,110
Because I do associate take that out of the school and then they can get this place.

515
00:50:56,110 --> 00:51:03,240
So the access issues. Most people go to the stage three and how the numbers become is beautiful.

516
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:06,600
No one is alive and five is still dying.

517
00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:12,760
In Ghana, 60% of the patients that come in with stage four.

518
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:16,360
So they tend someone who shows up. It's already spread.

519
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:23,950
You go to a clinic and you see folks of breast cancer, which is visibly growing out of the address.

520
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:32,230
You can see that around and especially women tend to gather will surprise you throughout my medical training as well into patients

521
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:40,630
that you would know because of what they couldn't get time off from work because they take time off the way they can get to a table.

522
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,830
So they know something is growing, they feel it, they know it.

523
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:52,600
But then think about their family and even the kid who don't come in until is such a weekend.

524
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:57,010
What is causing them so much pain? And then they come in.

525
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:02,860
We have folks who come in with stage four cancer who have been bleeding,

526
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:11,469
but they can't get to a place to get a colonoscopy or no one tells them they should get a colonoscopy or they see a

527
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:19,440
primary care provider in a rural place who tells them they have a temporary and keeps them put and hemorrhoid cream on it.

528
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:24,100
But what they really have is the awareness of cancer that's gotten so big and is going out of the ordinary.

529
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:29,820
It. And by the time the cancer was already spread and this is here in the U.S., in Michigan.

530
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:39,570
So when we talk about disparities or global health problems, you think about it too in Ghana is huge because can have a lack of focus.

531
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,060
This is happening here in Michigan because of all these disparities.

532
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:50,220
Some race, some socioeconomic. This is what you had to do.

533
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:55,050
Well, I thought was the moment and then.

534
00:52:55,060 --> 00:53:00,450
But for the five years, you're all great. I thought it was 0%.

535
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:05,500
I just think it's wondering, considering the disparities that occurred,

536
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:12,540
how successful is it to actually target or diagnose somebody with stage four colorectal cancer?

537
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:16,740
Yeah. So the topic is some of this is autopsies.

538
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,570
So if they I think they've passed away.

539
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:26,970
But usually if you have stage four causes, liver and some severe come in and some of them will have probably lesions so under the stage.

540
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:37,310
Some kind of pulmonary issues because it has occupied timelines and there has been things that have been vicious within that silence that those.

541
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:42,670
And then when they are bleeding and bleeding, if they do get to a stage, it sometimes it can pick up on that.

542
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:46,870
So is it also presenting with some other health issue?

543
00:53:48,500 --> 00:54:01,720
I don't know. I don't know how crazy it is actually come up with a value that it would save for the complications due to the colorectal cancer.

544
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:05,750
Yeah. So the thing about clearances, so I'm saying is zero.

545
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,230
That means that they are not alive by mistake by the time they were diagnosed.

546
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:17,390
How many of them are alive in five years? And everyone who was diagnosed with stage four is dead within that timeframe.

547
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,750
So those are the people who are coming to work.

548
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:29,850
And the reason why people die or in some cases settlement is the cancer goes and the liver can't do the work it's supposed to do.

549
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:32,190
So they end up with 7 billion.

550
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:39,979
And so they end up with like Stone Roses, almost like when you need a liver transplant situation is that they have pulmonary disease.

551
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:45,660
So they are breathing becomes an issue, if you like. Some of it is political incitement to a degree.

552
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:55,670
And then the thing that we worry about it a lot of the reason I'm all on an inspired because cancer is because the cancer fills the tube.

553
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:58,950
Remember to think about your existence as a pipe.

554
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:07,090
So when something fills that up and things kind of move through it anymore, it's almost like someone's put your foot on the horse.

555
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:11,380
It fills. It fills. Nothing is going to.

556
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:20,710
And then your bell can actually be fixed. So they end up with a penetration in septic shock and then get.

557
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:27,880
So typically that's what we see is that they regress either they die from their local disease has

558
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:34,250
gotten so big that it loss of the tube or they die from the disease spreading across the border.

559
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:46,240
So as I was going through my training and then into kind of the rest of it and then and more about what's going on in Ghana,

560
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:51,930
feeling guilty, brain drain, brain banks, their sense of what is my responsibility?

561
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:59,610
Yet again, we have six colorectal surgeons. All of us double trained in general in colorectal.

562
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:04,790
My better here I learn better. You gonna help him out with some of these numbers that we've seen?

563
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:12,380
I have all this training and so this is very interested in around colorectal cancer screening efforts.

564
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:19,490
Part of this also is driven by the Ghana Ministry of Health and a lot of institutions also serving like they need help.

565
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,780
When you think about global surgery or global health partnerships,

566
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:33,410
I find that it works best when it is instituted or created by the local people to see what is that need is saying this is what we need help with.

567
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:40,530
And I was very fortunate when I set up Michigan, the Ghana Ministry of Health had reached out to we need help set in colorectal to prevent this,

568
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:44,360
you know, taking care of this crisis that we have seen. So it aligns perfectly.

569
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,280
How much time? 24 minutes. Okay. Now I'll go through this this quickly.

570
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,280
So this is the screening guidelines in the US.

571
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:57,499
So this from 2016, we can either check your poop, just break up blood in your poop.

572
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:02,030
If you've got blood in your poop, then we can get a colonoscopy. So those are still based tests.

573
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:07,970
So they take a little piece and then put it on and they put a little bit of the chemical on and it changes color.

574
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:14,930
Or we say let's do a colonoscopy. So it could have a colonoscopy as prevention and as pure kind of thing.

575
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:19,900
So if we see something that's quality, we can take the polyp such that it never becomes a cancer.

576
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:28,850
So the whole process, the stool based stuff, usually we are picking the cancer because we can't actually prevent in that case.

577
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,880
So when we see the hope, though, is that we're putting the test out.

578
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:39,140
So that is why we push that here in the U.S. when you think about the sciences and access,

579
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:46,280
a lot of people well socioeconomic underrepresented minorities get screened as to basis because

580
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:51,450
it's easier because male this is someone's house it's like a call got advertised on TV.

581
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:55,010
You get in your house, you do it, you send it back. You do this all the time.

582
00:57:55,370 --> 00:58:00,739
The saddest thing I have to see is patients who come into my clinic who said I was so good doctor.

583
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:05,330
I did everything they told me to do and I still ended up with cancer and get so

584
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:09,350
frustrated because they don't understand that this is not a preventative measure.

585
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:15,050
This is a screening for every cancer. And then if it's got cancer, we intervene.

586
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:20,060
Here is a preventative axis. If you can get all of us.

587
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:24,020
Could be. It prevents cancer. These are the recommendations.

588
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:30,620
This is their recommendation in Ghana. So they've got a ministry of Health actually has guidelines around rectal cancer screening.

589
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:40,210
And they say 50 to 70 years old. Yet still, this test is a stool based test as a positive thing in an endoscopy.

590
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:49,090
I'll point out something else here. Until recently, our life average lifespan was 50 in the early fifties.

591
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:57,130
To have a policy that is centered at 50 to 70 when most of your population has died before, that makes no sense.

592
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:03,040
This was taken wholesale from the policies that we have here in the US.

593
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:10,300
I am going to guess that well-meaning people have got around the table and said We need to deal with cancer screening.

594
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:17,230
We need to come up with a political policy. This is what we have in other places, school institutes, a similar sort of thing.

595
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:22,510
That's what I would like to guess. I would be thinking about how inform and that.

596
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:26,960
So when you go out to do your public health, think about that.

597
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:34,400
We get so passionate about wanting to help that we forget that it has to be within the local context.

598
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:41,390
Identify B to figure out what the ups and downs, what does it look like on the ground?

599
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:47,780
You've all asked great questions about access resources, and that all has to be factored in.

600
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:54,290
If you have a policy that says 50 to 70 people come blood tests and endoscopy after that,

601
00:59:54,740 --> 01:00:01,130
but you don't have enough endoscopy centers to take care of that, then you really have to help this whole process.

602
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:08,030
This is a system no one can really follow. Right now, the average lifespan is 60 something years old.

603
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,610
So until that age range is over,

604
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:17,870
you want a screening test that allows you to take care of your catchment more so you can intervene and give people more life,

605
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,710
not less screening tests that you do at the end of someone's life said.

606
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,880
We went to Ghana and for one of the big teaching hospitals,

607
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:36,549
the second biggest teaching hospital would be like going to Michigan and talking to the surgeons and the GI doctors and a bunch of folks in Ghana.

608
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:46,870
We had 11 systems in the 33 million population and that gives you some sense of what the need in this GI place.

609
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:52,570
Second biggest teaching hospital centers, this country and neighboring countries.

610
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:55,840
So some of the folks from other countries come here for their kids.

611
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:00,639
They had full colonoscopy machines were there two years ago.

612
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,760
Three of them had broken down. They had one machine that was working.

613
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,690
So they had one machine, they had one school.

614
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:11,310
They had run out of the biopsy, forceps and stuff.

615
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,920
So they were cleaning it in-house and we used it it.

616
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:19,590
So you know that from an infection standpoint that is like terrible.

617
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:27,180
So that was the local situation as the second biggest teaching hospital in the country.

618
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:34,040
And they have a good position that we ask all the surgeons, all the geneticists from the PC piece,

619
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:40,650
what you are with and Ministry of Health has guidelines around flu because no one knew about it.

620
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:49,070
None of the providers knew about it. And then this again was another lesson around public health or global health stuff.

621
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:52,280
It's not enough to just create the documents.

622
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:58,070
I think we've gotten so good about creating documents, giving people high fives and think it would've made a difference.

623
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:06,860
You'd have to take them and implemented and then there has to be some sustainability around that because you can implement and say,

624
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:13,760
We've got this going on and you walk away and then whatever you did, if you don't keep on going because it isn't working.

625
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:16,280
What are some of the issues? It's going to fail.

626
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:26,150
Someone invested and bought them all us copy machines only once they run out of snares, they can do this stuff.

627
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:34,430
The person who invested hasn't come back to see that it's not really working and so make sure that it's not just a policy statement.

628
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,520
None of the doctors had undergone any screening,

629
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:43,490
even though the idea was and none of them had told a patient that they needed to go have any kind of screening.

630
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:47,150
So the Ministry of Health has a document. It's not translated.

631
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:51,770
We asked them what they thought, what were the reasons why people are not going?

632
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:58,579
And we looked down into system level and patient level practice and a lot of these assistant level issues, they don't have the resources.

633
01:02:58,580 --> 01:02:59,540
They don't know how to do this.

634
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:07,130
And I mean, even if you found people who had plus they don't have people to even do the follow up test and a screening costs too much.

635
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:15,830
So to give you an example, this fee out of pocket so then to has a national health insurance system the taxes people pay on food

636
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:22,520
and services goes into that breast cancer is covered under the national health insurance system,

637
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:27,470
from mammograms to surgery to chemotherapy to.

638
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,280
So everything is covered under the national health insurance.

639
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:35,930
They take a van around the villages and they do the screening in their beds.

640
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:43,660
It's amazing what there is a tumor board, an oncology team with a specialist talking about breast cancer.

641
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:53,780
There's someone who is planning chemotherapy and you're like, why isn't this happening for colorectal cancer or for some of the pediatric classes?

642
01:03:54,170 --> 01:04:01,010
Like, we don't have any data. What do you mean by that? So the GI doctor gave us an example.

643
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:05,929
If you were able to get from your home ten, 11 hours away,

644
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:13,310
plus you decided to give up working on your farm for a day to go to the big teaching hospital to get a colonoscopy done.

645
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:19,170
So you got. You have to bring with you your price.

646
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:22,430
You have to buy the crap that they are using to clean out your colon.

647
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:26,070
The insurance covers it. So I go to the pharmacy, I just pick it up.

648
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:29,900
It's painful so that you bring it. You buy it to sell.

649
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:34,550
And then you also bring this information. If you want to be put to sleep.

650
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:38,290
Yeah. We give you a little bit of this. I would make it simple.

651
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:43,040
So you sort of sleep on it could give you Propofol, it can knock you out completely.

652
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:46,160
So it can do the fullness to be the more relaxed you are,

653
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:52,940
the more likely you are going to be able to get to that full colon and see that if you are weak and you're fighting it,

654
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:55,550
is that it's unlikely we're going to be able to finish it.

655
01:04:56,120 --> 01:05:03,830
So you bring in your own medications for U.S. and then you pay for the full anesthesia proceeded as it was doing it.

656
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:09,200
If they see something and they biopsy it, take the biopsy.

657
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:18,250
If you haven't agreed to pay for the biopsies, then the GI doctor said it would wake people up to pull out of school,

658
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:24,160
wake you up, ask you if you've got the money. If you don't have the money they time.

659
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:32,350
If you say biopsy it because you show them you have the money. And then if you just leave, hopefully, but enough medication to put that to sleep.

660
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:39,010
The previously US disclosed the scope biases you have to pay for the bags to be read by the pathologists.

661
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:44,290
If you don't pay for the bags expressed by the pathologist, then that's discarded.

662
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:49,660
They tell you we saw something. You could have a surgery.

663
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:57,120
Can you pay for this surgery? And this is all times away from your loved ones getting money to take those steps.

664
01:05:57,570 --> 01:06:05,550
So when it comes a data thing, that's a problem. The GI doctor said on her watch she thinks she sees a lot of cancers.

665
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:10,380
She doesn't have any data to prove it. You can't just say it looks like a cancer.

666
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:16,290
To get someone to give some treatment doesn't help with the policymakers and the government.

667
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:24,330
The pathology people had a database. They would keep it and they have everything tracked, but it don't see the full range of stuff.

668
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:29,180
The only thing. The people who paid for it. They're very different from the rest.

669
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:36,380
And if you can guess why breast surgery has been so successful, is that because, again, when I talk about that global village,

670
01:06:36,770 --> 01:06:46,070
there's such a huge movement around breast cancer here in the U.S. and internationally, and it's fed into the movements and cost of all Africa.

671
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:55,790
It's amazing to see the amount of money that is being poured in and advocates against the death around breast cancer in India in the US.

672
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:00,920
It is insane. And when you think about breast cancer, it's a big deal.

673
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:12,580
But in terms of the morbidity and mortality, the relative colorectal cancer spreads, but it's been a lot of movement around that that has changed.

674
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:17,010
You guys have so much. Howard.

675
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:24,340
I don't know if you realize how much you do. Even with me, like Lenin and moving along and stuff like that to change,

676
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:31,180
really use your voice and your advocacy to really push pushing this insistence that even what NIH funds.

677
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:36,870
Because it's all driven by demand. You know, like grassroots demands and movements.

678
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:42,240
The thing about as you go through a public health step and I'm just going to skip through these real quickly.

679
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:48,230
So this is what the paper you read from Dr. Waldie. I say this is thinking outside the box.

680
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:57,380
So all the screening stuff, what intelligent people, what we are thinking about and question is how do we use instead of like toothpaste, colonoscopy?

681
01:07:57,710 --> 01:08:02,930
How do we pick up on cancer a little bit that before we even need to do all of those other things?

682
01:08:03,290 --> 01:08:06,650
How do we better detect who should get a colonoscopy and we shouldn't?

683
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:11,510
What I failed to mention is that is, do they tests because they pick up on blood?

684
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:17,690
It could be blood from a cancer, could be blood from a hemorrhoid or diverticulosis or an ulcer.

685
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:21,080
There's no way to know exactly what any of those.

686
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:24,500
All we know is that this bloody goes to maybe cancer.

687
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:29,660
We just don't know. So we then having paper colonoscopy, it can be very, very expensive.

688
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:36,830
So by using blood based tests, we do that for children. You can find out all of these genetic disorders from a blood based test.

689
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:46,960
You could call it the good biopsies. Now hear what it is that using a blood based test to see if they can detect cancer cells.

690
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:52,720
So in blood, all the different breakdown of blood. They see some things up and some things down.

691
01:08:53,020 --> 01:09:01,120
In patients have rectal cancer. You throw that into a machine learning model of prediction, too, which is what Dr. Walsh's works around.

692
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:11,110
And so you throw in a bunch of things age, gender, smoke, all these other risk things, plus the blood cancer, the CBC.

693
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:17,860
And then you can sort of refine and determine what is the likelihood that you might have colorectal cancer.

694
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:26,260
And so then we take in 200 people. We can narrow it down to ten people and say, so now these ten people, let's do a colonoscopy on them.

695
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:37,499
And this is just, again, a little bit more of that. But you can see how the this particular test was interesting because they took the CDC.

696
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:45,659
This is in a Kaiser Permanente system in California and took a CBC and then they tracked people 30 to 65 days

697
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:52,740
and people the test was there and it looked good afterwards and they were able to pick up on the census.

698
01:09:53,520 --> 01:10:01,050
The fact that there was a small case that we before someone was actually detected as having cancer a whole year beforehand.

699
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:11,130
That's amazing because analysis cancer, one stage, one disease potentially and this is all used in a blood test and my tumor.

700
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:16,140
And then pattern recognition, yes or no?

701
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:20,990
That's a good idea. What is the conversation around, like, noninvasive treatment?

702
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:31,590
Yeah. So that's even like a break, you know, if we can catch it as opposed to have a colonoscopy, because that is the least invasive thing.

703
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:39,450
Prevention if you want even beyond that of before that would be like how do we influence dietary education?

704
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:44,910
How do we figure out what all of those like resistance tendencies, stuff, smoking and all those kind of things?

705
01:10:45,330 --> 01:10:52,710
That's definitely what that needs to be done in that regard to reduce the risk of people developing cancer in the first place.

706
01:10:53,310 --> 01:11:02,430
Now, once you get a cancer, the only way to get rid of it is either we take it out of it, out all depending on what cancer it is, get chemotherapy.

707
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:12,799
And this is pattern recognition. So what this is doing is and this is some Dr. Welch's work using a technology similar

708
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,879
to what you have on your cell phone to sort of like look at different patterns,

709
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,150
to predict what looks like a cancer or what doesn't.

710
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:25,140
And this is supposed to address the shortage of technologies in a lot of these places because they don't have.

711
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:30,710
Even if we've got someone who paid for the medical, they wouldn't be able to look at it.

712
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:34,610
The one in Ghana just in the same situation, because that was an issue.

713
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:36,740
The pathologist had been gone for two months.

714
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:44,440
So they had all these samples that were said that even for breast cancer patients who have payment paid by the government,

715
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:50,030
they couldn't go along with treatment because they were waiting for the psychologist to come back from his tumor.

716
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:54,650
But this will allow to address that. So this is finishing up.

717
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:58,440
This is the patient that we saw at the beginning. I think so.

718
01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:07,340
So this he ended up getting. I called my collaborator, my research collaborator, who called a friend.

719
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:14,000
He got another colonoscopy done by someone who had actually been trained in doing colonoscopies.

720
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:16,760
But that's not a thing that happens in a lot of these cases.

721
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:22,160
You have folks who are not trained setting up shop because you can get money out of people.

722
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:28,980
So did it. And he had this massive. He had his surgery.

723
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:34,260
His stage was a stage two cancer.

724
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,959
They looked at full length notes.

725
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:44,120
When you do this, you have to look at 12 lymph nodes is the magic number that it used to see how far the cancer is in for anyone.

726
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:50,190
They took out 15 lymph nodes. We looked at four. So based on that, they said this was a stage two.

727
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:56,970
There was nothing like this here. We need to know what's in because that determines if it's actually stage to a stage three.

728
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,810
You don't know exactly because we haven't looked at all 12.

729
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:05,709
And so this we went back and we're like, why didn't you look? You have 15 minutes.

730
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:06,760
You said, oh, 15.

731
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:16,600
What the pathologist's like he doesn't have time to sit on a microscope for one patient to go through all of those pieces to cut out that answer.

732
01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:24,590
He's got a whole range of stuff he has to do. So for this patient, he's saying, look, before it looks okay.

733
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:29,870
So they decided no chemotherapy. Also, he's old and this is him here.

734
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:33,770
So Doctor doesn't give us permission to lie. So this is the day after surgery.

735
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:37,580
He couldn't pay for pain medication. So this is him.

736
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:44,270
They want no pain medication. Nothing. And it's very different from what we have had in the US in terms of how we manage this.

737
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:48,740
He is back to work in. Living his life.

738
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:56,110
So screening options, just pushing people to think outside of the box.

739
01:13:57,470 --> 01:14:01,340
Well, I've been working out more recently so Clarissa said you fellowship program.

740
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:08,240
So we are in the process. We've reached the last of four levels of getting approval from the government.

741
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:13,040
I hope to have this first fellow in Greece by July of next year.

742
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:20,690
We are going to get in March to do a massive class to train the trainers and then do a needs assessment about equipment that we need to take down.

743
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:24,170
In my way, even though I am not on the ground,

744
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:32,450
I think that is this better night because I found a way to get engaged and in leveraging the resources that I have here,

745
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:37,860
applying for forensic independence of the police to think about the problems that we have on the ground.

746
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:46,970
And my hope is that people will send me WhatsApp messages that they will contact the folks being treated down there to actually take care of them.

747
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:52,740
And this a lot of people I can think I just put them.

748
01:14:52,880 --> 01:15:01,580
I'm so sorry. I feel terrible when I forget someone in give position about like, let's get your resume there.

749
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:05,420
And so then this makes it easier, so to say thank you.

750
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:08,660
And again, I appreciate the attention. I'm not sure if I went overboard.

751
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:11,990
My watch is not working. And if we have any time for whatever.

752
01:15:12,350 --> 01:15:16,130
Oh, 5 minutes. So sorry.

753
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:22,870
I never said anything. Question.

754
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:36,150
Yes. So in the scenario where we're not able to offer patient treatment or the right preventative measures and they have stage one colorectal cancer,

755
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:42,180
how long does it usually take for that to reach stage four or it is a very patient rotation.

756
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:46,889
And that's a great question. I can tell a cancer clinic today has always got patients.

757
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:56,860
Once you know every single person, what they want is prognosis. Socialite, 85 year old lady who's like, What if I just sit there and do nothing?

758
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:00,040
How long do I have to live? I can live like it was two or three years.

759
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:04,980
I'll just sit with my headset. So the thing is sometimes hard to tell.

760
01:16:05,330 --> 01:16:11,150
And as surgeons, as a surgeon, is actually something we are not trained to do as well.

761
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:15,230
We usually have, though, colleges have that very difficult conversation with the patients.

762
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:19,340
Part of it is because a lot of it depends on the tumor type.

763
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:26,090
So we have some cancer cells that so the way a cancer risk for the cancer cell from a normal still and

764
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:32,149
it get an abnormal abnormal and then comes a cancer and then one becomes a cancer is still abnormal.

765
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:41,690
It keeps on changing. The more normal it looks, the less aggressive it is, the more abnormal it looks, the more aggressive it is.

766
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:44,810
So it depends on what is going on in the cancer,

767
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:53,810
which we can tell just by knowing that someone has a stage one without having it out and then a pathologist telling us how abnormal it looks.

768
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:58,880
So you might have had was like, well differentiated, poorly differentiated.

769
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:01,430
That tells us how aggressive it might be.

770
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:09,410
And some people have a genetic reason, like patients who have Crohn's ulcerative colitis or Lynch syndrome or other,

771
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:13,930
some of tend to have cancers that move progressed faster.

772
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:21,150
And sometimes we can tell if there is one of those things going on without having additional information.

773
01:17:21,810 --> 01:17:28,830
So yeah, so it depends. Stage one on an average would take a little bit of time to progress.

774
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:36,090
And I think that's why sometimes we don't see people, they might be having problems for years and we don't know until it becomes the whole system.

775
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:42,960
That's a great question. It comes up frequently. Yes.

776
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:49,480
Is that is that an area that like we're hearing is being used in is how to like more accurately project the timeline.

777
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:55,030
I would be surprised if there I don't know really and I have to again confess to my hope

778
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:59,500
is the part of the discussion that I struggle with so much and I meet some patients.

779
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:10,180
And that's another reason that oncologists I haven't looked at it from a prediction for prognosis of best that I hope not AIDS,

780
01:18:10,510 --> 01:18:14,260
but I wouldn't be surprised if people are looking at that. But that is definitely a good.

781
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:30,450
Yes. Yes. I didn't have to go with this. So given the concerns of the countries that are meeting with younger age populations,

782
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:37,860
do you find that the reduction in starting screening for colonoscopy as at 45 to be not conservative enough.

783
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:50,010
Yeah. So I can I don't people who are on the side of we need to change that age even area of stratified by specific risk factors.

784
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:55,920
So it wasn't until I was the fellow implementing safety training that I came

785
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:02,340
to find out that even when we had the age of 50% of black African Americans,

786
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:12,710
the recommendation was 45. Had no idea about going through my entire journalistic training about cancer screening and never came across.

787
01:19:12,970 --> 01:19:17,110
So even when it was 50 but last, folks, it's supposed to be 45.

788
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:26,920
Now we will be disqualified, but we haven't changed the for the black folks who receive more it now of this public

789
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:31,660
health question because how many do you need to screen to treat to make that difference?

790
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:39,340
And that's where I struggle. I feel like one life is important for the investment into that one life.

791
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:47,019
But from a public health public policy standpoint, I guess that's not exactly the best way to think,

792
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:52,770
because think about resources and how do you get your spouse to think a different set of.

793
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:59,070
What we do is we're gonna have resources in insurance.

794
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:03,060
I can tell you that because folks are so worried about this in cancer,

795
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:09,360
every time patients in their twenties become an integral places and you're like, I have blood in my eyes.

796
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:15,960
To most folks, it is probably hemorrhoids. But we find that folks are ordering more colonoscopies.

797
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:26,460
The way the government is ruling out Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, which scientists can have 11 days to.

798
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:34,500
Really what you're trying to do is make sure it's expensive because everyone is on it if you miss one of these impacts.

799
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:43,920
And until we have clear policy guidance in this place where you have access, some sort of insurance folks are going to get more open use.

800
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:49,770
So we are now seeing an overuse. I do colonoscopies and sometimes I have a 15 year old, then I.

801
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:59,900
Another side of the thing. But someone put in there and I can say that because of the patient population I see I got

802
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:07,100
my philosophy done as I didn't see out of focus because the numbers are just so scary.

803
01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:19,540
I do realize that and downstream seen all the worst cases because the machine is skewed to going back to the bias, which I don't.

804
01:21:20,690 --> 01:21:30,690
What I do. Because I suppose it is a little bit that I'm interested in your local hospice service, huh?

805
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:35,400
Yeah. So I am as a medical. So as a resume I did here.

806
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:40,110
What we do is we have neighbors will help us with the hospice services.

807
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:46,590
Um, ideally we would be in a city where we are not sending our patients to hospice.

808
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:49,660
We are very aggressive in sense of what we would do.

809
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:56,310
So a lot of us agents of chemotherapy and stuff and we try and get them into hospice.

810
01:21:56,610 --> 01:22:02,470
Well, we do. As a palliative care looks a little bit different from the hospice, the values of coping,

811
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:08,670
like how do you manage people's pain into the senses or side effects or the treatments

812
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:12,420
that you and I would put as a whole team that helps us with palliative care,

813
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:19,850
those palliative care, I don't want to say we should. We will make a call if we need to transition to a hospice location.

814
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:27,749
So hospice and all alone and in that institution, sometimes what we do run into is what we call consequence measures,

815
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:33,989
only where someone has the cancer for a while to try to treat it.

816
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:40,680
And it's sort of like struggling. And so they decide to do what's in treatment whilst in the hospital.

817
01:22:41,010 --> 01:22:44,790
So we'll do a control measures which is sort of different or not.

818
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:48,150
I think that hospice sort of gives it the complicated.

819
01:22:51,600 --> 01:23:01,950
Chris. I was just wondering just recently that with COVID, you had issues with chicken breast, with outbreaks in the hospital.

820
01:23:01,950 --> 01:23:06,359
That affects the way that surgical patients are able to be treated.

821
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:09,860
That has affected their patients. Yeah, that's an excellent question.

822
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:15,120
We actually wrote a paper on that, looking at our patients as a patients within Michigan.

823
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:26,250
So not only colorectal, but liver cancer, a bunch of cancers, because we shut down all our services for a week and then we had to the cancer surgeons.

824
01:23:26,610 --> 01:23:33,240
So even though the other people are not operating so throughout COVID, it's good because decisions have been operated.

825
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:39,120
What was difficult was chemotherapy and radiation.

826
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:44,700
That was a tough. But the other thing which happened, as opposed because of COVID,

827
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:51,960
is that a lot of the general surgery she had occupied as kind of care providers in the communities have closed shop.

828
01:23:52,830 --> 01:24:00,209
So we are seeing people who are having delays to get in and cool enough could be done or they were being pulled by a doctor for X,

829
01:24:00,210 --> 01:24:02,370
Y or Z was supposed to have another test.

830
01:24:02,550 --> 01:24:09,930
And then if that test is going to be sent to Michigan, but that never got ordered or never happened, and then the patient didn't know.

831
01:24:10,690 --> 01:24:15,300
So we've seen a lot of folks who did didn't my partner today.

832
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:22,820
So about the 35 year old who was lost to follow up processes and now has stage four rectal cancer.

833
01:24:23,670 --> 01:24:28,080
And in the community because she had to have close shop.

834
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:37,440
And so we've seen some of the delays to treatment because of shortages that have been documented.

835
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:43,940
Well, we are at time, so thank you so much.

836
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:44,660
Thank you.
