1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,610
All right, Mr. Klein, of your people today.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,649
Let's see if they triple in. Hello, everybody.

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,660
Who's here? Before we start on today's lecture,

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:20,360
I actually wanted to circle back about the mid-semester evaluation because we didn't

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:26,390
have a chance to talk about it because you had fall break and then you had the midterm.

6
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,720
So first, I just want to say thank you again for engaging with Dr. Ten.

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,460
She's done like well over a hundred MSPs now.

8
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,890
So I think she was able to get a pretty good read on the class.

9
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,670
She read my other class last year pretty well.

10
00:00:47,810 --> 00:01:00,200
So I will say her message to you all was that sometimes students do get fixated on the negative

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:07,250
aspects of class so much that they don't appreciate the good things that the class offers.

12
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:17,270
And then you go on to other professors and realize they didn't spend as much time as I did on caring about your learning.

13
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:25,580
So that is just something to keep in mind because I know it's very easy to get into a negative mindset and kind of sit there.

14
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:34,969
So for the strengths, thank you so much for thinking the slides are easy to follow you like the multimedia sources you like,

15
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:43,070
the professional experience sharing. That's good. I can't tell because sometimes I tell stories and I'm like, None of you have any facial expressions?

16
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,580
So I'm like, I don't know if I'm just sharing too much or what's going on.

17
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:56,240
You like that? I bring multiple perspectives in the class and my sensitivity towards social determinants of health, racism, environmental justice.

18
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:03,440
You like the homework and quizzes, surprisingly, and that the course expectations and structures reduce stress.

19
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:13,760
So hey, thank you. Now, in regards to areas for improvement, you would you would like more in-class activities and assignments.

20
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,890
So that is definitely I hear you. I see you. I'm going to try to integrate that more.

21
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:24,200
That's very surprising to me because who's right in class activities and assignments,

22
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:31,009
but you all seem to like each other, so I will continue to try to add those in as appropriate.

23
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:35,240
We do have one today guest speakers.

24
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,389
Okay. So this one is a tricky one that I would like to address.

25
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:44,629
So we like the idea of guest speakers, but the presentations would be more helpful if they could be directly linked to the

26
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:49,820
content slash goals of the course or even Dr. Lei's goals for individual class session.

27
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:56,030
So I do ask guest speakers to cover certain things, right?

28
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,140
I don't know if y'all realize this. They are not paid to guest speak.

29
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,309
This is something that they do on their own time.

30
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:11,330
So not only do they take the time to make the presentation, they take the time to do the presentation.

31
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,680
And what's been disappointing for me is that every time we've had a guest speaker,

32
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:24,620
you guys have mostly been silent in terms of your engagement with them, like with Dr. Scholl, too, I felt like I was asking all the questions.

33
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:29,959
So imagine if you're a person where you've taken the time to do this and to create

34
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:35,120
a lecture that you really didn't need to do and the classes unresponsive to you,

35
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:42,230
right? So I would say, please try to engage with future guest speakers because my online class didn't get

36
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:47,000
any of this and they would have loved that and they'd ask a ton of questions.

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,590
Okay, stronger connections in this course to environmental health sciences courses we take in would be helpful.

38
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,360
I don't know that I can do that because some of you are AP Some of the I don't

39
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,520
know what other classes you've taken a quick review of what was taught last week.

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,370
So that transition or connection to what's being taught this week was helpful can definitely do that.

41
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,060
It's not clear to me how the modules fit together.

42
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:23,720
I thought I was clear and that's the first time I've ever gotten this comment in the iterations that I've taught this class.

43
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:34,280
So essentially how, if it isn't clear how this class is scaffolded, is that we start with basic principles about infectious disease transmission,

44
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:41,990
move into what capacities and capabilities we have here in the United States with case studies integrated within it.

45
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:48,139
And then we start getting into deeper conversations about racism and environmental

46
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:53,450
justice and then wrap up with the class talking more about solutions.

47
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,930
So if that isn't clear, please come talk to me.

48
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,339
Privately. I don't hold office hours because no one showed up.

49
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,940
But like, you can schedule an appointment with me any time.

50
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,430
It's hard to see where the class is going.

51
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,680
I like learning a lot of different topics, but I'm having a difficult time integrating all the topics together.

52
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:23,470
And she did say there was a comment about how people are learning about infectious disease and emergency response, but not actually how to do that.

53
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,849
I told you all very explicitly at the beginning of this course.

54
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,360
This is a survey sampler platter kind of course.

55
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,830
And the syllabus very clearly states that nowhere in that nowhere in the syllabus does that say this is a practicum course.

56
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:46,760
So I would ask you in return to revisit that and adjust your expectations.

57
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:54,010
Okay. More emphasis on course learning objectives would help set direction for each lecture.

58
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,680
I have course learning objectives at the beginning of this, every slide deck.

59
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:05,050
Would it be helpful if I read them out loud to you? You see the head shakes.

60
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:11,509
Okay. PACE Some of the best.

61
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:18,500
The piece has felt quite slow. We are learning high level survey level content, but not how to do emergency response.

62
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,510
Okay, I just address that. Pace can be hit or miss.

63
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:27,800
Sometimes we are rushed at the end of class or we have to skip through some activities or slides or we don't get to hear from everybody.

64
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,860
Yeah, I mean, some days we do have more content, some days we don't have more content.

65
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,990
I will agree that the pacing does feel different,

66
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,090
but it also I would encourage you to take some ownership on your education and think

67
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:50,540
about how your participation or lack thereof is also shaping the classroom environment.

68
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:56,270
So if things feel like they're going slow, it's because I'm mostly staring at you.

69
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:00,560
Right. And then some specific comments.

70
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,430
Let's see. Key skills are learning in class.

71
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:08,480
Okay. So in relation to how are you participating in class?

72
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:16,430
I don't know. This part me, me kind of sad and I'm not sure how to navigate it.

73
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,450
The classroom environment doesn't feel welcoming to me. I thought or not, I don't.

74
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,450
I could add a thought or not, but I don't feel like it's helping advancing the conversation.

75
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,250
Sometimes the question posed by Aurora or another student is very open ended,

76
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,300
so I'm not really sure what extent you need to be able to explain the concept.

77
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,860
Sometimes I don't want to sound stupid and all my classmates are all super smart.

78
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,210
I feel like we're always behind and in a rush. So I don't want to ask questions because I'm worried it will slow us down.

79
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:53,180
Don't don't worry about that. Okay. Let's see.

80
00:07:54,230 --> 00:08:00,830
I have found this classes, this one and others that I feel like my engagement is somewhat is not valued.

81
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:07,490
And then it discourages me. Sometimes when I speak in class, it feels like my contribution is acknowledged and then quickly dismissed,

82
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,300
where many other students get much more engagement from the professor.

83
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:16,520
This can be discouraging as I feel like I shouldn't continue to speak up or talk.

84
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,170
I do want to say I don't know who this is because these are de-identified.

85
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:30,229
I apologize if you feel this way. I've tried really hard to like recognize everybody's contributions.

86
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:37,340
And if it seems like I linger more on other people's contributions, it's probably because they don't speak up as much.

87
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:43,550
So I want to encourage them to speak up more by potentially doing probing.

88
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,540
Sometimes there is fear of being judged and sometimes they don't have much to contribute that day and hesitant

89
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:56,809
to voice my opinions discussing certain things as I fear my opinions or thoughts are not always fully formed.

90
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:02,810
First, other people already talking and feeling like I don't want to discuss it because it's no longer relevant.

91
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,280
My fear of saying the wrong thing discourages me from participating.

92
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:14,989
I'm discouraged from participating because I don't think out loud and I worry we're not having a fully formed thought.

93
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:23,510
I will not express my actual opinion. And then some people say, I have a judgmental tone, which I do.

94
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:31,400
I try not to, but that might be my voice. And then being randomly chosen to speak, I only do that because no one is speaking.

95
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,319
So, I mean, I would say some of these make me sad and I'm not sure how to address it.

96
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,950
So maybe you all can help me because I feel like we established community

97
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:45,529
guidelines within the first week to try to foster a safe space in this classroom.

98
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:51,559
And I teach the same class online to people from very different backgrounds,

99
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:57,560
like people who live in Alabama and like different parts of California clashing with one another.

100
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:07,219
And they're all very vocal. So I feel like the community guidelines were established to create a space, a safe space in this classroom.

101
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:12,379
And I don't know that I can do anything to make you feel less discouraged,

102
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:18,260
that you don't want to speak out because you don't feel like you're you're smart enough or good enough.

103
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,440
That's like a internal thing.

104
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:27,229
But I feel like I as a collective group and you guys can correct me if I'm wrong,

105
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:32,500
I don't feel like any of us would judge anybody for saying something that wasn't correct.

106
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:38,270
I mean, like, I definitely don't know everything. And I will say when I don't know something and if I don't know something,

107
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,980
I'll look up and sometimes I say stuff that's wrong and then I have to like correct myself.

108
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,669
And that's just a part of like being a grad student.

109
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,720
And if some of you are thinking about pursuing a doctorate, guess what?

110
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,610
You're going to feel and be told you're wrong like 95% of the time.

111
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,480
And so that's something that is just a part of life.

112
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,310
It's humbling, but it also, like, helps you grow and learn.

113
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,300
So. You know, I'm sorry that some of you feel this way.

114
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:21,719
I don't know any of your interpersonal relationships outside of the context of this class, but I'm hoping that, you know,

115
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:28,980
you might take a dabble in trying to speak up more in class because, again, participation is 15% of your grade.

116
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:38,530
So it's one thing if your body is physically here, but it's another thing if you didn't really engage during lecture.

117
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:49,140
So that's all I had to say about that. Does anyone have any like comments or thoughts for me?

118
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:57,120
Ian Well, I feel I know personally I do really dangerous people, so that can be tough.

119
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:04,140
And I also feel like my perspective as an epidemiologist student, I don't know as much as you like that side of the room.

120
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,690
So I might not have anything to put into the conversation, if that's okay.

121
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:17,219
But as a epidemiology student, I'm sure you add a very rich and different perspective from like your experiences

122
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,500
and the coursework you've had and like being informed and fast and all that as well.

123
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:30,389
So I mean, I would say like, you know, don't, don't dismiss like your own experience.

124
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:34,230
I definitely get the anxiety aspect of it.

125
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:40,680
But like all of us are coming in with different baseline levels of education.

126
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:48,360
And even if you're like, I mean, it's a, you know, it's one thing to raise your hand to say like, okay, I agree, write what you can.

127
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:57,450
But, you know, it's also if you have a follow up thought or if you have a a story you'd like to share or a connection you'd like to make,

128
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:04,259
that's all valid as well. It doesn't have to be like a counterpoint or a thought piece or anything like that.

129
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:11,520
Does that make sense? Yeah. Thank you. Other thoughts or anything before we move on?

130
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:17,220
Okay. So just to recap then,

131
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:26,159
where we left off last time we talked about the timelines of environmental justice and then watched a few

132
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:35,280
examples of environmental justice at work with like grassroots efforts in terms of trying to stop like this,

133
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,780
you know, oil gas line from being put in and etc.

134
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:45,510
So today we're, we're looking at how a lack of environmental and social justice can,

135
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:50,280
in fact, impact infectious disease and emergency response outcomes,

136
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:57,030
and then summarize how environmental and social justice can impact at the state and federal level.

137
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,880
But before I forget, I just want to loop back.

138
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:09,420
A couple of weeks ago, we did talk about different Vibrio in the context of like cholera and all that stuff.

139
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:17,160
So this was almost a week ago, but I was listening to a podcast today and they mention this source like I pull this up.

140
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:24,730
So this is a rare but dangerous flesh eating bacteria is infecting Florida residents.

141
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:30,840
Okay, so this is Vibrio vulnificus, so not the cholera with the diarrhea.

142
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:38,580
And this in particular came from Hurricane Ian, where these are essentially foodborne illnesses called hallow.

143
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:44,250
Fill it because they require salt to survive or what they call like brackish waters.

144
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:53,910
So with the hurricane, you now have, you know, ocean salty saline seawater mixing in with the freshwater sources.

145
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:02,970
So this bacteria population increases during warmer summer months and see a boost after sewage spillage into coastal waters.

146
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:09,300
The storm brought 17 inches of rain to west central Florida with surges up to 12 feet.

147
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:15,300
So this one here, they call it flesh eating because it usually is caused.

148
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:21,180
The natural reservoir is in uncooked or undercooked oysters and shellfish.

149
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:32,940
But if it gets into on your flesh, it can start, you know, eating through open wounds and cuts and cause skin breakdowns and ulcers.

150
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:39,830
So this is the first time they've seen over 50 cases since 2008.

151
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:48,060
And those who are immunocompromised can potentially get something life threatening like sepsis or something as a result.

152
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:54,120
And so this one here, floodwater contact remains a big risk.

153
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,260
So remember, water and wounds don't mix.

154
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:05,490
And they advise people to avoid drinking or wading through it and then trying to clean it directly.

155
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:15,040
Lee. But I think up to this point, they have 65 cases and 11 deaths already from from this bacteria.

156
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:24,440
So I just wanted to follow up with you showing the actual example of infectious disease taking place after an emergency event.

157
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:29,270
Scary. Yes. Question to do with the commentary.

158
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:38,110
Yes. If you were really worried about people used to in general, the real illnesses are would you have to be specific to it, really?

159
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:49,040
You can be general, but I think it's given like ten, ten pages, double spaced can go by really fast.

160
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:59,059
So you might want to be more specific as to like vibrio illnesses in like the United States or like in India or like Thailand where you did your,

161
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:06,770
you know, your summer experience just so it doesn't get like super unwieldy because you do still looking at the

162
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:13,970
rubric have to you address three levels of response at least and then how to make response more equitable.

163
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,020
So you can discuss like the family of Vibrio diseases.

164
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,309
But I would say, you know, like we'll talk more about the paper next session actually,

165
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:31,070
because you'll turn in a topic to me soon to review, but maybe hone in a little bit to try to so it doesn't get unwieldy.

166
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:36,980
And it's it's a it's like a strong enough to be like a solid argument, if that makes sense.

167
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,740
All right. Do you still have friends or family, you know, that were affected by in.

168
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:54,019
I had a friend. I have a friend and her parents have like a vacation condo in Clearwater.

169
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,520
But I think it was okay.

170
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:06,770
I'll of everybody who lives like in a hurricane region in Florida is required to carry like heavy, heavy condo or home insurance.

171
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:13,489
And it's interesting because a lot of Michiganders or people like over the course of the pandemic,

172
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:20,780
because more telework is allowed, ended up moving to Florida or like snowbirds and things like that.

173
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:25,610
But I don't know that they are as much prepared as Floridians are.

174
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:32,689
So yeah. Anyhow, okay, so now we're going to get into social justice and again,

175
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:44,480
just re-emphasizing that I myself am not directly like it e j as j race scholar, I'm simply just like curating the information for you.

176
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:50,869
So for social justice, there's a lot of different definitions of social justice.

177
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:56,180
So these are three in particular that I paint for you. So very basic from the United Nations.

178
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:04,730
Social justice may broadly be understood as the fair and compassionate distribution of the fruits of economic growth.

179
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:12,649
Whereas the National Social Workers Association says social justice is the view that everyone deserves equal economic,

180
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,070
political and social rights and opportunities.

181
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:20,120
And then a center for economic and social justice gets really expansive.

182
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:25,760
So they say specifically social justice encompasses economic justice.

183
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:31,820
So it's the virtue which guides us creating those organized human interactions we call institutions.

184
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,419
In turn, the social institutions when justly organized,

185
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:41,390
provide us with access with is what's good for the person individually and in our association with others.

186
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:52,130
Also imposes the responsibility to work with others to design and continually perfect our institutions as a tool for personal and social development.

187
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,020
So in contrast to environmental justice, to back it up,

188
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:03,200
our social justice is more broad and not just within the realm of public health

189
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:09,560
and encompasses more so like an economic focus rather than an environmental focus.

190
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:21,440
Okay, so the general themes that you see within social justice are equal rights, equal opportunity and equal treatment.

191
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,230
So generally you'll see people focusing on human rights, access, participation and equity.

192
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:36,950
But generally when you have conversations about e.g. and addressing structural racism, these three concepts together are very much intertwined.

193
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:45,200
So some examples of social justice issues, maybe like racial inequities, LGBTQ plus rights,

194
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:49,940
voting rights, like a huge issue right now as we're coming up to the elections,

195
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:55,459
climate justice and environmental justice fits within this health care, refugee care,

196
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:01,040
income gaps, gun violence, which the school itself is is has a new public health ideas.

197
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,599
Have you all heard about that? The Public Health Ideas Initiative.

198
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:14,100
So every few years the School of Public Health focuses on like a topic which they want to address.

199
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:22,050
So right now it is gun violence prevention and recognizing that gun violence is a public health crisis.

200
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:32,040
I don't know if you'll saw there was another school shooting just yesterday in Saint Louis that I feel that barely got any any press, really,

201
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:42,870
because it's like a gradual, like desensitization of the frequency of these kinds of things and then hunger, food insecurity and more.

202
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:53,750
But you know, you can have downfalls in social justice at various levels of our society.

203
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,390
So if you think about something like at the organizational level,

204
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:03,980
so if you think about like the University of Michigan as an organization, I like your workplace as an organization, right?

205
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:11,660
Some lack of social justice can be like not providing technical assistance when needed or asked,

206
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:16,730
for example, not doing environmental and health impact analysis.

207
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:25,040
So if a bunch of your workers, for example, are complaining about headaches and whatever and like nausea,

208
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:31,640
fatigue, dizziness in the building, to me, you know, that I automatically think like sick building syndrome.

209
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:39,290
That might indicate to me maybe we need to do something like environmental and health impacts where we interview employees who are affected,

210
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:44,750
kind of see like, is it when they're in a certain area, is it not when they're in a certain area,

211
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:55,670
do like a like bring in professionals to do a mold assessment, but not recognizing to do that is a downfall.

212
00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:00,140
Not creating spaces for resource sharing and networking.

213
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,750
Essentially trying to isolate folks.

214
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:11,540
Not asking for guidance and advice from communities, as well as social justice and environmental justice advocates.

215
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:22,309
That still very much happens to this day in a lot of research where people do community work in a very haphazard way,

216
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:27,290
where they still work on communities and not with communities.

217
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,750
Virtue signaling in terms of diversity, equity and inclusion.

218
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,930
A lot of that's about that. Okay.

219
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,770
And then not putting words to action.

220
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:49,520
DTI is like a hot button topic right now and every university's mission statement you go to, everybody has a D I's action.

221
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:55,100
And most major companies like say they care about diversity, equity and inclusion.

222
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:59,450
Honestly, a lot of times it is just like lip service and virtue signaling.

223
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,780
They're talking to talk, but not necessarily walking the walk,

224
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:12,230
and that's contributing to social justice downfalls and then not creating a more just distribution of funds and efforts.

225
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,930
This potentially as well.

226
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:23,930
You know, I'll use this as an example like here at the School of Public Health, we very much have this like academics, star culture,

227
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:32,780
where you have a couple of researchers who are the heavy hitters and they therefore get preferential treatment,

228
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,020
although, you know, administration would say otherwise.

229
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,790
And then other folks just kind of are like scraping along.

230
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:51,980
So that's just an example. But what about its impact on infectious disease and emergency response in terms of employer response,

231
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:56,120
differential treatment of employees, employee relations?

232
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:01,040
And are they actually suited to advocate for those who are understaffed?

233
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:06,110
I can put on a make a note to myself.

234
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:19,940
I'm going to put on canvas this hour this preprint article by Chan and colleagues from 2020,

235
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:27,380
where they looked at 46 different states and different industries to look at essentially like,

236
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:37,370
excuse me, like the odds ratios and relative risks of COVID fatalities among different occupations.

237
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:43,310
Who do we think had higher fatality rates besides health care?

238
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:50,690
Like what kind of workers? People working in factories.

239
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:55,460
Factories? Yeah. Yeah. Maybe mining.

240
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:59,600
Okay. I'm thinking, like, service worker, service workers.

241
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,740
Frontline. Yeah. Yeah. So they show the breakdown of this, essentially.

242
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:12,650
And it is, yeah. Like a lot of service workers, frontline workers, folks with a lot of public interaction.

243
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:19,850
And most of these occupations generally tend to be what they consider more blue collar,

244
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,540
blue collar workers that are most of the time like predominantly minority.

245
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:34,190
If you think about who's working in like custodial services, environmental services, grocery stores, the service industry,

246
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:45,470
and to a certain extent, I mean, employers weren't seeing it directly, but they see these workers as somewhat expendable or replaceable.

247
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:51,620
So I'll have to put that paper on on on canvas after this.

248
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:57,379
But it's also a matter of like organizational culture and workplace safety culture.

249
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:08,420
So again, if we take COVID as an example of this, even looking at two very different workplaces, for example,

250
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:16,489
if you think about a place like Amazon where their organizational workplace safety culture is not very good, right?

251
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:25,160
We know workers there work ten, 12 hours a day, aren't given proper restroom breaks, aren't getting given sufficient lunch breaks.

252
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:35,149
They have like quotas to meet in terms of how many packages they like get put together per hour versus, I don't know,

253
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:40,550
let's say like somewhere like actually like University of Michigan where the workplace culture is very different.

254
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:47,959
Right. They did not want a lot of their employees getting sick, other employees getting sick.

255
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,880
And they discovered, hey, you actually can do your job and not physically be in the office.

256
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,750
Now, Amazon is a very different situation because they have to be physically present.

257
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:05,660
But I have another student in my other class who worked at H-E-B during the pandemic and that is a supermarket chain in Texas.

258
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,379
And the amount of protocols they had there was amazing.

259
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:18,170
Even if you went to the Trader Joe's here during the pandemic for a while they had caps on how many people could be inside at one time.

260
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:23,989
So there used to be a line wrapped around that entire plaza, although they moved people in pretty quick.

261
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:30,799
Right. And then, you know, the the employees were like sanitizing the cards for the customers as they came in.

262
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:38,000
And then a lot of places got plexiglass shielding and different types of engineering controls.

263
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:48,620
But the major issue is that a lot of organizations don't generally remain up to date with problems and the needs of the public health system,

264
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,979
or if they are getting news communicated to them,

265
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:58,340
they are very much just getting it from internet news or like clickbait news or word of mouth, for example.

266
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:05,989
So in previous after Ebola, I did some infectious disease gap analysis surveys with a couple of industries.

267
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:13,309
I did waste workers, EMT, EMS personnel, aircraft rescue and firefighting.

268
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:18,200
So these are specifically only firefighting personnel who work at airports

269
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,999
throughout the United States and do like the first aid response in airports.

270
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,040
If somebody has like a medical event.

271
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:37,910
I also did the death care sector and medical examiners and coroners and generally most of these industries got their infectious disease updates,

272
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:44,840
either from their professional organization, like via newsletter, or it was word of mouth by coworkers.

273
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:51,049
So you can imagine what that's like with a while, the information for something like COVID 19, very early on,

274
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:57,590
and people are kind of playing this game of like telephone where the original person has the right message.

275
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:02,810
But by the time it gets to like the third person or even the 10th person, it's very diluted.

276
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:11,570
And then thinking about the relationship as well between the private and the public sector, does that even exist?

277
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:18,830
Sometimes, but not a lot of the times now what about at the community level?

278
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:32,570
So in terms of community focus, generally social justice and environmental justice movements focus on communities rather than individuals.

279
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:36,559
And they're trying to be sensitive to power issues.

280
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:42,380
For example, who's causing the pollution reduces who is affected by the pollution.

281
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:48,770
But the similarity between SJ and E.J. is that it focuses on holistic approaches in terms of.

282
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,780
Analyzing and addressing problems as well as reforms.

283
00:30:53,500 --> 00:31:03,040
But environmental justice is more always focused on issues relevant to urban greenspace rather than, like we said, economics are like voting rights.

284
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:09,850
But the downfalls is that, you know, robust evidence shows that communities of color,

285
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:18,790
including indigenous communities and those who are low income, are the most affected by social and environmental justice issues.

286
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:29,710
But to this day, there's still very limited methods to essentially do disease cluster investigations linking this to environmental health.

287
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:35,770
We have some faculty here who do a lot of work in Detroit doing air sampling and stuff like that.

288
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:44,490
But in a lot of these cities with low income or like communities of color, there isn't anyone collecting that data.

289
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:51,220
The state health department doesn't do that at the state level. EPA and even the county level health department doesn't do that.

290
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:59,560
So in order to, like, understand and do this disease clustering investigation, we have to have that data and it's just not even being collected.

291
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:10,060
Also, not understanding the neighborhood context and determinants of health that influence or limit personal decision, decision making.

292
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:21,249
Right. So we've you know, or you've probably had conversations before with folks who, you know, take people who live in like hurricane prone regions,

293
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:27,220
for example, like when we talked about New Orleans and Katrina, how there's a large black community there.

294
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:33,990
And a lot of people were like afterwards when people were still living there, they're like, well, why won't they just move?

295
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,870
Right? And it's not as simple as that, right?

296
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:42,309
Because you have to take into account all this intersectionality of their identities,

297
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:49,690
their resources and their capital, limited adaptation and resilience planning as well.

298
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:53,830
I would say this is certainly not the fault of the community, though,

299
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:58,299
because you have people in the community who are on their like hierarchy of

300
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:05,230
needs are just trying to address the very basic level of food safety shelter.

301
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:11,860
They're just trying to get by their day to day. So they're not thinking about, you know,

302
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:19,540
catastrophic or potentially life changing events like this because it seems so tangible and abstract

303
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:26,800
compared to what's happening in this moment and not responsibly sourcing information as well.

304
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:30,190
I know in our activity a couple weeks ago,

305
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:38,229
I think it was the group that was sitting up here was kind of talking about going door to door to neighborhoods

306
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:44,469
that would be affected by the hurricane and trying to get them information on why it's important to evacuate,

307
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:47,020
when to do that by what their resources are.

308
00:33:47,470 --> 00:34:00,010
And then there is a lot still placing blame on the community rather than identifying upstream contributors to this lack of equity.

309
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:05,950
So in terms of like federal resources or like who's in charge of allocating the resources,

310
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:11,439
like we talked about in the article I showed you a few weeks ago with Hurricane Harvey,

311
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:19,840
even though that happened five years ago, the state received the aid from FEMA and the state decided how it was allocated.

312
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:28,479
So it ended up allocating a lot of that infrastructure, rebuilding funds to cities inland that weren't even affected by Hurricane Harvey,

313
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,290
but they just wanted to make additional improvements to their town.

314
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:35,590
Right. Whereas those folks in communities of color,

315
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:44,950
in zip codes that were mostly minority or low SES did not see any of those funds or their FEMA claims were were rejected.

316
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:50,170
Okay. Let me just take a sip of water.

317
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:59,929
And a lack of social justice has exposed again that not everybody has equal access to resources.

318
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:09,320
So health care facilities, some communities might have federally qualified health centers, but generally these are very few and far between clinics.

319
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:14,479
Appointment availability definitely differs by region as well,

320
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:23,180
and then quality of care and then an unequal distribution of vaccinations and health care in communities.

321
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:30,530
So what are the considerations when the resources are actually limited?

322
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:41,930
There is Vermont, the state of Vermont, which had had one of the highest vaccination rates out of the 50 states.

323
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:51,800
I don't know if you all are aware, but the CDC has decided to stop tracking COVID fatalities.

324
00:35:54,250 --> 00:36:01,879
Yeah, as of like two weeks ago because they were just like, it's just too much right now.

325
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,720
Okay. So so yeah.

326
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:13,430
So states are either taking it upon themselves, but Walgreens actually is also taking it upon themselves to track infection rates.

327
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,049
But not everyone goes to Walgreens.

328
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:24,620
I myself am more of a Rite Aid gal, but the state of Vermont, which had one of the highest vaccination rates and booster rates,

329
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:31,940
is currently seeing like a giant uptick in fall COVID reinfection again.

330
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:39,140
So that's just like a peak into, what, 2 to 4 weeks from now will be like in every state.

331
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,349
But it's interesting what the again,

332
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:49,580
I was I was talking about this at the Warren Cook discussion that I was facilitating with some AI professionals about what the CDC,

333
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:56,870
again, in a very frustrating way. Right. As a public health professional, how much they've changed their objectives over the last two,

334
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,110
three years and flip flop on things and what they're prioritizing.

335
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:07,430
They're no longer tracking COVID fatalities and releasing that data to the public,

336
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:21,890
but they're like starting to they're going to add to the required vaccinations for children, a COVID booster every year like a MMR, polio, etc.

337
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:32,090
I don't imagine that going over very well because in terms of like public school requirements for vaccinations, that's totally up to every state.

338
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:41,930
So me, myself, who grew up in California, for me to go to middle school, I had to have have a, B, polio, MMR, all this kind of stuff.

339
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:49,670
And when I moved to Indiana, I read I met some adults who never had any hepatitis vaccine series because it wasn't required.

340
00:37:50,630 --> 00:38:01,940
And with how adults are against COVID vaccines now, I feel like they're going to get a lot of push back requiring the booster for for the children.

341
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,780
So I'm like, oh, what do we what? Yes. Page, I thought they did tweet that it was like up to the states.

342
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,670
Yeah. Yeah I saw that only a couple of I don't think anyway but yeah.

343
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:16,790
Yeah. I mean ultimately like they make recommendations, right.

344
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:23,119
But it is up to the states and you can imagine what states would try to implement that or not implement that.

345
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:30,560
But for me, it's even hard to imagine California is going to go that far because we just want people to get polio again.

346
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:35,930
So yeah, yeah. Now what?

347
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:40,910
There is something called eco pandemic injustice.

348
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:47,059
So this is a term coined by powers and colleagues.

349
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:54,320
So essentially COVID 19 has increased awareness of the impacts of exposure to air pollutants

350
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:59,840
drawn back to that conversation about how air pollution in an indirect way makes you

351
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:05,330
more vulnerable to infectious diseases and environmental chemicals that act as immuno toxins

352
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:11,990
and the ways that habitat destruction increases zoonotic spillover and disease risk.

353
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:20,719
Okay, so basically what does that all mean? It's just like this formula here that they're coining as eco pandemic injustice where

354
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,970
you have air pollutants plus environmental chemicals plus habitat destruction,

355
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:31,490
again, generally in these disadvantaged communities, resulting in zoonotic spillover.

356
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:35,780
And that results ultimately in increased disease risk.

357
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,390
Okay. Now, what about at the state and federal level?

358
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,940
At the state and federal level, I kind of lumped them together.

359
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:55,190
So, again, this unequal distribution of resources, like in our FEMA example, the unequal treatment, a lack of or delayed response.

360
00:39:55,190 --> 00:40:05,080
So like we saw in Hurricane Katrina, for example, the burden of illness and disease and the lack of data collection and surveillance.

361
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:11,709
This is my biggest one, but I myself am not a data collector or a surveiller.

362
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:19,330
So I'm looking at my future epidemiologists and especially with communities of color in particular,

363
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:30,370
but even getting granular to the point where you're breaking up large sectors of the population to get more discrete data.

364
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:38,710
So if you look at a lot of The New York Times reporting on economic and and social repercussions of COVID,

365
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:43,090
they'll generalize black, white, Hispanic, Latino.

366
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:46,420
They even have Asian people on here.

367
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:53,950
But one of my biggest pet peeves is as a Asian-American is that, you know, Asians generally get lumped in together.

368
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,300
We are monolith, right?

369
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:05,170
But South Asians versus East Asians versus Southeast Asians have very different socioeconomic attainment, but also health outcomes.

370
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:14,830
But because, you know, and then also like so many Hispanic, Latino communities are very different in terms of like Argentineans versus,

371
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,700
you know, Mexicans, for example, in their health outcomes.

372
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:28,959
But because all this data is being lumped together or not even collected, it's very hard to get a clear picture of what's actually happening.

373
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,480
And because we don't have a clear picture of what's actually happening,

374
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:38,469
we can't distribute the resources, provide the response in a way that makes sense.

375
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:49,000
Right. Because if you'd like just I'll take a city like San Diego, for example, or actually San Jose.

376
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:56,320
San Jose, California, has a very, very large Asian population, one of the largest in the United States.

377
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:03,370
But if you look at the Vietnamese Americans who are living there versus the Indian-Americans who are living there,

378
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:14,619
you'll see huge disparities in terms of educational attainment, but also income level and their rate of vaccination uptake is not even the same.

379
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:19,930
But when you smash them all together, you look at it and say, Oh, the Asians in San Jose are good.

380
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:26,290
We can move on and go somewhere else, right? So this is like the continued issue that we have.

381
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:32,140
It's I wouldn't say it's a matter of institutions being lazy,

382
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:38,860
but it's not having enough person power or resources to even have the staff to do this in the first place.

383
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:43,149
And then like the historic defunding of public health, right?

384
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:48,160
So like when things go right, no one thinks about us, no one cares about us.

385
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:55,270
They cut our budgets and that. And then when things go wrong, everyone gets super mad at public health and they're like, Why don't you do anything?

386
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:59,470
It's like slash our budgets like consecutively for ten years.

387
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:02,890
But all of this leads again to unequal response.

388
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:11,440
So just a big takeaways. So yes, there is increased illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths in certain populations.

389
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:17,590
There are policies that do create barriers for communities of color and those that are low income,

390
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:27,370
lack of consideration for cultural linguistic differences, disparate impact of punitive measures, which I do want to bring up.

391
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:32,680
So violations of public orders with fines and potential jail time,

392
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:40,610
there is differential treatment in terms of like depending on the locality that you're in,

393
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:50,139
who the majority of your population is a person being disorderly and not wearing a mask who's white, for example,

394
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:57,549
and like spitting in a police officers face, probably not going to get fined, probably not going to get jail time.

395
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:04,630
Whereas like if a black man did that, not being facetious, being very serious, he could end up dead.

396
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:09,250
Okay. And then working on communities rather than with.

397
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:15,880
And then again slows changes until systemic or institutional issues are addressed.

398
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:26,470
So before we move on to our group activity, any clarifications about anything that I just mentioned or thoughts?

399
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:32,840
Okay. So we're going to do an ecosystem mapping activity.

400
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:43,970
Why this is this essentially like a synthetic representation of capturing all the key roles or key players that influence the user.

401
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:48,740
Okay. And the organization environment. So I'll show you a few examples because you're like, what is she talking about?

402
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:54,440
It helps display all entities that connect and how they connect to each other.

403
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:56,870
When a type of value is exchange,

404
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:06,980
so most people do ecosystem mapping in order to uncover existing gaps and identify valuable opportunity for like synergy or connection.

405
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:11,540
So really the first step in this is to get all players and entities involved.

406
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:21,470
So you can see this on your slides, but this is an ecosystem map that's, you know, of a person trying to buy a house.

407
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:29,990
Okay. So who is in there? So in the inside activities, you have things like home listing, mortgage calculators, price statistics.

408
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,950
But then, you know, from the time that you decide to move.

409
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:38,150
Right. One big key factor might be selecting your neighborhood.

410
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:39,480
What goes into that?

411
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:48,379
Proximity to work, commute times, evaluate services, crime statistics, proximity to social network, and then determine what you can afford.

412
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,310
What goes into that?

413
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:57,380
Applying for a pre-approval mortgage, negotiating with mortgage lenders, getting a real estate appraisal, and then finding a new home.

414
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:06,290
And then within that on you see on the outside activities besides these actual things of what you're going to do, they have who are the stakeholders?

415
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:10,250
So banks, for example, family and friends, social media.

416
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:17,059
In terms of buying a new home, you might have your buyer's agent, your lawyer, real estate agent when you actually move.

417
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:21,740
The stakeholders are movers and then, you know, carpenters, plumbers.

418
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:31,640
Another example this is a more basic one is if you were trying to do a start up, essentially.

419
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:35,510
So your inner hub, right, is a start up.

420
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:42,139
And then who's outside of you regionally that might help you with your startup are like incubators,

421
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:51,320
corporations, academic institutions, law firms, other partners, investors, co-working are cool living spaces.

422
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:57,049
And then if you blow out to the regional level in terms of you trying to have your startup,

423
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:03,090
you might have regulars, regulators, public authorities, customers and then job candidates.

424
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:13,820
Does that make sense to everybody? There is no right or wrong answer really in terms of who you imagine to be in your ecosystem.

425
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:20,000
So in the announcements on canvas, I did put a link to the Google slides.

426
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,290
So you all are and I didn't make you put you in groups this time.

427
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:29,810
You don't get to pick your own group, but some of you aren't here, so we'll see how small the groups get.

428
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,590
So for infectious disease response, this is our scenario.

429
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:40,580
Take something like COVID 19 and have a disadvantaged individual at the center of your ecosystem.

430
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:46,980
Now use your group. Have to identify what the disadvantages of your person are.

431
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:54,680
So you might say, you know, they have they are a person with physical disabilities who is low income and a woman.

432
00:47:54,680 --> 00:48:04,520
Right. And another group might be like, I am choosing a person who is Hispanic and low income and is a frontline worker.

433
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:09,950
So you as a group decide who your disadvantage individual is at the center.

434
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,870
Okay, define that for me.

435
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:23,150
And then who or what is in the regional ecosystem in terms of their infectious disease response and who is in the outer space or outside activities.

436
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:33,590
So for your Google slide, I have for group one Sarah, Paige, Chloe and Swati to Ian.

437
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:37,639
Mira is not here in Lexi.

438
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:46,340
Abby's not here. So just Ian and Lexi and then group three is Adriana, Sawhill, Kang and Burnley.

439
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,660
So I have the disadvantage person in the center again.

440
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:57,620
You have to define who that is to me. One person will report out but how you choose to make your mapping if you want

441
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:04,580
the very basic circles or you want the more complex thing totally up to you.

442
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:12,230
You can use graphics, you can use words, you can paste in things from like stock images and whatever.

443
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:18,560
But I want to see like what your interpretation is of who the key players are in

444
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:23,210
infectious disease response for this person and like how it is all interconnected.

445
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:26,600
Does that make sense? Okay. All right.

446
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:37,680
Go. Yeah.

447
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,620
Actually, I might move a person because they're kind of lonely bird.

448
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:47,790
Sawyer, can you go with this group? Okay. Yes.

449
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:55,050
Thank you. Easy to follow.

450
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:04,780
And then Burnley King and Adrian. Okay. All right.

451
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:12,730
That's okay. And it comes into.

452
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:25,620
So the whole time.

453
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:37,380
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, too.

454
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:41,450
Yeah.
