1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,524
Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:02,524 --> 00:00:07,240
I'll be going over the microbiome lecture real quick.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,560
So, basically, bacteria is not necessarily a bad thing to have.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,430
Sometimes they work synergistically with the body to

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,560
ensure that the whole system is working well and nicely.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,478
If you're interested, you can watch this video again.

7
00:00:22,478 --> 00:00:27,754
Basically, part of the video talks about how an infant has been given antibiotics

8
00:00:27,754 --> 00:00:32,670
and how when they were given that, their microbiome changed drastically.

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,553
But then, after they stopped taking it, their microbiome went back to normal and

10
00:00:37,553 --> 00:00:41,140
along with other things that affect the microbiome.

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,781
And amongst those things are maternal microbes.

12
00:00:44,781 --> 00:00:49,795
So, as mentioned in class, C-section versus vaginal delivery can affect that,

13
00:00:49,795 --> 00:00:53,840
the exchange of microbes between the mother and the infant.

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,647
And then the diet is a major contributor as to how much microbes

15
00:00:58,647 --> 00:01:01,982
you allow to grow or not grow in your colon.

16
00:01:01,982 --> 00:01:10,020
Environmental exposures and genetics because people have different ways and

17
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,246
Different tolerance to certain microbes or

18
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:19,040
different preferences to allow a microbe to grow over the other and so on.

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,094
So, here are some things that can affect the microbiome,

20
00:01:23,094 --> 00:01:27,670
is the conception of prebiotics and consumption of probiotics.

21
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,181
If you consume some probiotics, those are live bacteria.

22
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:36,516
So for the live bacteria to actually continue to be alive in your colon and

23
00:01:36,516 --> 00:01:41,690
to continue to nourish and be nourished, they need some prebiotics.

24
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,457
So they need something fermentable.

25
00:01:43,457 --> 00:01:45,680
They need a source of energy for themselves.

26
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,498
So make sure to feed your probiotics or

27
00:01:48,498 --> 00:01:52,040
else they can't really serve their function.

28
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,549
So, if someone is having a probiotic daily but

29
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:02,097
does not really have a healthy diet, then that can really

30
00:02:02,097 --> 00:02:08,639
cause they're probiotics to not live very well or live very long.

31
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,269
So, you always need to accompany that with a healthy diet to ensure that

32
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:15,440
the probiotics are alive.

33
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,637
And if you just have prebiotics but do not have the bacteria

34
00:02:20,637 --> 00:02:25,211
to consume them, then that's not really useful.

35
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:31,640
So those together in sync will be an optimal solution.

36
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,251
So microbes, they differ in lean and obese humans over here.

37
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:38,282
So, someone who suffers from obesity has a different

38
00:02:38,282 --> 00:02:41,400
fraction of bacteria compared to someone who is lean.

39
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:48,451
And this really speaks to the efficiency at which someone extracts energy.

40
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:53,199
So maybe someone who has obesity can extract more energy because,

41
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,437
as mentioned, when you ferment the fiber by the bacteria,

42
00:02:57,437 --> 00:03:02,776
you release short chain fatty acids that can be used as a source of energy for

43
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:08,540
the blood, the liver, or the colonocytes, themselves.

44
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,740
So the answer here is yes.

45
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,620
And then those are the sources of short chain fatty acids.

46
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,705
So butyrate would be the primary source for colonocytes and then acetate and

47
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:29,959
propionate would be the main sources for the blood and the liver to use as energy.

48
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,661
And then other metabolites.

49
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:35,878
So the bacteria can also make choline, carnitine, vitamin B12, vitamin K,

50
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:40,240
short chain fatty acids, as mentioned, and bile acid receptors and so on.

51
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,521
Downside of having excess digestion in the colon.

52
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:48,039
So, the more digestion there is, the more solutes there is in the colon, and

53
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:52,440
the more solutes there is in the colon, the more water that would attract.

54
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,206
And then, if you keep attracting a lot of water into the colon, instead of actually

55
00:03:57,206 --> 00:04:01,579
absorbing them and taking them out of the colon, that can lead to diarrhea.

56
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:07,687
Also microbes in excess will breathe and will just make more gas,

57
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:17,440
which can cause excessive gas production, basically.

58
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,197
So, FODMAPs for someone who probably has IBS, irritable bowel syndrome, and

59
00:04:22,197 --> 00:04:26,741
so on, maybe they want to avoid foods high in FODMAPs, because they just get

60
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:31,540
fermented and they cause excessive gas and more irritation then need be.

61
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,204
And so, FODMAP stands for fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides,

62
00:04:36,204 --> 00:04:38,640
monosaccharides, and polyols.

63
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,830
So, just be careful about what you eat.

64
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:47,412
There are some foods that are high in FODMAPs and some foods that are lower in

65
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:52,067
FODMAPs and definitely keep in mind that people have their own tolerance and

66
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:53,461
their own threshold.

67
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:58,217
So something that's a high FODMAP that truly irritates Person A who

68
00:04:58,217 --> 00:05:01,840
has IBS might not irritate Person B who has IBS.

69
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,940
So, this is where the genetic differences really kick in as well.

70
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,140
And that's a table for your reference.

71
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,828
And then this is the barrier function.

72
00:05:12,828 --> 00:05:19,810
So, basically, our colons, they also have an immune function and

73
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:29,853
they act as a barrier which we'll be covering in the next slides.

74
00:05:29,853 --> 00:05:32,141
So also here, endogenous glycans.

75
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:36,650
They can be used as a bacterial energy source.

76
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,333
So, basically, if you do not really feed your bacteria, then,

77
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:45,080
to live, they will start eating off the membrane and

78
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,701
then the membrane can act as an energy source for this bacteria.

79
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:53,688
But this isn't good for us because this membrane is meant to be there for

80
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:57,287
a reason to protect us from pathogens that could be in the colon.

81
00:05:57,287 --> 00:06:01,727
And so, when the bacteria colonize that area and

82
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:06,815
kill off part of the membrane, then we become more prone

83
00:06:06,815 --> 00:06:15,840
to be infected by whatever pathogens are actually in the lumen.

84
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,140
So, basically, immune system, it's innate or adaptive.

85
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:25,287
And then the microbes in the colon, they produce MAMPs,

86
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:30,670
so, sorry, MAMPs in the colon produce AMPs, basically.

87
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:34,047
So MAMPs are microbe associated molecular patterns.

88
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:40,143
So those are microbes that work on detecting pathogens,

89
00:06:40,143 --> 00:06:44,461
whether they're good or bad bacteria,

90
00:06:44,461 --> 00:06:48,144
they just work on detecting them.

91
00:06:48,144 --> 00:06:51,643
And if you're eating the same foods then this really makes it easier for

92
00:06:51,643 --> 00:06:54,736
your MAMPs to detect what's being ingested and what's not and

93
00:06:54,736 --> 00:06:56,810
they just get used to your eating habits.

94
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:02,814
But then if you ingest something that actually needs to be fought off or

95
00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:07,698
removed from the colon or put your immune system at risk,

96
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:13,196
then they also release AMPs, which are antimicrobial peptides

97
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:19,201
produced by the epithelial cells, to either ward off the pathogens or

98
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:25,761
just be released to ensure that everything is going smoothly, basically.

99
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:28,608
So, those are part of the innate system and

100
00:07:28,608 --> 00:07:32,097
they differentiate between good and bad bacteria.

101
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:36,706
So they recognize both, but definitely when there is bad bacteria,

102
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:42,268
they try to ward it off and when there is good bacteria, it's just recognized and,

103
00:07:42,268 --> 00:07:50,212
basically, it's not attacked if it's a good bacteria.

104
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:54,725
So, inflammation can definitely result from loss of barrier function,

105
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,191
as mentioned earlier.

106
00:07:56,191 --> 00:07:59,949
So, if your bacteria is unhappy and it's not being fed,

107
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:04,490
it's gonna colonize part of your barrier and then when it does that,

108
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:09,740
the loss of the barrier will compromise your immunity because now the pathogens

109
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:15,240
can just easily cross the barrier that's almost non existent at the moment.

110
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,185
So, long story short, keep your bacteria happy,

111
00:08:19,185 --> 00:08:23,956
feed them good food that they can utilize as an energy source or

112
00:08:23,956 --> 00:08:30,042
else they can start eating the membrane and that can compromise the immunity.

113
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,325
I believe that's it.
