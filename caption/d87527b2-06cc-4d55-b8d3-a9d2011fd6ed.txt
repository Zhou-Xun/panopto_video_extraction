1
00:00:05,575 --> 00:00:10,420
In this module,
we will focus on written advocacy tools.

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:16,220
And as we discussed in the last module,
written advocacy tools

3
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:21,910
are one step in a broader set of steps
in effective advocacy strategies.

4
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:27,440
These written materials do not
exist in isolation or in a vacuum.

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,259
So preparation of these materials

6
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:34,641
must be done in the context
of that broader strategy.

7
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:38,084
After we have researched our problem,

8
00:00:38,084 --> 00:00:42,685
developed a goal,
identified the decision maker.

9
00:00:42,685 --> 00:00:47,594
Honed in on specific messages that we know
will resonate with the decision maker.

10
00:00:47,594 --> 00:00:54,924
All of those points are important to
include in the written advocacy materials.

11
00:00:54,924 --> 00:01:02,260
I firmly believe that any advocacy
strategy must include a one pager.

12
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:07,940
It is by far the most important advocacy
tool, and there are a few reasons why.

13
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:13,780
For the author, the advocate,
the writer, it's very helpful for

14
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,940
us to hone in on specific messages.

15
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,701
To identify words that resonate
with the decision maker.

16
00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:26,452
And to use the process of
crafting that one pager as

17
00:01:26,452 --> 00:01:30,308
our way of crystallizing our thinking.

18
00:01:30,308 --> 00:01:34,519
So honing in on exactly what
it is we want to communicate,

19
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:39,650
that we know the decision
makers will refer to over time.

20
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:44,860
For the reader, it's very helpful
to have a concise summary

21
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,790
that explicitly pulls out
the key points for us.

22
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:55,180
So it's important on both sides,
the author as well as the reader.

23
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,956
These are routinely used
in all types of settings.

24
00:01:58,956 --> 00:02:03,118
Whether it's an organization,
whether it's my dean's office,

25
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:05,890
whether it's the United States Congress.

26
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,050
So one pagers are very, very common tools.

27
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,870
And they are the most important part
of what I call leave behind materials

28
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,770
that we talked about in
the earlier segment.

29
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,406
A leave behind packet will include the one
pager, as well as other documents.

30
00:02:21,406 --> 00:02:26,930
But it's often the item that is
placed on the top of the packet and

31
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:32,160
referred to during that in-person meeting.

32
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,940
I think it's helpful to go back to
the origin of the one pager to understand

33
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,910
how it became the currency
in written advocacy.

34
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:49,497
And it's a fascinating story from 1986
when the tax code was being revised.

35
00:02:49,497 --> 00:02:55,040
And as you can imagine, in the tax code,
there's sorta something for everyone.

36
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,070
And every type of special interest
group has provision one way or another.

37
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:07,040
So the number of amendments that
were floating around and being

38
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,840
voted on during consideration of that
proposal, there were hundreds of them.

39
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,270
And in 1986, the members of
congress were still required to

40
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,430
vote on the floor of
the House of Representatives.

41
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,750
Which is where the proposal was
being considered at the time.

42
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:31,160
So the only time that the staff had to
discuss these various amendments and

43
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:37,870
proposals with the member of congress
was the time between leaving the office.

44
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:43,110
And crossing the street to
travel to the house floor.

45
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:48,248
So these amendments were for
moving so fast that the lobbyists,

46
00:03:48,248 --> 00:03:52,520
and advocates and staff,
developed a process.

47
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,290
Through which they had
a quick one page summary.

48
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,060
This is the amendment.

49
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,547
This is the problem that it addresses.

50
00:04:01,547 --> 00:04:04,835
This is why this is
the appropriate solution to that,

51
00:04:04,835 --> 00:04:07,510
and here's how you should vote.

52
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:13,425
And this process of managing the number
of amendments that were floating around.

53
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:18,056
And being voted on,
sort of then led to the one pager

54
00:04:18,056 --> 00:04:23,020
being an expectation in
an advocacy strategy.

55
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:28,740
So since 1986 you've seen a lot
of one pagers on Capital Hill,

56
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,350
and now in other settings as well.

57
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:37,534
So I use these in all of my effective
advocacy strategies and in other ways.

58
00:04:37,534 --> 00:04:41,960
And these are a few tips
that I'd like to highlight.

59
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:48,060
Headings and sections that organize key
points are so helpful for the reader.

60
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,820
And using things like bold,
and capitalization, and

61
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,789
underline, italicizing.

62
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:57,546
Having lots of white space that
then draws the eye to the bullet

63
00:04:57,546 --> 00:05:00,430
points that are most important.

64
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,230
If there is data that can be
helpful in providing a context or

65
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,650
background for
a goal that you're trying to advance.

66
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:15,470
The use of a visual, graphs and
charts can be very, very helpful.

67
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:20,148
Not so far as the new kind of
infographic that has evolved in

68
00:05:20,148 --> 00:05:22,164
just the last few years.

69
00:05:22,164 --> 00:05:27,926
But incorporating elements of that
infographic type of approach can be very,

70
00:05:27,926 --> 00:05:29,990
very helpful.

71
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,470
And with the text,
avoiding long citations,

72
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,720
or kind of treatises,
is really helpful for the reader.

73
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,671
However, indicating
the source can be important.

74
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:48,542
If the reader would like to
explore further information,

75
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:51,210
they will know where to go.

76
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,010
Spelling out acronyms.

77
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:57,250
In health, public health,
we have a lot of acronyms, and

78
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:02,110
we can't expect that the layperson
will understand what we mean.

79
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,890
So keeping it simple, and recognizing

80
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:09,860
that the reader may not have expertise or
background in this topic.

81
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,920
So this is intended to be
a very quick read, and

82
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:18,090
something that can be easily
understood by the reader.

83
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:22,962
This is a potential structure that I
think is a helpful way to approach

84
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:24,475
writing a one pager.

85
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:28,205
Similar to the way that we do meetings
using the eight minute rule and

86
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:30,030
the oral communication.

87
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,863
In our written communication we
want to be very clear who we are,

88
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:39,080
who we represent, and
the goal that we're advancing.

89
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,540
In the next chunk of text,
we want to describe the problem.

90
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,388
And this is where you draw
on your education and

91
00:06:47,388 --> 00:06:51,195
your ability to do those
comprehensive literature reviews.

92
00:06:51,195 --> 00:06:57,280
And access that data and understand it in
a way that truly the layperson cannot.

93
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,289
But using statistics and
data to show the urgency of this problem,

94
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,794
that will motivate the reader and

95
00:07:04,794 --> 00:07:09,192
the decision maker to take
the action that you recommend.

96
00:07:09,192 --> 00:07:12,968
And not to wait, but
to create a sense of need

97
00:07:12,968 --> 00:07:18,535
given the background data
that you're able to share.

98
00:07:18,535 --> 00:07:22,972
And then in the next chunk of text,
describing In the solution.

99
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:25,422
And this is something that is so
important.

100
00:07:25,422 --> 00:07:30,092
We don't want to just describe the problem
without leaving the policy maker

101
00:07:30,092 --> 00:07:32,872
with an action item to advance.

102
00:07:32,872 --> 00:07:37,182
So noting why your specific goal

103
00:07:37,182 --> 00:07:41,062
is the appropriate response to
this problem is so important.

104
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:45,480
So using any statistics,
any research findings that we have.

105
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:51,090
Examples of similar proposals that
have moved forward in other states.

106
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:56,005
If we go back to our case study of
the smoke-free workplace legislation,

107
00:07:56,005 --> 00:08:01,096
we were able to draw on other states'
experiences with similar proposals.

108
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:05,986
To show why this would be a great solution
to the problem of secondhand smoke in

109
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:06,353
Michigan.
