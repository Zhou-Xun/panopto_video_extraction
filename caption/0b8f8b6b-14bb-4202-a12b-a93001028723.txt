1
00:00:05,942 --> 00:00:10,982
So, taking time to consider cultural
influences on communications is

2
00:00:10,982 --> 00:00:15,861
not an extra step, it's simply
part of good communication design.

3
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:20,181
But, I'm going to have to pause for
a moment now and talk a little bit about

4
00:00:20,181 --> 00:00:24,945
particular types of problems that do
appear when we fail to consider culture.

5
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:26,889
I'm going to discuss
a few in this lecture.

6
00:00:26,889 --> 00:00:29,808
Not a complete list by any
stretch of the imagination.

7
00:00:29,808 --> 00:00:34,661
But some good examples that I
think that highlight what can

8
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:39,117
go wrong when we fail to
engage in a respectful process

9
00:00:39,117 --> 00:00:43,290
of thinking about culture
in our design process.

10
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,153
So, one error that pops up almost
immediately is attention, right?

11
00:00:48,153 --> 00:00:52,860
If I don't understand whether you're
going to show up late or early,

12
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,175
whether you watch a particular channel or
not.

13
00:00:56,175 --> 00:01:01,306
When you behave, when you engage
in particular behaviors or not.

14
00:01:01,306 --> 00:01:05,732
I might to try to deliver my message to
you at the wrong time or the wrong place,

15
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,359
where you're just never going to
be able to see it or attend to it.

16
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,119
That's a failure of understanding
the cultural context.

17
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,868
And being aware of those patterns
of behavior enables us to make sure

18
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:21,617
that our message is not just
available to people, but

19
00:01:21,617 --> 00:01:25,560
available at a time and
place when they can attend to it.

20
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,661
We also need to think about
the social consequences, right?

21
00:01:28,661 --> 00:01:32,759
Sometimes, in a particular
social environment,

22
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,715
I cannot attend to a message
because it's not appropriate for

23
00:01:37,715 --> 00:01:41,161
me to do so
in that cultural moment in time.

24
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:44,100
Without understanding the culture,
we're going to fail.

25
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,510
And that failure is not because our
message is not of value to the audience,

26
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,094
it's because we didn't
understand the cultural context.

27
00:01:52,094 --> 00:01:55,772
And now I want to talk about
what my colleague Ken Resnicow

28
00:01:55,772 --> 00:01:59,616
talks about as he defines this
sort of surface structure.

29
00:01:59,616 --> 00:02:01,984
When we communicate with each other,

30
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:05,468
there are things that we expect
that are familiar to us.

31
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:07,856
It might be people we associate with us.

32
00:02:07,856 --> 00:02:12,578
It might be places, language,
terms, music, food,

33
00:02:12,578 --> 00:02:16,295
clothing, all of these
things that we see or

34
00:02:16,295 --> 00:02:21,938
hear that makes a message seem
familiar like it's speaking to us.

35
00:02:21,938 --> 00:02:28,561
When we use those appropriate surface
structures, I'm more receptive.

36
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:32,754
I'm more able and
more interested in tending to the message.

37
00:02:32,754 --> 00:02:38,044
But when I see something that doesn't look
like me, or doesn't look like my location,

38
00:02:38,044 --> 00:02:41,490
my family, my food,
I'm not going to attend to it as much.

39
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,946
Let me give you some examples.

40
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:48,355
So here are two pictures from a research
study that Dr. Resnicow was involved in.

41
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:51,599
It was involved with healthy eating
with African-American adults.

42
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,685
And this really subtle differences here,
right?

43
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:58,228
In both pictures there is okra but
in one you've got a sweet potato and

44
00:02:58,228 --> 00:02:59,891
in another you've got a mango.

45
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:04,659
In one in the background, you've got
some sort of generic like kitchen towel.

46
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:09,468
In another you've got a cloth that's
obviously sort of an African pattern.

47
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:14,335
For some people, one of these pictures
might resonate more than the other one.

48
00:03:14,335 --> 00:03:18,148
And paying attention to the surface
structure variations and

49
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:21,372
who your audience is will
help that message seem like

50
00:03:21,372 --> 00:03:24,613
something that they ought
to pay attention to more.

51
00:03:24,613 --> 00:03:27,714
You also see this in advertisements.

52
00:03:27,714 --> 00:03:29,777
Here's a truck ad.

53
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:34,626
General audience, the message is you
want a truck that's going to burn less

54
00:03:34,626 --> 00:03:36,513
fuel because fuel is money.

55
00:03:36,513 --> 00:03:40,173
Really broad idea,
should apply to everybody.

56
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:43,113
Now here's what you can do when
you have a little bit better

57
00:03:43,113 --> 00:03:45,942
understanding of the culture
you're trying to reach.

58
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:50,982
This is a targeted car ad,
this is an ad run by Subaru back about 20

59
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:56,930
years ago that was specifically targeted
towards gay and lesbian community.

60
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,172
And the phrasing of, it's not a choice,
it's the way we're built.

61
00:04:01,172 --> 00:04:06,710
It was designed to evoke a connection
to the language that was being talked

62
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:12,979
about at that point in time, about gay or
lesbian lifestyles as not being a choice.

63
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:15,850
Regardless of what you
particularly believe,

64
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:20,444
that similarity of language was
something that that audience recognized,

65
00:04:20,444 --> 00:04:27,371
and it enabled the message to be something
that they wanted to pay attention to.

66
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:31,053
Another type of cultural error
is comprehension errors.

67
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:35,857
Situations where words have different
meaning in one cultural group than what

68
00:04:35,857 --> 00:04:37,539
was originally intended.

69
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:40,668
I see this all the time in
professional communications, right?

70
00:04:40,668 --> 00:04:43,984
Doctors or
medical professionals use words.

71
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:47,157
The words they use when
communicating with each other, but

72
00:04:47,157 --> 00:04:51,486
when they're used with patients,
patients don't understand what they mean.

73
00:04:51,486 --> 00:04:56,237
And so comprehension fails or
phrasing is wrong, right?

74
00:04:56,237 --> 00:04:57,586
Think about language.

75
00:04:57,586 --> 00:05:02,149
I might put a sentence through
a translation process and

76
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:04,970
have words that are appropriate.

77
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:10,006
But if I read that, a native speaker
would never say it that way.

78
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:13,948
And they see that and they go, well,
somebody just tried to translate that.

79
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:18,495
You would never say it that way,
even if they understood the meaning.

80
00:05:18,495 --> 00:05:20,406
So that's a cultural error.

81
00:05:20,406 --> 00:05:24,463
You didn't phrase it in
the appropriate way.

82
00:05:24,463 --> 00:05:29,094
Another kind of cultural error that often
occurs in professional context is assuming

83
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:31,227
prior knowledge or lack of knowledge.

84
00:05:31,227 --> 00:05:35,908
If I give a presentation to you
assuming you've never thought about

85
00:05:35,908 --> 00:05:39,858
a particular topic, and
you've thought about it a lot.

86
00:05:39,858 --> 00:05:44,568
I've failed because I've now made
an assumption about your state of

87
00:05:44,568 --> 00:05:46,688
knowledge that is incorrect.

88
00:05:46,688 --> 00:05:50,564
And you might feel offended that I'm
giving you this information that you

89
00:05:50,564 --> 00:05:53,628
already know.

90
00:05:53,628 --> 00:05:57,369
Another kind of cultural error
works on that yielding phase.

91
00:05:57,369 --> 00:06:03,292
So if a message conflicts with
an existing model of people,

92
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:07,088
or a disease, or of the environment.

93
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:09,211
It doesn't make sense to people, so

94
00:06:09,211 --> 00:06:12,981
they won't understand why you're
asking them to do something.

95
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:13,973
I'll give you an example.

96
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:20,851
So I do work in risk communication,
and messages about food recost.

97
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:24,589
Let's say we're talking
about contaminated eggs.

98
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:28,125
If your model of contaminated eggs says,
well,

99
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:32,954
all I need to do is to cook the eggs
well and I'll be perfectly safe,

100
00:06:32,954 --> 00:06:37,981
then you don't understand why it is
I'm telling you to throw it out.

101
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,213
But if I need to change your model, so

102
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:44,325
that you understand that
the contamination might be in your hands.

103
00:06:44,325 --> 00:06:49,256
And even though you might try to cook
the eggs well, you might contaminate other

104
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:53,757
surfaces or other foods with your
hands when you're handling the eggs.

105
00:06:53,757 --> 00:06:58,726
I have to understand that you don't
understand that model before my

106
00:06:58,726 --> 00:07:00,914
message is going to make sense.

107
00:07:00,914 --> 00:07:06,163
When our instructions conflict with
cultural norms, if I tell you, you need

108
00:07:06,163 --> 00:07:11,752
to speak to your parents about, let's say,
contraception or sexual behavior.

109
00:07:11,752 --> 00:07:16,115
And the cultural norm is that
those conversations never happen,

110
00:07:16,115 --> 00:07:18,502
my message is not going to make sense.

111
00:07:18,502 --> 00:07:21,721
Or if I assume incorrect values or
preferences,

112
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:26,599
I assume that you don't want to get
pregnant when you do or something else.

113
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:31,464
I assume that you always want to have
surgery and live a longer life when

114
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:36,259
your value or your community's
values emphasizes quality of life.

115
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:37,229
I'm going to have a problem.

116
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:41,135
You're not going to accept
the messages that I'm giving you.

117
00:07:41,135 --> 00:07:45,128
The idea here is what we might call
culturally-sensitive deep structures.

118
00:07:45,128 --> 00:07:49,860
Again, this is a term I've been exposed
through my colleague Ken Resnicow.

119
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:55,329
The idea here is these deep structures
that are cultural, social, historical,

120
00:07:55,329 --> 00:08:00,022
environmental, psychological
forces that influence or behavior.

121
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:03,837
And I don't just mean ideas like race or
ethnicity.

122
00:08:03,837 --> 00:08:06,572
We can talk about this
in professional context.

123
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:08,345
Let's look at statistics.

124
00:08:08,345 --> 00:08:13,727
There's hypothesis testing statistics and
there are Bayesian statistics,

125
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:17,149
and if you think and
work in a Bayesian framework,

126
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:20,994
hypothesis testing is
a different cultural approach.

127
00:08:20,994 --> 00:08:25,584
And the terms and the way you would
want to talk to somebody about

128
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:30,086
let's say whether a data set is
showing a particular result,

129
00:08:30,086 --> 00:08:34,084
depends on understanding
that cultural difference.

130
00:08:34,084 --> 00:08:38,387
We are seeing increasingly evidence that
people's beliefs about climate change

131
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:40,140
are linked to their world views.

132
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,343
Those deep structures about the in
which they see the world is influencing

133
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:48,703
the way we see and interpret the evidence
we have regarding climate change.

134
00:08:48,703 --> 00:08:54,323
And one that I run up against all the time
in my medical decision making work is,

135
00:08:54,323 --> 00:08:57,577
seeing the metaphor of
a disease is an enemy.

136
00:08:57,577 --> 00:09:02,790
And hence treatment is a war in which we
have to fight cancer and win the battle.

137
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:08,661
That cultural assumption affects
our abilities to think about,

138
00:09:08,661 --> 00:09:14,969
say, palliative care or choices not
to engage in further treatment.

139
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:18,762
It's a structure that we need to
understand in order to be able to better

140
00:09:18,762 --> 00:09:21,918
communicate with people.

141
00:09:21,918 --> 00:09:25,706
Lastly, of course,
we can have errors in which the behavior

142
00:09:25,706 --> 00:09:29,585
that we're trying to encourage
has cultural consequences.

143
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:34,457
If I am encouraging you to do something
that is going to separate you from

144
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:38,405
your family, or your faith,
or your boss at your work,

145
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:41,849
those culturally-specific
barriers to action

146
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:48,273
are going to inhibit your willingness
to do what I'm asking you to do.

147
00:09:48,273 --> 00:09:54,182
Now that's a long list, but
it's by no means a complete list.

148
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:59,274
But it should give you a sense as to
why you really do need to be aware

149
00:09:59,274 --> 00:10:04,564
of how cultural issues can make
your communications ineffective.

150
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:10,256
