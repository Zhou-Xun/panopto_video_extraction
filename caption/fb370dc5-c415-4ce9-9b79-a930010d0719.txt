1
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:10,431
So whenever you're preparing
to communicate, and again,

2
00:00:10,431 --> 00:00:12,959
in either written or oral form.

3
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:17,551
One trick is, sometimes it's really
useful to create a planning document.

4
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,177
Now, you're like, [SOUND],

5
00:00:19,177 --> 00:00:23,545
why do I have to make another document
separate from what I'm trying to design?

6
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:25,168
But honestly this will help you.

7
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:30,102
It doesn't take long, but
what it does do is it forces you to think

8
00:00:30,102 --> 00:00:33,797
through your audience and
your goals in detail.

9
00:00:33,797 --> 00:00:38,582
And that helps you to remind yourself of
these issues as you're working through.

10
00:00:38,582 --> 00:00:43,374
And as you are presenting or
writing for your audience.

11
00:00:43,374 --> 00:00:45,926
So here are 5 questions
I'd like you to try and

12
00:00:45,926 --> 00:00:49,598
ask yourself every time you're
designing your communications.

13
00:00:49,598 --> 00:00:53,805
First, what are the salient
characteristics of your audience?

14
00:00:53,805 --> 00:01:00,282
Thinking about questions of demographics,
profession, their status, right?

15
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:03,936
It could be these are all people who
have a particular profession, or

16
00:01:03,936 --> 00:01:07,465
it could be these are all people
who are really sick with diabetes.

17
00:01:07,465 --> 00:01:11,063
Or it could be these are all people
who live in a particular neighborhood.

18
00:01:11,063 --> 00:01:15,123
That's being affected by, let's say,
an environmental contamination problem.

19
00:01:15,123 --> 00:01:18,786
Whatever it is,
what are those salient characteristics?

20
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:24,060
Second piece here,
what do you expect that they already know?

21
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,810
Can you reasonably expect that they know?

22
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:30,958
Let's take that example of the community
being exposed to an environmental

23
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:31,810
contaminant.

24
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,390
Can you expect that they already
know about this contaminant?

25
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,255
That the issue exists?

26
00:01:37,255 --> 00:01:40,760
Or do you need to backup and
let them know about that?

27
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,073
Can you already expect that they know
where the contamination came from?

28
00:01:45,073 --> 00:01:47,902
Or is that part of the questions
that you need to be answering

29
00:01:47,902 --> 00:01:50,063
when you are interacting
with these people?

30
00:01:50,063 --> 00:01:56,611
So again, being aware, what can you expect
that the people already know is critical.

31
00:01:56,611 --> 00:02:01,201
And that relates to this basic,
really simple summary idea,

32
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:03,860
why are they your target audience?

33
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,093
Why are you reaching out to them?

34
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:09,699
Answer that question, you're probably
going to be pretty good about

35
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:13,244
thinking about which characteristics
are the most relevant ones for

36
00:02:13,244 --> 00:02:14,968
designing your communication.

37
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:19,060
Second, what is the context in which
they will receive this message?

38
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,803
Running with my example right now,
let's say this is at a community meeting.

39
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:26,975
Where lots of community members have
gathered to speak with experts.

40
00:02:26,975 --> 00:02:31,539
That context will help you think through
what is it you want to get across in that

41
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:33,661
situation.

42
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:37,857
In that context, that's a face to
face conversation with a large group.

43
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:38,740
It's oral, but

44
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,043
maybe you've got to write a handout that
people are going to take home with them.

45
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:46,570
Maybe you're going to be videoed
having the interview, so

46
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,540
that's going to be broadcast
in that community.

47
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,366
Maybe there's letters that are being
sent out to individual homeowners.

48
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:57,337
Each of those modes is different,
and the location,

49
00:02:57,337 --> 00:03:02,469
the place in which people will be
interacting with it are different.

50
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:08,730
Big meeting, at home, in a one on one
session, at a government testimony.

51
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,449
Again, each of those contexts
are different, and what is the timing?

52
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:16,934
Is this something that's
happening really close to

53
00:03:16,934 --> 00:03:20,189
when this contamination
incident first broke?

54
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:24,876
Or is this some follow up,
it's six months later,

55
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:31,315
it's a very different time and
space than when the issue first arose?

56
00:03:31,315 --> 00:03:34,582
All of those kinds of ideas are important.

57
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:39,169
Third question,
why might the audience care?

58
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:43,763
And honestly, maybe they don't, but
if you're trying to reach out to them,

59
00:03:43,763 --> 00:03:45,585
you want them to care about it.

60
00:03:45,585 --> 00:03:49,220
And related to that is,
is what you have to say something that

61
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,301
they're likely accept, or
something they're likely to resist?

62
00:03:53,301 --> 00:03:56,472
Are they going to want to
hear what you have to say?

63
00:03:56,472 --> 00:04:02,238
Or are you trying to overcome
some hesitancy or apathy?

64
00:04:02,238 --> 00:04:07,054
Or maybe just absolute resistance to the
idea that you're trying to communicate.

65
00:04:07,054 --> 00:04:09,180
Four, what's my goal?

66
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,940
What am I trying to do here?

67
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,378
How do I measure success for
this communication?

68
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:15,888
And again, I want to be clear,

69
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,628
I want to focus your attention
on the goal for right now.

70
00:04:18,628 --> 00:04:25,268
Not the long term objective, but
how would you define success right now?

71
00:04:25,268 --> 00:04:28,637
And lastly, this point,
what are the barriers?

72
00:04:28,637 --> 00:04:33,509
Why might the audience not be able to
understand or respond to the message?

73
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:37,883
Language, if it's in the wrong language,
they can't understand it.

74
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:40,059
Time constraints could be a great message.

75
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:44,932
But if it's at a point in time in which
they're not going to be able to process

76
00:04:44,932 --> 00:04:47,533
it, too bad, not going to go anywhere.

77
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:49,555
Maybe it's emotional constraints,

78
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:52,720
using my example about
the environmental contamination.

79
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,209
If you have a bunch of residents who
are just learning about this for

80
00:04:57,209 --> 00:05:00,667
the first time, and
they are really upset by this.

81
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:05,038
You are going to have a hard time
getting a lot of complicated details

82
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,503
communicated in that moment in time.

83
00:05:07,503 --> 00:05:11,352
Same thing with a patient who might just
have been diagnosed with a particular

84
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:11,891
disease.

85
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:15,207
That's the wrong time,
not because it's not relevant, but

86
00:05:15,207 --> 00:05:19,870
because emotionally the people
aren't ready for it.

87
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,185
Maybe it's just lack of background, if you
assume too much about their knowledge,

88
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:25,481
it's not going to work.

89
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:31,028
So again, thinking about that background
knowledge as a potential barrier.

90
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:35,802
Now, I asked you to think about,
literally, writing down answers to each of

91
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:39,194
these questions, and
it might seem like a lot of work.

92
00:05:39,194 --> 00:05:41,728
But here's why I think
this is really important.

93
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:45,606
It only takes messing up
one of these things to

94
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:50,106
make your communication fail completely,
right?

95
00:05:50,106 --> 00:05:56,406
You pick the wrong context, it's done,
you use the wrong words, it's done.

96
00:05:56,406 --> 00:06:00,781
So, it really is valuable to
practice asking yourself these

97
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:05,860
questions as a check to make sure
that you're not missing something.

98
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,091
If you're going to put all this time and
effort into designing a communication.

99
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:12,732
And in many professional contexts,

100
00:06:12,732 --> 00:06:18,362
money into designing your communications,
you want to make sure it's good.

101
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:22,199
I do this process when I'm
designing classes, right?

102
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,377
I think about this class differently
than I do one in which I'm meeting

103
00:06:27,377 --> 00:06:32,045
one on one with small groups of
people in a physical classroom.

104
00:06:32,045 --> 00:06:36,780
So I'd go through these five
questions pretty much before every

105
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,453
time I design a class.

106
00:06:38,453 --> 00:06:42,166
Or every time I start to
develop a new survey or

107
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:48,050
educational intervention to think
through each of those five points.

108
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:54,035
So just to review, make sure you've got
these, 5 questions to ask each time.

109
00:06:54,035 --> 00:06:57,019
What are the salient
characteristics of the audience?

110
00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:01,244
What's the context in which
they will receive the message?

111
00:07:01,244 --> 00:07:06,782
Why might they care about this message?

112
00:07:06,782 --> 00:07:10,519
What's my goal for this communication?

113
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:15,463
And fifth, what are the barriers the
audience might face in understanding or

114
00:07:15,463 --> 00:07:17,297
responding to the message?

115
00:07:17,297 --> 00:07:19,923
That's it,
that's all you've got to remember, but

116
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:23,843
asking yourself these questions
can make a big difference.
