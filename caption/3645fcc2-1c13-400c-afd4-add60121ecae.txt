1
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,780
Laura Power: start.

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,740
Laura Power: In the main zoom session will be talking about doctoral Program.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:24,000
Laura Power: doctoral programs, and we have Professor adar here with Sarah skolnick and dish Obama, who are in the doctoral program so they're going to help you think about what it's.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,160
Laura Power: Why, they may have chosen this path and what it's like what what applicants.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:38,400
Laura Power: What might make a strong application and maybe just think through the application process and then what it's like in actual program too so we'll get to hear from Sarah and do that.

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:47,340
Laura Power: And then we'll for those of us for the MED school discussion we're going to go into the breakout room I think it's a smaller group of us that will do that, we have Dr rough.

7
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:56,490
Laura Power: From a physician from Michigan medicines, who is here, we have serena who graduated from our program from general I think was a GT or general IP she'll.

8
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,960
Serena Bidwell: si gh T.

9
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,380
Laura Power: So gap that's right so serena took some of my class.

10
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:17,370
Laura Power: has been a few years now, and so we're excited to have her back and hear about her journey and MED school and then I think Eric Steinbruck maybe joining us as well i'm looking for him in the pictures I don't see him yet, but if he joins us will have him.

11
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,030
Laura Power: he's an msc program as well as and then school.

12
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:29,670
Laura Power: So that's our session today and i've tried to make it so that their breakout room for those of you who are interested in the MED school discussion.

13
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:47,730
Laura Power: You can head into the breakout room now and we'll do our more introductions and discussion there so allison and serena, I hope, are you able to see the breakout room, you should the way i've tried to set it up, is that you can select for yourself to go into the breakout room awesome okay.

14
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,650
Laura Power: Well, you guys can have them there.

15
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:55,740
Laura Power: And then for students, if you're interested in the MED school discussion go ahead into that breakout room as well.

16
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:04,470
Laura Power: i'll i'm going to pop into that one in a minute and i'll join you all there and help with introductions and just make sure, things are going smoothly.

17
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:20,550
Laura Power: For the rest of the group here dominic is here to to help us make sure things go smoothly our students all know dominate very well so she's here, but of course we know what Professor Dr you're also in good hands so let's see here.

18
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,590
Laura Power: All right, looks like three minutes there okay so um.

19
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,260
Laura Power: Maybe to maybe you know as people log in i'll be kind of keeping an eye on the.

20
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:40,350
Laura Power: waiting room and making sure people are coming in, but hopefully they'll see that the breakout room and i've kind of sent a message to students beforehand to so they should know what to expect.

21
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:51,840
Laura Power: So i'm going to pop into the breakout room before I do that, let me just stop and see if there's any questions or to clarify anything before we get started.

22
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,590
Laura Power: everyone feels pretty good.

23
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:07,230
Laura Power: All right, all right, Dr adar i'm going to let you take it away and introduce yourself and the students and then I also check in, on the other group.

24
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:18,270
Sara Adar (she/her): sounds great so welcome everybody, I understand that this is a session on PhD programs, so you guys are all, considering that.

25
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:28,170
Sara Adar (she/her): For those of you who don't know me, I think you probably all do but, just in case not so i'm one of the Faculty and environmental an occupational at the.

26
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:34,110
Sara Adar (she/her): You know, in the department, I am also the director of the PhD program and so.

27
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:45,030
Sara Adar (she/her): I helped to run the doctoral committee which manages PhD admissions and PhD life and training, and so I am very happy to answer any questions you have.

28
00:03:45,030 --> 00:04:00,840
Sara Adar (she/her): i'm also joined by Dr usha and Sarah who are two of our wonderful PhD students who very kindly agreed to come and share some of their experiences, you know, being in your shoes and now being in the Program.

29
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:14,520
Sara Adar (she/her): And I guess what I thought i'd do for this session is sort of maybe you know have Dijon Sarah and myself, we can give you a little bit of insight into like why we decided to do a PhD or what brought us to.

30
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:24,300
Sara Adar (she/her): You know, choosing academia as a career and then I thought it might be helpful to talk a little bit about what to look for in a doctoral program when you're applying.

31
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:33,570
Sara Adar (she/her): And then answer really any questions that you guys might have about the application process and just you know the program in general.

32
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:50,580
Sara Adar (she/her): If there's anything else that you guys want us to cover why don't you just either you know unmute yourself, or, if you want to pop it in the chat and then that way, we can make sure that we have everything covered, but I thought that that was like good big picture start for everything.

33
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:58,500
Sara Adar (she/her): um so I don't know, do you want to go first you want to briefly say sort of why you decided to get a PhD.

34
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,120
sure.

35
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,100
Deesha R Bhaumik: it's been a long time since someone's asking a question actually.

36
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,430
Deesha R Bhaumik: yeah so I.

37
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:17,370
Deesha R Bhaumik: I might be a little bit unique because I went straight from undergrad to masters or PhD I think there's a lot of value for people that maybe took some time to work in.

38
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:23,100
Deesha R Bhaumik: Like all of my friends are in the future awesome because they've all worked in different spheres of public health.

39
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:30,510
Deesha R Bhaumik: or other jobs and then come back with such great experience I went direct I studied, public health and statistics for my undergrad.

40
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:38,520
Deesha R Bhaumik: Then I did my masters in biostatistics and then, when I was applying for PhDs I decided to apply for epidemiology programs.

41
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:47,940
Deesha R Bhaumik: i've always been really interested in math and statistics and i've liked those skills, but i've also always loved influencing public health.

42
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:58,050
Deesha R Bhaumik: And I felt like epidemiology was that perfect bridge between I can still do these statistical analyses I don't have to come up with my own theories, but I can use all these great methodologies that are already existing.

43
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:08,430
Deesha R Bhaumik: And then apply it to a broader public health work and then within epidemiology there's so many different fields, whether you go to chronic disease infectious disease.

44
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:19,890
Deesha R Bhaumik: Social epidemiology and even between within all of those there's different fields as well, so it's a big there's a big scope of what you want to study.

45
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:28,020
Deesha R Bhaumik: And so I decided to go into geology mostly because when I started my master's I did my masters at university of Michigan.

46
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:37,950
Deesha R Bhaumik: I found a research tradition, with a faculty Member her name is Betsy fox went into works on the oral microbiome and they became really interested in the research and to kind of guided me towards.

47
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:45,060
Deesha R Bhaumik: i'm entering that PhD and I got to see you in my lab group I got to see capabilities of what the PhD students were doing.

48
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:53,190
Deesha R Bhaumik: And I you know I could have gotten a job after my master's but I decided, I really like doing research and I like this.

49
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:59,670
Deesha R Bhaumik: Collaborative environment that academia provides for you and I was like there's more to learn, and I really want to learn.

50
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:04,920
Deesha R Bhaumik: More about epidemiology and the methods and it became you know what I applied, it was.

51
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:16,530
Deesha R Bhaumik: fall of 2019 and then, when I was getting accepted it was spring of 2021 a pandemic hit, so no one, you would have to do it was when I was applying everyone was like what are you applying to.

52
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:29,640
Deesha R Bhaumik: And then, when I started been thrown around like Oh, I know what that is right, because the pandemic and hit enter it's extremely relevant so one of my points was that it's an extremely relevant field which no one was convinced that, when I was applying but now everyone knows.

53
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,500
Deesha R Bhaumik: and

54
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,530
Deesha R Bhaumik: Do you want me to go on Dr Dr like about my experiences in the first year or, should I stop here.

55
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,430
Deesha R Bhaumik: But she might have frozen.

56
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:46,590
Deesha R Bhaumik: Okay, well, she froze but i'll go really briefly on to what i've been studying.

57
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:56,070
Deesha R Bhaumik: I have been studying So the first year of the PhD is mostly focusing on passing your qualifying exams to be comprehensive exam to make sure that you are.

58
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:05,700
Deesha R Bhaumik: Sufficient in epidemiology methods and in the meantime i've been studying disparities in oral health and i've been working on research in the oral microbiome.

59
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:21,600
Deesha R Bhaumik: And how the microbiome influences chronic diseases such as dental caries or cavities and it's been great work and then that conduct my research, combined with the classes and spend a really good like overall.

60
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:28,620
Deesha R Bhaumik: comprehensive view of I think what a typical PG program is.

61
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:40,290
Deesha R Bhaumik: OK, so I think that's a good intro does anyone have any questions before maybe I pass it.

62
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:44,520
Deesha R Bhaumik: Okay, so i'm thinking no questions.

63
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:53,010
Deesha R Bhaumik: So definitely I know we lost you for a minute I kind of did like my like why I applied and then do you want me to keep going.

64
00:08:53,010 --> 00:09:03,960
Sara Adar (she/her): that's perfect no I think that's perfect and I apologize, because my Internet or something seems to be flaking out so hopefully you get to stay with us for what.

65
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:09,690
Sara Adar (she/her): Sarah did you want to do a brief summary as to sort of what brought you to PhD and why you.

66
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,930
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: decided yeah.

67
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,510
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: yeah sorry um.

68
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,910
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: I feel like the show really covered a lot of the basis.

69
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:30,090
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: With the primary one being wanting to learn more and with a more formal education, but I was really inspired by other people who had PhDs and EPI.

70
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:37,980
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: i've always really liked public health and understanding things from like a systemic level.

71
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:49,020
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: yeah so I I enter I went to the master's program I mean it's like a long story, I wanted to pursue, public health and get a PhD.

72
00:09:49,020 --> 00:10:02,910
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: But there were just a lot of interactions throughout my life with people in public health, who are doing really interesting work and particularly people with PhDs and abby who are doing really interesting work and.

73
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:24,720
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: Like really new just to me I kind of I think like was so impressed, and like amazed, with everything that they understood, and I think of like some my wonderful professors like Professor adar, but I also think of some of my teachers, that I had especially my master's Program.

74
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:33,900
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: For episode 600 at this one ta name dq and he was just like he knew everything about episode and it just really like I wanted to be like.

75
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:43,380
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: um and then, when I was in my master's program i've always been interested in math, and so I got into math modeling and took a lot of those courses.

76
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,030
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: And you got to know the professor's there and now i'm working with one.

77
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:59,880
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: And I just with math modeling In particular, I really felt like I wanted to learn from these people and figure out what I can do with this and answer what questions, I can answer and.

78
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:10,590
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: I guess I keep I wanted to the PhD because I wanted to learn, with people that I really liked and respected and wanted to grow with them and learn from them.

79
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:20,610
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: Ultimately, to answer some of the questions that I have about like why we see the things that we do, why we see the patterns and society that we do and.

80
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,620
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: yeah and that led me to as i'll talk a little about my research interests are.

81
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,910
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: i'm broadly interested in.

82
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:37,860
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: diseases that have a stigma that have a behavior attached with stigma attached to that behavior so i'm right now i'm doing lung cancer i'm interested in head neck cancer.

83
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:50,610
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: i'm interested in St eyes and I like to answer these questions i'm looking through the lens of mathematical modeling and simulating different populations.

84
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,540
Sara Adar (she/her): awesome.

85
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,790
Sara Adar (she/her): it's always fun for me to like sort of hear what.

86
00:11:53,790 --> 00:12:11,460
Sara Adar (she/her): brought people into the program and those things, and certainly I heard from both of you guys, you know sort of the passionate about the science of learning and all those things which is wonderful, I mean for me i've always enjoyed research, so I started doing research, when I was an undergrad.

87
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:21,330
Sara Adar (she/her): You know I volunteered work for free, you know it's like washing people's dishes just to get some cash in order to do that the stuff I really wanted to do for free.

88
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:31,860
Sara Adar (she/her): And you know I did a little bit of a longer path so I did my undergraduate Masters degree, and then I went and I did work for a couple years because, for me it felt important.

89
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:41,790
Sara Adar (she/her): To get some experiences behind my belt before I went back into a PhD but you know, certainly my love of research and being able to do that.

90
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:53,490
Sara Adar (she/her): You know, a PhD offers you that opportunity to do research as a career it's not always required, but certainly makes it easier and for teaching right if.

91
00:12:53,490 --> 00:13:01,530
Sara Adar (she/her): You guys, many of you know I enjoy teaching, you know, and that is also something that that having a PhD has allowed me to do.

92
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:11,460
Sara Adar (she/her): um So those are sort of our background Oh, I guess, I could say you know, in terms of my particular area of research, I do environmental work i'm really.

93
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:21,630
Sara Adar (she/her): You know, interested in air pollution and noise exposures and health and and thinking about how you can intervene on those things to improve health ultimately.

94
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:33,360
Sara Adar (she/her): um so Those are just some sort of examples we have people coming in with you know, to get the PhD from many different walks of life and different you know sort of motivations.

95
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:41,010
Sara Adar (she/her): We have some folks in the PhD program who are really passionate about you know going to work, say, for example, for the CDC.

96
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:55,140
Sara Adar (she/her): You know, and they want to go and become officers and you know, in the CDC is program and become you know really experts that help you know the nation respond, for example, to things like coven so.

97
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:09,180
Sara Adar (she/her): We do have lots of different motivations, but I think themes you'll see our desire for continued learning and you know ability to sort of do these research and and projects as you go forward.

98
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:16,560
Sara Adar (she/her): So I mean, I guess, in terms of thinking about where to get a PhD and selecting programs.

99
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:27,750
Sara Adar (she/her): You know the way that I perceive it is you're getting a couple of things out of your PhD right, so one is you're going to be getting advanced training there's more methods courses that you do.

100
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:36,750
Sara Adar (she/her): You know more advanced topics that you're going to study in order to become an expert in a certain area so that's something you're going to want to be looking for programs that have.

101
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:42,720
Sara Adar (she/her): You know, quality classes that are going to train you in the areas that you want, and then the other.

102
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:51,210
Sara Adar (she/her): pieces really a mentored learning right so so much of the PhD is really almost like an apprenticeship.

103
00:14:51,210 --> 00:15:01,200
Sara Adar (she/her): You know where you're working one on one with your your primary mentor and also your dissertation Committee, you know so everybody in our program at least we'll have.

104
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:12,360
Sara Adar (she/her): One primary mentor who's really looking out for them, sometimes too, and then you have a committee of you know, four or five experts that can also guide you through the program and so.

105
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:25,950
Sara Adar (she/her): You know, when people are considering getting a PhD I always advise that you look very carefully at the Faculty expertise in all of the different programs that you're looking at because.

106
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:40,860
Sara Adar (she/her): Like I said, you know you really are doing a lot of this apprenticeship, and so, if you can't find somebody who's researching what you want to trade, it might not be the program for you, because that matchup is so important.

107
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:55,230
Sara Adar (she/her): um yeah and as you're, you know as you're looking at programs like I said, you know you'll want to go look at the Faculty website see what kind of projects they're doing what you know what grants, they have going on what papers they're publishing.

108
00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:03,450
Sara Adar (she/her): it's also a good idea to reach out to talk to people, so you know I will tell you i'm very accustomed to getting these emails which I.

109
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:09,030
Sara Adar (she/her): Am you know thinking about getting a PhD you know i'm wondering if you're accepting students, you know, can we chat.

110
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:21,060
Sara Adar (she/her): And those conversations can be really helpful as well, because of the way in which you know you're going to be working closely with as faculty Member for a few years, and so, making sure that the personalities jive.

111
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:28,470
Sara Adar (she/her): as well, and just you know, asking questions, how do you interact with your students are you the kind of mentor who meets with the students once a week.

112
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:35,340
Sara Adar (she/her): Are you the kind of mentor who you know just like let's the students, you know go when you're there if they if they have questions.

113
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:48,120
Sara Adar (she/her): I think those things can be really valuable, also in terms of finding the right match up for you um The other thing I would say, you know is you're going to want to be looking for.

114
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,550
Sara Adar (she/her): PhD programs is funding.

115
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:58,800
Sara Adar (she/her): So here at university of Michigan when we admit our students, we only admit students, if we can find funding packages for them.

116
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:07,950
Sara Adar (she/her): We philosophically believe it's incredibly important for students, not to have to pay out of their own pockets to earn a PhD in epidemiology.

117
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:14,010
Sara Adar (she/her): You know, and I think that many programs are that way, but it is something that you'll want to ask about.

118
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:23,970
Sara Adar (she/her): Because right, quite frankly, whether or not you make a paycheck and whether or not you're paying to do that program obviously has important you know life ramifications.

119
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:41,520
Sara Adar (she/her): I would say, those are three things you know I recommend you kind of look for when you're looking where to apply D shots or were there other things that you were looking for when you guys applied to programs, and he advice in terms of figuring out where the right spot is for you.

120
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,590
Deesha R Bhaumik: um I think you hit, most of them most important points I think something that might also be valuable to.

121
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,310
Sara Adar (she/her): Do.

122
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:57,210
Deesha R Bhaumik: And this, maybe might be more valuable like post ambitions, but if you really like a pci on paper and maybe you did it like a zoom interview or zoom like.

123
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:06,870
Deesha R Bhaumik: Call with them to reach out to students in their lab and asked, like the students about that relationship, because I, like you know a lot of guys are amazing.

124
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:13,770
Deesha R Bhaumik: But some students might not mess, with their P eyes and you kind of want to know that or you might not mesh with the other students in your lab.

125
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:24,720
Deesha R Bhaumik: Which again this is like harder to like when you're weighing like pros and cons it's harder to be like oh I don't like the students with the programs really good so it's a very personal decision but um.

126
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,570
Deesha R Bhaumik: But I think the collaborative effort that a PG takes is really important, and it's something that I really value.

127
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:39,810
Deesha R Bhaumik: And I think that I can I learned from my Peters and even like in my core like Sarah and I collaborate all the time about like hey I don't get this method like, how can you help me with this.

128
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:43,710
Deesha R Bhaumik: And it's really helpful and so just kind of knowing that environment.

129
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:52,350
Deesha R Bhaumik: And thinking about do you want to be in a PG program where there's like 40 students or do you want to be in one there's three students or something in the middle, like 12 because they all very.

130
00:18:52,350 --> 00:19:03,330
Deesha R Bhaumik: um I think that's, the most important and then I would stress funding also do ask if you know how they guarantee the funding for the PhD I think it's very important.

131
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:20,400
Deesha R Bhaumik: To just feel like okay I don't have to worry about money, and I can just focus on research, or like Am I getting paid because i'm I teach every semester, because that's also a lot of work, or is there a reject opportunity or it's all variable but and it's all very personal.

132
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,590
Deesha R Bhaumik: Are those are important things yeah I don't know.

133
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,180
If Sarah.

134
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,690
Sara Adar (she/her): yeah just before Sarah does, I was just going to jump into I mean, I think that that.

135
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:34,590
Sara Adar (she/her): Community aspect is incredibly important as well, I mean, I will say right that one of the best things about my PhD program was.

136
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:45,510
Sara Adar (she/her): Forming you know Community among my fellow students, as well as the Faculty that still continue to this day, I mean i'm you know i'm glad see you and Sarah collaborating I was trying to tell students that you're forming that.

137
00:19:45,510 --> 00:20:02,580
Sara Adar (she/her): But it is important to get kind of a pulse of the of the you know programs can sense of community and sort of how you know their supports for students and how the students will work together, I think that's an awesome awesome point Sarah did you have other thoughts to.

138
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:14,550
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: yeah I was just gonna say, one of the most valuable things for me when I was applying to PhD programs is like immediately reaching out to a bunch of different professors at different institutions.

139
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:24,420
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: And something that was interesting about that was even if that Professor like didn't have funding or really didn't have availability, they would refer me to someone else often.

140
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:35,340
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: And I think we don't think about those other opportunities or other people, and like professors know at who at their institution would be like a good fit and they kind of you know.

141
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:47,160
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: Can direct you so that's another I would definitely reach out to people and if you're thinking of applying to PhD and not be afraid of doing so.

142
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,580
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: yeah.

143
00:20:47,580 --> 00:21:04,230
Sara Adar (she/her): Excellent advice um or other questions from the crowd are ready, any thoughts or things that you guys are wondering about in terms of picking programs.

144
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:12,090
Sara Adar (she/her): Now it's like lunchtime, because we're on zoom or not all the time.

145
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:26,670
Sara Adar (she/her): Are right well seeing not at the moment, you know there's one oh yeah if you don't want to go into academia for the long term, do you recommend a PhD I think it's an amazing question.

146
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:36,270
Sara Adar (she/her): And I think it's one you guys should consider carefully, because a PhD while it can be incredibly fun and interesting and all of that.

147
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:46,530
Sara Adar (she/her): It is time, and it is challenging and It often takes I think our average of you know folks getting through the full program from like you know masters.

148
00:21:46,530 --> 00:22:00,420
Sara Adar (she/her): And like you know PhD training through graduation is like four years you know, and those are four years that you're not earning a big salary right, I mean we do pair students but i'm not gonna lie PhD.

149
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:10,260
Sara Adar (she/her): You know, salaries are not big big paychecks, so I think you have to ask yourself whether or not it's going to help you get to where you're going.

150
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:22,890
Sara Adar (she/her): If you want to be an academic like you want a job, like mine, where i'm teaching and i'm doing research in an academic setting you need a PhD it's really hard to do that without a PhD.

151
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:30,120
Sara Adar (she/her): You know in industry, there are some ways in which PhDs will help you so like I was in a consulting.

152
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:39,090
Sara Adar (she/her): You know group for three years before I came back and the pH you know, like the the the heads of the company had PhDs that did help them.

153
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:54,900
Sara Adar (she/her): But there were plenty of people with master's degrees that also work their way up and they were fine you know, in the government setting, there are some places that are too like if you're doing a research position that a PhD will help you but not every slot so.

154
00:22:54,900 --> 00:23:04,920
Sara Adar (she/her): I think that it really matters in terms of what you want to do, and I would look at the you know where you want to wind up and see how many people have those PhDs.

155
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:18,810
Sara Adar (she/her): or ask people in those settings whether or not it's necessary because I don't think PhD is are required for everything and I don't think they are for everyone.

156
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:25,710
Sara Adar (she/her): All right, any other questions on that.

157
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:37,140
Sara Adar (she/her): All right, alright, so I mean in terms of applications and everything I wonder if there's questions about that um.

158
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:46,890
Sara Adar (she/her): You know I know that applications are due, and like a month and a half or something I think our applications are doing just beginning of December.

159
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:51,690
Sara Adar (she/her): You know, go yeah Mon see you had a question.

160
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:56,490
Mansi Verma: yeah I had a question based off applications because i'm starting to work on a couple of.

161
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,740
Mansi Verma: them and i'm kind of struggling with like.

162
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:06,180
Mansi Verma: The statement of purpose or like what exactly to include other than like research interests and like.

163
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,070
stuff like that.

164
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,770
Sara Adar (she/her): yeah it's a really good question, I mean, I think.

165
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:13,200
Sara Adar (she/her): That statement of purpose.

166
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:25,890
Sara Adar (she/her): You know, we are reading for a couple of things right, so one is we're looking to see what's motivating you what you want to study and where you want to go.

167
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:31,710
Sara Adar (she/her): So that we can really understand who the right person to match with you is.

168
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:40,350
Sara Adar (she/her): So if somebody applies, you know there's a place at least on our application that we asked you to specify like which faculty look like the right fit for you.

169
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:52,080
Sara Adar (she/her): But also read those statement of purpose and if somebody is like oh my gosh this would be a perfect mentor for them, you know I see that in the statement of purpose and then i'll route their application to.

170
00:24:52,080 --> 00:25:01,110
Sara Adar (she/her): You know those faculty to review so it's that piece, I think you also are trying to demonstrate.

171
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:11,190
Sara Adar (she/her): You know your experience and and the ways in which you are ready to go and be a successful PhD student right so and as much as you can talk.

172
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:21,780
Sara Adar (she/her): A bit about you know i've researched in this area and i've you know these skills, I have from my you know life that will be valuable I think that's helpful.

173
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:33,000
Sara Adar (she/her): You know, it also allows you to highlight things and talk about you know, certain areas that you might not see explicitly in like a CV or something like that.

174
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:44,700
Sara Adar (she/her): um did I don't know Dr Sarah did you have anything else that you'd add to that in terms of like what you recommend putting in there.

175
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:53,370
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: yeah I mean and in terms of everything that Professor adar said I that was, I think what i've been told, as well, and what I did.

176
00:25:53,370 --> 00:26:02,070
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: But I would just say that I took my statement of purpose to like a bunch of different writing centers around you miss.

177
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:23,790
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: I was in the master's program here, and I would really suggest that because I actually a lot of the people who were reading it had already been in PhD programs and in other fields but gave similar perspectives of like what I should highlight.

178
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:27,690
Deesha R Bhaumik: On the only thing that I would add to that is.

179
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:41,610
Deesha R Bhaumik: Okay, I actually didn't get my secret read by like professionals, but I did have people read them what I personally like and now i'm wondering if I don't know if this actually works or not, but what I personally like to do is always my advice for any type of.

180
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:48,600
Deesha R Bhaumik: Statement of purpose, whatever field you apply just always to start with the hook, because at the end of the day, you want them to remember your application.

181
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:56,850
Deesha R Bhaumik: And so just trying to be a little more unique with like the story of like how you came to where you are I just think that's enough of the hook right like.

182
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:11,550
Deesha R Bhaumik: of how you came to where you are is also really important, not just listing all the research you've done, but I feel like getting that comprehensive view of USA academic or researcher is really important, as well.

183
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:22,200
Sara Adar (she/her): yeah I mean and that's that sort of speaks to the piece a little bit of like you know what helping helping the people reading it to learn more about you, other than just your.

184
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:34,800
Sara Adar (she/her): You know what's in the CV another thing actually I was just realizing that can be helpful to include is you know, sometimes what you see an applications are grit.

185
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,130
Sara Adar (she/her): And that sort of this concept of the people.

186
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:48,960
Sara Adar (she/her): You know who right there the you know there they have a really strong application, but maybe they didn't get a pluses in every class and then you read the statement and you're like oh.

187
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:57,240
Sara Adar (she/her): Well that's because they were working for jobs in order to support their family, while they were also doing research and they were also learning about this and then we're also doing.

188
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:06,930
Sara Adar (she/her): You know those things, so I think pieces that you can add to provide context, so if there are funny things in your transcript or in your materials right.

189
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:19,470
Sara Adar (she/her): That gives you an opportunity to talk about it and really like you know sort of highlight those things that you are proud of about yourself and then you know that make you a strong Canada.

190
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:31,440
Sara Adar (she/her): All right, we have a couple other questions coming in, so how many programs do students typically apply for unpaid she's it's a real question, I think it probably ranges.

191
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:38,940
Sara Adar (she/her): I, I have a weird situation because I was yeah my situation might not be helpful.

192
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:45,810
Sara Adar (she/her): You know, I was actually recruited for my PhD from my advisor at the time, so I only applied to one.

193
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:53,670
Sara Adar (she/her): Which is probably not common I don't know addition Sarah how many did you guys apply to.

194
00:28:53,670 --> 00:29:01,530
Deesha R Bhaumik: A I can't remember exactly, but it was somewhere between like seven and eight I believe yeah and I chose.

195
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:12,240
Deesha R Bhaumik: And I remember like strategically because there's a lot of programs throughout the country choosing programs that I thought would be the best fit for me, so there are sometimes I think like.

196
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:23,850
Deesha R Bhaumik: Oh God, one of the north Carolina schools is way more methods focus interrupt me ology program and I was, I talked to Professor and I was like oh I don't think this is a fit for me and other programs, and he didn't have enough stats for me.

197
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:29,940
Deesha R Bhaumik: And so I think I yeah I think it was like seven maybe yeah.

198
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,270
Sara Adar (she/her): Yes.

199
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,830
Sara Adar (she/her): Sir, what about you how many did you.

200
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,000
Deesha R Bhaumik: play for.

201
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,110
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: I only applied to three I, I believe.

202
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:48,090
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: If and again mine was a little bit I think it's unusual as well, I think people apply I feel like 5678 910 you know, like, I feel like that's a five to 10.

203
00:29:48,090 --> 00:30:04,170
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: From what i've heard from other people, but because, like my research is so specific like math modeling and like with looking at specific synchronizes is like such a specific field there weren't a ton of options.

204
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,480
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: So I applied to three.

205
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:13,410
Sara Adar (she/her): yeah I think I think it's right, I mean I think you're going to want to look and see which are the right programs for you and then apply to you.

206
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:18,210
Sara Adar (she/her): You know, as many as you can that have the have the right fits for you.

207
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:30,960
Sara Adar (she/her): You know, in terms of like the right faculty and everything else all right um if you were interested in multiple types of research labs do you need to narrow to one in your application.

208
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:52,020
Sara Adar (she/her): um I don't think so so um you know, the more faculty that like you might match with right in some ways, you have a higher odds of getting in because we sort of we we really you know accept students based on these mentor and mentee matchups.

209
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:59,010
Sara Adar (she/her): On the other hand, like you, don't want your application to be so broad that nobody feels as if the student is the right one for me.

210
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:11,130
Sara Adar (she/her): So the students, that I find challenging to read, are the ones were like Oh, I would love to do X and y and Z and P and D Q and everything and then, when I read it, as somebody who does you know P i'm like.

211
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:15,270
Sara Adar (she/her): i'm not really sure that you're passionate about what I do.

212
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:25,080
Sara Adar (she/her): So I think having some flexibility in your areas right, I mean, like, for example, if you were excited about genetics and mathematical modeling like those are both focused enough.

213
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:36,960
Sara Adar (she/her): You know that you could find research professors in either area, but I would just be cautious about spreading your net way too wide if that makes any sense.

214
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:49,980
Sara Adar (she/her): um okay decide to work for a little while after graduating before a PhD or other resources through us and that we can ask access for application help.

215
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,040
Sara Adar (she/her): um.

216
00:31:53,040 --> 00:32:07,860
Sara Adar (she/her): I guess i'm not sure what kind of help would be offered um I mean, I think you, you know you could always come back to your faculty members for letters of reference.

217
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:23,790
Sara Adar (she/her): um I suppose i'm not sure what else, what else would be offered like a writing Center or something I think is probably specific to U of m or like current students dish I see you take off your microphone to you.

218
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,570
Deesha R Bhaumik: I mean this is.

219
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:28,650
Deesha R Bhaumik: A great question I actually don't have the answers but um.

220
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:37,980
Deesha R Bhaumik: But in terms of like lay out let's take that person who you know graduate from the Masters routes for two years and and now playing PG and now they need three letters of REC.

221
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:46,530
Deesha R Bhaumik: And now they're reaching out to faculty that maybe they haven't spoken to in two years, I would say if you're definitely thinking about a PhD even just.

222
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:53,160
Deesha R Bhaumik: Maybe just considering it to keep in touch with those faculty from now to make sure they're at least update on what you're doing.

223
00:32:53,160 --> 00:33:01,470
Deesha R Bhaumik: You could depending how how close you are faculty, and this is a heart i've never asked someone to do this, but you could potentially ask them to like.

224
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:09,570
Deesha R Bhaumik: Draft a letter already so that they have something to look back on, I know, sometimes for medical schools they'll do that for people.

225
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:17,850
Deesha R Bhaumik: Like there's a portal that faculty can upload those letters of recommendation beforehand, even if you take a one or two gap years.

226
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:23,490
Deesha R Bhaumik: But I don't think there's something as specific like a portal for the PhD stuff.

227
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:37,110
Deesha R Bhaumik: But I think that always keeping in touch with faculty members, even as you graduate is such an important thing is to be like hi, this is an update on my life hope you're doing well right, just so that they have that connection with you.

228
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,610
Deesha R Bhaumik: You know yeah.

229
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,170
Sara Adar (she/her): I mean, I think if you're also.

230
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:42,840
Sara Adar (she/her): considering taking a gap year you know.

231
00:33:42,840 --> 00:34:01,050
Sara Adar (she/her): talking to the faculty members, you know, say, for example, that you work with the isley on and letting them know that that's your intention right then that way they're keeping it in mind when when the time passes, but certainly you know forming connections with your isley you know.

232
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:09,750
Sara Adar (she/her): faculty and things like that is always a nice way to kind of get get your foot in the door and get you know letters of reference and things like that.

233
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:15,330
Sara Adar (she/her): alexa did that answer your question is there, another way that we can address that.

234
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:18,570
Alexa Kort: yeah that was helpful, I was also just thinking about like.

235
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,160
Alexa Kort: career Center resources like with.

236
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,060
Alexa Kort: Like drafting like statement of purpose and whatnot if we were.

237
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,990
Sara Adar (she/her): selling.

238
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:41,310
Sara Adar (she/her): As alumni it's a great question, I know that many of our resources are available to alumni so, for example, like you know the job centre and things like that, I think that they, I think that they still give you access after you graduate.

239
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:45,600
Sara Adar (she/her): But she might want to reach out to some of those centers and ask.

240
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:53,670
Sara Adar (she/her): And if not even actually dish it's not a bad idea right, if you think you are going to want to apply, you could write a draft now.

241
00:34:53,670 --> 00:35:07,980
Sara Adar (she/her): You know and get some feedback and then you'll update it, you know after you work for a couple years with some more information so that would be a way to sort of leverage the resources before you go if that's what you want to do.

242
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:18,420
Sara Adar (she/her): Alright, we also had a question about allowing for PhD applicants to differ so.

243
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:29,340
Sara Adar (she/her): it's a great question, I think it may depend on the funding, so, in principle I don't think it's a problem for people to defer.

244
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:38,340
Sara Adar (she/her): The challenge is is that because we want to fund everybody, you know, the funding is going to be linked off into grants or to.

245
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:49,830
Sara Adar (she/her): You know, to gift funds or to fellowships or things like that, and so, if there's timing issues there that would be the place that I could imagine it might be tricky.

246
00:35:49,830 --> 00:36:02,100
Sara Adar (she/her): And at that point, you might just need to talk to the Faculty mentor you know to say like is it Okay, if I defer is the project still going on, and I could you know, use the money later.

247
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,810
Sara Adar (she/her): All right, Sarah you have a specific question to you about mathematical modeling.

248
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:15,600
Sara Adar (she/her): How much prior experience and mathematical modeling do you think is needed to be a student in a mathematical modeling lab.

249
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,920
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: that's a good question I think there's people who come into.

250
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:28,740
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: Our research group who have like a strong math background, and that means like getting their.

251
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:32,790
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: bachelor's degree in math or also coming from a math.

252
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,040
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: stairs and math.

253
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:49,920
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: However, there's also people coming into our research group that are traditional math people and kind of through the PhD program or through whatever program there and kind of explore math modeling by taking classes with our professors.

254
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,080
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: So.

255
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:57,750
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: I guess like kind of trying to think I guess.

256
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:16,350
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: You don't really I mean to you don't really need to have prior experience, necessarily, but if you don't then they're going to want you to take bunch of math modeling courses, I mean I would definitely recommend taking those courses, if you have any interest and also.

257
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:19,650
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: Just to like see if you like it, you know.

258
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:29,250
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: But if you have those courses, you should ideally, and you have a connection with a professor and they've seen your work and those courses, then it should.

259
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:45,510
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: You should be able to come in, we have a lot of diverse like backgrounds and a lot of people can get into math modeling because it serves a lot of different projects, and you can learn pretty quickly some like simple models that can help you understand things.

260
00:37:45,510 --> 00:38:00,870
Sara Adar (she/her): And I think sort of a general you know thought is is in any way that you can have experiences, under your belt that demonstrate that you have done what you want to do in a PhD enjoyed it.

261
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:10,440
Sara Adar (she/her): You know and we're good at it, I think, is going to improve your likelihood of being accepted just because you know if a faculty member is looking at two applications.

262
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:17,310
Sara Adar (she/her): both of whom say I want to do mathematical modeling one has taken a bunch of classes and and maybe got a little project in it.

263
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:26,580
Sara Adar (she/her): You know, and has and has demonstrated success, and still is interested in it and somebody else's just like well, it sounds really cool i've never done it before but that's what I want to do.

264
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:36,300
Sara Adar (she/her): You know, you can have you can imagine, and understand right that that person who has expertise in it, or or a background in it, you know, is going to be more compelling candidate.

265
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:52,980
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: yeah I guess for like if your PhD specific you definitely need to have some kind of experience with math modeling whether that was like through research, like work like whether you worked before or you did a Masters and took math modeling courses.

266
00:38:52,980 --> 00:39:05,160
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: My personal experience is that I was a math minor and my undergraduate and then I took whatever math modern courses, I could, while I was a master student here.

267
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,970
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: yeah.

268
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:10,560
Sara Adar (she/her): Alright, so there was a question about.

269
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:17,400
Sara Adar (she/her): prerequisites and if it's something that you haven't had an undergrad or during mph.

270
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:26,130
Sara Adar (she/her): You know if you haven't graduated yet, and you can still get it anywhere on campus right that's one way to do it before you graduate is to try and fit another.

271
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:33,870
Sara Adar (she/her): class in but otherwise yeah like you could take it at a Community college, you can take it in any spot, you know that that you can get that access.

272
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:49,200
Sara Adar (she/her): coursera and stuff now there's a lot of you know, move send all these things that are coming out that that might also be an opportunity, you know, to take coursework that you need for a PhD Program.

273
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,180
Deesha R Bhaumik: Right i'm Dr there's a question one of the first one that I think.

274
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,670
Sara Adar (she/her): We missed okay What was it.

275
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,780
Deesha R Bhaumik: um it's.

276
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:13,170
Sara Adar (she/her): From Mohammed, and it says sorry Mohammed his PhD an md comparable in the field of fb um so it's a really good question um so.

277
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:29,910
Sara Adar (she/her): At the there are most certainly faculty who have MDS and mph is so you know I work with a lot of different researchers who have that background um.

278
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:43,500
Sara Adar (she/her): They may less often in the FBI department itself, like the people I know i'm just thinking are like you know so environmental health that you know university Washington and stuff.

279
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:54,780
Sara Adar (she/her): But I think that if you have an md and an mph you can often do a lot of the research, you know that, like that she would do with a PhD.

280
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,840
Sara Adar (she/her): um.

281
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:03,810
Sara Adar (she/her): yeah it may depend on and I like that the piece that I don't know is whether or not that's changing.

282
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:15,660
Sara Adar (she/her): But certainly I do know that there are faculty out there, you know that have MDS an mph.

283
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:26,100
Sara Adar (she/her): Thank you for bringing that up that we've got missed in the stack how heavily is having a publication in peer reviewed journal weighed an application.

284
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:32,640
Sara Adar (she/her): I mean, I certainly think it's nice it's going to help you if you have one because it just demonstrates, you know.

285
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:39,120
Sara Adar (she/her): Experience in doing research, but you don't have to have one in order to be you know accepted.

286
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:54,060
Sara Adar (she/her): in any way that you can demonstrate and have been working on research, like even if it's you know, giving presentations at you know scientific conferences or things like that I think those are helpful to put on on your CV.

287
00:41:54,060 --> 00:42:06,300
Sara Adar (she/her): But if you have you know I mean if you have the chance to try and work on a paper like that for sure that does make you, you know, an even stronger candidate.

288
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:22,560
Sara Adar (she/her): Again it's sort of it's sort of demonstrating both skills at these kind of things, but also that you know what it means to do research is showing that you've actually done it before and enlightened still like it.

289
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:29,130
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: You can also have on your application, though not like a publication, but a time where you presented right.

290
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,930
Yes.

291
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:45,720
Sarah Rivero Skolnick: One two if you feel like and I remember, I was like really trying to present in my master's program, and so I can put that and show show that I knew, you know what I was doing also to have the experience but it definitely was like.

292
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,210
Sara Adar (she/her): yeah and I would recommend right and.

293
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:50,370
Sara Adar (she/her): Everybody should be presenting.

294
00:42:50,370 --> 00:43:14,910
Sara Adar (she/her): Their rate there's summer thing in forget what you call it, but the like the poster session right you could add that to your list of presentations right, you know put put on that research that you're presenting at the poster session.

295
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:30,750
Sara Adar (she/her): So the question was just whether or not you have a chance to update your application probably not so we try and make decisions, you know really by like by March.

296
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:37,920
Sara Adar (she/her): Sometimes earlier this last year we actually got out our admits much earlier than that, I think we were in February.

297
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:44,100
Sara Adar (she/her): What you could do, though, is there's often a section, where people put things in preparation.

298
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:50,730
Sara Adar (she/her): So if you're currently writing a paper, I would just listed underneath a section that says publication preparation.

299
00:43:50,730 --> 00:44:10,860
Sara Adar (she/her): Or if it's a presentation that's been accepted for presentation and spring I would just put that underneath presentations and then say to be presented, you know, in April of 2021.

300
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:29,580
Sara Adar (she/her): Very good we've got three more minutes before everybody else to go off to their next commitment any other last questions comments concerns.

301
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:34,890
Sara Adar (she/her): Okay awesome if if questions come up feel free to reach out.

302
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:46,200
Sara Adar (she/her): In the meantime, we wish you the best in your applications, and thank you, Sarah for joining us, I really appreciate you guys taking a little time to share your experiences.

303
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:51,240
Sara Adar (she/her): Right good, well, I think what.

304
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:59,790
Deesha R Bhaumik: I.

305
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:07,020
Sara Adar (she/her): Right so many I think everybody's dropping off oh hi Sydney.

306
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,830
Sydney Whack: I was going to say hi I haven't talked to you in a while.

307
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,000
Sara Adar (she/her): You know.

308
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,190
Sara Adar (she/her): it's good to see your face you doing.

309
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:24,270
Sydney Whack: Okay, no yeah I am i'm in till I get back to you because I remember after the iot conversation we had but I definitely have to catch up with us i'll be emailing you say.

310
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:27,180
Sara Adar (she/her): Okay, that sounds great.

311
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:32,010
Sara Adar (she/her): afternoon, you too bye.

312
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:36,030
Sara Adar (she/her): I will stop did you need anything.

313
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:43,320
Sara Adar (she/her): Oh wait we can't hear you.

314
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,330
Sara Adar (she/her): Tommy can you hear my stuff.

315
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:49,560
Dominique: I can't if I can't hear you either.

316
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:54,300
Sara Adar (she/her): You could put it on the chat if you had a question.

317
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,870
Sara Adar (she/her): And I my computer is being weird today to I don't know.

318
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:01,860
Sara Adar (she/her): Maybe the storms have made everything a little wonky.

319
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:05,280
Sara Adar (she/her): lightning storm last night was crazy.

320
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,860
Dominique: Yes, it was.

321
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,840
Dominique: It was.

322
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,910
Sara Adar (she/her): yeah.

323
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:19,320
Sara Adar (she/her): my daughter came came to her room and was like it's crazy yeah.
