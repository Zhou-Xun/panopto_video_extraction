1
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:22,270
All right. Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Apologies. I'm running a couple of minutes late and getting us going.

2
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,920
Great to see you all. I hope you're enjoying the very safe spring.

3
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:33,490
So maybe a winter temporary thaw, but just kind of weird right to be managing rain.

4
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:38,770
Let's see a couple of quick things and then we'll get into our groups and start get back to our project.

5
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:47,560
So I sent out a couple of announcements. One was regarding today's project, which we'll get to hear in a second.

6
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:55,870
The other was about our student led class discussions that following winter break next week will begin with.

7
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:03,190
And then the subsequent course sessions that kind of laid out how those class sessions will look.

8
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,390
I will give at least two weeks in advance. So actually,

9
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:14,590
today I can send to group number one kind of a draft of my slides or what I'll be presenting in the first part of the class so that

10
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:23,140
you kind of have a clue rate of anywhere to pick up or not to be redundant and what you do prepare for the for the class discussion.

11
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,300
And of course, let me know if you have any questions at any point on any of that stuff.

12
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,830
Exams got graded and posted yesterday evening.

13
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,640
A quick show of hands if that was viewable in canvas. OK, yeah.

14
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,060
Often I have like a 50 percent success rate and actually processing it correctly and canvas.

15
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:50,650
I mean, in general, everyone did fantastic and of the class, I was super, super happy with how well everyone did.

16
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,360
That's great.

17
00:01:51,360 --> 00:02:03,400
There was one question and it was Question three talked about food safety and what are the three agencies that play a role in food safety?

18
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,040
And actually phrased the answer or the question wrong?

19
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:13,450
I should have said I intended to say that play an important regulatory role, and that really only leaves three answers.

20
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,520
FDA, USDA and EPA.

21
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,870
Several of you answered CDC, and I was like, Wait a second, that's not right.

22
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,220
And then I read my question. Yeah, I didn't have anything in there about regulatory. So there were there were four possible answers.

23
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:34,090
And so kudos to those of you who who I think actually some of you put off for just in case.

24
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,460
But if you have any questions, let me know.

25
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:44,800
I'm happy to chat about any part of the exam because we can meet after class or meet set up a Zoom meeting or meet outside of class,

26
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,220
whatever your preference. But I again, I'm really happy with how well everybody did.

27
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:58,400
So are there any questions before we launch into today's work?

28
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,650
So our goal here will break back up into our four groups lets you kind of finish putting together your story.

29
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,270
I'm going to propose that we do our kind of five minute break right about five

30
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,920
minutes to two and then start right at two o'clock and just kind of go through,

31
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:23,590
probably on a voluntary basis, which groups want to go first and have each group have a chance to kind of present their analysis and what they

32
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:32,320
what they came up with in terms of looking through those materials in two different cases here at the university?

33
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:46,570
There's a snafu and hoping you'll remember your group so I can pull up an announcement that would have it listed whatever group that Rachel is in.

34
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:56,140
She emailed me just a few minutes ago and said, I don't know where she's managing some issues and isn't able to be here.

35
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:06,650
And it was trying to figure out how to zoom with her team, both for discussion and then perhaps also for, um, for the presentation.

36
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:14,500
So I'll kind of work with that group independently, one to break up here. These are the four groups I think we did, or even if remembered incorrectly.

37
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,230
Let's kind of do Group one in this front corner.

38
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:38,010
Group two in the back corner, Group three backed by the door and Group four up here, and I'll let you go ahead and move into those groups now.

39
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:53,050
Yes. And here.

40
00:05:11,163 --> 00:05:19,683
It was about one percent, but I was just going to say that it's really. Said that was a really test.

41
00:05:19,683 --> 00:05:23,643
Yeah, I won't spoil it for you guys are welcome.

42
00:05:23,643 --> 00:05:34,143
If you want to pull up of your whatever you going to present this computer, know how it's going to work at the log ins.

43
00:05:34,143 --> 00:05:38,463
I'm logged into canvas running the Panopto recording and zoom.

44
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:48,333
I think you can like open incognito window. OK, I'll let you take the controls and then just share screen within.

45
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:54,523
Zoom did some way reach up and see what's gone down doing work that.

46
00:05:54,523 --> 00:06:03,563
And I, you know, I think I find it the most.

47
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:13,713
Yeah. So, yeah, I'm down the road.

48
00:06:13,713 --> 00:06:40,143
Oh, they're not getting the stuff, so I think you have to do this to turn this into reality and this things was really wonderful.

49
00:06:40,143 --> 00:06:49,953
I mean, I think we have a good night every quickly when you go to your own site tonight,

50
00:06:49,953 --> 00:07:06,603
another $350 million more than the others who just put us on this, oh oh, that would be wonderful.

51
00:07:06,603 --> 00:07:21,333
And then we through, I would say, go ahead and open the door for these actors.

52
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:34,113
Oh my God. Yeah. Instead of their own.

53
00:07:34,113 --> 00:07:52,343
And. I don't think they're going to see us having to log in.

54
00:07:52,343 --> 00:08:34,273
She said yes. And you might be needed in order to share, which I could tell you.

55
00:08:34,273 --> 00:08:43,663
So she has. There.

56
00:08:43,663 --> 00:08:50,593
OK, I'm Katie, and yeah, we'll just start.

57
00:08:50,593 --> 00:08:58,903
Yeah, so we made kind of like the pros and cons for the central power plan and for the pros it

58
00:08:58,903 --> 00:09:05,083
did have like input and perspective from a lot of different members of student groups,

59
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:09,553
faculty representatives and local residents.

60
00:09:09,553 --> 00:09:14,053
And it also had a few different meetings where they invited groups from the community

61
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:19,843
to learn about the project and kind of give their input about how they were feeling.

62
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:28,063
And the electricity from the power plant is generated from steam that would otherwise be or go to waste,

63
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:35,923
which results in an efficiency of 80 percent, which is a lot higher than other power plants.

64
00:09:35,923 --> 00:09:45,703
It also reduces the university's greenhouse gas emissions by around 100000 tons per year, which is a lot.

65
00:09:45,703 --> 00:09:55,243
And the combustion turbine that was that is going to be added on would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80000 metric tons per year,

66
00:09:55,243 --> 00:10:02,203
which would lower emissions by about half, which would go towards the university's 2025 goal.

67
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:13,903
And then the cons the university kind of jumped to the power plant idea and didn't explore other options other than this or tried to run,

68
00:10:13,903 --> 00:10:24,973
other than the 80 million natural gas turbine and energy or renewable energy is kind of a market that's kind of not new,

69
00:10:24,973 --> 00:10:31,303
but definitely like getting a lot more attention as climate change becomes more severe.

70
00:10:31,303 --> 00:10:41,023
So it's an area where definitely like cheaper options would become available soon, and they kind of jump to this one.

71
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:52,153
And there was a lack of transparency within the community and members for how expensive it is and the natural gas turbine commits.

72
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:56,083
Well, this is why I said the universities rely on natural gas for decades,

73
00:10:56,083 --> 00:11:05,383
even though it's kind of fast evolving market and the natural gas price is volatile and could become economically unsustainable.

74
00:11:05,383 --> 00:11:18,373
And then the main con is just that. It was a huge investment and is a nonrenewable energy source.

75
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:27,473
They came with the notion that you think that that would interfere in you.

76
00:11:27,473 --> 00:11:28,834
Yeah. I don't know.

77
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:40,512
You know, so the computers and.
