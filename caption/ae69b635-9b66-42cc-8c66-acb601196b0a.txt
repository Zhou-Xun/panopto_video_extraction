1
00:00:09,503 --> 00:00:13,819
The built environment around us has
undeniable impacts on public health.

2
00:00:13,819 --> 00:00:18,319
But what tools are available to us to help
ensure that those impacts are positive

3
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:19,670
rather than negative?

4
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,626
Let's explore.

5
00:00:21,626 --> 00:00:25,183
The design of communities is perhaps
the greatest tool we have available to

6
00:00:25,183 --> 00:00:29,030
ensure that the built environment is
benefiting human health, not harming it.

7
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,450
I'd like to spend the next moment talking
to you about modern community design,

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,250
or something that's often
referred to as sprawl.

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,047
You can see here a photo of Mexico City,
which like many large,

10
00:00:40,047 --> 00:00:44,076
urban agglomerations sort of
exemplifies this notion of sprawl.

11
00:00:44,076 --> 00:00:45,534
But what actually leads to sprawl?

12
00:00:45,534 --> 00:00:47,684
What are the design features here?

13
00:00:47,684 --> 00:00:51,409
The first is a very strong
separation of land use by zoning.

14
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:56,432
To where mixed use, where you might have
mixed commercial and residential zones,

15
00:00:56,432 --> 00:01:00,737
are basically forgone in favor of
completely separate residential and

16
00:01:00,737 --> 00:01:02,280
commercial zones.

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,460
This again forces people to use forms of
transportation to travel, for example,

18
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,210
from home to work.

19
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:13,150
Another feature of sprawl is low density,
lots of single family separate homes or

20
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,410
dwellings.

21
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,460
Sprawl is also characterized by
a dispersion of activity centers,

22
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,770
places you basically need to take a car or
public transport to get to, and

23
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,610
relatively few local gathering places.

24
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,405
So a key tenet of sprawl is basically it's
oriented towards automobile transport

25
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:34,611
rather than active transportation
by foot or by bike.

26
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:39,040
And another final tenet of sprawl is
a trend towards disinvestment in central

27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,653
cities and

28
00:01:39,653 --> 00:01:44,489
more investment in the fringe of cities,
the suburbs or even exurbs, where again,

29
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:50,870
people are often going to have to travel
to the center of the city for work.

30
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,450
Let's take a moment now and
compare and contrast a suburban or

31
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,570
sprawl type design as we see
at the top of this image

32
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,230
to a traditional neighborhood
like we see at the bottom.

33
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,449
Here, you can see a number of things.

34
00:02:01,449 --> 00:02:05,457
So we have a major roadway sort of
cutting through the center of the image,

35
00:02:05,457 --> 00:02:06,307
left to right.

36
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:10,641
And you can see in the top section of
suburban sprawl, we have homes that are on

37
00:02:10,641 --> 00:02:14,770
streets that are discontinuous and
not very well interconnected.

38
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,580
They often for
example terminate in a cul-de-sac.

39
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,023
You'll also see a separation between
single family homes in the upper left and

40
00:02:22,023 --> 00:02:23,581
apartments in the center.

41
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:27,985
And both of these housing areas
are separated then from the business

42
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:32,324
area here represented as the mall
on the right, and from schools.

43
00:02:32,324 --> 00:02:37,115
So there's really no place for people to
travel between homes and apartments and

44
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,285
from homes and
apartments to the mall and the school,

45
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,973
basically requires people
to get into a car.

46
00:02:42,973 --> 00:02:47,093
Now, if we look at the bottom part of
the image here, towards a more traditional

47
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:51,890
neighborhood, here we can see that homes
and apartments are much more interspersed.

48
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,410
We have a central business district here,
the mall,

49
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,730
that's within walkable distance of
most of these homes and houses.

50
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,338
And the school is also very much
integrated into the community.

51
00:03:02,338 --> 00:03:04,987
So again, at the top,
in the suburban sprawl,

52
00:03:04,987 --> 00:03:09,320
we have places basically that are very
difficult to move to or around.

53
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,960
And in the bottom,
in the traditional neighborhood,

54
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,270
we have a very interconnected community
with a mixture of residential and

55
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,400
business and schooling sites.

56
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,650
Now I'd like to show you a visual
representation of the growth

57
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,850
of a community.

58
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:27,974
So what you're looking at here is
the city of Las Vegas in Nevada and

59
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:31,373
its growth between 1972 and 2013.

60
00:03:31,373 --> 00:03:33,814
So if we look all the way
back in the 1970s,

61
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:36,831
you can see the city of Las Vegas
was relatively compact.

62
00:03:36,831 --> 00:03:40,681
It's sort of restricted to the upper
right-hand corner of the image here.

63
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:44,872
But like many cities in the American
southwest, the city really started

64
00:03:44,872 --> 00:03:49,285
to sprawl in the 1980s, and
that sprawl accelerated in the 1990s.

65
00:03:49,285 --> 00:03:53,416
Until finally by the year 2013,
the city of Las Vegas had

66
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:57,795
virtually filled the entire valley
that the city is located in.

67
00:03:57,795 --> 00:04:00,770
So what tools do we actually have
available to influence our built

68
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,482
environment?

69
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:04,650
In the United States,
we really have three key things.

70
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,901
Building codes set structural and
scaling requirements.

71
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:10,468
They basically tell us how
to build buildings and

72
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:13,733
how to design the lots that
the buildings are constructed on.

73
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,403
Second, we have zoning codes.

74
00:04:15,403 --> 00:04:19,537
And so these codes specify locations for
certain activities,

75
00:04:19,537 --> 00:04:23,441
like residential use or
commercial use or industrial use.

76
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:27,295
And they also set out things like
density requirements or restrictions.

77
00:04:27,295 --> 00:04:31,207
And so here the image you see is
from the city of Portland, and

78
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:36,043
it shows a small section of Portland and
the zones that are used to determine

79
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:40,829
what can happen or what uses can be
allowed in different parts of the city.

80
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:45,268
And finally, suburban regulations
really set the stage for the layout and

81
00:04:45,268 --> 00:04:50,870
the form that each individual
community may take in a suburban area.

82
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,050
So let's look at the impact of these
three approaches on environmental health.

83
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,840
What can building codes do in
terms of environmental health?

84
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,760
Well, building codes can
require materials be used and

85
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,270
some materials may introduce exposures.

86
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,876
So the requirement that asbestos be used
in certain types of buildings up until

87
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:13,622
the 1970s in the US guarantees that
some buildings that are still standing,

88
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:16,581
residential or commercial,
contain asbestos.

89
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:20,079
It's not harmful unless it's disturbed,
perhaps through renovation, but

90
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,421
it's there, and
thereby a building requirement.

91
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:27,527
Other types of building materials may emit
things like volatile organic compounds.

92
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,583
The design of the building
can also impact exposures.

93
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:35,356
So particularly in the 1970s and
1980s, we move towards what's called

94
00:05:35,356 --> 00:05:39,427
a tighter building design,
meaning we try to minimize leakage of air

95
00:05:39,427 --> 00:05:43,797
between indoors and outdoors to try
to hold in heat and air conditioning.

96
00:05:43,797 --> 00:05:47,159
But the tighter the building and
the less exchange of fresh air,

97
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:50,600
the higher the risk of
indoor air quality problems.

98
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,220
And finally where we actually site
the buildings can also impact

99
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,210
environmental health.

100
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,871
So in another module,
we talked about radon and

101
00:05:57,871 --> 00:06:00,809
its presence in certain
parts of the United States.

102
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:04,642
If you construct a building in parts of
the United States where radon is present

103
00:06:04,642 --> 00:06:08,825
in high concentrations, there are certain
requirements, for example, putting in

104
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:14,680
a liner underneath the building to prevent
radon from intruding into that building.

105
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,880
What about zoning codes?

106
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,460
What impact can these have
on environmental health?

107
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,930
Well, anytime we separate land uses,
we're creating at least the potential for

108
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,980
disparities in health and health equity
and also for environmental justice issues.

109
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,367
I'll show you an example here
from the city of New York.

110
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:31,907
So you see the map here.

111
00:06:31,907 --> 00:06:37,509
In this map of New York City in dark black
lines are outlined manufacturing areas.

112
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:41,597
And the shading on the map basically
shows the fraction of minority

113
00:06:41,597 --> 00:06:44,882
populations throughout
the city with darker shading

114
00:06:44,882 --> 00:06:48,398
indicating a higher fraction
of minority populations.

115
00:06:48,398 --> 00:06:52,056
And what you'll see with this map
unfortunately is that most of

116
00:06:52,056 --> 00:06:56,336
the manufacturing zones are located
in areas with the highest fraction of

117
00:06:56,336 --> 00:06:57,799
minority populations.

118
00:06:57,799 --> 00:07:00,807
Now, we know minority populations
tend to be marginalized, and

119
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:04,800
they tend to also to have other issues
beyond environmental health challenges.

120
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,780
So here's an example where zoning may be
driving environmental health problems,

121
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,230
particularly for minority communities.

122
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,220
Finally, we can talk about
the impact of suburban regulations

123
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,300
on environmental health.

124
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,970
So there have been many studies that have
compared to traditional neighborhood

125
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:25,300
designs to other more modern types of
designs looking at different measures.

126
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,430
So for example, here we see
a sequence of images on the left.

127
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,880
We have a more traditional
neighborhood development.

128
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,300
And so here we would see
an interconnected grid of streets.

129
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,558
To the right of that,
we have a more suburban style development.

130
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,276
So here we have larger homes,
less density,

131
00:07:41,276 --> 00:07:45,720
and streets that are not interconnected
and often end in cul-de-sacs.

132
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,545
The third image to the right is an
enclosed community or a gated community,

133
00:07:49,545 --> 00:07:52,532
which makes access to
the surrounding area challenging.

134
00:07:52,532 --> 00:07:56,133
And finally, we have on the far
right a cluster housing development.

135
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:59,444
Basically, this is a cluster of
homes that's fairly remote from

136
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:00,657
anything else nearby.

137
00:08:00,657 --> 00:08:05,144
So research has shown us that the suburban
type of design generally has lower

138
00:08:05,144 --> 00:08:10,195
walkability and lower physical activity
opportunities than a traditional design,

139
00:08:10,195 --> 00:08:15,198
but also may be associated with higher
perceived well-being among its residents.

140
00:08:15,198 --> 00:08:19,041
We have found through many types of
research that this enclosed design,

141
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:23,325
which really restricts this residential
community from everything around it,

142
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:26,790
tends to have the lowest or
worst scores in terms of walkability or

143
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,610
physical activity opportunities or
well-being.

144
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,810
I'd like to wrap up by talking
about an alternative design for

145
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,930
how to make our
transportation system better.

146
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,970
This is a concept called complete streets.

147
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:43,080
And the notion here is that we enhance our
roadways to make moving around communities

148
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,860
easier and safer for everybody.

149
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,360
So on the edge of the street, on the left
side, we have a gathering space, basically

150
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,110
a wide area where it's possible for people
to mill about and have a conversation.

151
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,694
To the right of that, we have
a physically separated bicycle lane.

152
00:08:58,694 --> 00:09:00,310
And I say physically separated,

153
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,234
you'll see there is a curb between the
bicycle lane and the gathering space, and

154
00:09:04,234 --> 00:09:08,280
also a curb between the bicycle lane and
the adjacent motor vehicle lane.

155
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,980
So here we're separating a vulnerable road
user, bicyclists, from much heavier and

156
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,730
much more dangerous motor vehicle traffic.

157
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,400
In the center of the image,
we have a lane for motor vehicles.

158
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,510
So that's dedicated for
sort of the general public.

159
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,485
To the right of that, we have a lane
that's specifically dedicated to transit.

160
00:09:25,485 --> 00:09:29,725
And so the idea here is the general public
can be caught in traffic in the motor

161
00:09:29,725 --> 00:09:34,364
vehicle lanes, whereas the transit lanes
are ideally less congested and allow for

162
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:37,840
a much more predictable and
speedy transit-based commute.

163
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,570
Then we have a bus stop
to the right of that.

164
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,595
And finally, we have a distinct and

165
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:45,420
discrete walking pathway at
the very far right of this image.

166
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,212
So here, everybody is able to get to their
destination, but we have them physically

167
00:09:50,212 --> 00:09:54,329
separated in a way that increases
safety and increases efficiency, and

168
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:58,056
quite frankly can also result in
a more attractive streetscape.

169
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:02,580
So the built environment, again, does have
undeniable influences on public health,

170
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,551
but the good news is we have many tools
available to us to improve public health

171
00:10:06,551 --> 00:10:10,752
through the way we design
our built environment.
