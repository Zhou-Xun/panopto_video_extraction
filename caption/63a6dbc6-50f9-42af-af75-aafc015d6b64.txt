00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:28,600
One of the very special parts about our course is the ability that you will have to apply what you're learning about the health care system,

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,010
public health, finance, budgeting, human resources,

3
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:43,510
negotiation and advocacy directly to a federally qualified health center called CHAZZ Community Health and Social Services.

4
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,809
Now, what I'm really excited about is the opportunity.

5
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:55,270
You will have to think carefully about what you're learning throughout our course and and really engage in the work that Chaz is working on.

6
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,920
To apply what you've learned to some of the work that they are doing.

7
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,919
So we're going to have throughout our course, the opportunity to directly think about how Chaz,

8
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,980
as an organization, interfaces with the public health system, with the health care system,

9
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:19,120
how as an organization it is contending with issues related to finance and budgeting, how negotiation plays a role,

10
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:28,960
how human resources plays a role, and ultimately what role advocacy plays inside of making Chaz a thriving organization in southwest Detroit.

11
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,290
So as we get started with our course, I want you to really,

12
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:41,019
really think through each part of what we learn and take it as an opportunity to apply these principles and really

13
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:47,710
dig in to the important work that's happening on the front lines inside of communities like Southwest Detroit.
