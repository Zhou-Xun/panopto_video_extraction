1
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:12,715
that are used to calculate incidence, otherwise known as risk, in epidemiological studies.

2
00:00:12,715 --> 00:00:19,715
And I just want to say a quick note. I hope that you have all seen the announcement that I put on Canvas this morning.

3
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:24,715
And this recording is happening on Tuesday, September 8th.

4
00:00:24,715 --> 00:00:34,715
The Graduate Employees Organization, or GEO, is on strike in support of a safe and just pandemic for all.

5
00:00:34,715 --> 00:00:44,715
As your instructor, I support GEO's right to strike. I also am in solidarity with many of the causes that GEO cite in their strike.

6
00:00:44,715 --> 00:00:55,715
For this reason, the lecture material for the week of September 8th to 11th is going to be a synchronous in order to promote access

7
00:00:55,715 --> 00:01:01,715
to the course material and ensure that everyone maintains their access to the course while GEO is on strike.

8
00:01:01,715 --> 00:01:08,715
And while many students are in solidarity with GEO while they strike, recording

9
00:01:08,715 --> 00:01:13,715
the material over Panopto using this method rather than holding it over

10
00:01:13,715 --> 00:01:18,715
Zoom allows me to create a higher quality recording that can be closed

11
00:01:18,715 --> 00:01:24,715
captioned and sped up or slowed down more easily than a Zoom recording can be.

12
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:25,715
So with that in mind,

13
00:01:25,715 --> 00:01:34,715
I'm going to prerecord the material with the hopes that this improves accessibility while allows me to stand in solidarity with GEO

14
00:01:34,715 --> 00:01:38,715
There will still be a optional,

15
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:45,715
informal in-class session in our Zoom classroom from 11:00 until 11:50 on Tuesday and

16
00:01:45,715 --> 00:01:54,715
Thursday for those who wish to work in their small groups to complete the class activities and exercises.

17
00:01:54,715 --> 00:02:05,715
However, please know that I will not retaliate against any students who choose not to attend EPID 601 this week in support of the GEO strike.

18
00:02:05,715 --> 00:02:13,715
I've also expanded my office hours, if anyone wishes to talk or check in, it doesn't even need to be course related necessarily.

19
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:16,715
We can talk about the GEO strike, COVID-19, and everything else that's going on.

20
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:20,715
Please feel free to book an appointment slot with me. Okay.

21
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:27,715
Let's get started. So in the parts one and part two of this session,

22
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:36,715
we learned about different measures that are used to assess disease outcomes, namely proportion and ratio type measures.

23
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:46,715
We also learned about person time. So we're going to do a brief review of person time and we're going to talk about methods to calculate incidents.

24
00:02:46,715 --> 00:02:56,715
So in this session right now, I'm going to introduce the simple cumulative risk method, which is also known as the incidence proportion method.

25
00:02:56,715 --> 00:03:03,715
I will introduce the actuarial or life tables method to calculating cumulative incidence.

26
00:03:03,715 --> 00:03:05,715
I will introduce the incidence density method.

27
00:03:05,715 --> 00:03:15,715
But the incidence density method and the Kaplan-Meier product limit method will mostly be discussed in part four and five of this lecture session.

28
00:03:15,715 --> 00:03:22,715
So you can view this entire week as a as one session that's broken into six parts.

29
00:03:22,715 --> 00:03:28,715
So for Thursday, you'll learn about the incidence density and Kaplan-Meier product limit methods.

30
00:03:28,715 --> 00:03:35,715
And then I'm going to close this session with a brief word on the relationship between risk and rates and the relationship between incidents,

31
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:42,715
prevalence and duration. So let's talk about person time.

32
00:03:42,715 --> 00:03:46,715
Last, I guess, not last class, but in the last recording,

33
00:03:46,715 --> 00:03:53,715
we introduced the idea of person time as being the length or span of time that an individual is at risk

34
00:03:53,715 --> 00:04:02,715
for the disease outcome in question and is present in a cohort or study or population under surveillance.

35
00:04:02,715 --> 00:04:12,715
So the total person time is the sum of individual person time contributions to the follow up period.

36
00:04:12,715 --> 00:04:24,715
As an example, we could accumulate 10 person years by following 10 people for one year each or by following one person for ten years total.

37
00:04:24,715 --> 00:04:28,715
You may see total person time referred to as population time.

38
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:35,715
This is a terminology that I often find confusing. So in this class, we will talk about individual person

39
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:42,715
time for one person, and total person time for a population.

40
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,715
Here's an example you will often see:

41
00:04:45,715 --> 00:04:55,715
Person time data are expressed in this way where time is on the X axis here; I've shown it in years, but it can also be done in months or weeks.

42
00:04:55,715 --> 00:05:01,715
And then you have a number of participants shown on the Y axis with lines drawn out

43
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:07,715
over time to indicate the amount of time that each person or participate can, sorry,

44
00:05:07,715 --> 00:05:12,715
each person or participant contributes to the time under study.

45
00:05:12,715 --> 00:05:18,715
Here the outcome is myocardial infarction or MI,

46
00:05:18,715 --> 00:05:26,715
and that's indicated in the figure. We've also indicated drop out because we know that people often drop out of epidemiological studies;

47
00:05:26,715 --> 00:05:30,715
either they decide they no longer wish to take part. Maybe they move away.

48
00:05:30,715 --> 00:05:38,715
Maybe they die. Or if we're looking at an actual population under surveillance, people might migrate out of the population.

49
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:46,715
And similarly, they may also die. So we could ask the question, what is the person time contributed by the study participants,

50
00:05:46,715 --> 00:05:56,715
assuming that all dropouts and disease onsets occur exactly at the follow up interval year, so that what that means is we assume when there is an MI

51
00:05:56,715 --> 00:06:02,715
recorded at time equals four, it happens exactly at that time equals four.

52
00:06:02,715 --> 00:06:11,715
Even though in reality we know that that myocardial infarction may have occurred at some unknown time point in between years three and four.

53
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:15,715
We just check in on people exactly at year three and exactly year four.

54
00:06:15,715 --> 00:06:18,715
So that's when it gets recorded.

55
00:06:18,715 --> 00:06:29,715
So in order to calculate the person time, we could do this visually by simply adding up the number of years under study.

56
00:06:29,715 --> 00:06:38,715
So we can see from the figure that person one is included in the study for the full 10 years of observation.

57
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:47,715
Person two is included in the study for four years of observation. They then develop the myocardial infarction outcome and they no longer contribute

58
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:53,715
person time at risk because they're no longer at risk for the outcome.

59
00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:58,715
Person number three contributes nine years of follow up time at risk,

60
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:05,715
and then they develop the myocardial infarction and then they are no longer at risk of the outcome.

61
00:07:05,715 --> 00:07:13,715
Person four is under observation in the follow up period for four years, and then they drop out of the study.

62
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:24,715
And Person five is under observation for seven years. And then they develop the myocardial infarction and they are no longer at risk of the outcome.

63
00:07:24,715 --> 00:07:28,715
So we would simply total the number of years of observation for all of these people.

64
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:37,715
And here it would be 10 plus four plus nine plus four plus seven, which is thirty four years.

65
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:46,715
And here, recall that we are assuming that all dropouts and disease onsets occur exactly at the follow up interview here.

66
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:50,715
We can also calculate this using the formula shown at the bottom of the slide.

67
00:07:50,715 --> 00:07:55,715
If we did not have the kind of visual data that I'm showing you here.

68
00:07:55,715 --> 00:08:02,715
We can also calculate the total person time under observation in an alternative way.

69
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:09,715
So, again, we know that dropouts and disease onsets occur at some unknown point in time.

70
00:08:09,715 --> 00:08:18,715
In between follow up interval years. It's just a convenience to record it as happening exactly at the time of the follow up.

71
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:29,715
So specifically here, a dropout or myocardial infarction such as experienced by person to in person four that is recorded at T equals four,

72
00:08:29,715 --> 00:08:34,715
probably actually happened at some unknown point in time.

73
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:38,715
In between T equals three and T equals four.

74
00:08:38,715 --> 00:08:45,715
What we do in that case is we would often then assign the person who drops out or develops the disease

75
00:08:45,715 --> 00:08:54,715
outcome zero point five years of observation for that final year that they are under observation.

76
00:08:54,715 --> 00:09:00,715
So let's redo the person time calculation making that assumption.

77
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:08,715
Person one still contributes a full 10 years of follow up time person to who is recorded at T equals four

78
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:16,715
as having a myocardial infarction would in this case contribute three point five years of follow up time,

79
00:09:16,715 --> 00:09:23,715
because we are assuming that their myocardial infarction occurred at some point in time between T equals three and T equals four.

80
00:09:23,715 --> 00:09:29,715
Similarly, person three, who is recorded as having a myocardial infarction at T equals nine,

81
00:09:29,715 --> 00:09:33,715
would contribute eight point five years of follow up time because we are

82
00:09:33,715 --> 00:09:38,715
assuming that their myocardial infarction occurs at some unknown point in time.

83
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:46,715
In between T equals eight and T equals nine. So we indicate this as eight point five years to reflect that uncertainty.

84
00:09:46,715 --> 00:09:52,715
And similarly, for a person for we would say that they contributed three point five years of follow up time and four person five.

85
00:09:52,715 --> 00:09:56,715
We would say that they contributed six point five years of follow up time.

86
00:09:56,715 --> 00:10:04,715
This gives us a total of thirty two years of follow up time when we account for this uncertainty of the disease.

87
00:10:04,715 --> 00:10:08,715
Onsets and dropouts happening at some unknown point in time.

88
00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:19,715
In between follow up interval years. Let's move on to talking about methods that we use to calculate incidents.

89
00:10:19,715 --> 00:10:24,715
So first, I want to talk about why we have four different methods.

90
00:10:24,715 --> 00:10:28,715
Why do we have four different methods and how do we know which one we would use?

91
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:33,715
Well, the answer is the choice of method depends on the data that you have.

92
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:42,715
It depends how much information you have about the people who drop out of the study and who develop the disease outcome under study.

93
00:10:42,715 --> 00:10:50,715
The simple cumulative method is effective, and it works when we have complete follow up on all individuals.

94
00:10:50,715 --> 00:10:55,715
This is often an unrealistic assumption because it would mean that there are no study

95
00:10:55,715 --> 00:11:02,715
dropouts and all individuals are followed throughout the entire time under observation.

96
00:11:02,715 --> 00:11:07,715
We can use the actuarial method when we have incomplete follow up.

97
00:11:07,715 --> 00:11:10,715
And that would be just as I showed you in the previous example.

98
00:11:10,715 --> 00:11:17,715
So we have data on cases and withdrawal, which is another phrase I'm using here to refer to drop out,

99
00:11:17,715 --> 00:11:23,715
limited to interval periods. So this means rather than absolute continuous monitoring,

100
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:28,715
we follow up on people over intervals such as every one year or every two years.

101
00:11:28,715 --> 00:11:36,715
And so the exact time of follow up is unknown. We can use the incidence density method.

102
00:11:36,715 --> 00:11:42,715
And this is preferred when the exact time of onset or withdrawal is known.

103
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:49,715
And we can use it when we have rate data available. We'll talk a little bit more about this later.

104
00:11:49,715 --> 00:11:54,715
And we can use the Kaplan-Meier product limit method when we have incomplete follow up.

105
00:11:54,715 --> 00:12:02,715
And specifically when we have exact available, sorry, exact data available for the cases who have the disease onset.

106
00:12:02,715 --> 00:12:07,715
But the data on steady withdrawal is limited to interval periods.

107
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:15,715
So I will go through examples of calculating each of these types, calculating risk according to each of these types of methods.

108
00:12:15,715 --> 00:12:24,715
And when I do this, please keep in mind the reasons why we would choose each type of method, depending on the data that we have.

109
00:12:24,715 --> 00:12:29,715
So let's talk about the simple cumulative risk method.

110
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:37,715
Recall from part two that the cumulative incidence, which is the same thing as the incidence proportion,

111
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:48,715
is calculated as the number of incident cases in a given population divided by the number of disease free people in the population

112
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:52,715
at the start of the follow up period, or t0.

113
00:12:52,715 --> 00:12:58,715
Note here that we use the acronym CI to refer to cumulative incidence.

114
00:12:58,715 --> 00:13:09,715
Please don't confuse this with CI as in confidence intervals. The subscript on risk, which is denoted by the R with the little hat,

115
00:13:09,715 --> 00:13:15,715
meaning it is our estimate of risk, which is the same as the subscript for the cumulative incidence,

116
00:13:15,715 --> 00:13:20,715
again, with a hat, meaning is an estimate indicates t0, t.

117
00:13:20,715 --> 00:13:27,715
This means risk over the interval from t0 so the start of the interval to time t which

118
00:13:27,715 --> 00:13:35,715
is the given follow up time that we choose to define as the end of the follow up interval.

119
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:43,715
And you'll often see data that look like in the figure on the left hand side of the slide when thinking about estimating risk,

120
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:48,715
whether it's according to the simple cumulative method or another one of our methods.

121
00:13:48,715 --> 00:13:52,715
So similar to the example that I showed you in the very beginning.

122
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:59,715
We have the follow up time in years shown on the X axis and subject I shown on the Y axis.

123
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:09,715
And here there are seven subjects. And as per the key, the dashed line indicates that the subject is living without disease,

124
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:14,715
which means they are at risk and contributing person, time to the follow up.

125
00:14:14,715 --> 00:14:19,715
The solid line indicates the individual is living with the disease,

126
00:14:19,715 --> 00:14:24,715
which means they are not at risk and not contributing person, time to the follow up.

127
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:36,715
Xs indicate new incident occurrences of the disease outcome and circles indicate death, which here we are considering to be equivalent to study Drago.

128
00:14:36,715 --> 00:14:42,715
So if we were to calculate the simple cumulative incidence or the incidence proportion,

129
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:54,715
we would simply take the number of incident cases divided by the total number of at risk subjects at the start of the follow up period.

130
00:14:54,715 --> 00:15:04,715
And we've indicated that (t0, t) is the interval zero to five because we are following people up from zero years, up to five years.

131
00:15:04,715 --> 00:15:12,715
So we can look at this figure and we see that there are three incident occurrences of the disease outcome.

132
00:15:12,715 --> 00:15:20,715
These are individuals four, five and seven. So our numerator in this formula is three.

133
00:15:20,715 --> 00:15:27,715
We then look at how many individuals are at risk for the disease outcome at the start of the follow up period.

134
00:15:27,715 --> 00:15:31,715
And it is five of the seven individuals that is individuals.

135
00:15:31,715 --> 00:15:37,715
One, two, four, five and seven. That is the denominator of our formula.

136
00:15:37,715 --> 00:15:42,715
Please note that individuals, three and six were already living with the disease outcome.

137
00:15:42,715 --> 00:15:49,715
So they are not contributing person time and they are also not at risk for the disease outcome.

138
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:54,715
So the cumulative incidents or incidents proportion is 60 percent.

139
00:15:54,715 --> 00:15:59,715
Also note here that while this figure does show person time of follow up,

140
00:15:59,715 --> 00:16:09,715
we don't actually use any information about the person time in calculating cumulative incidents otherwise known as the incidents proportion.

141
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:19,715
Recall from the first part of this lecture that  proportional measures do not inherently include time in the measure itself.

142
00:16:19,715 --> 00:16:25,715
So we do not use person time when we calculate cumulative incidence or incidence proportions.

143
00:16:25,715 --> 00:16:31,715
However, it is important to state the time period that the measure of incidence refers to.

144
00:16:31,715 --> 00:16:39,715
So this would be a 60 percent cumulative incidence over the five year follow up period.

145
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:45,715
As you might be already inferring, there are some limitations of the simple cumulative method.

146
00:16:45,715 --> 00:16:50,715
First, it assumes that all individuals are observed for the entire follow up period.

147
00:16:50,715 --> 00:16:57,715
It doesn't account for a steady drop out or migration out of the population. It also assumes no competing risks.

148
00:16:57,715 --> 00:17:02,715
So we assume that subjects will not die of another cause or become not at risk.

149
00:17:02,715 --> 00:17:09,715
And these assumptions are usually unrealistic. And so there are big limitations to the simple cumulative incidence method.

150
00:17:09,715 --> 00:17:12,715
And there are only certain situations in which we can actually calculate it

151
00:17:12,715 --> 00:17:20,715
and be confident that it accurately reflects the true risk in the population.

152
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:27,715
Let's go through an example. Let's say that 40 thousand women with no history of breast cancer are observed for five months,

153
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:31,715
60 develop breast cancer on the first day of the second month of observation.

154
00:17:31,715 --> 00:17:35,715
What is the cumulative incidence of breast cancer?

155
00:17:35,715 --> 00:17:43,715
Recalling the simple formula for cumulative incidence, it is simply 60 women who developed breast cancer,

156
00:17:43,715 --> 00:17:49,715
over 40000 women, which is the number of women who are at risk at the start of the follow up period.

157
00:17:49,715 --> 00:17:59,715
This is a cumulative incidence of zero point zero zero one five cases over five months.

158
00:17:59,715 --> 00:18:04,715
Let's move on to the actuarial method. So this is an improvement to the cumulative risk method.

159
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:12,715
Assuming that we have the data that let us calculate it in the actuarial method to calculate risk, we use life tables.

160
00:18:12,715 --> 00:18:18,715
This allows us to estimate risk accurately over follow up intervals when there are study withdrawals.

161
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:25,715
And what we essentially do here is calculate the probability of the disease outcome as well as survival for each interval.

162
00:18:25,715 --> 00:18:29,715
So this would be year one year two, year three, year four and so on.

163
00:18:29,715 --> 00:18:33,715
And then we calculate the cumulative probability.

164
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:41,715
We then ultimately calculate the cumulative risk of the outcome, which is one minus the cumulative probability of survival.

165
00:18:41,715 --> 00:18:52,715
This will become more clear in a moment as we'll go through an example. So step one, we calculate the effective population size at each interval.

166
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:56,715
Step two, we calculate the proportion who died at each interval.

167
00:18:56,715 --> 00:19:01,715
Step three, we calculate the proportion who survived at each interval.

168
00:19:01,715 --> 00:19:06,715
Step four. Then we calculate the cumulative survival proportion.

169
00:19:06,715 --> 00:19:16,715
And then we estimate the risk of the outcome as one minus the cumulative survival proportion at the very end of the total follow up period.

170
00:19:16,715 --> 00:19:23,715
Here's what this looks like. So here we have our in time intervals shown in rows.

171
00:19:23,715 --> 00:19:29,715
So we have a total of five years of follow up time that split into one year intervals.

172
00:19:29,715 --> 00:19:33,715
The next column shows the number of individuals who are alive at T not.

173
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:37,715
And that would be the number who are alive at the start of that interval.

174
00:19:37,715 --> 00:19:42,715
The number who died during that interval. The number who withdrew from the population.

175
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:47,715
And from that information, we can calculate the effective population size at each interval.

176
00:19:47,715 --> 00:19:54,715
The proportion who died at each interval. The proportion who survived. And then the cumulative survival proportion.

177
00:19:54,715 --> 00:19:59,715
Note here that the outcome is, in fact, death. When we're calculating the life table.

178
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:08,715
And I think that this is a useful example because life tables are often used to calculate life expectancy in populations.

179
00:20:08,715 --> 00:20:14,715
And so they're primarily of interest when we're thinking about mortality as the outcome.

180
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:19,715
So let's go through this table. There's about to be a lot of numbers flying across the screen.

181
00:20:19,715 --> 00:20:24,715
I apologize if this is confusing or even nausea inducing.

182
00:20:24,715 --> 00:20:31,715
Please don't worry if you don't understand it the first time through the class activity as well as exercises for this week session,

183
00:20:31,715 --> 00:20:38,715
we'll have you work with life table data. And I think that it becomes much more clear after working through an example on your own.

184
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:44,715
So let's go through it. So first, what we want to do is calculate the effective population size.

185
00:20:44,715 --> 00:20:51,715
All we do to calculate this within each interval is take the number who are alive at t0,

186
00:20:51,715 --> 00:20:57,715
which is again the start of the interval minus point five times the number who withdrew.

187
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:03,715
The reason why we do point five times the number who withdrew is because if you recall from earlier,

188
00:21:03,715 --> 00:21:08,715
we don't know the exact time point at which withdrawals occur.

189
00:21:08,715 --> 00:21:15,715
So a withdrawal in the first year happens at some point in time between times zero and year one.

190
00:21:15,715 --> 00:21:23,715
And similarly, a withdrawal in the second year happens at some unknown time point between year one and year two.

191
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:30,715
And so to account for this uncertainty, we just assume that withdrawals happen halfway through with a follow up interval,

192
00:21:30,715 --> 00:21:35,715
which is why we multiply the number of withdrawals by point five.

193
00:21:35,715 --> 00:21:41,715
So we take the number alive at TI Not, which is three hundred and seventy five at the start of the first year,

194
00:21:41,715 --> 00:21:46,715
minus point five times the number of withdrawals, which is actually zero in the first year.

195
00:21:46,715 --> 00:21:52,715
So the effect of population size in the first year is three hundred and seventy five.

196
00:21:52,715 --> 00:21:57,715
And I've calculated this out for all years. So you would basically do this across the road.

197
00:21:57,715 --> 00:22:04,715
So within each time interval, take the number alive at the start of the interval, minus point five times the withdrawals to get one.

198
00:22:04,715 --> 00:22:11,715
So you get the effect of population size. And in the second year, it's one hundred and seventy five point five.

199
00:22:11,715 --> 00:22:15,715
The next step is to calculate the proportion who died within each interval.

200
00:22:15,715 --> 00:22:23,715
To do this, we simply take the number who died during that interval divided by the effective population size in that interval.

201
00:22:23,715 --> 00:22:31,715
And that gives us the proportion who died. And so I'm showing this as calculated within each of the time intervals.

202
00:22:31,715 --> 00:22:36,715
Step three is to calculate the proportion who survived at each interval. This one's really simple.

203
00:22:36,715 --> 00:22:45,715
It's simply one minus the proportion who died. So just take one minus the values in the column for the proportion who died across all intervals.

204
00:22:45,715 --> 00:22:53,715
And this is what you get. Next, we calculate the cumulative survival proportion in the first year.

205
00:22:53,715 --> 00:22:58,715
It is simply the same as the proportion who survived in the second year.

206
00:22:58,715 --> 00:23:03,715
It would be the proportion who survived in year two times, the proportion who survived.

207
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:08,715
In year one, this gives us point two, seven, seven and then and goes so on.

208
00:23:08,715 --> 00:23:14,715
So the cumulative survival proportion in the third year would be the proportion who survived.

209
00:23:14,715 --> 00:23:18,715
In your three times your two times year one. And we do this the whole way.

210
00:23:18,715 --> 00:23:27,715
Going down the column for the cumulative survival proportion. And we ultimately get a cumulative survival of twelve point four percent.

211
00:23:27,715 --> 00:23:32,715
And then recall that the cumulative risk of death is one minus the cumulative survival.

212
00:23:32,715 --> 00:23:44,715
So the cumulative risk is eighty seven point six percent. So everything that I just showed you, in fact, translates to this simple equation here.

213
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:52,715
So this is what we get for the cumulative risk or incidents within each interval.

214
00:23:52,715 --> 00:23:59,715
So we take the number of incident cases divided by the number of disease free subjects at the start of the interval,

215
00:23:59,715 --> 00:24:11,715
minus half the number of withdrawals. And to get the cumulative survival and risk outputs from the table, we use this formula.

216
00:24:11,715 --> 00:24:14,715
And so I know this formula might look a little bit scary,

217
00:24:14,715 --> 00:24:21,715
but I promise it simply just shows you how to calculate what we just did in the previous table.

218
00:24:21,715 --> 00:24:32,715
So to express this formulae, we estimate the risk for an accumulated period t0 through to tj of Delta years,

219
00:24:32,715 --> 00:24:39,715
where by combining the one year estimates of risk and the cumulative incidence

220
00:24:39,715 --> 00:24:45,715
for interval j is the Delta jth year cumulative incidence for the jth time,

221
00:24:45,715 --> 00:24:51,715
interval and recall j is a dummy subscript for the jth stratum.

222
00:24:51,715 --> 00:24:53,715
If this notation is confusing,

223
00:24:53,715 --> 00:25:04,715
please don't forget that Alan really generously recorded a cheat sheet for mathematical notation and made the cheat sheet available.

224
00:25:04,715 --> 00:25:10,715
I think it's in the format of a PowerPoint slide and it's on the canvas page for today's class.

225
00:25:10,715 --> 00:25:17,715
And basically what this does is it allows us to accumulate time from the beginning of the first time interval to the end of the jth time interval.

226
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:25,715
And then ultimately get the cumulative survival and risk of the outcome.

227
00:25:25,715 --> 00:25:36,715
A minor note here is that we can actually conceptualize time as both calendar time or as age, depending on how our cohort is structured.

228
00:25:36,715 --> 00:25:40,715
And this is just a very quick example to show what we use life tables for.

229
00:25:40,715 --> 00:25:46,715
In practice most often. So life tables are used to calculate life expectancy.

230
00:25:46,715 --> 00:25:58,715
And so we do this by age and using the probability of death for a given age as the interval under study.

231
00:25:58,715 --> 00:26:05,715
OK. The incidence density method. We're going to talk about the incidence density method in more depth in the.

232
00:26:05,715 --> 00:26:08,715
I think it's part four of the session that you'll watch on Thursday.

233
00:26:08,715 --> 00:26:13,715
But I wanted to introduce it briefly here because it does get a little bit more complicated.

234
00:26:13,715 --> 00:26:21,715
So recall from part two of this lecture that incidence density is a rate and it incorporates person time in the denominator.

235
00:26:21,715 --> 00:26:27,715
So a true rate incorporates time into the denominator. Incidence density is a true rate.

236
00:26:27,715 --> 00:26:32,715
Let's come back to this example from the start of the class where we calculated cumulative

237
00:26:32,715 --> 00:26:38,715
incidents where 40 thousand women with no history of breast cancer are observed for five months.

238
00:26:38,715 --> 00:26:44,715
Sixty of these women develop breast cancer on the first day of the second month of observation.

239
00:26:44,715 --> 00:26:48,715
Recall that the cumulative incidence was simply sixty over forty thousand.

240
00:26:48,715 --> 00:26:55,715
Now we want to know the incidence density. So now we're taking into account person time directly into the measure.

241
00:26:55,715 --> 00:27:00,715
We simply take the numerator is the same, the number of cases is the same.

242
00:27:00,715 --> 00:27:03,715
But now our denominator is a little bit different.

243
00:27:03,715 --> 00:27:09,715
So we account for the fact that those 60 women who developed breast cancer on the first day of the second

244
00:27:09,715 --> 00:27:15,715
month of observation only contributed one month of at risk person time before they develop the outcome,

245
00:27:15,715 --> 00:27:23,715
whereas the rest of the women contributed a full five months of person time of observation at risk for the outcome.

246
00:27:23,715 --> 00:27:28,715
This gives us thirty nine thousand nine hundred and forty women who are followed for five months of at risk

247
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:36,715
person time and 60 women who contributed one month of at risk person time before developing the outcome.

248
00:27:36,715 --> 00:27:44,715
This gives us 60 cases, over one hundred and ninety nine thousand seven hundred and sixty person months of observation.

249
00:27:44,715 --> 00:27:48,715
That gives us zero point zero zero zero three cases per person.

250
00:27:48,715 --> 00:27:55,715
Month of observation. And then because that number is very small and kind of hard to interpret.

251
00:27:55,715 --> 00:28:05,715
We can scale this up to express it as three point six cases per 1000 person years.

252
00:28:05,715 --> 00:28:14,715
OK. I want to give a brief summary of the difference between a risk and a rate, because I think these are useful things to keep in mind.

253
00:28:14,715 --> 00:28:20,715
Recall from the first part of the session that risk is the probability of an

254
00:28:20,715 --> 00:28:26,715
event occurring over a specified period of time in a specified population.

255
00:28:26,715 --> 00:28:32,715
In contrast, a rate is a frequency of an event occurring per unit of time.

256
00:28:32,715 --> 00:28:41,715
It allows the risk status of individuals to change. And it incorporates time directly into the denominator.

257
00:28:41,715 --> 00:28:47,715
The measures of risk that we will primarily work with in this course are the cumulative incidents,

258
00:28:47,715 --> 00:28:57,715
which is also referred to as the incidents proportion. The primary rate measure that we will work with in this course is the incidence density.

259
00:28:57,715 --> 00:29:04,715
This is also referred to as the incidence rate. Risk as a proportion is dimensionless.

260
00:29:04,715 --> 00:29:11,715
But you must always refer to the time period that a calculated risk refers to.

261
00:29:11,715 --> 00:29:15,715
And as a proportion, it ranges from zero to one.

262
00:29:15,715 --> 00:29:27,715
In contrast, the dimension for the rate is one over person time, which you can also express as the number of cases per unit of person time.

263
00:29:27,715 --> 00:29:33,715
And it has a range from zero to infinity. OK.

264
00:29:33,715 --> 00:29:41,715
Finally, I want to give a brief word on the relationship between incidence, prevalence and duration.

265
00:29:41,715 --> 00:29:48,715
Prevalence or P is a function of incidence or ID, so I'm referring here to incidence

266
00:29:48,715 --> 00:29:54,715
density and the duration of disease, which I'm referring to as Tbar.

267
00:29:54,715 --> 00:29:59,715
I think this figure that I've shown on this slide really nicely helps to contextualize it.

268
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:10,715
So if you think about the number of cases in a population as being contained by or being analogous to blue dots inside a vessel,

269
00:30:10,715 --> 00:30:15,715
I don't know what these dots are. Maybe they're pebbles. Maybe they're pieces of glass or whatever.

270
00:30:15,715 --> 00:30:26,715
And that's the prevalence of disease. Right. So the more full this vessel is, the higher the prevalence is in the population.

271
00:30:26,715 --> 00:30:34,715
And incidence represents the number of new cases that are coming in to this jar of prevalent cases.

272
00:30:34,715 --> 00:30:44,715
So you can imagine as incidence increases, this jar is going to get more full and it's going to get more full, more quickly as incidence decreases,

273
00:30:44,715 --> 00:30:50,715
and maybe you can think about it as a tap being turned on and off as prevalence decreases,

274
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:57,715
the number of cases in the population or the prevalence is going to stay low.

275
00:30:57,715 --> 00:31:01,715
And when it does increase, it will increase more slowly.

276
00:31:01,715 --> 00:31:07,715
There's also a way for prevalence to go down for a disease, and that happens in one of two ways.

277
00:31:07,715 --> 00:31:14,715
Either people die of the disease and they no longer have it or they are cured and they no longer have it.

278
00:31:14,715 --> 00:31:17,715
So if the death rate is really high,

279
00:31:17,715 --> 00:31:25,715
you can imagine that these pebbles or pieces of glass are going to fall out of the vessel of prevalence more quickly.

280
00:31:25,715 --> 00:31:33,715
So the prevalence will go down. Similarly, if people recover very quickly or if there's a very high cure rate,

281
00:31:33,715 --> 00:31:39,715
the prevalence will go down because you will have pebbles being released from this jar more quickly.

282
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:48,715
Similarly, if people live for a long time with the disease outcome, either they live with it, but they don't die of it or they aren't cured from it.

283
00:31:48,715 --> 00:31:53,715
Then the prevalence is going to stay high and we'll be a lot of pieces of glass in this jar.

284
00:31:53,715 --> 00:32:05,715
So you can think about prevalence as being like this jar that contains the cases and the incidents and either deaths or recovery

285
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:17,715
as taps that can turn on and off and be more open or more closed to regulate the amount of prevalence in a population.

286
00:32:17,715 --> 00:32:29,715
And so that is why prevalence is a function of the incidence and the duration of disease, and formally we can actually quantify this.

287
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:40,715
So the prevalence is equal to the incidence times duration of the disease divided by the incidence times, duration plus one.

288
00:32:40,715 --> 00:32:42,715
And a neat trick here.

289
00:32:42,715 --> 00:32:52,715
If the prevalence of the disease is low, then the prevalence is approximately equal to the incidence times, the duration of the disease.

290
00:32:52,715 --> 00:32:58,715
And please note that this assumes a steady state and closed population.

291
00:32:58,715 --> 00:33:07,715
So to recap, if the incidence of a disease is low, but the duration is long, then the prevalence is relatively high.

292
00:33:07,715 --> 00:33:11,715
Conversely, if the incidence of a disease is high, but the duration is short,

293
00:33:11,715 --> 00:33:23,715
either because people die very rapidly from the disease or they are cured from it very quickly, then the prevalence will actually be relatively low.

294
00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:25,715
Let's do a quick example,

295
00:33:25,715 --> 00:33:34,715
let's imagine the incidence rate of coronary heart disease in women is zero point zero zero five cases per year and the mean duration is five years.

296
00:33:34,715 --> 00:33:39,715
Calculate the prevalence, assuming a steady state population and no net migration.

297
00:33:39,715 --> 00:33:42,715
We used the formula that I showed you on the previous slide.

298
00:33:42,715 --> 00:33:50,715
So we would multiply zero point zero zero five, which is the incidence density times five, which is the main duration.

299
00:33:50,715 --> 00:33:58,715
And then we would divide that by again zero point zero five times five plus one, which gives us zero point zero two four,

300
00:33:58,715 --> 00:34:07,715
which equals a two point four percent prevalence since this prevalence that we've calculated is less than zero point one.

301
00:34:07,715 --> 00:34:09,715
It looks like we can use the rare disease assumption.

302
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:15,715
So the rare disease assumption is when prevalence in the population is less than 10 percent of a given outcome.

303
00:34:15,715 --> 00:34:19,715
It makes a few different epidemiological calculations more simple, including this one.

304
00:34:19,715 --> 00:34:26,715
But there's others we'll get into later in the course. So we can actually simplify this formula to P equals ID times T.

305
00:34:26,715 --> 00:34:35,715
This gives us zero point zero zero five times five, which gives us zero point zero two five, which is approximately equal to zero point zero two four.

306
00:34:35,715 --> 00:34:44,715
And that's it. Thanks so much, everyone. Thank you for your patience with everything that's going on with respect to the geo strike.

307
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:51,715
I hope to see many of you for the optional in person exercise session at 11:00 this morning.

308
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:56,715
I know that's very, very soon. If you don't come, I think that's totally fine.

309
00:34:56,715 --> 00:35:02,715
And I won't retaliate against anyone who does not attend epidemics or one in solidarity with the strike.

310
00:35:02,715 --> 00:35:03,676
Thank you very much.
