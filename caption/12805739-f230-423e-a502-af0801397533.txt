1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:23,000
All right. Well, into the afternoon, everybody. I hope you all had a good extended weekend and they're ready to really learn about chemical hazards.

2
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:38,770
Sure. So just as a reminder of where we were at a very broad environmental health introduction the first week and then the first class period,

3
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,260
followed by this just general exposure science last time,

4
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,120
which is going to be some of the basics that's going to underlie what we talked about throughout the semester.

5
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,840
And then we're going to go a step further and get to what we're going to be

6
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,140
applying some of those exposures science principles with is the chemical hazards.

7
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:07,299
So again, this is just kind of an intro, as we talked about last time, there's many, many companies out there.

8
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:12,730
So today it's going to be focused on kind of a framework for how we start thinking about that.

9
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:23,050
Any questions about the course before we get started? Yeah, clarifications again, schedule will be here.

10
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,780
If this doesn't have enough info for you, you can refer to the syllabus.

11
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,890
I think I fixed all the links. Finally you can go to the syllabus.

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
If not just let me know either in class or you can always email.

13
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,690
As well. Okay.

14
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,570
This is the fanciest flight I have because I guess the.

15
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,620
The newer power plant will start designing for you.

16
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,200
Hey, I or something. Hey, do you think you teach very fast?

17
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,130
I mean, I guess who might I say? Yeah, I thought that was fun.

18
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,490
Anyway, so, like I said, this is my second time teaching this class.

19
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,250
It was tight for, like, 25 years or something by Ted Sellers, who just retired.

20
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,580
So I haven't fully transitioned all his slides yet.

21
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:22,180
He had probably twice as many lecture lectures prepared for this class as there were class periods.

22
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,970
I've been boiling down, boiling down, and I still use some of his slides.

23
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,110
His tend to be the busier ones [INAUDIBLE] enjoy, but just want to make sure he gets credit.

24
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,879
This is one of his or. With the different chemical structures.

25
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:42,510
You know you had some fun but you know, same same chemical formula, potentially different different chemicals,

26
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,400
potentially different toxicities and considerations for, for exposure and health as well.

27
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,940
Um, so I don't know if the who's in toxicology class right now remind me.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,219
Okay. What do they say about Paracelsus in that class? Have you guys talked about this?

29
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,340
Is this quote true? Yeah. The father and son scuffling?

30
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:09,269
Yeah. Generally, generally true. Obviously, there's going to be some caveats here in there when you start thinking about dose response.

31
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,450
Curves aren't always fully predictable.

32
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,670
But yeah, you know, everything could be toxic if given enough.

33
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,080
So and that's been proven time and again, unfortunately.

34
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,200
And this is that's Tesla's right there. I'm just kidding. This is I don't know what this slide was.

35
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,800
He had it in here. I'm like, I shouldn't take it out, but I am not going to explain.

36
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,459
So that's how he described chemical hazards anyway.

37
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:48,570
So today we're going to talk about introduction again to the vast array of chemicals out there and then trying to sort of get our arms around it,

38
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:54,690
but talking about different classification schemes and then talk about various examples with this within each of those schemes

39
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:03,150
and then different factors we want you to be aware of and start thinking about how chemicals can then result in exposure.

40
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:08,820
And a lot of this comes out of the chapter that was posted on Pinterest.

41
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,450
There is. Okay.

42
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:20,940
So after today, I just think in terms of structure, source, medium usage, toxicity properties, those are that's what we're going to go through today.

43
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,430
So just think about it in those terms and then we'll also discuss a little bit

44
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:32,430
more about how some of these things might relate to exposure and toxicity.

45
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:45,270
Okay. So here we are. We have by nature, by source, by medium manner of use, mechanism of action properties and physicochemical properties.

46
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:51,110
So these are just one way of classes, several ways of classifying.

47
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,100
And this is not meant to be exhaustive.

48
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,760
There are other ways you can talk about chemical hazards, but these are the ones the rules are the main ones that you'll see out there.

49
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:08,250
When people refer to chemicals, you might hear them say, Oh, I focus on organic chemicals or I focus on inorganic chemicals.

50
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:17,400
You hear that a lot in analytical chemistry. Usually people focus on one or the other, and same can be said by a lot.

51
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:27,120
For a lot of these, depending on the context, you'll hear about people talking and referring to chemicals in some of these matters too, to group them.

52
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,790
So we'll just dove right in. So organic versus inorganic to start with.

53
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:40,049
So if you have some remembrances or maybe some flashbacks to organic chemistry,

54
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:46,260
perhaps even high school chemistry, I suppose the difference between the two.

55
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:53,610
So organic chemicals must have at least one carbon atom and usually the not always will have hydrogen in there as well.

56
00:05:54,420 --> 00:06:01,650
And it's just a very large group of chemicals that we talked about those numbers last last week.

57
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:09,630
The thousands upon thousands of chemicals, there's always ways to synthesize something, something new and exciting on those lines.

58
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:18,450
But the so, you know, for any of these you could give for any chemical out there, you can probably break it down based on what's known about it.

59
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:26,700
Obviously, for for many of those chemicals may not be known why these properties are easily so easily found.

60
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,690
But we'll just use methane as a as a simple example.

61
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,230
So that is the simplest organic chemical for again,

62
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:42,000
remembering back to your organic chemistry that's an output it's as an outcome of a hydrocarbon

63
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:51,660
has various sources landfills natural gas flow ground subterranean it can be found in soil,

64
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,399
of course, and air that's used for fuel.

65
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,870
Again, the reason we're talking about this is all of these things might impact the way in which

66
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:08,100
people may be exposed and ultimately harmed by this chemicals toxic mix mechanism,

67
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,720
simple as fixing. Can anybody tell me what simple asphyxia means?

68
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,070
Displaces oxygen. Right. So asphyxiation is suffocation.

69
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,660
Right. And that can be one of two types.

70
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,520
One is. Simple.

71
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,180
Another is chemical. So nothing is simple.

72
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,110
You just simply displaces oxygen. And so.

73
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:43,560
The first being exposed is, especially in a confined space, will have less and less oxygen to breathe.

74
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:55,410
So it's a symbol. We'll have a good example of a chemical and a little bit chemical specs in target organ, brain or whole body, you know, suffocation.

75
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,620
You know, it's it's eventually going to impact the whole body.

76
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:04,230
It gets bad enough, of course, of concern for exposure will be acute like we talked about last time.

77
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,650
There's acute chronic sub chronic. In this case,

78
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:17,219
most likely more involved those short term high levels of exposure that could lead to that displacement of oxygen environmental properties,

79
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,110
that is the greenhouse gas statements of CO2 and others.

80
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:29,910
And then through this particular chemical, you can talk about its physical state or there's polar or non-polar,

81
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,530
hydrophobic or hydrophilic, or there's flammable combustible.

82
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,810
Some of those properties, again, think about how they relate to potential exposure and effect.

83
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,300
Volatility is another big one that we come back to a lot throughout the semester.

84
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:54,330
If it's a gas, obviously it's already in the air, but a lot of that comes into play a lot of when we think about how people are exposed.

85
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:07,709
Jasper. So again, this is a ginormous class of chemicals we need to start talking about here.

86
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:12,590
Phenix They have all kinds of naming schemes.

87
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,360
If you remember back, we want, you know, more on that type of memorization.

88
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:26,280
But just some examples of some some big ones that we look at a lot in exposure, science and public health.

89
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:35,070
So that's all from authentic hydrocarbons. There's a good example here, a couple of examples.

90
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:41,609
Aromatic hydrocarbons. Btecs. So BTECS is an acronym that you hear about a lot.

91
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,990
And when we talk about occupational as well as environmental when it comes to.

92
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:52,460
Solvents will of beta stands for benzene, toluene, ethyl, benzene and xylene.

93
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:59,210
Related class of chemicals that have this benzene ring and they have sort of similar properties

94
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:08,600
environmentally as well as potentially a toxicity was another grouping is chlorinated hydrocarbons.

95
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,400
So it's the benzene ring with chlorine added.

96
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:25,670
So that's things like PCBs, dioxin, PCB, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, her pages here's an example down here in the lower right.

97
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,180
Benzoate appearing as a carcinogenic page.

98
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:46,010
It's found in combustion byproducts of smoke, etc. Another example is alkanes, olefins over here, building styrene, etc. In that alkene family.

99
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:54,650
Another big one in recent decades in the occupational literature is ISO saying it's used in a lot of different things.

100
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:07,820
I was asked about a case where they had this spray insulation foam they use I societies that helps it helps a cure.

101
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:15,290
Homes said. Concern for people who are actually spraying, but also the occupants of the building potentially after it sprayed.

102
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,340
So again, just a smattering of examples.

103
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:24,590
There's tons out there and we'll continue talking about this throughout the semesters.

104
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:30,530
These are organic chemicals. And again, for each of these, you could come up with a listing of some of these.

105
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:40,550
Characteristics throughout. Oh, and down here we have a coordinated solvent.

106
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,620
You'll notice there's no hydrogens here. But if this is, this is for tetrachloride, ethylene.

107
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:52,730
For ethylene, it's Houston dry cleaning. If that gets burned, it might form dioxin.

108
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:59,750
Quick toxic. So again, you might have some secondary concerns as well for chemicals,

109
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:05,330
one leading to another depending on processes involved or how the life cycle in the environment.

110
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:17,160
So moving from that to some examples of organic how inorganic these are chemicals that lack carbon hydrogen.

111
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:29,460
So it could be just an element in itself or part of a compound and that that compound can lead to it being in a speciation form or imbalance,

112
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:38,520
particularly for metals. But one example, a classic example, when we talk about this class and probably throughout your in environmental courses,

113
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:45,510
public health courses is what is probably the best, most well-studied chemical out there with regards to health.

114
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:53,489
But again, listing some of its characteristics here. I won't read these off to you, but it's of course,

115
00:12:53,490 --> 00:13:03,120
an element found in a lot of old things the old gasoline or paint or plumbing or some big ones that we're still dealing with, obviously.

116
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:14,520
And again, this is another one of those places where environmental justice is plays a big role where you find some of these older infrastructure.

117
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:21,300
No other infrastructure that would lead to some populations being more exposed than others.

118
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:29,880
It can be found in a lot of different media, has a lot of uses throughout history.

119
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,430
I talked just briefly last time about ESPN automobile fuel.

120
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,650
Look, we've got techno is now being taken out of other types of fuel as well.

121
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,100
Sadr Cosmetics.

122
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:52,110
We can still find it sometimes if it's you know, there's a lot of different companies out there that sell personal care products and cosmetics.

123
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,680
They're not all super careful about what goes into those products.

124
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:04,100
So still, can we find it? You know, every few months you see a study, it's in a certain brand of lipstick or makeup.

125
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:12,460
A range of different toxic mechanism swapping disrupts heme synthesis, which is important for a lot of functions,

126
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:22,630
also negatively impact brain function, central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, a lot of different target organs.

127
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:31,450
Again, this also plays into how we what concerns we have from exposure was given when we talk about target organs and mechanisms,

128
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:37,030
because that can dictate what we're concerned about with regards to exposure about for example.

129
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:45,610
Pathway time courses is usually I mean, if you're exposed to a super high level, but of course it could be an acute concern.

130
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:54,400
But for the most part, we're concerned about more chronic effects, long term exposure, long term effects, different environmental properties.

131
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,660
It's a metal, it's an element. It doesn't go anywhere. It's always there.

132
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:06,630
It's naturally occurring. We went out, we dug it up and used it in a both concentrate it and use it in a bunch of things that yeah,

133
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,050
you know, so it's ubiquitous and then you cover your properties.

134
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:16,690
It's usually in a solid form in an aerosol, if it's part of a compound that might impact how it behaves as well.

135
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,160
So it's all important things to consider again when we think about exposure.

136
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,590
Again, just another example. So here's our reminder of our periodic table moments.

137
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:37,270
All. Organic different compounds that can be part of or alone, you know,

138
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:45,620
or metals and you know, the types of metals here, different gases, noble gases, etc.

139
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,440
So a bit more on inorganic chemicals. So I said different types of metals.

140
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,630
These get classified also in different ways. In our field, we tend to prefer them as as heavy metals,

141
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:09,120
long times when we talk about things like lead and cadmium that are don't serve any known beneficial function in the human body.

142
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:18,920
What I would call those heavy metals or toxic metals, you know, chromium can play a vital role on the surface sort.

143
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:25,230
But then there's light metals like beryllium or lithium metalloids like arsenic.

144
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:33,000
So sometimes you'll see people just group them all want them all as metals, but sometimes they are a little more careful in how they describe those.

145
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:40,680
Then of course, you have your other nonmetal elements that are carbon, phosphorus, etc.,

146
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:46,710
all of which could be an exposure concern either alone or as part of a larger compound.

147
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:54,420
When we talk about metals particularly, we also again want to know if it's part of a compound.

148
00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:00,780
What is that compound? So we give you information on its valence or species.

149
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,220
So a prime example of this is chromium. Chromium.

150
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:11,490
Three trivial chromium naturally occurring might even be beneficial for certain processes in the body.

151
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,910
Of course you don't want to overexpose, but it is there.

152
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:23,010
However, if it's in that trivial form or hexavalent form, sorry, plus six, if it's with oxygen, for example,

153
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:31,290
that can be that that's known to be carcinogenic and it's highly regulated and of great concern.

154
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:37,390
And that was the chemical that was released in the Ann Arbor area two weeks ago here on Earth upstream.

155
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:48,660
So that's that's important to note. You also things like mercury, if it's in it, if it's part of an organic compound, it's much more toxic.

156
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,590
So methylmercury is. Big concern as well.

157
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,820
Tetra ethylene or other organic forms of the head on the glass can taste sweet.

158
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:07,550
So again, historically that was a concern because it was used in paint.

159
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:12,630
You have chipped paint, you have kids. Maybe they like the taste of it.

160
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,710
That's going to result in extreme levels of exposure.

161
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:26,370
So again, just kind of getting to know what form the chemicals and properties might be present that could influence exposure.

162
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,430
And we'll talk about some more of this later. But you have some other biggies in the occupational realm.

163
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:39,650
Silica and asbestos. So asbestos here, the fibers are of concern.

164
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:46,030
Silica is the crystal structure there. Both long.

165
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:57,070
One carcinogens. Okay. So that's by nature with organic versus inorganic is our first classification scheme by source.

166
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:05,100
I won't spend too much time on this because we did talk about it last time. So, for example, natural versus manmade or anthropogenic.

167
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:12,900
So some natural examples. We had a few last time here, some more, you know, anything that could be generated from food,

168
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:19,610
water or atmosphere that doesn't involve human activity, trees, pine smell, that's a trapping.

169
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:25,139
That's a chemical that's produced naturally. Sometimes we harness it for our own purposes.

170
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:32,670
So teach them about air fresheners, for example. Some of these other ones get sort of on that borderline of we talk about different agents.

171
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:38,370
We have chemical, physical and biological. Some of these are borderline biological agents.

172
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:43,319
So that the fungus itself would be I would turn them into a biological.

173
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:51,690
But they can put off they can generate VOCs, for example, volatile organic chemicals that could be that you could be exposed to.

174
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,760
So there's some gray areas there. Insects, spiders, bees.

175
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,590
Why would that be here? Because they're made of chemicals and toxins.

176
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:06,550
Yeah. So it's, um, what they might inject you with, or.

177
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:15,480
The method of those is there's a chemical structure in the example.

178
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:23,790
Um, if we eat meat and that is treated with antibiotics or the pharmaceuticals, that's a chemical weapons.

179
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,300
Is it naturally occurring? Not really.

180
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:35,670
But, you know, we have the intermediary. Then we talk about some of these last time forest fires don't just forms naturally occurring,

181
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:44,370
but can present some hazardous exposures and can be further exacerbated by human activity.

182
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,850
So even in the forest fire, you have what's coming off the trees when they burn.

183
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:55,350
What about that house that burns all that building? You got all kinds of stuff in there that's going to be a lot of chemicals generated.

184
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:02,180
You know, talk about dioxin. That'll be a big concern with with some of those organics that might be.

185
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:10,860
Structures and structures. Endotoxin is another example.

186
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:18,310
Lipopolysaccharide of a gram negative bacteria.

187
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:22,770
This is big enough for agricultural industry. I grew up on a farm.

188
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,780
I was pretty explosive on this as well too, as well as a lot of other things.

189
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:32,010
But this is a concern sometimes of grain storage.

190
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:36,380
If there's a lot of bacterial growth, then the extent of toxic chemicals.

191
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:46,390
As well. It's a draw. But again, that's kind of that borderline between biological and chemical agents.

192
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,270
I'm not going to spend much time on humans.

193
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:56,870
We all produce chemicals. So this is a slide from Dr. Zeller's.

194
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:00,470
He is doing active research on on breath as a biomarker.

195
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,510
So that's why he put this slide.

196
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:12,350
I this is even probably his own data maybe where they measure exhaled breath all the volatile organic compounds they find in the breath.

197
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:16,060
So I just thought was interesting to think about it as a resource.

198
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:22,880
And we talked about viruses as a resource for biological agents, but they could also be useful agencies.

199
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:29,160
Or if you think about personal care, you know, so much work for you and somebody else gets exposed.

200
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,570
That perfume that the person is wearing.

201
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:41,730
I had a student once, a master's student, who worked at the hospital who did their project on patients in the ICU.

202
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:51,390
After they'd come out, they actually exhale all the drugs they were administered to put them under, and that could lead to exposure to other people.

203
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,870
And I'm supposed to be put under there.

204
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,130
So that was actually profitable. So just another perspective there.

205
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:10,050
Of course, we have man made. So again, I'm not going to belabor this since we talked about last time, but just some prime examples here.

206
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:16,590
Of manmade chemicals or sources that directly related to human activity.

207
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:28,670
And when you do it by source and try to separate manmade versus natural, it can be confusing as well.

208
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,990
Again, might depend on context and perspective.

209
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:42,820
So, you know, PCBs, polycyclic or polychlorinated biphenyls or other mercury, as we talked about, can be found at high concentrations of fish.

210
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:53,110
So is that a natural source? Usually not, right, because those chemicals came from originally from somewhere else.

211
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,410
So it depends on the context how far you sit.

212
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:04,180
Not so that that fish is just an intermediary, that pathway of that chemical that is likely from human activity.

213
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:12,770
Getting from this original source to the view. Any questions?

214
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:21,470
So far, I've thrown a lot of acronyms out in the context and trying to make sure it spells out where they're needed.

215
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:31,550
All right. So the next designation is by medium or by manner of use and by medium.

216
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:37,160
We'll talk about that a lot more next time we start talking about routes and pathways.

217
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,730
But again, just a brief intro here. We have food.

218
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,420
We just talked about fish, other meats.

219
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:57,510
Produce is a big. The way in which people might be exposed to pesticides, water, of course, through various modes there as well.

220
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,460
So we'll come back to that next time. Anybody here live in the west side of Ann Arbor?

221
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:08,490
Nobody. All right. Good for you guys.

222
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:12,620
Did you did your homework before you decide where to rent or buy.

223
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:16,650
Right. Anyway, so let's say Ann Arbor and we'll get back to this.

224
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:26,400
I talk about this more in-depth in the risk assessment lecture, but it was contaminated with a chemical called one for dioxane.

225
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:36,900
And it started off as a very concentrated source, but it's slowly migrating underground.

226
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:44,000
So we're going to come back. So it's a soil concern and a water concern at the time.

227
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:53,230
At the moment. The next scheme is by youth.

228
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,250
So a lot of times you'll hear people refer to chemicals just kind of as a broad category

229
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:03,820
that might actually have members of that category that aren't very similar at all.

230
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:08,680
So buy what they're used for. One example would be pesticides.

231
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:15,630
So there's just a huge grouping that can include hundreds and hundreds of different chemicals that may be similar.

232
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:21,070
Not the only thing they have in common is they kill something right by it on purpose.

233
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:24,940
So there's just loads and loads of different examples of pesticides.

234
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:31,120
Insecticides. You can break them to insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, etc.

235
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,480
Rodenticides. The list goes on and on.

236
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:41,320
But again, just a giant group that might be referred to sort of general.

237
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,079
So I get asked, you know, I get media requests.

238
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,830
They want to talk about pesticides and I'm like, well, you know, give be a little more specific, right?

239
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:51,920
Because it is such a huge group of chemicals.

240
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:56,480
Silence is another one. You see a lot, you know, occupational settings.

241
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:01,569
Tons of solvents are used in the house. A lot of solvents are used, but they're not all the same.

242
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:07,479
They may not all have the same kind of behaviors that we've been talking about with regards to form there and what

243
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:15,520
they're likely to do with the environment and how you might be exposed or how toxic they might be that he uses of glues.

244
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,440
These are chemical compounds, accolades, epoxies, different things.

245
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:24,490
It's just another example of how something might be grouped by usage.

246
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:33,920
Eight days coatings version. So again, how something gets used can be another way to categorize.

247
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:38,690
And there's always historical pictures of pesticides that are frightening.

248
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,340
So here we have a crop duster.

249
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:49,950
You know, they load up the airplane. They still do this method today. This is like a species of livestock.

250
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:57,380
It's usually used on crops and schools. Application that they load up the airplane and they drop it.

251
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:06,110
Huge amounts of this is similar to what I said last time in the military or they just apply the fumigant.

252
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:13,620
The skin or liquid as. This is an old ad for DDT.

253
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:20,870
Used to be in magazines. I think I have come back to that when I talk about consumer products.

254
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:34,010
Okay. So you use makes a big deal though. So it might not be the best descriptor when it comes to chemical properties necessarily,

255
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:39,590
but it can be the difference between what we term toxicity versus hazard.

256
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:49,340
So this is an important distinction and I probably should've changed doctor sellers as this business has slowed slide.

257
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:57,650
So toxicity is an intrinsic property of a substance and it's defined by how you test it.

258
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:06,920
You know, we can tested in animals or in cell lines, etc. and for that chemical that has its assigned toxicity based on those observations or tests.

259
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:16,980
Just having a chemical that's toxic does not necessarily mean it's going to cause harm in a human because you have to also have the exposure, right?

260
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:23,880
So Hazard is thought to be a term that takes into account both the toxicity and the nature and intensity of exposure.

261
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:32,300
So if you have for example, I've done some work in semiconductor, semiconductor manufacturing.

262
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:39,030
They use tons of very, very highly toxic chemicals in that process, like passing gas and things like that.

263
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:47,000
But if they are able to contain it, you have a high toxicity, but the hazard may not be as great as for other things.

264
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:53,590
It might be more likely to result in exposure. So that's a that's a distinction, again,

265
00:29:53,830 --> 00:30:02,350
kind of stems from things we've talked about for already in this class that exposure to point it's extremely important we think of hazard.

266
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,780
There is toxicity as is designated for a given chemical.

267
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:19,820
Okay so to turn it Wall Street this more so factors that might make something for a given

268
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:27,110
toxicity more or less hazardous are the conditions of use its physical state and performance.

269
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:32,240
And these are going to come back over and over throughout the semester. The conditions of use.

270
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,380
A lot of times if we're grinding something, you know,

271
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:44,420
actively engaged with that chemical or what includes that chemical, it might result in more likelihood of exposure.

272
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:51,680
So processes for grinding, spraying, heating, things like that can really increase that.

273
00:30:51,680 --> 00:31:02,330
Like the containment is a big one. So I mentioned with methane or as simple as fixing something that's enclosed and there's not a lot of ventilation,

274
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:10,830
obviously the chemical could build up. That's saying how close you are to the process that's generating the kind of.

275
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:20,770
So all these can can really increase or decrease that hazard for a physical state if it's a solid liquid or gas.

276
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:28,300
It makes a big difference on how it gets to the human and animals relative to the tree as well formed.

277
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:38,430
This is another big one. Is it in big pieces, small pieces, gas or a vapor or something?

278
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:45,250
So I think the next slide here will. Okay, so let's think of a couple of examples.

279
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:54,790
So I talked about with, let's see, we had a big chunk of work just like sitting here on this table.

280
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:00,370
How concerned would you guys be about your exposure of that?

281
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:05,020
Let's pretend this owl is made up of blood. Just pure blood.

282
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,220
How concerned are you about that? Why is that?

283
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:18,840
Because it's very likely to get people to write most of your touching it right hand mouth contact.

284
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,530
Okay, so what if you then take that and break it up?

285
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,780
Fishers, fishermen here, fishery people do some fishing.

286
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,490
They still make a lot of those weights out of what?

287
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:39,660
So if we just cut this into chunks and sell them as fishing boats, would it be more or less concerned about human exposure at that point?

288
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:48,230
I mean, it's a lot to learn right by mass and you're increasing the potential of more people.

289
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:56,719
So that's one thing. And then a fishing way. A lot of times you have to touch it in order to use it for its intended applications.

290
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:06,920
Right. So that might be a concern for other forms of life where we can be concerned about more potentially than just a large block of it sitting here.

291
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:18,540
Dustin Yeah, if there is a process involved, if you're grinding this out or you guys know this is called me out, right?

292
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:25,360
It's got the eyes and that creepy nose. It's kind of like an owl. But what it does is it rotates 360 degrees.

293
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:30,910
I that's why they call it the owl. So when you talk, it should pick up what you say on the camera.

294
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:39,470
So it's kind of cool. Yeah. So if we were doing something to that, to the creative, does that work?

295
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:46,280
What are the other uses when you told that previous slide that historically.

296
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:53,660
Intense heat about burn it off of like windowsills.

297
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:58,390
Yeah. So, you know, back in the day, they would melt that down and incorporated into it.

298
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:08,710
They liquid paint or had certain properties that made it made a great pain but not enough attention was given to what that would mean for exposure.

299
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:14,930
Yeah. Gasoline as well. So I think you get the point of let example.

300
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,900
Another one would be silica I mentioned. So where do you find silica?

301
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:27,190
Mining squadrons, mines and quarries. What about in everyday life?

302
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:31,140
Private first class inflation. Okay.

303
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:34,780
Yeah, maybe some drywall. You know, we're open.

304
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:40,330
Yeah. What about. Anybody go to the beach? So there's tons of silica out there.

305
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:45,280
Were you concerned with your silica exposure? Why not?

306
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,760
Size of the particle. Yeah, exactly. So we're talking about form.

307
00:34:52,150 --> 00:35:02,950
So with silica and we're talking about target organ potentially or toxicity being relevant to to what we're concerned about exposure to the lung.

308
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,410
Is that what we're primarily concerned about?

309
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:13,090
So you're concerned with breathing in sand on the beach is such so large that it's not going to make its way into the deeper part of the lung.

310
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:21,219
So but you guys mentioned a few applications of silica, a big one historically that was just absolutely horrible.

311
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:28,810
Is sandblasting or abrasive blasting where you just take that sand and you shoot it out of a gun at high velocity to.

312
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,330
A lot of times with paint or other metal surfaces to give that surface profile for repainting.

313
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:38,330
Um, just obliterates the sand particles.

314
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:44,540
It's a very, very small, what we call respirable dust particles.

315
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:51,460
So that's what. It's extremely harmful and fatal if one gets silicosis.

316
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:55,480
So you guys get to get the picture. There's just a couple of examples of form.

317
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:59,530
We could do it with a lot of different chemicals. Asbestos is another one.

318
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,570
It's in fiber form. Another one of the lung is the concern.

319
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:14,349
But if you just have a bunch of asbestos sitting there or pre being mined, probably not going to be a concern unless people are agitating it.

320
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:17,770
Right. All right.

321
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,430
Mechanism of action is another way to classify.

322
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,430
So these are, again, just some examples. These aren't exhaustive.

323
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:40,770
But one example is colonies three some kind of errors that that a single master is is impacted a synopsis of the neurotransmitter.

324
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:46,650
And that's the mode of action for a lot of insecticides sort of, you know, phosphates and carbonates.

325
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:53,940
Both common classes of insecticides work by this mechanism, and that's one way to classify it.

326
00:36:54,180 --> 00:37:06,870
You know, in the pesticide realm, people refer to when a series members walk and ultimately, you know, causes the target organism to seize up and die.

327
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:14,840
So you might want to be concerned about, you know, if there's a cause that humans and will end at a high enough concentration.

328
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,950
Right. Another example is chemical vaccines.

329
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:22,550
So again, we talk about simple. Our simple example was methane.

330
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:26,090
What's an example of chemicals, for example? But you go on.

331
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:33,010
Well, I don't know, so I don't. Oh, yeah, I think so.

332
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:39,220
I think you're right. The one that I think of a lot, a prime example is carbon monoxide.

333
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:45,340
So the carbon dioxide is known to bind with hemoglobin with much more affinity than oxygen.

334
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:51,370
Hemoglobin is used to transport oxygen to different parts of the body and return the CO2.

335
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:59,410
And if you get SEO in the way that Google is not available to carry the auctions,

336
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:06,090
you get speciation through a chemical reaction versus simply displacing oxygen in the wind turbine.

337
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:14,200
So this one is more of a biological interaction, involvement versus just, you know, remove, you know, the oxygen in a room being displaced.

338
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:19,150
This is more biologically dispersed, but it's called the chemical scarcity versus simple.

339
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,170
So you might want to just make note of that. It could appear on a quiz.

340
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:32,120
Okay. Okay. Next one is irritants is the way you might think of something.

341
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,980
You heard refer to it or that those chemicals are an irritant.

342
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:45,890
That's just a way. To classify things. A lot of things we encounter think of like cleaning chemicals.

343
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,070
A lot of those might be irritants. We might get some burning in your airways, but it may not be serious.

344
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:55,430
Long term tons of chemicals are neurotoxic.

345
00:38:55,430 --> 00:39:03,470
Hence the impact of the brain carcinogens cancer causing a growing list of those.

346
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:14,809
So again, just examples of that snakebite mechanism. We could also classify by target, organ or site so long as you don't have to pay attention.

347
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:25,130
This table is just an example. Again, this is just a listing of known lung toxicants and this table is from that book, the different chapter.

348
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:33,980
It talks about the you don't have to memorize this at all, but it gives you a list of the toxins and there's tables like this out there.

349
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:40,220
So the chemical name, the common name of the disease, this is an occupational book.

350
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:45,380
So it's an occupational source of the chemical and then the acute and chronic lung effects of the chemical.

351
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:49,160
And this is just the first page and only goes down the see of.

352
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:55,730
So there's a lot of lung toxicants out there and some have their own names

353
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:01,670
like this best this is on their asbestosis so Wilma brilliant brilliance is.

354
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:11,410
Silica, silicosis. A lot of these diseases came about from observation within workers,

355
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:16,390
and the disease was actually named after either the worker group or the chemical itself.

356
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,090
And that's how it came about.

357
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:32,230
So I know I said the workers so iron oxides for example silver finishers lung they heard that these are diseases hematite,

358
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:39,520
miners, long arc welders long. So again some of these diseases are actually that the workers were the first noticed it.

359
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:48,640
But anyway so that's just warning example we have liver could be affected it's you know sprained blood skin etc.

360
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:56,740
Yeah. I'm curious about the heart qualities along with that. And then do our guide or is that just the thing that metal's releasing vapors?

361
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:02,889
I think. Well, according this table, it's the iron oxides, but I'm not exactly sure.

362
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:05,990
I've actually done a lot of welding often. I don't know that.

363
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,790
But good question. I'm not I'm not for sure.

364
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:20,260
I know there is one not a lung disease, but with manganese, a brain disease called magnesium, which is very similar to Parkinson's.

365
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,920
But yeah, I'm not sure about that. I think it might be just like metal fever.

366
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:35,840
So that's by mechanism and by site and by no properties.

367
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:45,260
A lot of times we refer to chemicals by their ability to persist in the environment or in the body, the of food chains or how reactive they are.

368
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,400
So presumably you heard of the term poppers.

369
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:54,500
So there's been a lot of talk the last few decades about poppies.

370
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:58,970
There's been international treaties signed regarding poppies,

371
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:04,099
and that's persistent organic food in such a wide range of different chemicals that have been found

372
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:12,050
to be stick around environment a long time and might be harmful to ecosystems as well as humans.

373
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:22,450
We already mentioned heavy metals, greenhouse gases and other sort of big categorization based on their thermal properties.

374
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:28,720
Ozone producers on the on the cleaners, acid rain producers, etc.

375
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:36,040
So talk about ozone a lot in this class, and that's surface level ozone, which is harmful.

376
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,080
But, you know, typically we're talking about human exposure.

377
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:44,920
You're talking about the ozone layer, which would be more relevant to potentially the exposure, which is the physical.

378
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:52,850
So just a. It's more physicochemical properties.

379
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:57,460
There's tons out there and a couple more that are very relevant to what we talk about in this class.

380
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,040
One is molecular weight. So how big is that molecule?

381
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:09,560
And then they put pressure. How likely is that chemical to be in liquid, solid or.

382
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:17,910
Paper gas for. So on the way here with smaller, you know,

383
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:25,430
you add up the good weights from the periodic table in your compound to get that weight, but weight grams per more.

384
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,820
So that can be useful to make some general predictions about a chemical behavior

385
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:37,470
or what might be of concern or exposure and then be pressure is very big deal,

386
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:46,770
but we think about relative exposure and things like that. So the higher the pressure, the more likely it's in the gas space.

387
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:56,550
And here we have water at molecular weight of 18 through the two hydrogens and the oxygen, which is 16 to 18.

388
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,980
And then you have your vapor pressure is 24 meters of mercury.

389
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:03,840
So that fits right here.

390
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:16,710
So anything above this on this table is more likely than water to evaporate, right under various conditions, of course, the temperature and humidity.

391
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:21,690
But anything below it is less likely than water to evaporate.

392
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:30,010
So you see some. I mentioned Venezuela hiring before that.

393
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:33,160
That's the carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

394
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:37,750
We mentioned benzene, green methane.

395
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:42,100
We talked about the gas phase. Sir.

396
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:54,530
So here you're just listing in the different media. So when we're talking about a chemical in the various media,

397
00:44:54,530 --> 00:45:00,979
what types of things or properties or currencies might we be interested in with

398
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:05,990
regards to the chemical itself and its toxicity and its exposure or hazard?

399
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:13,970
So in air, if it's a gas, a vapor aerosol, and we'll dove deeper into that later in the semester.

400
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:18,260
Water, some various things we might want to know. Ionic neutral.

401
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:25,400
Whether that those chemicals are dissolved or suspended in the water, that might really impact as well.

402
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:32,389
How you approach to clean up or removing your chemical from the water soil is going to have

403
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:39,170
a mix of some of these air and water properties that are concerned and others as well.

404
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:43,880
And again, a wide range of of properties.

405
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:48,710
Depending on the setting, could impact what we're concerned about.

406
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,540
A couple of your underling will come back to a lot throughout the semester.

407
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:59,669
Humidity, temperature, coat contaminants can impact a lot of things.

408
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:07,650
And how we're concerned about exposure, how we measure exposure, how we interpret the potential for exposure and adverse health.

409
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:13,350
All right. So that's our schemes.

410
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:20,220
Oh, I got another slide. Sorry. So we'll talk about Dermal next time.

411
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:26,600
But just as an example. Dermal exposure. The two properties we mentioned on two slides ago.

412
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:36,870
Molecular weight and vapor pressure. Not only are concern for your airborne hazards, but also whether or not it's going to penetrate the skin.

413
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:42,780
So things that have low molecular weight and low vapor pressure.

414
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:47,070
That combination is on the surface.

415
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:51,630
We think that might be a concern for DERM as well, just based on those properties of the counter.

416
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,130
So here are two, but that's not always the case and here are two examples.

417
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:02,700
So we have an organic organophosphate pesticide now found in something called sole solvents.

418
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:12,300
Used a lot in an industry. Both are known to have dermal exposure concerns, but they look very different, right?

419
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:19,140
So that rule of thumb of both the weight and their pressure does hold true a lot, but it's not always the case.

420
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:25,680
So here we have a very low pressure, which means it can sit on the skin longer, most likely to evaporate.

421
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:29,010
But in this case, we have a very large molecular weight. Right.

422
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:32,610
Look at all those letters and add all those up.

423
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:37,589
Right. So this one, despite its large healthy weight, you can still penetrate skin.

424
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:46,500
We'll talk about why that might be next time. And then this one is a little bit smaller, but it does have that somewhat higher vapor pressure.

425
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:52,680
Again, that little thumb doesn't always hold. So these are just two examples and then we'll come back to this.

426
00:47:54,330 --> 00:48:00,000
Okay. So that's our. Our schemes that we used to classify.

427
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:04,510
Again, not necessarily exhaustive, but some of the main ones. Three questions to this point.

428
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:08,440
No.

429
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:22,290
So the rest of the time I have some more slides on just various groups of chemicals that we see a lot of that I spend a lot of my time researching.

430
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:28,350
So I just thought I'd give some more background on those as well. That's part of this intro to chemical hazards.

431
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:34,740
So in another one, we we talk about what is arsenic. So as you know, this is in sources.

432
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:41,580
Of course, it's coal mining, as we talked about before. It might also be naturally occurring and found in water.

433
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:48,480
That's what happens in Bangladesh to a great extent, much lesser extent here in southeastern Michigan.

434
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:53,850
We do have some pockets of arsenic and then some health effects.

435
00:48:54,630 --> 00:49:02,110
Skin lesions, purposes, diabetes and. So again, I'm saying give me some more common examples.

436
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:09,900
Sources in Halifax. Then maybe some movie recommendations.

437
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:21,270
That's right. So chromium so chromium is used a lot in metal manufacturer because it helps prevent rusting.

438
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:27,820
So. Stainless steel is a big piece of.

439
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:33,660
You were from Chicago. You've been to Chicago.

440
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,950
Have you seen this thing in Millennium Park? What's it called? I cannot recall.

441
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:44,550
Yeah, just a gigantic piece of stainless steel.

442
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:48,890
It's a lot of a lot of chromium here. The reason I'm a welder.

443
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:57,420
So we talk about the different forms of chromium. A lot of times the chromium trivial form, which we're not that concerned about.

444
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:09,120
But when you weld the chromium into stainless steel, it gets oxidized, so it can turn the chromium that chrome three into chrome six, but it oxidized.

445
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:17,220
So that is where usage and how that materials process can make a huge difference in exposure.

446
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:27,570
And finally, the water, which I mentioned in our spill recently, they're still getting a grasp of the risk from that.

447
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:32,370
Anybody seen the movie Erin Brockovich? All right.

448
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,030
So that movie and you've heard of it. Anybody heard of her?

449
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,290
She's still around as an actress. She worked at a law firm that took on.

450
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:52,600
I think as PGE, the California Energy Company, they had actually put me in the water and it was a big, big time lawsuits that nobody talks about.

451
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:58,120
If you're I've got some free time and it's on whatever streaming service you have.

452
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:11,890
Its uses pigment, pigment and dye paints. So we talk about that and paint certain traffic to paint as pigment what is called.

453
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:20,450
Concrete cement. Has been known to contain chromium.

454
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,710
And getting a sense of performance. And again this is going to be a big.

455
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:33,580
A big piece of that. Cadmium and other heavy metals.

456
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:38,359
It doesn't really have a positive function in the body and like a lot of other metals,

457
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:44,840
but from when we mentioned volcanoes for a lot of industrial pollution.

458
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:52,290
We know what this is. We see a lot of pictures like this. It's a smelter.

459
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:57,630
We use the word Smelter Alliance where they kind of process the metal after it's made.

460
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:01,710
This used to be all over the place and extremely dirty.

461
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:11,490
So anything around it and it wouldn't working in or near it usually had super high levels of whatever metal was being smelted at the time.

462
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:21,240
Cigarets are also a big source of cat might also be in the feed depending on where the food is grown.

463
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:29,040
It's one of those that can be incorporated into leafy greens and other things, but it has kidney effects,

464
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:39,420
something called potato disease that was documented in the high exposure case a long time ago that you can look up.

465
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:47,100
A lot of these are really interesting and really tragic stories, but it's good to know where they derive from.

466
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:56,930
But a lot of other adverse health effects with K. Manganese, on the other hand, is an essential metal.

467
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,550
So it actually does play a vital role in the body at very low levels.

468
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:08,560
However, if you're exposed to higher levels of activity.

469
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:14,700
Okay. So manganese is used in nonstick stainless steel.

470
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:21,959
So regular steel, all kinds of carbon steel, high levels of manganese in the in the steel.

471
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:28,980
So when it's welded or other metal working processes, you can be exposed to high levels of manganese.

472
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,919
I mentioned magnesium,

473
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:41,850
so that's been shown in welders alone because you heat up that the steel contains a high amount of manganese, you breathe again.

474
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:49,080
Especially possibly whole factory is through to the brain and you have magnesium.

475
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:55,690
And there's a lot of this is where the wires get involved. There's a lot of lawsuits these days about people.

476
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:05,640
Parkinson's isn't the same as magnetism. Former welders try and get compensation so you can see how it all plays together.

477
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:13,020
Also is used as a gasoline additive at times like this of what used to.

478
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:19,600
He called him. And I want you to make little batteries as well.

479
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:28,060
So it's a lot of different, but it's a mannerism, but again, an essential level.

480
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:37,680
But high levels have also more recently been shown to potentially be associated brain development in children and reproductive toxicities.

481
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:42,970
So keep an eye out for mercury.

482
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:47,110
It's all in place. Coal fired power plants is a big source.

483
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:57,860
It's then gets dispersed everywhere. It tends to settle on sediment, then gets taken up by fish, particularly the organic component.

484
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,930
So methylmercury. And then it bio magnifies up the food chain.

485
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:08,620
So it's in that sediment gets hit by the little plankton linking up by something a little bit bigger or the bigger, the bigger.

486
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:18,790
Then you get the fish that we eat have taken up all that mercury that's taken up before that and humans get exposed.

487
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:31,020
Light fixtures, electronics. This relates to neurological disorders and whether there's any one to read about if you have time.

488
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:35,380
You know, a lot of disease and adverse neurodevelopment as well.

489
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:42,920
Two films. That's just a few.

490
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:51,480
You can do this for a lot of different metals, especially now with things like rare earth metals being more and more sought after and used.

491
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:56,010
There hasn't been a whole lot done on some of those like polonium.

492
00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:00,990
I know there's. See.

493
00:56:01,930 --> 00:56:05,110
Here's one of my favorites, molybdenum. I've done some research on that one.

494
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:11,950
You'll see it sometimes in supplements. You'll see manganese in supplements, some chromium sometimes.

495
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:16,240
And a lot of these old ones, copper, zinc, because those are essential metals.

496
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:19,929
But again, you don't want too much. But, you know, it's America.

497
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:24,489
We want as much as everything as we can get it right. So. But I've seen more dinner.

498
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:32,410
There's another one where I've seen supplements advertised like 20 times your daily allowance or suggested allowance.

499
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:41,080
It's like. But we have seen some or some potential associations of more reproductive or brain effects.

500
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:45,960
So preliminary, you know, they're not final yet, but still working.

501
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:54,909
Small talk back and forth examples. We're going to call once again.

502
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:59,200
That's a big one in occupational settings as well as some household.

503
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:06,670
Other industrial chemicals are added. So formaldehyde that they're going to be used for a lot of different things.

504
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:17,999
Another one that we find in various. It's because bed sheets are found formaldehyde in other areas very much the same.

505
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,860
It's mentioned pages, other very powerful.

506
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:27,570
The pilot point. It compounds pesticides. This goes on and on pharmaceuticals.

507
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:34,950
This is always a going concern. They're finding pharmaceuticals everywhere now, wastewater, etc.,

508
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:40,210
with people either after they're metabolized or people aren't getting rid of them properly.

509
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:46,110
Go on, use caution. I should say organic solvents.

510
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:52,290
The large list here, meth of the ketone is one one, just one zero out of many, many of those.

511
00:57:52,830 --> 00:58:01,230
But there are a wide range of uses for cleaning, decreasing, etc. but a lot of times they'll have similar effects.

512
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:07,370
Several central nervous system. Might get like a drunkenness feeling.

513
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:15,500
If you do that enough times, it's not funny, but over time can really have serious effects.

514
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:24,860
Skin irritation is another common effect of those, and then longer term, certain ones have been tied to cancer reproductive health effects and.

515
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:31,340
For instance. Chlorinated solvents.

516
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:35,450
So these are a subset of that organic solvent.

517
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:41,729
So, as I mentioned, tetra. Perchlorate tetrachloride.

518
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:46,110
Thanks for clarifying between fluoride, chloroform, etc.

519
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:50,370
I used dry cleaning other industrial processes.

520
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:57,570
Problem with these is they don't break down. They can stay in water for a very long time.

521
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:01,530
So here's another movie rec recommendation. Anybody seen this one?

522
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:08,509
John Travolta is the old one call the civil action. I don't necessarily like his character in the movie,

523
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:16,250
but it's an interesting story about another legal case involving Corning salt water in Massachusetts.

524
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:25,310
You know, a cancer cluster. So if you guys are into dramatic legal, environmental related motion pictures.

525
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:33,520
There's not one, but a wide range of nervous system effects with these as well, as I mentioned, cancer.

526
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:53,580
Features combustion by product. So we talk about tobacco smoke, forest fires, automobiles, industrial combustion, all those types of situations.

527
00:59:54,210 --> 01:00:02,880
Even grilling. You may grow over the long weekend to have real pizza, the sauce.

528
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:15,010
An interesting process. You have those fats that burn that sink to the bottom of the grill and the the the smoke contains them and then they get of.

529
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:28,190
So anyway, of these they have various exposure potential, some properties, various toxicities, some are carcinogenic like chili powder.

530
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:33,190
And likely that tends to be at a lower concentration. Then a lot of the other forms.

531
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:42,570
Naphthalene and others, naphthalene is thought to potentially be associated with nasal cancer.

532
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:47,040
So, again, Peerj is a big problematic group of chemicals.

533
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:56,360
Actively looking into. Poppies, more specifically, aromatic compounds.

534
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:59,540
This is like PCBs and dioxins and pure almonds.

535
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,970
You know, hopefully, yes. This is another older example.

536
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:12,320
2000 for Ukraine presidential election. Viktor Yushchenko looks like this.

537
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:17,420
They believe he is poisoned with dioxin. A couple weeks later, he looks like that.

538
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,710
That is the core acne effect of dioxin.

539
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:26,820
So that's what you create in the news these days. It made me think about.

540
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:37,350
This is the environmental example. PCBs historically used in capacitors, transformers cutting oils.

541
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:46,830
Coughing and silence. So this building, interestingly, was probably constructed in the 1960s.

542
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:50,100
That was right in the wheelhouse of PCBs usage.

543
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:58,350
So it's a if you go on the outside, though, and we see two different types of materials joining together.

544
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:05,100
Windows to the brick, things like that, different types of brick, the season, coughing or sealant.

545
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:10,350
Back in the old era, a lot of times they had a high amount of PCBs and those.

546
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:16,960
Which has led to a lot of building air quality issues, a lot of issues when people go to renovate,

547
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:21,310
if it's just a poor detective, go through a lot of additional.

548
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:28,670
Protections for them. There's 209 different specific forms of piece of news or controversy out there.

549
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:32,990
Different levels of coordination. And they have been found to be.

550
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:41,570
So a lot of episodes mentioned, dioxins and periods, again, sort of historical, but still around because they're so persistent.

551
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:46,750
And can be formed secondarily. Through combustion.

552
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:56,280
I mentioned pesticides. So again, just a reminder, a lot of different types for a lot of different purposes.

553
01:02:57,450 --> 01:03:02,430
There's something like, I think around right around 1000 different individual chemicals.

554
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:09,420
Then we think about how they might be mixed together, mixed in different forms, mixed with different synergism things.

555
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:18,060
You have thousands and thousands of different chemicals out there that are pesticides, even disinfectants or considered pesticides.

556
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:25,950
Some are specialized. Others are broad spectrum and could be organic or intervient.

557
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:30,810
Or some of these days are organic. Broad spectrum.

558
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:36,090
I did an interview a couple weeks ago with.

559
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:42,860
I see these people and they're asking about the mosquito spraying that people do in their yards.

560
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:50,990
And yeah, so some of those they'll use. I mean, they used to use the, you know, phosphates, which are known to be neurotoxic.

561
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:55,340
Now they use pyrethroids, which are a little less neurotoxic, which is bad.

562
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:59,690
But then you think, well, they're trying to kill one, maybe two species if you talk about ticks.

563
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:04,940
But they actually advertise these chemicals as being effective against 330 different species.

564
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:07,940
It's like. With the other 328.

565
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:13,280
But, you know, it's just crazy how this go with the scorched earth approach.

566
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:19,810
So the ecosystem effects as well as the. If you have pets, the pets call the yard.

567
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:26,160
They come back in. You have the pesticide in your house. It doesn't break down because it's not ready in some way, are they?

568
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:34,650
The reason is that, first of all, I think it's that because they're worried that the mosquitoes or ticks specialized in target will tend to

569
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:41,610
adapt or whatever that's happening anyway as they keep will rotate because they become more energy adapt.

570
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:46,529
Yeah. That's one reason or that's just laziness.

571
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:50,490
I don't know. It's what they can get for the cheapest. There's probably a lot of reasons.

572
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:55,350
Sure. And it's legal. You know, it's EPA registered.

573
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,520
So but it's there's a lot of a lot of it out there, for sure.

574
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:05,730
So further classification will be important.

575
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:13,830
These are the ones that aren't used anymore. Again, the 1970s is when PCBs and we're going to get to 40% were typically not used anymore.

576
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:19,940
But because it is, DDT is so effective against malaria, it's still used in a lot of places.

577
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:25,200
That's a joke. But they've gotten a much better at more targeted application.

578
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:27,840
They're not just not doing this anymore furtively.

579
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:36,150
It's they have very specific equipment that they use specific locations around the house or wherever it might be to fight it.

580
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:42,750
So again, that just giving you perspective. So that's more legacy pesticides these days.

581
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:54,630
These are the three main, three largest or most used classes of insecticides, the phosphorus, carbonates and two thirds clip here.

582
01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:00,180
It's one of dozens, if not hundreds of, you know, phosphorous pesticides.

583
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:07,830
It's one it's in the news all the time. They all have their their street names as well that you find in the story.

584
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:18,659
So this was called Thursday and it was banned in 2000 for residential use based on child plastic concerns or still used on crops, golf courses.

585
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:20,370
And it's been a debate ever since.

586
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:27,450
EPA will say they're going to be on it and there's a new election and they say they're not going to ban it and it just keeps going back and forth.

587
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:32,350
So that one's in limbo and still used in some settings.

588
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:41,520
That rule also very widely used by battered people or called Home Depot or whatever.

589
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:46,880
We've seen some adverse effects from that one as well as pyrethrum.

590
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:55,890
It's probably the most common used ones now, like I mentioned in the backyard spraying for mosquitoes, but other uses as well.

591
01:06:57,210 --> 01:07:03,210
Herbicides, atrazine on corn, tons of action on corn being from Iowa.

592
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:09,060
Used to do some work in corn fields. It's another one I've been exposed to a lot, I'm sure.

593
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:15,950
I wish I could go back and get some measurements. Glyphosate is another big one these days.

594
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:21,500
For a lot of various things too. For days used on lawns. A lot. So again.

595
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:25,940
Very widely used. Very broad exposure.

596
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:37,130
Potential. Maybe the toxicity testing, or at least epidemiologically or experimentally, is slightly lagging from what it should be.

597
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:45,600
Some fungicides as well. Some other chemicals that we are focusing on these days, BPA, as we mentioned,

598
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:50,400
there's also they're taking out BPA and what products or whether they're using instead.

599
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:55,890
Yeah, BP's BPA, my favorite BPA.

600
01:07:58,830 --> 01:08:05,280
So there's similar chemicals. My study from toxicity perspective validates is a big one.

601
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,510
Several thousand different chemicals used to make plastics softer.

602
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:14,670
They're used in other products as well as sold on some things, but they're everywhere.

603
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:21,910
P Fast we've mentioned impairments and things like make up also includes the same.

604
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:27,100
It's used as a antimicrobial and flame retardants.

605
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:32,530
So these all have their own backstories that I could talk about for a long time, but not going to.

606
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:38,800
There's another movie wreck. You've seen either of these. This is more recent one, Mark Ruffalo in Dark Waters.

607
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:40,150
That's a good movie.

608
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:52,570
There's also a documentary sort of version of this overlapping story's called The Devil We Know, which I don't know where it can be found these days.

609
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:57,640
But just these become more and more in the news, more and more concern.

610
01:08:59,950 --> 01:09:04,540
You know, there are two chemicals that became the prime concern for EPA, for us.

611
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:08,670
But then, you know, again, there's thousands of different variations of the.

612
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:13,600
This type of chemical. So what we don't know still and a lot of it's still out there.

613
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:20,680
So this is going to be an issue for quite some time. I think some of you in here, we're going to be faster.

614
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:33,399
Flame retardants, various different types. Here's another documentary that's interesting called The Toxic Hot Seat Over YouTube.

615
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:37,270
And come here for the preview. It's not. Check it out. I think this is the one.

616
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:39,460
This was on HBO.

617
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:50,020
I think Spawn is tied to a Chicago Tribune series that they did where they make a lot of similarities between the chemical companies that use

618
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:57,420
flame retardants in the tobacco companies and how they set up sort of show organizations to promote the use of their product and had some,

619
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:01,540
some weird things going on. So. Pearson that I'd suggest.

620
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:06,640
This documentary. It's not it's not an assignment. It's that your.

621
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:14,800
Interest. But anyway, these are chemically bound to the products they can reach out over time.

622
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:22,650
So they're all kinds of stuff furniture, company, all kinds of building materials, even children's clothing, toys.

623
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:31,770
And then California again, it's all on this documentary who are convinced that they need to prevent these fires so

624
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:36,980
badly that they've just added laws that require more and more of these chemicals to do that.

625
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:41,460
Then you have this whole wave of increased levels of bees.

626
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:45,150
So really interesting story, but that's still ongoing.

627
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:56,530
Okay. So just one last word as we think about chemical hazards throughout the semester.

628
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,600
There's something called the precautionary principle.

629
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:07,720
And when I get to risk assessment and policy, you're going to see that a lot of times the policy lags greatly,

630
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:11,710
especially in this country, with regards to the chemicals.

631
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:17,379
So I like to promote what we call the precautionary principle, where you don't have to have perfect information,

632
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:21,430
you don't have to have that smoking gun necessarily to be careful, you know,

633
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:27,220
to take precautions and how you use a distributor of a given chemical or approach.

634
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,650
Exposure, potential exposure.

635
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:38,290
So the four components take preventative action in the face of uncertainty, shifting the burden of proof to the proponents of an activity.

636
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:45,850
Exploring a wide range of alternatives to possibly harmful actions and increasing public participation in decision making.

637
01:11:45,850 --> 01:11:49,120
Those are all the tenets of the precautionary principle.

638
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:54,520
Again, don't just or we're not just assuming, oh, if they're able to sell, it must be safe.

639
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:58,570
We don't have to worry about it. Don't think about how could you maybe could be done differently.

640
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:02,860
People at that town hall meeting don't know what they're talking about. Don't listen to them.

641
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:12,280
Those are all bad. And in the face of precautionary principle, because we're never very rarely do we have perfect information.

642
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:16,640
With which to make decisions. So you want to make sure you're making the best decision.

643
01:12:17,610 --> 01:12:22,680
That you can't to prevent. Disease and Ebola.

644
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:30,060
Okay. So finally, the statement further research is needed, which may appear in most of my papers,

645
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:35,220
should not be used as news thought to mean we don't need to do.

646
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:40,210
So just to know if there are any questions before we break.

647
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:46,370
Okay. Next time I think we start on exposure to capital.

648
01:12:46,370 --> 01:12:51,080
So a bit more details there. All right.

649
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:51,560
Thank you.
