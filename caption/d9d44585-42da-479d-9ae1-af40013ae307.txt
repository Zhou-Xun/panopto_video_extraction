1
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,710
But in a way, it's.

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:27,480
In a way, it's strange that we we are grouping these two together, but it was a way for us to get the two topics introduced to you.

3
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:36,359
But also even any any one of them is strange insofar as if you're a microbiologist, you could ask, why are these microbes put together this way?

4
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,980
Or How is it that all vector borne diseases could be grouped together and so forth?

5
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:46,170
Well, it's just basically because of the modes of transmission. So there is a certain logic to that.

6
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,490
The diseases are, for the most part, widely distributed, some of them globally,

7
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:03,960
and many of them with the potential for epidemic outbreaks, and a few of them with very elevated incidence.

8
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:15,100
They in general have an incredibly large economic and health burden that goes along with them.

9
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:30,520
So wherever you find certain of these STDs or VBE is they are extremely important as as diseases of of development and and of well-being more broadly.

10
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:36,750
The determinants of risk are highly vary with each disease.

11
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:44,440
And so it's, it's a challenge in a way to have meaningful comparisons.

12
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:54,099
But at the same time we try to do that. Certain behaviors or certain socio economic contexts or environmental conditions may

13
00:01:54,100 --> 00:02:00,040
increase the risk of most of the diseases in one or the other of those two groups,

14
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:07,570
but not always. And so it's a it's a big challenge in a way, again, to to have this with these groups together.

15
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,600
But. Well, and therefore,

16
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:22,450
it's important to recognize that there are important differences fruit for the prevention and and interventions more broadly against these diseases.

17
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:32,430
And the preventions, generally speaking, are effective and they're widely available, as is treatment in most cases for most of these diseases.

18
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,320
The problem is implementing and maintaining them. And this is, I think.

19
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:47,130
Probably something that most of you are now, if you haven't already realized that, realizing that we know an awful lot about the biology now of many,

20
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:57,599
many conditions, about the social determinants of risk, about what creates opportunities for increased transmission, increased.

21
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,030
Exposure increased. Interactions that lead to disease.

22
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:12,330
But we're unable to have effective interventions that are long lasting and produce the desired results.

23
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,320
That's why that's why we're we're doing the kind of work that we're doing, I guess.

24
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:28,390
Let me just briefly give a I guess I'll call it a refresher on the types of transmission.

25
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,729
And again, it's very superficial.

26
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:39,460
But the idea here is to put in context these two groups of diseases, because the transmission, the mode of transmission is critical for both of them.

27
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,070
Direct transmission is, as I think most of you know, immediate.

28
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:52,120
That is to say that there's no time frame from one infected person to another infected person for transmission transfer to occur.

29
00:03:53,080 --> 00:04:01,360
And it requires that the microbe escapes from a human or an animal that is the reservoir.

30
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:11,350
And then in in turn also is received by, in fact, another person who hasn't been infected.

31
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,149
This could be person to person. It could be fecal oral, it could be sexual contact.

32
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,500
We'll talk about today. It could be using surgery through droplet spread.

33
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:28,840
But direct transmission is a mode of transfer, a very broad grouping, if you will,

34
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:35,320
that serves to transmit a variety of different types of infectious agents.

35
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:41,590
And here's just a short list. There are many of them, but these are ones that are typically directly transmitted.

36
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:54,130
Not always, but typically the normal mode of transmission involves direct contact or droplet transfer in the case of some of them.

37
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,870
We're going to talk about direct transmission and sexual contact today.

38
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:08,280
The other types of transmission then would include indirect as a broad category and.

39
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:17,130
This involves a variety. Transfer mechanisms, including Airborne.

40
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:25,920
Vehicle borne. In which the vehicle could be any kind of an object, really.

41
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:34,320
It could be it could be water, it could be food, it could be objects in the environment,

42
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:45,860
a variety of different vehicles on which were in which the microbe exists and with which transfer,

43
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,040
transport and transfer to another uninfected person occurs.

44
00:05:51,610 --> 00:06:01,360
Then of course there's vector borne and that's the one that will also be spending a bit of time today talking about in this case, the vectors are.

45
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,220
Able to acquire the infectious agent from an infected and infectious person.

46
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,910
And then. Transfer to another person.

47
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,660
And the process by which that occurs is through taking a blood meal.

48
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:25,290
So all of the arthropods, insects, ticks and so forth that transfer effectively microbes are blood feeding.

49
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,180
They they don't feed on plants. They feed on human or animal blood.

50
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,920
And as a result,

51
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:39,900
they're capable of acquiring during that blood meal the infectious agent and then transferring it later on in feeding on another person.

52
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:48,249
So we're going to talk. Sorry. So we're going to talk about indirectly parents transmitted vector borne diseases.

53
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:56,340
That's the other major topic. Obviously there has to be a way to get out from an infected person.

54
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,700
And there are a variety of different ways in which that can occur.

55
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:15,630
Today, we're going to focus on sexually transmitted exits, if you will, in from from males and from females to a recipient host human,

56
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:24,390
where the recipient receives the the microbe either directly,

57
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:32,129
as in the case of a sexual transmission event or indirectly through an arthropod that takes a blood meal.

58
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:38,010
Previously from the from the. So the exit here then is through a blood, blood feeding event.

59
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:46,740
And then the transfer or entry of the microbe into the next human host is through another insect bite.

60
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:56,950
Just a brief reminder again that airborne that is indirect involves aerosols

61
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:06,040
that exit one human or animal and enter the usually the respiratory system,

62
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:16,120
sometimes the skin of another person. And there's a distinction that is often made by epidemiologists between droplet versus airborne.

63
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:22,950
And I know this sounds a bit. Too precise, perhaps for some of you.

64
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:31,379
But I think it's important because. And most recently had a lot of experience with this with COVID 19.

65
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:44,580
But droplet spread involves direct transfer in which the person who is infecting another person is within a few inches to no more than,

66
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,670
say, a meter, a few feet of that person.

67
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,310
And that's as opposed to airborne spread, which involves aerosols.

68
00:08:52,320 --> 00:09:01,350
So the idea here is that someone who is standing within very close proximity, a few feet will will receive droplets.

69
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,790
But that's a what we consider to be a direct transmission of that.

70
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:14,759
Infectious droplets that are drying, droplets that become droplet nuclei, then are the ones that become aerosolized.

71
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,930
And so transmission can occur over long periods of time and over long distances.

72
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:23,940
There are lots of different examples of that indirect airborne transmission.

73
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,430
And we can add COVID 19 to the list now to.

74
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:38,059
Vehicle borne is another kind of indirect transmission that involves what we call fomites,

75
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,360
very often water, as I mentioned, water, food, surgical instruments.

76
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,930
If it's in or through a pod that has its proboscis,

77
00:09:47,930 --> 00:10:04,580
it's feeding parts of the head or its feet infected from walking on or in a wound or in fecal matter or in on a dead, decaying animal.

78
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:10,850
And it acquires a pathogen that way. That's not what we're talking about with vector borne infection.

79
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:18,440
And then I'll explain about that. You. But in this case, then you can have vehicle borne indirect transmission that does involve Norfolk Island.

80
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:27,650
But that's not what we're talking about. And in most cases, the microbe has not multiplied in or on the vehicle before it gets transmitted.

81
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:36,530
There are lots of examples of that. Cholera Cryptosporidiosis streptococcal infections, hep C, polio, salmonella, many others.

82
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:43,670
So again, this is another form of indirect transmission, but it's a vehicle for we're not going to talk about that.

83
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:49,790
Instead we're going to talk about vector borne. And so in this case, the.

84
00:10:50,770 --> 00:11:02,080
Transmission is from an animal to another arthropod, usually typically an insect or a tick or a might,

85
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:08,950
just, again, a minor detail, but one that you might want to remember.

86
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:13,750
Arthropods are the broad group. Insects do not include ticks.

87
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:19,390
Ticks are in a separate, completely separate group of of arthropods, ticks and mites and so forth.

88
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:25,010
So when I say arthropod, what I'm really saying is insect or tech or mite or something like that.

89
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:37,420
But. The microbe multiplies within that insect or that tick or that right, and it develops in it or both.

90
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,590
And so the idea here is that there is a biological process.

91
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:50,650
These insects with these ticks have to acquire the infection, and then it takes time for the infection to replicate within it.

92
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:59,920
So it's a complex biological process, which is one that can give us opportunities for intervention.

93
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:14,140
And this acquisition then is from an infected human or animal host and then the biological replication occurs within the arthropod.

94
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,990
After that period of time, then the arthropod takes another blood meal from another.

95
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,459
Host in most cases are human ones that we're interested in.

96
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:30,370
Most are humans, and that host then can become infected.

97
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:38,800
The microbes can also be transmitted by female arthropods to their eggs or to the next stage in development.

98
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:45,760
So really complex life cycles that have co-evolved over over millions of years.

99
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:58,180
And so it means that on one hand, there are a whole lot of points of entry into the into the dynamics of transmission that we can consider.

100
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:08,389
But on the other hand, the reason that they're around is they've co-evolved for millennia and are able to be very

101
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:16,610
efficient in transmission and evading immune systems and surviving in over long periods of time,

102
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,230
sometimes in their arthropod vectors and so forth.

103
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,480
So again, this is just sort of background.

104
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:29,950
And as I mentioned, this notion of biological development occurs before the next blood meal.

105
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:35,860
And there are tons of examples of vector borne diseases that you've heard of Lyme disease, malaria, plague, etc.

106
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:42,660
So. Okay. So finally, in this brief background,

107
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:54,690
let me just remind you of the way in which natural reservoirs of these pathogens plays the role anthropomorphic diseases where in fact,

108
00:13:54,690 --> 00:14:09,120
bonuses are those in which the primary vertebrate host and then natural transmission cycle involves humans and nurses and animals can become infected,

109
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,870
but they don't don't serve as maintenance reservoirs for transmission.

110
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:18,930
So even though there might be spillover from a transmission cycle that involves human to human, human malaria, for example,

111
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:28,710
a mosquito that feeds on a cow who is in the mosquito is infectious, might transmit the Plasmodium parasite, but the cow won't become sick.

112
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:36,260
The cow won't become infected. And that. So answering those these are animal sorry human to human infections.

113
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:42,890
Animal infections involve zoonoses in which the normal reservoir is a nonhuman animal.

114
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:48,940
And sometimes those non-humans experienced disease.

115
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,620
Those animals experience disease, but not always.

116
00:14:52,160 --> 00:15:02,510
But in humans, a zoonotic disease or a zoonosis involves non-human vertebrate hosts as the primary reservoirs.

117
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:09,560
And so this could be either directly or indirectly transmission mediated, if you will.

118
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:16,850
And in fact, you can have maintenance of you think of an example or maintenance of transmission

119
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:23,570
that is vector borne in which there's spillover to humans from these animals.

120
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:33,860
Well, that doesn't involve the vector. So, for example, Rift Valley Fever is a good example where I don't know if it's a good example,

121
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,310
but it's one that I studied a lot ages ago and know a bit about.

122
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:44,329
But the transmission cycle involves this virus being acquired by eighties mosquitoes,

123
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:53,690
principally transmitted to other from cows, from camels, from sheep to other cows, camels and sheep.

124
00:15:54,110 --> 00:16:00,739
And that's normally the transmission of cycling. And sometimes there's some disease in in pregnant use, for example.

125
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:06,030
But most of the time it doesn't kill the host. And and there's a maintenance of transmission.

126
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:16,370
Then in those non-humans, people who butcher these animals are at high risk of becoming infected from the blood and organs of tissue,

127
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:27,000
from the animals that they're butchering and in fact, can acquire and pretty often die from Rift Valley Fever as a result of that.

128
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:34,880
So but most most of the zoonoses, all of the zoonoses talked about today are are vector borne.

129
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:39,470
And then there are some that we call anthropomorphism and they can go both directions.

130
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,760
Probably the best example that's closest to home for us right now is influenza.

131
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,710
That would be a.

132
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:56,770
Directly transfer directly or indirectly aerosolized transmission of a virus that includes not just human to human to human transmission,

133
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,009
but human to animal transmission and animal to animal transmission.

134
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:09,639
And some of the same strains that animals like pigs and waterfowl acquire are ones that we can also become infected with,

135
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:16,510
and we probably contribute to the pool of virus that these animals then receive after we've been infected as humans.

136
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:22,830
Okay. So you can think of these modes of transmission in the following way.

137
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:27,480
Directly transmitted into pronounces are human to human directly.

138
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:37,160
Directly transmitted. Zoonoses, zoonotic infections are typically animals to animals, but then sometimes people get in the way.

139
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,320
Indirectly transmitted. Answer Windows are human.

140
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,770
To vector or object to human.

141
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:57,069
And that's the normal mode of transmission or indirectly transmitted or indirectly transmitted zoonoses in which the normal

142
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:07,180
mode is animal to vector to animal with occasional spillover by another vector via a vector feeding on humans to us.

143
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:16,840
So I'm spending as much time as I as I am on this because I think it's important to help you think about how we go about intervening,

144
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:28,220
knowing where the reservoirs are, what the mode of transmission is, and in part why we've grouped the two groups that we have today.

145
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,680
The way we have is is based on mode of transmission.

146
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,120
Okay. Let me just pause here for a moment.

147
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,990
Questions or comments about this. Any one of this is kind of straightforward.

148
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:49,280
No. Okay.

149
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,100
Yeah, this is all sort of background. All right. Vector borne diseases.

150
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,840
Let's start with them. They are very important.

151
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:05,090
One in six of all infectious diseases is a vector borne disease globally.

152
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:10,760
Globally, with an estimated 700,000 deaths annually.

153
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:19,530
Currently. There are an enormous variety of blood feeding, blood sucking arthropod species,

154
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:26,790
and they transmit a variety, a huge variety of parasites, bacteria and viruses.

155
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:33,980
I'll briefly mentioned malaria here caused by the parasite Plasmodium.

156
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:40,610
It's estimated that there are at least 60 or so species of anopheles mosquitoes.

157
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:49,640
Human malaria is only the Plasmodium that causes human malaria is only transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes.

158
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:56,600
There are probably 30 or 40 genera genera of of mosquitoes.

159
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:02,870
And this one genus is the only one that transmits Plasmodium to humans.

160
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:08,630
And it's estimated today that more than 200 million cases occur annually.

161
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,240
We have had enormous success in reducing transmission over the last decade or so,

162
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:22,190
such that globally now there are only 400,000 only only 400,000 deaths per year.

163
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,650
Most of those are occurring in under five children.

164
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:33,390
And I say there's been enormous progress because this number used to be closer to eight or 900,000 deaths every year.

165
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:50,760
Just due to malaria. It's estimated that dengue, for example, puts nearly 4 billion people at risk of infection with the dengue virus of dengue fever.

166
00:20:51,630 --> 00:21:01,140
And perhaps as many as 130 countries are included in that large number, 96 million cases every year.

167
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,570
And this is much less lethal.

168
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:10,530
So there may be only 40,000 deaths annually, but it's one of the fastest growing vector borne diseases.

169
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:22,830
Part of the reason for this is that it is. Very readily transmitted by a variety of AIDS species different than the Anopheles species.

170
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:29,100
So an ugly species won't transmit dengue virus, a native species won't transmit Plasmodium.

171
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,760
So again, this is just in this little nutshell here of two examples.

172
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:45,810
You can see the complexity and and the fact that the 80 species that we're concerned about are able to breed in small containers as little as eight,

173
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:55,170
a plastic cup that was thrown out in the backyard with the trash that accumulates rainwater abbes aegypti.

174
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:59,430
Female mosquitoes will lay eggs in that little cup of water.

175
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:07,470
And bingo, you have to have a local quantity of kilos capable of transmitting dengue right in your home, literally in your own backyard.

176
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,819
Lots of other vector borne diseases, and I'll mention a few of them. Just very briefly.

177
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:20,790
Again, this is a superficial overview. To teach a whole course on this Chagas disease, which menaces some of these you've heard of schistosomiasis,

178
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:30,120
hundreds of millions of people are affected worldwide by these these diseases and the associated infection with them.

179
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:38,610
I'll mention here that schistosomiasis, in the eyes of some people, is not a true vector borne disease.

180
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,050
It's not a an arthropod vector borne disease.

181
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:55,020
In fact, the primary transmitter of schistosoma management is to some species of elements is are snails, a variety of snail species.

182
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,950
So it's not arthropods. And again,

183
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:04,319
most of these diseases are preventable and there are plenty of protective measures that

184
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:13,710
people can can employ and are being employed with more or less effective results.

185
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:19,259
And I see a hand is raised. Which is just announcing.

186
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,010
Feel free to drop questions, I guess. QUESTION Did you have a question?

187
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,799
Yeah. So dropping the child over. Oh, go ahead.

188
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:34,100
You can ask now if you wish. Yeah. When you're mentioning those vector borne diseases,

189
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:42,470
I just wondering when you were talking about like the definitions of direct and indirect contact for zoonosis and all that,

190
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:49,520
you mentioned how it was between human beings and vertebrates.

191
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,760
And I was wondering like, are there invertebrates involved? I don't know if that was like a silly question, but I was just thinking about it.

192
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:01,340
Not a silly question, a very good one. The challenge here is that.

193
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:19,480
For any pathogen to be able to survive to to invade as through a portal of entry replicate and eventually then be transmitted exit.

194
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:25,270
It has to have for the most part has to have co-evolved with someone similar to us.

195
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:32,820
So a lot of primate infections and diseases end up being human infections and disease, but not always.

196
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:45,460
And there's a lot of viruses that can do quite well in in rodents or or in in some cases in insects where there's trans ovarian transmission,

197
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:57,070
insect insect transmission. But for the most part, the reservoir hosts are vertebrates, and for the most part, they are mammals.

198
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:09,280
And for the most part, well, I'll leave it there. And I say that simply because those pathogens, those microbes, before they're even pathogenic,

199
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:19,060
those microbes have evolved characteristics to exploit the internal environments of of these other hosts.

200
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:29,980
And if if we were infected by a plant virus, we'd almost certainly not become ill because it wouldn't be able to replicate.

201
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:37,239
And we might have a mild immune reaction to a foreign body being injected into us.

202
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,480
But but we wouldn't have a true infection and we wouldn't get sick.

203
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:50,529
So for the most part, these are non-human vertebrates, mammals in particular, that serve as the natural maintenance reservoir,

204
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,769
where there's mouth to mouth to mouth transmission,

205
00:25:53,770 --> 00:26:03,550
either directly or indirectly or or or deer to adhere to deer transmission or your vertebrate host.

206
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:10,120
And so the role then that the insects play is, in the case of vector borne transmission,

207
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:17,739
is to acquire this from a non-human host during a blood meal and then during a later blood meal, subsequent blood meal.

208
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:24,010
If that insect survives long enough to take a second blood meal to transmit, transmit, does that help?

209
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,890
Great. Thanks for asking the question. We have one more mark.

210
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:35,930
I know a number of these diseases are diseases. You all are writing about your paper for your paper.

211
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:39,560
So definitely ask questions. We have papers on malaria.

212
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,879
I got some Bengay, but Caroline was asking in the chat,

213
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:50,330
how does vector control look different for different arthropod species, like flying insects for sex?

214
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,850
Oh gosh, that's really hard to generalize, but.

215
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:02,050
I guess what I would the way I would answer this is that.

216
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:10,390
The natural history characteristics of the different vectors, groups of vectors.

217
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:18,160
Let me put it that way. Will encourage certain kinds of interventions through the environment, for example.

218
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:30,400
So. Insects that transmit infections that are primarily found breeding in water like mosquitoes.

219
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:39,490
You have opportunities to intervene through controlling the presence of breeding sites, water breeding sites.

220
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:46,989
Insects that transmit Chagas disease don't breed in water.

221
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:52,660
They live in the walls of dwellings, human dwellings.

222
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:58,600
And so your intervention strategy would be very different, again,

223
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:07,570
against the population of the vector, but also against the contact between the vector and the humans.

224
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:15,309
I mean, in, in the simplest of worlds, if all we had were lots of insects that fed on us sorry,

225
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:21,340
insects that were capable of transmitting but didn't feed on us. You wouldn't care if if they if there were lots of them.

226
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:25,150
So one intervention, of course, is to reduce the abundance of those factors.

227
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:34,540
Then another intervention would be to reduce vector, human contact and another and that could be with the same number of vectors,

228
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:44,020
you can have nets or you can have traps or you can you can introduce different kinds of ways of

229
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:50,350
modifying their behavior attractants that will draw them to other other hosts instead of humans.

230
00:28:51,990 --> 00:29:01,980
So that the problem with trying to generalize is that there are first many points of intervention in a vector borne disease cycle.

231
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:12,330
And secondly, the vectors vary enormously, even within within a broad group, say, say the flies.

232
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:23,320
Deptula. There are huge, huge variety of different habitats where they breed sites, where they hang out during the day.

233
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,680
Some of them feed only at night, others during the day.

234
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:33,070
Some of them feed primarily on certain kinds of non-human hosts.

235
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:44,350
Sand flies. Well, a good example is that one of the papers that I suggested look at sand flies typically will be in forested areas, not in.

236
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:56,650
Or at the edge of forested areas. And some species are very abundant in forested areas, others in in the edge or in urban settings.

237
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:04,300
And the ones that are important then that you care about, you need to understand where they are in order to intervene against them.

238
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:10,100
And so it's just really hard to generalize, even though we all try to do it.

239
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,430
It's a great it's a great a great way to think about it.

240
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:24,230
And that's where the the insights into the kinds of intervention might be found is looking at the F the differences, as well as the similarities.

241
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:33,990
Other questions. Okay, then let me move ahead.

242
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:49,920
The next. Slide that I have here is just a quick summary which I stole from and acknowledge that it was from one of the readings today actually.

243
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:56,100
And I just want to illustrate the magnitude of impact in this case.

244
00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:05,850
Disability adjusted life years lost through various vector borne diseases, $46 million lost to malaria each year.

245
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:15,930
We mentioned the natural history here, dengue, I've already mentioned as well 2.3 million that we lost the mosquito eighties thank you virus.

246
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:23,610
If just though we've discussed already snails schistosoma trauma toads.

247
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:32,379
The lymphatic filariasis including lymphatic filariasis $1.6 million lost every year.

248
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:39,210
A variety of different mosquitoes to two major genera of of nematodes.

249
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:48,780
Monoculture, crisis, river blindness. Here's a good example where another fly in the in the dip era but these black flies I

250
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,439
think some of you may already know this I don't know what you've come across already,

251
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,950
but they they predominantly breed in fast flowing streams.

252
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,520
The females lay their eggs on.

253
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:06,400
On water on plants that are water, water based thereon.

254
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:18,140
And the larvae then attach to these blades of of plants and filter feed as well as gain oxygen in the oxygenated water.

255
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:25,100
Why do I belabor that? Well, because these black flies which transmit Uncle Circo volvulus,

256
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:33,440
the primary agent causing Uncle psoriasis or river blindness, they only are found around fast flowing streams.

257
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:38,270
And the intervention then insecticidal interventions.

258
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:43,879
Interventions are focused on those streams where black flies are abundant and there's

259
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:50,030
been a very effective global campaign towards elimination in many countries,

260
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,720
effective in eliminating uncle in many countries,

261
00:32:53,930 --> 00:33:01,909
and eventually the hope of eradicating both because we know of very specific blackfly

262
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:09,430
that's the only fly that transmits Uncle Shaka and because humans are the only reservoir.

263
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:15,170
So this is a vector borne answer for noses in which we can control.

264
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:20,420
We can treat people who are who have the infectious stage, the black flies,

265
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:26,600
and we can reduce blackfly abundance with a very targeted insecticidal approach.

266
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,750
So. The devil's in the details, unfortunately.

267
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:35,760
And this is the frustration of of of talking about this huge group of infections all at once.

268
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:40,240
But but that's what we have today. Sam flies in with mania.

269
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:47,110
That was, again, one of the topics that we're reading today, Japanese encephalitis.

270
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:54,190
Again, Culex mosquitoes. It's a virus that transmits that's transmitted by mosquitoes.

271
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:57,160
Yellow fever. You're all familiar with that and so forth.

272
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:08,379
The point I want to make is the huge impact that just these few vector borne diseases have on disability adjusted life years lost.

273
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,560
And more broadly, the numbers are here.

274
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:17,980
But for some of them at least, there are fatal cases depending on which ones we're talking about.

275
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:28,940
Okay. Quick question, mark. Yes, I know there's been this I've read a lot of things recently about climate change and loss of biodiversity.

276
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,470
I don't know if this is a strange question,

277
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:39,620
but is there ever a conflict between trying to limit vector borne disease and concerns about loss of biodiversity?

278
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:52,150
Some people raised this question in the context of, well, the simple way to put it is so are mosquitoes good for anything?

279
00:34:53,750 --> 00:35:08,630
And the the answer is yes for some things, but it's not a a valuable question to be asking because there's no way we could ever get rid of mosquitoes.

280
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:18,540
Neither the particular species that we're concerned about that are vectors of important diseases in humans,

281
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:28,260
nor more broadly, the group of arthropods that are are important in that regard.

282
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:36,180
And we probably wouldn't want to. What is being done, of course, and this is outside of the question that you asked, though,

283
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:43,770
is that there are efforts to genetically modified some of these vectors so that they are no longer able to transmit

284
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:56,550
primarily through modifying their immune system or their ability to allow for replication of the parasite within them.

285
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:03,420
But but the the bigger question here, I guess, is environmental modification leading to.

286
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:11,500
Radical changes in mosquito or tick or or fill in the blank vector.

287
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,760
Is occurring in some cases, but it's uneven and there's no simple way of predicting it,

288
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,720
despite the fact that there's a lot of concern about global warming,

289
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:30,640
altering environmental conditions for some vectors, perhaps increasing them in certain settings.

290
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:44,740
In general. I think it's if there are other reasons to reduce our carbon footprint and to combat global warming, then in vector borne diseases,

291
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:52,060
and yet we know that there is likely to be impacts, there are likely to be impacts that will that will occur.

292
00:36:54,170 --> 00:37:01,459
I don't know if I quite aired in or deviated too much from the question you asked there, but, you know, that makes sense.

293
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:05,240
Thank you. Oh, and Bobby has a question, too.

294
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,810
Hi. Yes.

295
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:16,100
So a couple of years ago, I took a class on eukaryotic biology and we talked about, like methods of vector control, specifically like for mosquitoes.

296
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:22,879
And I think we were talking about malaria at the time, but something that came up was like, as you mentioned, stopping the reproductive cycle.

297
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:31,340
So they would like basically get these male mosquitoes and dip them in this like chemical, which was abbreviated as of course I remember it perfectly,

298
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:38,840
but it basically sterilized the males and once they like tried to reproduce the female, it rubbed off on the female.

299
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:42,439
So she wasn't able to reproduce because the male was already sterile.

300
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:48,140
But then the chemical gets on her and she's no longer able to reproduce and continue the life cycle.

301
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:56,690
Do you think that's a pretty like viable option in terms of like halting vector transmission or is that more like a short term solution?

302
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:10,810
So in general, the interventions like that one that you've raised and genetic modification and other behavioral manipulations and so forth,

303
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:14,920
they're aimed at either reducing.

304
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:23,250
The abundance of the vector or modifying its behavior or ability its behavior.

305
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:35,190
In this case, reproduction you mention or its behavior to feed on on hosts that are infectious or allow for the parasite to develop.

306
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:42,930
The big problem that I see with this is there it's basically a question of scale.

307
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:56,930
Being able to show that in this experimental context there was an effective loss in in the reduction in reproduction is is one thing but then.

308
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:03,250
I guess that's the way to put it is how would you ever make that kind of an intervention big enough

309
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:10,180
in a cost effective way to have an impact on mosquito on this particular mosquitoes abundance?

310
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:13,780
Number one. Number two, if you put enough of this.

311
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:23,230
Compound PGP. It's probably some kind of the hormone sex hormone or I'm not sure what it would be, but in any event, if you put enough of that out,

312
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:31,240
it's entirely possible that you would have major impacts on other arthropods and other insects in particular,

313
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:36,250
especially closely related ones that could produce negative effects in other ways.

314
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:45,250
So one of the one of the challenges in any of these large scale interventions is impacting on non-target vectors.

315
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:54,870
Another kind of concern is that if you can demonstrate that genetic modification of

316
00:39:55,140 --> 00:40:00,480
a vector has reduced its ability to transmit through whatever or whatever pathway,

317
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:07,440
how do you drive that genetic change through the population?

318
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:12,420
You can introduce it with a large number of modified mosquitoes that you release.

319
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:19,080
But unless those mosquitoes reproduce better than the natural strain that's out there already,

320
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,799
you're not going to have the kind of impact that you want.

321
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:34,020
And eventually that that unless it enhances reproduction as well as reduces transmission through whatever pathway you've you've engineered,

322
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:40,290
it's not going to it's not going to be driven into the population. So this is one of the big challenges as well.

323
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:45,310
Does that help? Great. Thank you.

324
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:50,570
Yeah. Okay. So I'm thrilled that you're asking questions.

325
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,640
I'm worried that if I keep answering them, we're going to not get through the material today.

326
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:01,010
So let me let me move forward with with some of the additional fly from our show here.

327
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:04,610
This is a different way to think about it, and it's just sort of turning things around.

328
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:12,350
Is it eighties? Mosquitoes transmit a huge variety of agents that lead to a variety of different diseases.

329
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:17,690
And this is one genus. This is a short list. Anopheles.

330
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:24,950
We've mentioned a few of these. Culex here are a few others. And the point I want to make with these is these are just a few mosquitoes here.

331
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:31,130
A few. So three genera, a few species in each of these.

332
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:38,480
And it's a short list. So there are others that we could be talking about that we don't have time to mention.

333
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:45,829
I raised this issue of schistosomiasis and aquatic snails before, but we'll keep that on the W.H.O. short list.

334
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:55,399
We talked about black flies, but also fleas. We haven't mentioned much about the plague and and to reassess are two diseases.

335
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:02,870
You don't think of this as a as a vector transmitted microbe, but plague certainly is.

336
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:11,420
And lice then are also responsible fleas and lice are responsible for disease we haven't talked about yet.

337
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:16,010
Sand flies we've mentioned already and ticks we haven't really said much about.

338
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:22,940
This is, again, a very short list of ticks that transmit virus, viruses,

339
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:30,710
bacteria and other microbes that are capable of causing a huge variety of diseases.

340
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:39,620
The one big difference that I will mention that leads to opportunities for intervention with ticks that.

341
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:51,690
That isn't the case with most of the other insects that transmit through blood meals is that ticks take a long time to take their blood meal,

342
00:42:52,500 --> 00:43:04,410
literally days. So a tick, depending on the species and depending on the stage, will remain attached to its host for a couple of days,

343
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:09,390
up to three or four or five days even before it would naturally drop off.

344
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:17,010
If it's a three month stick, a larvae drops off, becomes an engorged larva that then molds to become a nymph.

345
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,190
That nymph might not appear for another three or four or five months.

346
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:26,130
The nymph hops on, another host takes a blood meal after three or four days, drops off,

347
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:31,919
becomes an adult after three or four or five months, and the adult then takes another blood meal.

348
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,260
And if it's a female, she'll lay thousands of eggs.

349
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:40,680
But the point is, they're large, long lifecycles, long periods of time that they're feeding on a host.

350
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:47,900
So this opens up opportunities for intervention that you'd normally wouldn't see with very short

351
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:57,060
of shorter lived and shorter feeding insects like mosquitoes and fleas and flies and so forth.

352
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:03,360
So that's an important piece of biology that you might keep in mind if you're comparing.

353
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:08,110
And then finally I try to limit bugs.

354
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,680
And this is another really interesting group, Chagas disease. We mentioned it briefly.

355
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,300
I'm tempted to talk more about them, but I'm not going. It's too much.

356
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:25,070
It's going to take time. Okay. Oh 35 Well, just quickly, we mentioned sleeping sickness.

357
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:33,950
We haven't talked about that. Again, sexy flies are literally common fly like in the sense that they look like them,

358
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:43,969
but they are very different because they feed exclusively on blood as well, except for nectar in some, some cases.

359
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:47,450
But by and large, they're blood feeders as well. All right.

360
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:54,310
This is a different way of doing it. And I'm going to quickly go through this. More than 600 virus is transmitted by a couple of vectors.

361
00:44:54,320 --> 00:45:01,850
That doesn't mean that these are all human disease causing, but a huge variety of viruses are transmitted.

362
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:06,250
Principally, if not entirely, by arthropod vectors.

363
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:12,790
This is a short list. Those are arthropod vectors.

364
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:17,380
Different arthropod vectors can also transmit bacteria and rickettsia.

365
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:23,110
This is a group of rickettsia species, a group of bacteria here.

366
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:31,350
Each of which has one or a few primary vectors, arthropod vectors.

367
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:34,920
And so this host. Sorry.

368
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:44,460
Vector host, vector associated association with particular pathogens.

369
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:52,680
And the coevolution that's led to that is, is another really important thing to keep in mind if you're trying to intervene because it's

370
00:45:52,680 --> 00:46:00,450
not as though any particular mite will be able to transmit any or all of these pathogens.

371
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:07,110
There's a coevolution of host vector and pathogen that is important to keep in mind.

372
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:16,610
Protozoa as well that easier Plasmodium we've talked about this mania, we've talked about chance trips as well.

373
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:28,280
These are all vector borne transport, vector borne infections that lead to protozoan, vector borne diseases of ecosystem analysis and so forth.

374
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:36,830
So again, the notion here that we have a huge variety of vectors, an enormous number of pathogens,

375
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:44,690
but that there is in general a fairly tight vector pathogen relationship.

376
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:50,540
This is worth keeping in mind in talking broadly about this group of active borne diseases.

377
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:55,790
A few other examples. Mosquitoes that transmit, carry and require.

378
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:02,440
Biting midges, we have mentioned. But this is another group as well as the black flies.

379
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:09,340
And these produce the associated diseases that many of you have heard about and maybe,

380
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:13,660
maybe some of you have had, depending on what experience you've had in developing countries.

381
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,880
Okay. Another quick point I want to make here is that the.

382
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:25,040
National Academy of Sciences now.

383
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:36,980
Very dated summary of vector borne disease epidemics that can occur in the 20th century has this huge list, most of which we've talked about.

384
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:46,970
And the principle here is that these infections are recognized as very important in terms of public health impact,

385
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:56,810
but also important in terms of their ability to occur in some settings with unexpected ferocity.

386
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:09,170
The outbreaks that can occur from some of these are huge and and can lead to really devastating health and economic impacts.

387
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:15,950
And so it sometimes it's easy to sort of dismiss these as, oh, well, it's just, you know,

388
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:23,749
it's just a little bit of an infection from getting bitten by a tick or a mosquito or or a sand fly.

389
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:27,979
But no, in fact, that's not the case. These these can be very important infections.

390
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,280
And there's a huge variety of zoonotic infections.

391
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:42,260
These are these are principally anthropogenic. But the zoonoses are also equally important, sometimes much more prone to outbreaks,

392
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:47,719
because human infection isn't the source of the next round of transmission.

393
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:54,170
And so if a large number of non-human vertebrates become infected and are in close proximity to humans,

394
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:59,240
there can be spillover transmission that occurs very unexpectedly producing these epidemics.

395
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:07,209
Another. The tone that I want to bring to your attention if you haven't already seen it.

396
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:12,820
I had the good fortune to be invited to participate as a member of the committee that produced this.

397
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:18,070
Now, now 20 years old, I was astounded to see how old it is now.

398
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:26,470
But I still think it's a very valuable piece of of a source of information.

399
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:34,580
Some of the important factors that lead to the risk of emerging and reemerging vector borne diseases, population growth and unplanned urbanization.

400
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,499
This is something that I think most of you can see is obvious. On one hand,

401
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:43,780
you can imagine certain kinds of urbanization might actually reduce the breeding

402
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:50,080
sites of certain mosquitoes or the proximity of other vectors to humans.

403
00:49:50,410 --> 00:50:00,489
But by and large, regardless of what taking into account certain kinds of vector borne diseases, this kind of environmental change,

404
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:06,790
including population growth in urban settings, leads to an increased risk of emergence or reemergence at once,

405
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:11,710
using the standard socio economic or social inequalities.

406
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:21,609
And more broadly, poverty can lead to increased risk of certain vector borne diseases,

407
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:28,960
reemerging the movement of humans and associated pathogens, vectors and their genes is an obvious one.

408
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,190
And vector borne diseases are not immune to that by any means.

409
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:45,159
Public Health Infrastructure. This is true for most all of the problems that this course is addressing and the human resource capacity,

410
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:49,120
but in particular in medical entomology and vector biology. And I think this is something that.

411
00:50:51,980 --> 00:51:04,219
Has has unfortunately fallen by the wayside. Is that is that training people in the basics of these sciences and the ability to understand vector

412
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:12,260
behavior and ecology and associated epidemiology is unfortunately not not what it used to be.

413
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:18,440
We're faced with a lot of challenges in developing new approaches.

414
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:23,450
Some of the approaches that we've been using are no longer functioning where they were supposed to.

415
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,680
And then more broadly in particular,

416
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:37,220
pesticide resistance and economic disincentives to developing new pesticides has become a big problem for

417
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:44,630
interventions that aim to tend towards the vector and using pesticides and insecticides in particular across sectors.

418
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:52,110
So these are points that were mentioned in the microbial threats to health volume that was published a while back now.

419
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:58,190
Okay. So here we are. So many vector borne diseases.

420
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:01,290
So little time. Any other questions about.

421
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:06,080
Beads that you want to ask before we move to sex.

422
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:14,030
I see. I see a chart here. Let's see. Okay.

423
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:21,260
All right, let's move on then. The eyes or STDs?

424
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:26,180
Again, this is an area of a group of.

425
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:37,870
Infections and diseases that in many ways are underappreciated, not considered all that important.

426
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:40,900
And yet I would argue that's a mistake.

427
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,300
Every day, 1 million STIs are acquired worldwide.

428
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:51,910
1 million every day. But interestingly, most of them are a symptomatic.

429
00:52:53,780 --> 00:53:06,460
300 and almost 400 million new cases of the top four STDs, chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and the common infection occur each year.

430
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:10,430
But interestingly, each of these is curable.

431
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,490
You can treat and cure these infections.

432
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:25,930
A half billion people in the reproductive age group are chronically infected with herpes simplex virus and genital herpes.

433
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:39,210
An estimated 300,000 cancer deaths due to cervical cancer occur each year as a result of almost entirely the result of HPV infection.

434
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:47,580
About a million women who are pregnant. Have syphilis.

435
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:54,690
And this has led to an estimated 350,000 adverse birth outcomes every year.

436
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:06,440
STDs or STIs directly impact people through stigmatization, infertility, cancers and so forth.

437
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:16,910
So there's in addition to the biophysical impacts, other indirect, if you will, impacts as well.

438
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:28,520
And yet we're faced with the problem of drug resistance again on the rise, meaning that these STIs, which are generally treatable,

439
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:33,919
are becoming less treatable because of either and the need for an increase in the

440
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:40,040
amount of drug being used or or the absence of any drugs that are truly effective.

441
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:44,300
So this is a big problem is being faced worldwide now.

442
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:54,780
Okay. Just a quick reminder here that STDs and stars aren't quite the same, but basically the difference is asymptomatic and asymptomatic.

443
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,260
You can have an apparent or mild symptoms.

444
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:07,440
In the case of asymptomatic, in apparent or mild, that can lead to serious complications and no serious complications.

445
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:21,180
Biophysical complications can have consequences that can be not always fatal, but can be severe and very disruptive to people's wellbeing.

446
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:28,980
Painful and an unpleasant, but are most often severe in women and newborn babies.

447
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:37,010
Those symptoms include the variety shown here, a urethral discharge of all and so forth.

448
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:41,180
And the point I want to make is that perhaps the.

449
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:49,889
Lack of attention that's paid to Steve's relatives is in part because.

450
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:58,500
Well, all right, this is just a little bit of pain. And it'll you know, it won't it won't affect your ability to to work that much.

451
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:05,100
And you can get on with your life and it's probably not going to kill you and so forth and so on.

452
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:15,810
This is not taking into account the morbidity, the enormous morbidity that studies and studies produce and in some cases, mortality.

453
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:21,400
Very brief overview of the infectious agents that are involved.

454
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:26,290
Bacteria. Different species. Very different genera.

455
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:31,440
Involving different species as well. Producing syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and roids.

456
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:40,630
Those are all bacteria. The primary protozoan is took them on as nationalists recent trichomoniasis.

457
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:53,050
Various viruses that produce symptoms more or less, but all of which are sexually transmitted.

458
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:56,940
Primarily sexually transmitted. And.

459
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:10,130
The the important point, I think, to keep in mind here is that this notion of STD's as primarily symptomatic is is mistaken.

460
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:17,210
This is the tip of the iceberg, if you will, and the bulk of infections are asymptomatic.

461
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:27,320
So there are not STDs in the sense that they're diseases that have recognizable symptoms, but they're asymptomatic very often.

462
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,740
And this varies between male females for the most part.

463
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:42,020
Males have much more symptomatic expression of infection than females, and females tend to have much more asymptomatic infection.

464
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:50,570
Not that it means that they females generally don't have symptomatic infection,

465
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:57,860
but that the way in which infection manifests itself very often is is not recognized or not seen.

466
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:05,120
And this may in part be due to women being less willing to seek treatment or seek

467
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:10,130
diagnosis initially and treatment for STDs because of stigmatization and so forth.

468
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:23,540
A quick global picture of, in this case, the age standardized incidence in 2019 of all studies.

469
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:30,059
Again, there was that group of four that that was mentioned earlier that represents the primary ones.

470
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:42,300
But but this is all NCI so it's more than just that and the age ten standardized incidence rate per 100,000 shown here is the scale

471
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:51,810
and the idea is that you can see various parts of the world that have a much higher incidence than other parts of the world.

472
00:58:53,670 --> 00:59:01,469
And in a in a way this isn't surprising, probably in in other ways,

473
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:06,240
perhaps there are some anomalies that would be worth looking into into, for example,

474
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:22,200
India has a relatively lower age standardized incidence of all STIs, whereas much of sub-Saharan Africa has a much higher age standardized incidence.

475
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:28,950
Different way of looking at it is the number of cases in 2016.

476
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:38,590
And you can see here that the. Number varies by continent, but this is for the big four and it's a huge number.

477
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:46,090
This is granted the number of existing cases of of prevalent cases in one year.

478
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:57,730
But is millions of of people, men and women who will experience or don't experience, but who are infected with agents that cause these diseases.

479
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:07,690
And of course, even if you are not experiencing disease, you are at risk of infecting other people in the process,

480
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:12,700
transmitting agents to other other unsuspecting people,

481
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:19,870
because you perhaps recognize that you're infectious and your sexual partner doesn't know either.

482
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:25,810
And so it creates that that opportunity for transmission unexpectedly.

483
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:36,090
Men and women are different in this regard. And it's interesting if you look at now by income, high income countries for women in this case,

484
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:41,550
it's apparent to middle, low and lower, lower middle and lower income.

485
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:47,729
There's a general pattern of trend of increase, but you can see that there's variation.

486
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:50,490
So for example in high income countries, the relative.

487
01:00:52,710 --> 01:01:02,970
Incidence of chlamydia as compared to the MONA infection analysis about the same, whereas it's very different in low income countries.

488
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:13,830
So there's a sense that you can develop sort of nuanced understanding of this in the case of women and similarly in the case of men.

489
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:22,860
It's interesting that in the case of men, the chlamydia infection has a higher prevalence,

490
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:29,640
and you can see it here in all four income categories than the other infections.

491
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:38,159
And this is probably not related to infection so much as an apparent infection.

492
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:47,550
In other words, whether or not these men have been tested, had symptoms and have been tested for these infections is is a separate, separate question.

493
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:51,810
And then we can look at it a little differently as well, in this case with.

494
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:58,709
Incidence rate estimates for chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis and syphilis.

495
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:07,680
And you can see that in this case for women in African region versus other parts of the world by W.H.O. regions.

496
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:13,139
By and large, certain regions of the Americas and the African region,

497
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:19,070
we saw that on the map earlier, have a much higher prevalence of most all of these four big ones.

498
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:23,190
And similarly for men as well. Okay.

499
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:28,760
What are the risk factors then for. For these speeches.

500
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:33,170
And in a sense, what are the implications for us as epidemiologists?

501
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:45,360
I think it's not a surprise that the people who have the highest partner, sexual partner, exchange or change rate are the ones at highest risk.

502
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:50,010
And this is, generally speaking, adolescents and young adults, but not exclusively.

503
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:56,490
Commercial sex workers are in the same category of having a large number of partners.

504
01:02:57,090 --> 01:03:05,160
The lifetime number of sex partners, the time between sex partners and the number of concurrent sex partners also increases risk.

505
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:15,720
And then if you choose or end up having sex with partners from high prevalence groups,

506
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:25,350
this obviously is something that would increase your risk of being exposed and of of acquiring a STI.

507
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:33,150
Transmission then in the case of.

508
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:42,530
Sorry. Let I mean, what happened here? Yeah. In. In the case of transmission.

509
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:48,260
Generally speaking, transmission occurs early in infection.

510
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:59,840
So if you are shedding pathogens shortly after being exposed, were infected and eventually infected and replication occurs,

511
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:04,370
you're at highest risk of transmitting to your sexual partner.

512
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:11,220
But it really it depends.

513
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:18,120
And this has a lot to do with the number of new cases that each infected person generates.

514
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:31,380
There are ways in which this in this intervention interventions can be effective and if if used properly, decreased transmission very effectively.

515
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:43,410
But by and large, it turns out that these interventions are not being used in cases where a known infection occurs simply by choice,

516
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:46,050
or in most cases where infection is not known.

517
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:58,480
So there's this issue then of having a bridge population where people are transmitting among themselves and are sometimes unknowingly infectious.

518
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:03,110
Interacting sexually with a bridging population.

519
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:06,530
People who use commercial sex work.

520
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:16,310
Workers who are interacting with non partner relationships on a regular basis.

521
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:24,890
They then can serve as bridging a group of bridging people who transmit then to the general population.

522
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:28,910
And so this notion of there being core transmitters, I think is critical.

523
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:37,910
And again, these are transmitters who sometimes are not aware that they are infectious and as a result, are not taking precautions.

524
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:44,639
The thing to keep in mind is that you've had your HIV lecture, I believe,

525
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:59,280
and other STDs other than HIV also are important in increasing the risk of HIV infection occurring when when exposure takes place.

526
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:10,920
So if you have an STD and you are exposed to someone who is HIV positive in a in a manner that would lead to transmission,

527
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:16,200
you're at much higher risk of acquiring that infection than if you didn't have that STD.

528
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:27,540
And this STD STI HIV interaction has led to using STI control as a way to reduce risk of HIV.

529
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:37,470
What are some of the barriers then to SETI control at a community level?

530
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:52,950
We've got a variety of ways in which skills are not being well, are being transmitted more frequently, and therefore intervention is is hampered.

531
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,270
Some of the obvious ones. Poverty and labor. Migration.

532
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:06,270
So when families are separated, men in particular will have sexual relations with other women other than their primary partner.

533
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:17,280
The fact that women in low status settings are very often involved in risky social behavior

534
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:24,420
and are unable to control very often who they have sex with puts them at higher risk.

535
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:33,190
In many settings, the ability to seek health care or STIs is limited or nonexistent.

536
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:45,370
So treatment is is not available effectively. And so access to the health care facilities is is a major problem at the community level.

537
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:55,200
How do you deal with this? Well, try to deal with the socioeconomic and social policies, if you will,

538
01:07:55,470 --> 01:08:00,570
that reduce family separation and thereby reduce the vulnerability of those people.

539
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:09,990
Improve education for girls, which would reduce their drive, their pull to becoming sex workers and increase their power.

540
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:20,880
Improving the availability of health health care services, which would increase prevention and care and then education on symptoms and so forth.

541
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:27,390
This, too, would, I think, have a major impact on improving STI.

542
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:34,820
Prevention at a community level. Okay.

543
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:42,290
So that's really all I wanted to say about STDs, but I hope you have some questions.

544
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:50,520
We still have a few minutes left. He wants to raise some issues from what I just said on on this or on the previous discussion on.

545
01:08:51,960 --> 01:09:05,590
Vector borne diseases. Are any of you planning to write your projects on STDs?

546
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:18,180
Well, we have a few. So we have at least one person and maybe two that are two, I think, that are writing about HIV.

547
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:28,060
I'm doing tuberculosis, but I do talk about HIV occasionally with co-morbidity.

548
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:40,840
And in particular TB as a co-morbid condition for expression of STIs or or with HIV.

549
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:47,200
It's my focus is TB. So HIV is more of, you know, just talking about co-morbidity with TB?

550
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:51,660
Great. Any others who are doing.

551
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:56,360
Or maybe now wish you were doing scissor CDs.

552
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:07,610
Okay. We've got a couple of minutes left. I don't know if you were able to take a look at the two readings.

553
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:13,070
I tried to choose two different readings that were epidemiological in nature

554
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:23,390
related to these two broad topics and different in their analytical approaches.

555
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:36,110
And if you were able to look at them, did you have any thoughts or questions or concerns about what they what they presented?

556
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:50,420
I had a question about here on paper, the deforestation article.

557
01:10:51,320 --> 01:11:01,190
I'm just wondering if you could perhaps expand a little bit because the introduction section didn't expand too much on us, but the how exactly.

558
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:09,780
Like the incidence of visceral leishmaniasis increases with deforestation.

559
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:16,350
Like what exactly is happening to the ecological habitat of the vector?

560
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:22,530
Big question. Yeah. So the premise of this study.

561
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:27,440
That's not the way to put the hypothesis being tested by this.

562
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:37,400
This study was that sand flies a particular species of sand fly loots, the Mejia launch of Pampas,

563
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:46,100
which is the primary vector of the agent that's causing this release leishmaniasis in this area in Brazil.

564
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:51,380
Is most abundant in.

565
01:11:53,150 --> 01:12:01,400
Non forested areas. And I'm being intentionally careful here not to say urban or peri urban or.

566
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:13,549
Or anything else. And. The reason I'm hesitating here is it actually is very able to exploit habitats that are partially

567
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:23,060
forested or forest edges or rocky outcroppings that don't have a lot of plant material,

568
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:27,770
but have a low lying vegetation and so forth.

569
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:37,310
They lay their eggs in in crevices or in in soil that's not shaded.

570
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:42,920
So a heavy forest. This species of sand fly will never be found in heavy forest.

571
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:50,450
It's almost always very domestic. If. If the human habitation is near a forest, fine.

572
01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:53,120
But in a forest, you'd never find them.

573
01:12:53,360 --> 01:13:01,400
People who live in forests have different species of sand flies that they have to worry about and different at least many species as well.

574
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:09,770
So the premise here was that if you encroach on the forest, remove some of the forest,

575
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:15,290
that the vectors that transmit leishmania in this setting will become more abundant

576
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:20,840
and in closer contact with people because they don't feed exclusively on people.

577
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:25,980
And in fact, non-human reservoirs.

578
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:36,240
I've forgotten now which. I think it's primarily domestic animals in this context, probably sheep and goats and so forth.

579
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:44,970
They serve as a as an excellent reservoir, as an excellent host to feeding them my lounge puppies.

580
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:50,730
And so and they can also serve as reservoirs for the pathogen for at least mania.

581
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:58,460
And so. As you alter the environment in this way, you increase the habitat for them.

582
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:06,350
For the same. Apply the same for abundance and increases as well as the amount of feeding on people.

583
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:13,700
But there's enough feeding on non-humans that there can be zoonotic transfer in these settings.

584
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:18,160
And so that's sort of the underlying hypothesis.

585
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:32,150
And they demonstrated this association in a natural, naturalistic experiment, if you will, where they monitored over time changes in the habitat.

586
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:43,860
And demonstrated this, or rather estimated it using satellite imagery and deforestation associated through that pathway.

587
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:53,320
And then the resulting number of canine cases, I believe it was, as well as human cases of leash mania,

588
01:14:53,340 --> 01:15:01,860
infection and the number of samples estimated by the government trapping agency, the government vector borne disease group.

589
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:04,770
And so they demonstrated that association.

590
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:14,090
And in a nutshell, I don't know if that answers answers your question, but that's how I would sort of try to summarize it.

591
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:25,680
Don't. Thank you. And I guess one of the challenges I see with this kind of a study is the approach is one of

592
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:34,620
looking for patterns that exist as a result of natural changes with a limited amount of ability.

593
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:43,890
You're controlling nothing really, and you're looking for for patterns over large areas with a limited number

594
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:50,370
of variables that you're gathering from sources that you know nothing about,

595
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:56,510
the quality of the data and so forth. Despite that, they were able to demonstrate this association.

596
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:11,020
So in a sense, it's a really valuable observation that leads to so many more questions about, well, did this occur rapidly?

597
01:16:12,490 --> 01:16:16,900
Would it have occurred if the deforestation occurred? It took place differently?

598
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:27,670
Should they have left some areas that were forested so that the other species of sand slides might be the ones that are most abundant?

599
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:37,309
Should they have considered? Treating the non-human reservoirs in a way that would have prevented them from

600
01:16:37,310 --> 01:16:42,170
becoming infected and therefore infecting samples and therefore infecting people.

601
01:16:42,650 --> 01:16:52,520
So there are lots of details that you can't gain insights into in a study like this, and yet it still demonstrates a broad pattern.

602
01:16:55,410 --> 01:17:00,660
And this is as opposed to the other study, of course, which which was a cluster randomized.

603
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:14,249
Controlled study in which there was an intervention to attend to two interventions treating people for syphilis and treating them,

604
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:22,860
plus giving them education and a demonstrated impact through the education, addition of education and and and monitoring and so forth.

605
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:27,900
So very different kind of study, a very different kind of problem as well.

606
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:37,270
All right. We are at time, so I'm going to let you all go. But if anyone have further questions for Mark, you can feel free to stay on for a minute.

607
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:42,950
Great. Thank you all for listening and thank you for participating.

608
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:47,450
Really glad you were able to ask questions and have some answers.
