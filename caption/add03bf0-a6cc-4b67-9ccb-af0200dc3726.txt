1
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:11,760
You know. Have you made a big.

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,960
I was I really was kind of. No.

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,480
What am I? I guess. Q.

4
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:32,660
Do whether you. And to be honest, when did you start making that decision?

5
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:41,910
Okay. I think what this lab actually is just in open office hours.

6
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,890
You don't need to work on any exercise, but if you have any questions on the last homework or previous homework or the class,

7
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:58,670
you can just came up here and we can discuss. Yeah.

8
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,680
And you? Here.

9
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:15,000
So I was thinking, should I go to school? You are.

10
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:27,100
And you. I was taking.

11
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,200
Oh. But I guess.

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,990
That's just in the study. That was.

13
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:49,420
Because the facts about the Middle East. I figure.

14
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,550
Same deal in Rick Perry's. So these are.

15
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,420
So it's. Okay.

16
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:21,600
Literally. I was really concerned about how I would work when they are all into.

17
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:37,420
Yeah. I get to see my A reporting. Did you want to start your engines either when you watching?

18
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,090
Yeah. So what? Where did you go?

19
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,060
I don't know. I think I'm bored. Yeah, I think you're on the right track.

20
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:55,520
Yeah, which. Which, which. Because you're behind.

21
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,670
And that's what I had to ask. Which of we check?

22
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:09,020
How much does it cost? I don't know. But I personally, I do.

23
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:20,570
I know this is a job you try to do is you guys think about.

24
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:43,580
If you can control. Well, these remote controls more representative of the source of these words than they were the controls that show why.

25
00:04:52,180 --> 00:05:04,180
Well, you. But at the same time with the environmental exposures.

26
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,780
So do you think it was a personal.

27
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,060
But I. Yeah.

28
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,160
Yeah. I mean, if you do it for.

29
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:39,280
I was ready to do this.

30
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,470
I ate it all. And the Olympic matches here.

31
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:58,090
Yeah, but actually, I tell you, it's getting better.

32
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,300
Yeah, I. Everybody just of needs.

33
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,680
Do you think there'd be something like maybe maybe.

34
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:16,340
You know, I'm also like socioeconomic status for.

35
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:29,690
Housing both Houses of Parliament and the House of I all it makes.

36
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,080
Maybe that's what we know.

37
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,350
Maybe less than where I was when I was. That these people were. So I was.

38
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:58,320
Because I was telling you, if you see that I do what I tell you, which is you need to think about that like just a little more.

39
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,590
And there's crowd control. And you?

40
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,930
Yeah. Yeah. So I guess. General. Say that.

41
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:23,840
Yeah. And I want to make sure that if you think if you think about your family, that's what you get.

42
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:33,219
Very often. It's very easy. Associates no one likes either.

43
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:39,460
It's going on right now. I would prefer that was getting in control so far.

44
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:54,930
And now we can see that we have zero exposure and.

45
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:11,730
Or. Or is it? Pardon me. I can speculate since I guess it is currently I have it all over the odds ratios that I can see.

46
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:25,710
That's right. Oh. Oh, yeah. Because if there is one that I don't like, it's hard to tell you.

47
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:32,430
I think you need to be. They mentioned which variable you mentioned four.

48
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,020
I know. Yeah, everybody has the same.

49
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:55,940
Age and neighborhood of residents factor in itself and for any of the residents where it started.

50
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:06,990
So actually I think the only way you can take action in your own life.

51
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:25,110
For instance, the impact of a. So the only rules that are out there today to make sure, like you say, factors are.

52
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,090
Yeah. And I guess I.

53
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:44,650
Direction of bias. And there are.

54
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,520
Like a plus or minus?

55
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:00,990
Yeah, I think so. And also, like, it was all made out, I didn't actually.

56
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,770
What? Like, why certain people were selected to study and how they were like these were older and how they were like,

57
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:20,760
I don't know if you have to and if you ever want to do workshops that actually.

58
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,950
Just get used to it.

59
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:36,040
Yeah. It's great.

60
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:58,030
I guess I feel like. So these are maybe they are in relation to HIV AIDS because it was, I guess, like many aspirin controllers.

61
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:06,680
There may be some program controls in that neighborhood or other disadvantage.

62
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:16,950
So yeah. So I don't think like the combined controls are maybe the best one because they can feel like the advantages of some insurance.

63
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,600
Okay. Well, I appreciate it.

64
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:30,510
Anyway, thank you so much. Are you?

65
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,470
I'm not sure how many girls just. I don't.

66
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:54,330
I. Yeah, but then I didn't.

67
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:00,940
Yeah, I guess. Right.

68
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:13,290
We should have. Actually, I think it's kind of interesting that you're only we cannot show cases like

69
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:19,799
this quote she wasn't showing the case and controls because they represent.

70
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:25,350
Yes for all counts. So the outcry for.

71
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:33,090
Yeah, those are actually the variables that you can try and actually taste.

72
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,500
He's the one to have those actions in.

73
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:45,860
And that's how we represent how how we send our cases.

74
00:12:46,560 --> 00:13:07,050
Because maybe somehow. Or maybe. Other factors may also be seen as key and I am not sure what is actually happening outside trying to help.

75
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,890
Established by. We can use one word.

76
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:26,470
And. And. That lack there of their outcomes days will influence whether they will be selected.

77
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:36,900
So I have another. And I was able emotionally.

78
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,370
Now for other government troops.

79
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:51,110
I'm not sure whether or not you're right. Passive. You all need to judge.

80
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,560
And then sort of going backwards and just making sure that it so is the friends.

81
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:13,269
The Friends control. It's not because I was I don't I don't know whether you chose or controlled Central Valley,

82
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:20,330
but I think it's not because it's more controlled which will have more internal value.

83
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:25,989
I think it highlights what are the price controls could be more attractive

84
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:32,440
than the status of the source population that gave rise to cases or controls.

85
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,640
That's more representative of the population.

86
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,410
Yeah, I was just thinking about one place I would put them against to think about.

87
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,160
Yes. Yeah. That was. I think it's a that's.

88
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:41,870
That's. Yeah.

89
00:16:44,040 --> 00:17:13,450
Fact. Good for her.

90
00:17:49,430 --> 00:18:05,860
You know. It's especially so it sounds like it's kind of during a couple of nights.

91
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:15,570
That's why was.

92
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:33,680
Yeah. What do you want me to do?

93
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:41,940
Yeah, we haven't heard, but that as a result.

94
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:48,760
Right. We can't afford. You're going to go for.

95
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:56,190
We didn't even realize these companies are doing.

96
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,590
So I think this is a.

97
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:15,330
Based on data. I think this sample share is like comparing the.

98
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:40,800
So how to help your children by acting like you use different kinds of controls and you try to help them out?

99
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,040
Yeah, I don't see how that works.

100
00:19:52,190 --> 00:20:05,290
Yeah. Yeah, because that's not, you know, that's the way.

101
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:22,390
And. Mary, thank. I think that's true but I think not sure which terminal that.

102
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:42,570
I think you need to be with someone, because I think that I was like I was like, I don't think I could have done it for so.

103
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:49,920
No. Thank you.

104
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,860
Okay, good. How are you doing with it?

105
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:14,610
I mean, in the eighties, I don't think I'm there, but yeah, I don't want to hear such cases, but I wasn't so sure.

106
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,860
Where are you going? Well, we decided it's okay.

107
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:27,060
This is it. Yeah, actually.

108
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,680
So 10 minutes apart from this. Yeah.

109
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:38,940
Do you think that this is, like a review for friends that they share similar?

110
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:48,360
Exactly. Like, right now, I'm like, I'm home.

111
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:06,880
Maybe more I more phone calls and. I think at time she and Amy also associated with how people are reacting.

112
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:15,610
Okay. So I sure I that. Directly, directly to macro variables.

113
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:28,550
That's why people call people, but they also write something like, If I do, I have to go crazy.

114
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,840
But it was like a I think they're right.

115
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:44,440
So I don't know what to make of all of that.

116
00:22:44,470 --> 00:23:01,709
Yeah. Did you figure out how much evidence we should think about it that's going to be aware that I do this?

117
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,560
We always look at all of our. All right.

118
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:14,560
Okay. Sounds good. Thank you so much. This picture of a.

119
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:27,720
Banana limit. So many genetics groups that like.

120
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:36,050
In my drawing. A dagger. Yeah.

121
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:43,920
Okay. Today is. He.

122
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:53,810
Well, if you want to get that. There's like a ten.

123
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,210
Like me. I think there's so many factors that. I mean to do.

124
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:08,870
I don't know. We? Do you like that?

125
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,800
Yeah. And this.

126
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:21,950
Yeah, well, I am, but that's.

127
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:31,770
This is. Oh, that's true.

128
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:40,560
Okay. I mean, it's true that. Because it's, like, really good.

129
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:45,320
It's like we got.

130
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,720
So like some people. Two point.

131
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:18,540
I don't like these confounders or just like. What about?

132
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:39,270
What about? I think that's good.

133
00:25:49,680 --> 00:26:03,830
I mean, I don't know how long. Diet and exercise. You're never like.

134
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:50,450
But like. You're only.

135
00:26:54,140 --> 00:27:03,600
You're aware. Huge help for you with that.

136
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:09,740
Yeah, yeah. It's a win. Is it worse than.

137
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:18,270
In the summer of. I don't think it needs to be like this.

138
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:24,210
It's kind it's cold hearted about it.

139
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:35,780
Like what? You don't know what I mean?

140
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:47,150
Yeah, I do. What is your theory?

141
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:53,130
With your theory? I think my.

142
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:03,760
Just for having full blown stress and actually get stressed that you like stuff like that.

143
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:20,640
It's stress because you're going to think you're sorry because I'm going to make your day and I'm like, okay, I'm here for you, but what about.

144
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,770
Yeah. But I feel like. I don't know if.

145
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:34,710
I got other things. Which I don't think it makes any secondary body.

146
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:40,190
I. I. If. Yeah.

147
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:52,080
Yeah. You should know what they should be like.

148
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:57,320
But what do you use it for?

149
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:11,380
I think you are cool, but in this case I think if you select in for exactly that,

150
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:25,589
because you can have a world where all the world should be like where all the cases came from.

151
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,790
Like they may not be from the neighborhood. You.

152
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:46,910
You got it? Yes. It's all that easy to say that people.

153
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:55,100
The most creative, most beautiful 13 year olds.

154
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:02,500
Yeah, that's. Lot of like in December when it was announced that.

155
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:11,800
But if you're here, of course, at this time, we have to take the cut off.

156
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:19,740
So this kind of extended. It's your intestines.

157
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:28,570
You feel at ease right now?

158
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's another way.

159
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:37,790
Yeah, that's. That's why.

160
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:50,360
Why does. So what are the train bombings?

161
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:55,370
Except the explosion and the other all the other potential.

162
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,180
I'd say characteristics are similar to this.

163
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:06,770
So that's why. I cannot tell.

164
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:22,580
You know, I can help you understand the reasons why or other potential confounders that are linked to our same color.

165
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:33,900
Probably because we. Caused me some thinking that maybe he's.

166
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:49,470
Oh. But I think you need to be more specific with regard to what you think about that in the paper.

167
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:52,560
It's actually factually incorrect.

168
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:59,960
Why? If you match our age, only the age.

169
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,070
Not the other way around.

170
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:24,720
It doesn't hurt. The paper only mentioned ammonium nitrate.

171
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:34,180
So. And. Yeah.

172
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:41,040
You if you need anything other than I'm the only major major, you know.

173
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:47,660
So, I mean, find why. That's why I like keeping my horse.

174
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:54,390
Because they can do that either. By the way, how they see us, at least when I am coming from that distance.

175
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,230
Yes, they know that they share the same thing.

176
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:05,750
Basically, they share the same. Yes. But it's not necessarily housing that neighborhood control that she shares.

177
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:15,250
Let me just let me just.

178
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:19,880
Yeah. But I was like, Yeah.

179
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,560
I think makes perfect from control. So in that respect, most.

180
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:30,800
Foreign policy. More than just age.

181
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:39,260
Yes. What's that?

182
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:44,750
Don't have you found.

183
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:50,410
People are the results of this paper or the interest?

184
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:57,590
Now to the interaction of security.

185
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:36,430
Okay. So we were working with our dad and even though we were taking off all kinds of things, we were like, But there is nothing that.

186
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:46,540
What I what going to say whether you are a case or.

187
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:57,040
You signed, you were selected into the study. I remember all the stacks from across the kitchen study.

188
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,580
You always imagine and that's plenty.

189
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:07,290
Why choose your outcomes? That's another. That.

190
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:20,059
So that's one major problem. I don't know the answer, but I think you need to think about it.

191
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:25,600
Like, why? Why did you go to Baghdad?

192
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:31,580
I think either one of these outcomes was action.

193
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:50,330
You need. So. It's from alcohol to a variable conception because.

194
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,560
Only have the. I'll come to you.

195
00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:00,100
Why? You were acting like your daddy right then.

196
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,690
And that, you know, what happens is you have another probability of.

197
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:15,130
So it all comes to this. He's associated with the advent variable cost, something like the exposure.

198
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:22,790
Yeah. Yeah, but this is the most. Right?

199
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:29,800
Yeah. And I suggest you go back to try to see how that instructor talks about.

200
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:47,190
Okay, you can start. What's it like?

201
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:53,360
I think I know how you feel about it. The probability of.

202
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:58,570
You might have encountered a true representative.

203
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:30,910
You're trying to relate here as to how this is going to happen, if there is any alteration.

204
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:44,970
It's like what you said regarding the matching, and I don't take that into account.

205
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:49,510
Um. Is one form of control that not.

206
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:58,280
This question is asking, by the way, how they like controls and how it's how it.

207
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,550
I've been watching segments I've seen outlets that.

208
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:13,379
Yeah. So that's what they need to do. Like me, make assumptions because as you say,

209
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:20,400
you need to look at your own language group of people more likely to have to answer the phone or you have to

210
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:29,840
have the phone number and whether they're more likely to relate how they work related to exposure status.

211
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:35,100
So yes, the fact you don't need to be a stakeholder to answer that direction.

212
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:40,750
So we captured more and more.

213
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:45,310
That's good. Yeah. No, and I think that's to.

214
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:55,639
So I think that contributes to leadership versus. They were less like it would be.

215
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:00,170
Exactly. He said his face would have been 100.

216
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,560
Gotcha. But you can also like give other water.

217
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:13,380
Either you do that, or maybe I like to.

218
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:23,510
Maybe they're in your house for night. This is kind of the same.

219
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:33,290
Gotcha. So there's a lot of stories, a lot of fighting going on.

220
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:38,840
And also remind you, I'll come back to this. Because.

221
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:44,780
I mean, because. Make it so variable if you think about all the.

222
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:56,690
Some spoke. Although I would say that in choosing actually the selection bias is not out not to come

223
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:03,770
down because so so you just think about way you think about what you buy your labels.

224
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:14,510
Like there are four sales and each represents a test case or a case file.

225
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:26,210
And he's exposed to the crowds.

226
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,090
We're fighting the people we're not connected to.

227
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:36,590
Right. We just had to ask the 75, 80 or see how he.

228
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:45,110
People all. So much.

229
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:57,260
Okay. Yeah, actually, I got 10 minutes.

230
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:02,190
Yeah, exactly. Um, so I don't.

231
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:19,240
You is. It seems to me, even for the rest of you, I don't know.

232
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:25,379
Because under the assumption that. Yeah.

233
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,160
But it is not specific. I mean.

234
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:38,620
Yeah. Drug use. Yeah. I mean for example, I mean which are less likely to.

235
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:52,150
Like unique actually because he has a wide. Describe exactly why this is one for all.

236
00:41:54,100 --> 00:42:02,380
But my main question was this one, which I think was kind of a it's a significant question this week,

237
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:10,550
which when I was thinking about it and now it's a little bit into don't you have to answer it?

238
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:18,470
But I didn't actually actually, I don't think it's over.

239
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:24,400
Okay. I think it's a selection process because you really need to see how this is.

240
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:33,440
Yeah. How you are. I think how your study population was selected to do the study and the groups that were not the

241
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:40,329
what's the characteristic that happens with respect to both the exposure and outcome status,

242
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:45,100
how they were different from the next one to your.

243
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:56,800
So I guess the direction the bias becomes or whatever it is.

244
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:16,520
Yes, I really did. Yeah. Yeah. That's a what can you explain why another example that maybe when I get into a study I know how to get exposure.

245
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:31,030
How, how does that change for sales and outcome status which so maybe is what is the comparative animal interest and how long.

246
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:44,920
Yeah, it. Yes.

247
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:03,440
Yeah. It's nice to see something really interesting.

248
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:18,090
Yeah. Yeah. School. Whatever.

249
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:31,860
With more. Right next year every three or four.

250
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:04,980
Indivisibility is something that something has to be like this.

251
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,360
Is that not something else?

252
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:25,660
Yeah. I mean I'll say it's like some I think the Russians like the assumption being referred to like.

253
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:43,830
When you predict the direction of bias, you know, like it was actually, which they were like over and over over the last decade cycles for Anders.

254
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,850
Anders. And there are many cycles.

255
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:52,490
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

256
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:59,310
Probably what you are also used to here. So your assumption regarding what was.

257
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:19,590
She? And he was very funny.

258
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:33,650
And I just like he came to the university hospital and even in the lab, I still hear him.

259
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:37,840
Kelly. Yeah.

260
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:44,620
Think that has a lot. Yes. People look to to.

261
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:53,930
And if you're looking. But. Yeah. Was just like, no.

262
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:20,400
The. Ed.

263
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:27,000
But I didn't. Sorry. Finish.

264
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:36,290
No. But you're just.

265
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:40,580
I was like, I'll take that. Yeah. There are the signs you do like.

266
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:46,700
I guess I really like that. Yeah, it really can just.

267
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:52,910
Yeah. Yeah, but.

268
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:59,810
But, you know, like, you keep saying that, like you. I think it's.

269
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:12,230
People get. How's your frog?

270
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:20,590
I've been thinking. So in order to get you what you did for everyone.

271
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:35,730
I have to tell you, I'm going to have to do something that I would think that I know that I, I would feel like I was like under the.

272
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:43,760
It's. I'm only going to drive.

273
00:48:51,240 --> 00:49:06,220
I just said, I hope we don't. I sit in the car before you start shooting?

274
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:21,390
That's not at all. Maybe they see the sticker on the back of your car that they would like to see the the bus coming.

275
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:25,000
Yeah. Yeah.

276
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,910
And it's a story you're targeting yourself.

277
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:34,180
It's like. The focus.

278
00:49:37,570 --> 00:51:33,180
I spent. One of.

279
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:51,440
Yes, that's. That was.

280
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:13,920
Yeah.
