1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,605
After watching this video, you will be
able to use the estimate statement in

2
00:00:14,605 --> 00:00:19,617
program mode to calculate your measures of
association using the proper reference.

3
00:00:19,617 --> 00:00:24,297
This is the data from the someone cohort
that we used to run a log binomial model

4
00:00:24,297 --> 00:00:26,800
to calculate average ratio.

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,970
At that point, I ask you to be
patient with estimate statement.

6
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,522
So now finally I'm going to
explain it in more detail.

7
00:00:34,522 --> 00:00:39,619
Remember, in this model we are using
the variable TGMS as a binary variable for

8
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:41,910
hypertriglyceridemia.

9
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,074
And we're using the variable factor
1S at the special variable that

10
00:00:46,074 --> 00:00:50,940
indicates high or low compliance
with a modern dietary pattern.

11
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,610
Now in the estimate statement,
know that I always add a label.

12
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,950
It shows him pink because
it's between codes.

13
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,380
This helps you to know
who you are calculating.

14
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,321
Then we add the exposure variable that
we want to calculate the measure of

15
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:06,169
association.

16
00:01:06,169 --> 00:01:08,220
In this case, factor of 1S.

17
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,725
And then I put that minus one, one or
one minus one in a magical way.

18
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:14,231
The user understand.

19
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:18,840
That's the part I'm going
to explain now finally.

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,765
Also know that after the slash,
I put the exp,

21
00:01:21,765 --> 00:01:26,460
so the data will be exponentiated and
we will get average ratio.

22
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,870
And I'm adding something you now,

23
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:34,390
I'm adding an E that will give
me some parameter information.

24
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,669
So now take a look at the parameter
information that you get by default in

25
00:01:38,669 --> 00:01:39,453
your model.

26
00:01:39,453 --> 00:01:42,092
You can see that you
have three parameters.

27
00:01:42,092 --> 00:01:46,960
The first is the intercept, the second
after one are the two categories of your

28
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,720
exposure variable factor 1S.

29
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,322
This info in away is reflected in the
model and how the variables are calculated

30
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:58,653
because we did not specify any
reference in the class statement.

31
00:01:58,653 --> 00:02:01,370
Is used in the highest
values that reference.

32
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,704
So you can see that in the model is
calculating are better for the lowest

33
00:02:05,704 --> 00:02:10,481
value which was the low compliance with
a modern diet, and that's why we're

34
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:15,653
getting a negative data, which is supposed
to give you a rich ratio lower than one.

35
00:02:15,653 --> 00:02:17,431
That is a protective refresh.

36
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:21,652
If you exponentiate that, you will get
average ratio that compares the low

37
00:02:21,652 --> 00:02:25,138
compliance with a high compliance,
but we don't want that.

38
00:02:25,138 --> 00:02:26,367
We want the opposite.

39
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:30,150
So now let's look at
another part of the output.

40
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,541
Take a look at the coefficients for
contrast.

41
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:36,528
You got this because you added an E
to the options of estimate statement.

42
00:02:36,528 --> 00:02:38,340
This is a new thing.

43
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,600
So notice that you have also three
parameters compared those with

44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,720
the parameter information
that you could before.

45
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,426
Now very important, the one that has
a minus one is the one that is going to be

46
00:02:49,426 --> 00:02:53,350
used as the reference in
your estimated statement.

47
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,342
So know that regardless of what
it was going in the model,

48
00:02:57,342 --> 00:03:02,014
your mother was using low compliance
as the reference by default.

49
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:05,441
Now by adding that minus
one on one in that order,

50
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:10,030
you're asking size to use
low as the reference.

51
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,945
So they can look at
the contrast HTML results.

52
00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:16,510
1.98 is the average ratio for
the comparison of low

53
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:21,095
compliance with the modern dietary
pattern versus high compliance.

54
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:24,670
You are using low order reference.

55
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:30,480
Now let's switch the minus one and
one in the estimate statement.

56
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,830
Take a look at the parameter information
that has not changed at all.

57
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,055
Such still ordering
the parameters the same way and

58
00:03:38,055 --> 00:03:42,610
still using them in the same
order in the parameter estimates.

59
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,412
Using still high compliance
as the reference because

60
00:03:45,412 --> 00:03:48,028
that's the largest number,
and that's what SAS

61
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:53,240
does by default if you don't specify
differently in your class statement.

62
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,926
But now,
note what happens with the contrast.

63
00:03:55,926 --> 00:03:58,758
And remember that minus
one is the reference.

64
00:03:58,758 --> 00:04:01,735
Now just switch that in
the estimate statement.

65
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:07,060
So now you're asking SAS to actually
use high compliance as their reference.

66
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,864
Know that always the one with
a minus one is the reference.

67
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:14,790
So now factor 1S equals
to one is the reference.

68
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,695
The reference now is having high
compliance with the modern dietary

69
00:04:18,695 --> 00:04:19,321
pattern.

70
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:21,393
So going to the estimate results,

71
00:04:21,393 --> 00:04:27,050
this ratio is now protected because
we're using high as the reference.

72
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,201
So even though this can be
confusing in the beginning,

73
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:33,557
I highly encourage you to play
with estimate statements so

74
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:38,420
you can see that it's just a matter
of changing the references.

75
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,296
Since summer, in this video we use
the estimate statement in PROC GENMOD to

76
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:46,680
calculate your measures of association
with the proper reference.

77
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,368
And we are done with unit six.

78
00:04:48,368 --> 00:04:53,767
In the next video we will summarize
the main concepts learned in this unit.
