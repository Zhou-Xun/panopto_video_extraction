1
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,240
In this module, we'll
be talking about

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,100
pathways and routes of exposure.

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,145
I'll define these terms as
we go through the lecture.

4
00:00:17,145 --> 00:00:18,540
But first, I want to highlight.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,740
We're standing here at

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,320
the beautiful University
of Michigan campus farm,

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,450
in front of some crops
that are being grown.

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,250
You might ask, "What
does this have to

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,470
do with environmental
health sciences?"

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,090
Well think about ways that

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,830
harmful substances
in the environment

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,210
can get into your body.

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,940
Food represents one
very obvious way

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,130
that we can potentially
become exposed.

15
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,005
So this seem like
a great setting,

16
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:42,315
to introduce these concepts.

17
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:45,580
If you recall back to the
exposure disease framework,

18
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,360
we talked about in
another module,

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,620
you hopefully remember that

20
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,365
the first box in that
framework is the source.

21
00:00:51,365 --> 00:00:53,930
We can classify sources
in many different ways.

22
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,435
One of them, is whether
they're anthropogenic,

23
00:00:56,435 --> 00:00:59,015
created by humans or natural.

24
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:00,770
So standing here in
front of a farm,

25
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,090
this is very much an
anthropogenic creation,

26
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,670
but notice that it occurs in

27
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,115
an otherwise very
natural setting.

28
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:10,490
We could also think about
sources as being stationary,

29
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,770
something that doesn't
move around in space.

30
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,125
So an example there might
be a power plant or mobile,

31
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,590
something that does move
through space like cars,

32
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,510
or planes, or trains.

33
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,985
Finally, we could think of
sources as either being

34
00:01:22,985 --> 00:01:25,745
a point source or an area source.

35
00:01:25,745 --> 00:01:28,130
A point source is
a fixed point in

36
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,620
space that emits
some harmful hazard,

37
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,895
an example here might be

38
00:01:31,895 --> 00:01:34,580
an incinerator in the
middle of a community.

39
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,350
Or an area source when that's

40
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,120
more dispersed over a broad area

41
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,385
and farms are another
excellent example

42
00:01:40,385 --> 00:01:42,035
of an area source.

43
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,470
So for example, when
rain falls onto a field

44
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,570
any chemicals that
have accumulated

45
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,865
on that field,
pesticides, for example,

46
00:01:49,865 --> 00:01:53,270
or fertilizers can then run
off with that rainwater,

47
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,575
and that run-off becomes

48
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:56,480
a very dispersed source of

49
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,060
pollution for the
surrounding environment.

50
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,690
We can also think about ways
that chemicals can move

51
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,490
throughout the environment
to potentially

52
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,415
come into contact with people.

53
00:02:06,415 --> 00:02:08,880
In the graphic that you see here,

54
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,055
we've illustrated multiple
sources for a single chemical.

55
00:02:12,055 --> 00:02:13,835
So the child, the baby

56
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:15,770
sitting in the middle
of this picture,

57
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,615
has many many different sources

58
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:19,595
of potential lead exposure.

59
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:22,010
So lead, a very
harmful neurotoxic

60
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,620
and for children especially,

61
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,400
can come from lots of
different sources.

62
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,660
So you see here,

63
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,290
there's the potential for
this child to inhale lead

64
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,925
that might be emitted from

65
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:34,295
an industrial source
out of a smokestack.

66
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:36,305
Or it could come out
of the exhaust of

67
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:39,145
automobiles that are
using leaded gasoline.

68
00:02:39,145 --> 00:02:41,420
You'll see also there's
the potential for

69
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,399
this child to get lead exposure,

70
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:45,035
for example through the lead

71
00:02:45,035 --> 00:02:47,705
solder that's present
in cans of food.

72
00:02:47,705 --> 00:02:50,270
So when that solder comes
into contact with the food,

73
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,830
the lead can be transferred into

74
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,395
the food that the kid then eats.

75
00:02:54,395 --> 00:02:56,750
We could also think
about older homes,

76
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,160
which often have lead paint.

77
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,245
As that paint degrades over time,

78
00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:01,940
it falls in flakes to the floor.

79
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,740
The kid can eat those flakes,

80
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,285
which actually are sweet,

81
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,580
or the flakes can turn into dust

82
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,740
as they're stepped on
or otherwise crushed,

83
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,960
and then maybe there's a
pet that goes and rolls in

84
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,195
that dust and then the
child pets the pet.

85
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,500
So here's one case,

86
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,910
a single chemical where there are

87
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,350
many potential
sources of exposure.

88
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,940
We can also think about
a single source that

89
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,100
emits lots of different
types of hazards.

90
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,020
So a classic example here,

91
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,860
might be a factory
or a power plant,

92
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,410
in the middle of a community.

93
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,540
The smoke stacks from
that factory might be

94
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,000
emitting volatile
organic compounds,

95
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,745
sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide,

96
00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:39,830
ozone, lots of different hazards.

97
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,950
So a single source,

98
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,190
but many many different hazards
emitted from that source.

99
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,795
In environmental
health, we think about

100
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:50,330
vectors or media that

101
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,000
chemicals particularly
can travel through to

102
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,185
get through the environment
from the source to us.

103
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:59,460
When I say us, the proper
term there is a receptor.

104
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,230
So in environmental
health sciences,

105
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,710
we're interested in
receptors that are people.

106
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,290
So we can think about the
different media that a chemical

107
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,640
might collect in and move

108
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,770
through the environment through.

109
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,235
Those are air, soil
like we find here,

110
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:16,175
water and food, like the
crops that you see behind me.

111
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:18,500
So let's dive into
some examples here of

112
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,900
specific pathways that a chemical

113
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,180
might take to move
through the environment.

114
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,830
So in the image
you're looking at,

115
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,980
we have a couple of
drums of a chemical,

116
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,120
a harmful chemical, and we can

117
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,230
see arrows that are

118
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,480
highlighting different
pathways of exposure.

119
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,340
So the one at the top,

120
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,930
indicates that perhaps
this chemical is volatile.

121
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,350
So it turns into a
vapor in the air,

122
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,270
then it moves with the air

123
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,535
until it comes in to
contact with the person,

124
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:46,700
and the person has a chance
then to breathe in that air.

125
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,570
So that's a media of air,

126
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,060
and you can see the
pathway here is it

127
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,610
basically blowing down
wind from the spill.

128
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,410
We could also imagine
that chemical

129
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,969
going into the ground,

130
00:04:55,969 --> 00:04:57,830
and once it's in the ground it

131
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,675
may come into contact with water

132
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,490
until eventually perhaps it comes

133
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,560
into contact with a well pipe.

134
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,540
Well water is quite common source

135
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,775
of water here in Michigan.

136
00:05:06,775 --> 00:05:09,930
Now when someone is pulling
water through that well pipe,

137
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,645
they're also pulling
that chemical

138
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,030
and potentially
drinking that chemical.

139
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,490
We could also think
about that chemical

140
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,445
getting into the air or
getting into the soil,

141
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:22,085
and then either being taken up by

142
00:05:22,085 --> 00:05:25,055
the crops growing in
that area from the soil,

143
00:05:25,055 --> 00:05:27,530
or getting into contact
with that chemical

144
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,840
through water that's
applied to the crops.

145
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,960
Or if the chemical is in the
air and then deposits on

146
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,440
the leaves of this great-looking
broccoli behind me,

147
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,740
then the food becomes
contaminated,

148
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,645
and we become exposed
when we eat that food.

149
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:44,000
So again, we've got
four primary media

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,815
here; air, soil, water,

151
00:05:45,815 --> 00:05:49,250
and food and different
pathways that a chemical can

152
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,205
take from the source

153
00:05:51,205 --> 00:05:52,490
through the environment
to come into

154
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,545
contact with a person.

155
00:05:54,545 --> 00:05:56,810
Once a chemical has moved through

156
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,330
the environment and come
into contact with a person,

157
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,860
we then have to consider what we

158
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,510
call the route of exposure.

159
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,580
There are four main
routes of exposure.

160
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,010
So this is the way that
a chemical or other

161
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,830
type of hazard transitions
from being in the environment,

162
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,210
to being in your body.

163
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,270
So the first one we'll
focus on here is ingestion.

164
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,010
Imagine drinking
a glass of water.

165
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,120
You're drinking the
water, hydrogen,

166
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,610
and oxygen but
you're also drinking

167
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,310
any other chemicals that
are present in that water.

168
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,990
Or imagine eating food,

169
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,530
you're eating
whatever the food is,

170
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,830
but also pesticides
and potential other

171
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,410
materials that might have
contaminated that food.

172
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,820
All of those things are an
ingestion route of exposure.

173
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,140
We could also think
about inhalation.

174
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,180
So every time I breathe in air,

175
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,120
I'm breathing in hundreds if
not thousands of chemicals,

176
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,265
even in a clean
environment like this.

177
00:06:43,265 --> 00:06:45,230
So each inhalation I take,

178
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,540
is a potential
inhalation route of

179
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,220
exposure for chemicals or
other types of hazards.

180
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,320
The third route of exposure we'll

181
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,040
talk about is skin contact.

182
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,540
So if you've ever come

183
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,335
into contact with the
poison ivy plant,

184
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,830
you've had probably an
unfortunate experience

185
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,180
of a skin contact
route of exposure.

186
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,770
The oil from the leaves of
the plants gets on your skin,

187
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,040
it doesn't travel through

188
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,020
your skin but it
causes a very acute,

189
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,330
very localized skin rash

190
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,780
that can be incredibly
unpleasant.

191
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,640
Finally, we can also
have skin absorption.

192
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,770
So certain types of
hazards will pass through

193
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,970
the dead layer of skin on

194
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,720
the outside of your
body and end up,

195
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,785
for example, in your bloodstream.

196
00:07:23,785 --> 00:07:26,540
An example here would
be nanoparticles.

197
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,590
You might think, "Well,

198
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,870
where do I come into contact
with nanoparticles?"

199
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,505
Actually, if you wear sunscreen,

200
00:07:31,505 --> 00:07:33,075
and you should wear sunscreen

201
00:07:33,075 --> 00:07:34,890
to protect against skin damage,

202
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,080
the active ingredient in

203
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,150
sunscreen is a bunch
of nanoparticles.

204
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,000
So as you apply that
sunscreen to your skin,

205
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,130
some of those nanoparticles
immediately start

206
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,480
traveling through your skin

207
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,235
and end up in your bloodstream.

208
00:07:46,235 --> 00:07:48,170
Now we know that sunscreen
on the outside of

209
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,630
your body is very good
for protecting your skin.

210
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,099
What about these nanoparticles

211
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:53,255
when they're inside your body?

212
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:55,255
We don't know so much about that.

213
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:57,725
So collectively, we
need to think about

214
00:07:57,725 --> 00:08:00,290
where's the source,
in the environment?

215
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,880
What is the type of source?

216
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,680
What sort of media can

217
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,140
that hazard from the
source accumulate

218
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,910
in and move through
the environment?

219
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,880
Then once a human comes into
contact with that hazard,

220
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,970
how might it actually
enter their body?

221
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,661
What route of exposure
does it take?
