1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,600
And then you go off to a different school and your kid's going to go off to college.

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:11,210
So but the only time is the most important thing.

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,530
And then next week, I should be able to go.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:33,780
I think it's you know, I mean, it's going to take some time that it's going to take some time to develop these researchers.

5
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:43,110
Yeah, but I think that it's just something actionable, like something that is important that we should be starting.

6
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:51,090
So. Good morning, everyone. Happy Monday. Today we're talking about data for any cost.

7
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,369
Well, really, to be a good public health person, it's good to understand that data.

8
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,639
And where do we find data? What's the data quality?

9
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,719
And it's so important for cost effectiveness analyzes. Typically they're using models and the models are informed by data.

10
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:14,310
And it's one of these things. Garbage in, garbage out. So to have, you know, bad data going into the model, the results are not going to be very good.

11
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:23,430
So you want to make sure that you understand where you find data and then go to the quality and understand biases.

12
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:31,380
So we start talking about data needed different types of resources and then strengths, limitations of the different sources.

13
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:43,020
So here is just a big list of some potential data sources that are relevant to cost effectiveness analysis,

14
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,380
whether you're using a mark from whatever you have,

15
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:57,330
some kind of epidemiological inputs describing the disease, describing the interventions and the effect of the interventions.

16
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:07,950
So things like prevalence incidence, mortality, risk rating ratios of the population, the disease, severity, distribution, all those types of things.

17
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,469
Oftentimes, the medical literature can be really good for getting information like that.

18
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:20,610
So Pub Med Google Scholar I think can be good sources for finding those types of studies.

19
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:29,550
But there are also a lot of national represent here in the United States nationally representative data sources like NHANES.

20
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:37,380
And it's oftentimes a very good. But you actually want to know can you describe what means is what are they what do they do?

21
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,590
The National Health and Nutrition Information Source.

22
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:54,510
So so just it's kind of like a national survey about like I think they have several centers around the country

23
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:07,020
and they take a look at the prevalence of the diseases and the usage of this health services and so on.

24
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:14,360
And they also have some like I remember the laboratory testing results, right?

25
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,600
It's kind of like electronic health records thing. Yeah.

26
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,610
And what they do is actually so this is considered to be nationally representative so they can

27
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:30,569
random sampling and they actually drive trucks around where they bring people in and you know,

28
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:36,180
they draw their blood the terms blood pressure, you know, they actually do the clinical lab measurements and so forth.

29
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,669
You presumably have a nationally representative population with population sampling.

30
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,470
So they actually have a lot of quite detailed data in a safe way.

31
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:53,140
But then not just blood pressure and stuff like that, but they again, they might draw blood and then check lab values, check.

32
00:03:53,190 --> 00:04:00,330
Are you infected with ABC, TFG? So that can be a really good data source.

33
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:07,889
With that said, because it is so intensive and they drive around and actually bring people into them and ask them questions and draw blood.

34
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:13,379
And so it is intensive. And so it's not, you know, 100% sampling.

35
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,010
It's a it's a small sampling, but it is supposed to be nationally representative also.

36
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,920
And it can be really good. And again, it's not just survey it.

37
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:29,820
It does ask a lot of questions, but it also collects a lot of clinical data as well.

38
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,100
It's not just someone's to on the questionnaire and they check off. Yeah, I think I had diabetes or not.

39
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:40,730
They actually draw your blood in, look for anyone else, anything.

40
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,689
So there are a lot of you know, this is a listing of a lot of potential data.

41
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:52,349
Sources here in the top section here is really more clinical, epidemiological.

42
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:56,610
And then at the bottom here, we have some things that are more related to the economics here.

43
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,420
Medical utilization, costs of medical. Hair labor costs there.

44
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:08,820
You might get data in some other sources. So a variety of sources for this.

45
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,440
Also, the medical literature oftentimes can have some data on a medical economic literature, data on costing.

46
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:30,089
Any questions about data sources? And again, I think if you're making what these data sources, the inference is,

47
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:35,010
I think about what I'm going to call a kind of table one in a cost effectiveness parameter.

48
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:41,850
It's got a. Values and ranges and so forth.

49
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:48,240
And again, you have these epidemiological parameters and then you have some cost parameters,

50
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,370
and then you might have some utility quality of life parameters.

51
00:05:53,610 --> 00:06:03,390
And when you think about it too, if you have a decision tree, see that you have, you know, probabilities which are probably based on epidemiology.

52
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:09,030
And then at the end of the tree you have costs and qualities and you have to have those three kind of categories of things.

53
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:17,520
If you have Markov model now, you know, probabilities or rates, so you need to preference arrows.

54
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:23,980
And then in each health state, you need to know dollars and qualities associated with being in those difficult states.

55
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:30,620
Those are the kind of three general categories of parameters that you'll have for a cost effectiveness study.

56
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:40,970
So in an example here, let's say we're considering testing first or immediate treatment and then someone has a disease or not.

57
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,250
And then if we're testing, it's a true positive or false positive,

58
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,160
and then someone can be treated and there might be side effects or or failed treatment, things like that.

59
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,000
What kind of data in this hypothetical example, where would you look for data?

60
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,360
What kind of data would you be looking for? And to parameter wise, this kind of a cost benefit analysis?

61
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,240
Patients who got treatment but who did not get treatment.

62
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,260
Well, so this is our I guess this is our decision.

63
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:25,080
Should we just. Someone walks, Nora. I'd say STD clinic, STI clinic.

64
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,310
Do we just give them some antibiotics for me to treat them for something?

65
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:36,299
Or do we test them first and then give them antibiotics? Well, so this is this is our policy question.

66
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,960
We're not really sure yet. Right. We're asking the question, should I immediately treat or test?

67
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:46,020
So actually, you shouldn't at this point, you should worry about what is the actual practice.

68
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,110
Because we're gonna have to answer the question, what should be the practice?

69
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:57,420
So what are some of the pieces of information we would need to know whether we should just hand out antibiotics like candy, immediate treatment?

70
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:05,740
Or should we test first? You know how?

71
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,700
What's the prevalence of disease like? What's the probability somebody has the disease?

72
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:15,640
Yeah. If you have 99.9999999% of people who come in to your clinic have the disease.

73
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:19,630
You don't need to test them. Right. So you need you want to know the prevalence of the disease.

74
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,190
If it's only 1% of the population has this disease, maybe we shouldn't be handing out these drugs.

75
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,740
That can't be. Do you want the prevalence of the disease? I don't.

76
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,889
Did you want to know so you can get that from or something like that?

77
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:46,730
Maybe the prevalence of disease. Yeah because if there are going treating immediately is going to there are probabilities

78
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,990
associated with you know that would be way more effective than waiting at the same time.

79
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:55,640
So maybe you'd have a delay, you know, different effectiveness if you treat early versus like.

80
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:03,600
And so you might have. So maybe successful treatment here is different than successful treatment here.

81
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:07,060
Maybe Q Q is greater than hour or something like that.

82
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:12,190
Right? Maybe. Maybe. So early treatment.

83
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,250
That's something to think about. What other information might you want to?

84
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:27,220
And, you know, the outcomes in every branch of your tree in terms of cost and quality.

85
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:33,640
Yeah. So I need to have you need to have cost inequalities for every single branch in your tree here.

86
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,650
So you might have it. And then down here to so forth.

87
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,500
So you want to, you know, look for studies and literature, maybe of a quality of life.

88
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:56,490
If you if you have side effects or failed treatment versus successful treatment, how much does it cost?

89
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:01,500
If you're living with failed treatment versus successful treatment, how much does this help cost?

90
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,430
And then also you probably want to look in the medical literature and understand this test.

91
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:19,220
So look in, you know, maybe for FDA approval, how good is the test at identifying people who have it?

92
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:28,700
How good is the test at identifying people who don't have the disease and giving you a so probably so what if someone has the disease?

93
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,870
What's the chance? What do we call this chance? That the test will give you a positive result?

94
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,950
That term is called you have the disease.

95
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,129
What's the probability a task will give you?

96
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:49,820
Will say you have the disease. All right.

97
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,960
Sensitivity. Sensitivity, right. That's called sense and test sensitivity.

98
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,760
Can the test detect disease when it really is there and how?

99
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,160
Well that if you don't have the disease and the test. So this is often in sensitivity.

100
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,470
Now, what about if you don't have the disease?

101
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,390
What's the chance the test will say you don't have the disease, will correctly say you don't have the disease.

102
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,480
What we call that specificity.

103
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:33,830
Specificity. Right. And so that is the probably it'll give you the true negative.

104
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,459
Both those things are important because we want to correctly identify people who don't have a disease.

105
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:43,090
So they don't need in this case, need treatment. And we want to probably identify people during treatment.

106
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,380
That's the sensitivity that.

107
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:55,410
So that's something if you're ever thinking about testing questions, that's important to know both what's the prevalence of disease?

108
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,740
But then how good is my test in terms of sensitivity and specificity?

109
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:11,640
Okay. Quick question. So let's say we look in a study, we find that P value is less than 0.05.

110
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:18,559
What does that mean? Statistical.

111
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,950
Statistically significant. I mean, statistically significant.

112
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:25,430
What does a statistically significant mean association?

113
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,360
That chance means some sort of association through the correlation.

114
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,880
Yeah, but by chance. So what? What? Let's hear some more about statistically significant.

115
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:49,720
I guess it's more of a measure of how different would you expect these results to be if you repeated the test?

116
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:54,760
Are you saying like 95 out of 100 times you're going to get these results?

117
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:01,240
What I guess the p value. By the way, I'm asking a very difficult question, actually.

118
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,470
It sounds like you you've taken this class you all her p A+ as my final and this

119
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,850
is actually a difficult question even statisticians have a difficult time,

120
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,010
even though I probably will have a different question. So.

121
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,950
Plus in .05 tells us something actually that it isn't the question we want answered.

122
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:27,680
Peanuts in point five says if there really is no effect.

123
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:33,680
There's only a 5% chance we get the results of this extreme or more extreme.

124
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:43,220
But that's not the question we want to answer. We want to know what's the chance that this result we saw is true?

125
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:52,170
We're not living in a hypothetical world where maybe these things are our equivalent and we got some random fluke.

126
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,540
So just be careful of that.

127
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:04,230
You know, the p value loss in point of five and also what's his or her about kind of statistically significant versus clinically significant?

128
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:14,930
What would you. You give me an example of something where something is maybe statistically significant but not clinically significant?

129
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:24,420
Or vice versa. Could it be like?

130
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:32,100
Like sometimes like herbal types of like alternative treatments, like clinically people feel like they see different things,

131
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,330
but it doesn't show up in the data or there's not the sample size.

132
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,990
Well, so yeah, some of these things are kind of tied to sample size.

133
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:48,270
And so clinically segment is something that, that you would it would be a meaningful difference to you as a as a patient.

134
00:14:49,680 --> 00:15:00,680
So let's say that, you know, a let's say I had a a cloth mask and it blocks 1% of particles.

135
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:03,750
And so it's like really thin mesh and only blocks 1% of particles.

136
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:15,300
Now, if I designed a clinical trial large enough with hundreds of millions of people, I could probably show a 1% reduction in coronavirus infections.

137
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,980
Now, I would need a huge sample size and maybe I'd show plus 1.5.

138
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:29,510
This really is better than no mask at all. But that might not be a clinically like a 1% reduction in your infection.

139
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,380
Maybe that wouldn't be big enough for you to really care.

140
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,149
Now, if you have an ID,

141
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:44,879
95 to 95% of the particles feel like that it has a 95% reduction in your risk of coronavirus getting from hours that is meaningful,

142
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:53,580
that is clinically significant to you. But maybe if you studied, if you did a clinical trial with only ten people,

143
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:58,860
ten people unmasked, ten people may ask you randomize and so forth, and maybe you showed.

144
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:06,240
Yes, the N95 reduces infections, but P is equal to ten because you didn't power it large enough.

145
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,529
That doesn't mean that that isn't a clinically meaningful difference.

146
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,370
It's just maybe the study was empowered enough to to show it statistically.

147
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:22,320
So the thing to do is to keep in mind, two is depending on how the study is designed.

148
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:28,079
Also that just because you see some sort of statistically significant difference, it might just be correlation.

149
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:38,380
It might not be causation. And so some of the risks here are things like confounders and omitted variables.

150
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,430
So my favorite example here is of lung edge.

151
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:50,520
So back in like the 1950s or something like that, it was very clear that smoking was correlated with lung cancer.

152
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,829
And people back in 1950 said, hey, it's clear smoking causes lung cancer.

153
00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:00,180
There's a clear association here. We got a lot of smokers who end up getting lung cancer.

154
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:09,150
But the tobacco companies said, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We can't deny that smoking is correlated with lung cancer.

155
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:13,020
There clearly many more people who are smokers who have lung cancer.

156
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:21,209
But you might be missing something. We think that there might be language that people have.

157
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:27,930
They just have really itchy lungs. Guess what the cure is to alleviate that nasty lung itch.

158
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:38,380
The Cigarets. Yes, exactly. The Cigarets. Well, so this lung, it is something that's actually causing the lung cancer and correlated to lung cancer.

159
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:44,950
But the lung edge, you know, makes you want to smoke these cigarets to alleviate that lung issue.

160
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,389
But it's actually not our cigarets that are causing the cancer.

161
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:54,910
It's something underlying this admitted variable of someone having this lung inside the lung.

162
00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:00,040
It just causing the cancer. We're just helping people alleviate those itchy lungs.

163
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:05,590
And actually, we're helping these people with this terrible condition. We're alleviating some of the pain and suffering of the bongs.

164
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:11,710
So we're doing great things and it's our cigarets are not the problem. It's this hidden automated variable of lung injury.

165
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:20,110
And that's that's a difficult argument to to refute, you know, especially back in 1950s,

166
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:23,950
you can't identify this mysterious lung edge that's really the cause of lung cancer.

167
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,330
And so it took actually decades of kind of basic biology,

168
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:33,760
biological research to kind of prove that there wasn't some mysterious long

169
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,209
that was causing the lung cancer that actually was the tars in the cigaret.

170
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:44,410
And you could look in little petri dishes and drink tar and lung cancer cells and see how it would mutate them and so forth that caused lung cancer.

171
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,009
But it's very difficult to kind of refute the of the assertion that there might be some

172
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:56,560
sort of hidden variable or omitted variable there if you don't have good studies.

173
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,999
And these are and, you know, back in 1957, just kind of observational studies and said, hey,

174
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,010
look, I seem to notice a lot of people with lung cancer who are who are prior smokers.

175
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:09,410
And I seem to observe a lot of smokers end up with lung cancer.

176
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:19,630
And so I want to also highlight here, too, just because the studies are imperfect doesn't mean that there is a real that there is a real cause there.

177
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,399
I mean, so you can show, you know, correlation with something.

178
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,010
Indeed. And you might say, hey, I think this does cause this.

179
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:32,980
But even if it's not a perfect study, that doesn't mean that that that relationship doesn't exist.

180
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,840
So I want to mention one other thing with confounding, too, that can be a problem.

181
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:52,900
So there was a study in the 1980s of treatment of kidney stones, and they used a couple of different treatments.

182
00:19:53,650 --> 00:20:01,570
And for small kidney stones, they observed that people who got treatment,

183
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:13,420
a 93% were successful with treatment with small stones, 87% of people were successful with treatment for large kidney stones.

184
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,330
73% of people were successful treated, only 69% successful.

185
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:18,910
Three would be.

186
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:26,890
However, when they put this all together, people with both small and large stones, they looked at everyone who got treatment and be together.

187
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:34,450
83% of the people were successful. Treatment B Only 78% of people were successful in treatment.

188
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:38,379
Hey, now again, this was an observational study.

189
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,550
They just kind of look back in the records of and there's no randomization or anything.

190
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:46,150
They just looked at observationally, what people had, what the outcomes were,

191
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,460
people who had received treatment and treated with small, large stones and they found these results.

192
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,830
So I've got a question for you guys.

193
00:20:53,830 --> 00:21:04,840
If you guys had if you as we're going to make a recommendation to a hospital in sugar, is Truman able to be which treatment should the hospital use?

194
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:13,500
Treatment A Who goes for treatment and who thinks treatment vs what the hospital should use.

195
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:23,770
They treated me. Why treated me? I'm just trying to think in terms of like overall, I mean, like the 80% just seems larger.

196
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:28,350
So I would just say these are overall 83% is better than 78%.

197
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:37,470
But for someone who's at treatment, hey, why don't say treatment? Because it's it's like it's shown promising results for the groups.

198
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:41,400
So they groups. One, two, three. That's a small stone.

199
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:48,090
It's better if it weren't stone. It's better there aren't either types of stuff missing here.

200
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:57,680
It's really better for both types of stones. So why? Why does treatment be look better overall than if it's better for both small and large stones?

201
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:06,050
Why is treatment be better overall? A higher percentage has a larger sample.

202
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:11,690
The higher percentage for small steps has a larger sample. Yeah.

203
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:16,130
So one thing you notice here are the sample sizes here.

204
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:23,840
It looks like treatment B was used on a lot of small stones and looks like treatment.

205
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,590
It was used on a large of large stones. Now which stones?

206
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,680
I mean, I'm not an nephrologist here, but which stones are easier to treat?

207
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:36,050
The small ones. The small ones have a much higher success rate than the large ones.

208
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:50,420
Right. And if treatment B was used on the easier, easier stones, then it's it's going to have a higher success rate here.

209
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,740
So, you know, I guess I would argue when you know,

210
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,389
when you look at this kind of small stones versus large stones and you observe that and you know

211
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:08,959
that there was some kind of bias or this these weren't allocated randomly attributed to me.

212
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,750
We're not allocated randomly to people. It seems like, you know,

213
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:20,239
physicians chose to be more often for small stones and a problem for large stones that that gave us this what I

214
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:29,030
would say biased results here that to be better overall simply because it wasn't used for the more difficult stones.

215
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:37,250
I think you will see this this concern and a lot of, you know, large academic medical centers like ones across the street here,

216
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:45,230
if you look at maybe like overall mortality in hospitals, you see how possibly hospital be, hospital be has higher mortality.

217
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,120
A hospital or a hospital be say is the reason for the higher mortality.

218
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:58,460
And so I actually don't know the results here. But let's say Michigan medicine, let's say they have higher mortality than Beaumont.

219
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:03,320
Yeah. Their go to answer is always that they treat more complicated cases.

220
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:10,310
Exactly is they say, look where where this, you know, specialty hospital that receives all the most difficult cases.

221
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,940
And so our mortality might be higher. But that doesn't mean we're bad doctors.

222
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,780
It means that we're trying our best to serve the sickest population.

223
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,110
And more people die because we're treating the sickest patients.

224
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,670
No, I first of all, I don't know if Michigan medicine has higher mortality.

225
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,809
Second of all, you know, I don't know if they try to make that argument.

226
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:34,129
But that is an argument typically that you will hear from a lot of places when they when someone says, hey,

227
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:39,080
you don't have very good outcomes, they say, well, it's because we're treating a more difficult population.

228
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:45,020
And that could be true. It could be the case in some communities.

229
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:51,850
Better medical center, which doesn't treat between very sick patients versus, you know, tertiary hospital, be like that.

230
00:24:51,880 --> 00:25:01,100
You know maybe maybe they do treat or sicker patients and so they have maybe higher costs, maybe worse, worse aggregate outcomes.

231
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:09,530
You hear this also from insurance companies that say and you hear about that as being a problem with kind of adverse selection.

232
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,059
You know, an insurance company might say, hey, look,

233
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:16,730
we we have higher costs and everything like got because for whatever reason, we're forced to serve sicker patients to.

234
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,120
So that's something to. But so then what you want to do that is you want to try to control for that,

235
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:30,230
you want to try to measure in this case, you know, small fingers, large stones in the case of a hospital,

236
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:35,810
maybe severity of patient patients coming into your hospital to what they call risk adjust,

237
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,190
for example, to see, you know, is this a fair comparison between different systems?

238
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:47,150
So another example of this, let's say we have 100,000 COVID 19 patients, 90,000.

239
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,260
So this is just observational again. 90,000 patients received outpatient care.

240
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,010
Your total cost was $90 million. Let's say a person if they received outpatient care and then 10,000,

241
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:02,900
the people received inpatient care for a total cost of $100 million, which is $10,000 per patient.

242
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:14,300
If we instead took those patients and kicked them out of the hospital and gave them inpatient care, would we have saved $90 million?

243
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:27,609
I'm seeing your head shake now, y'know? Because you're making the assumption that they're not going to go get care elsewhere or that their case,

244
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:33,790
like there's a reason that they went to outpatient care. So you're just like completely ignoring every other factor.

245
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:39,910
I exactly. The people who received inpatient care were probably sicker than the patients who received outpatient care.

246
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:47,460
Even if you kick them out of the hospital and made them get outpatient care, they probably would have had more expensive outpatient care,

247
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:52,330
seeing their doctor more often, outpatient, taking more medications, etc., etc., etc.

248
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:56,110
And actually their outcomes probably probably would have been worse too.

249
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,380
You know, maybe they, you know, they probably should have received it.

250
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:05,260
So that if you don't control for, again, patient severity, you make the incorrect assessment that,

251
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,650
hey, we can save all this money by just giving people outpatient care.

252
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,830
So maybe it's the case that, you know, severe patients actually,

253
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:21,250
if you had give them outpatient give them outpatient care in order, you know, 50 $500 in costs or something like that.

254
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:31,880
So in our times we say we're control. And so you say we're controlling something.

255
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:36,900
We're controlling for something. Why do we need these controls?

256
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:46,460
We're actually media better. In a randomized study you have, you'll be randomized people to our intervention.

257
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,120
Then why is there always a control arm in a study where they get a placebo or something like that?

258
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:06,340
Compare the results. Yeah, we want to see, you know, what's that what's the difference between between the two and.

259
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:16,100
Another thing is there is blinding in studies. Why do we do blinding in randomized studies to make sure there's no bias?

260
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,970
So what kind of bias would there would we see if we didn't do blind?

261
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:26,270
I think it could be both implicit and explicit bias, depending on who's doing the study, what the study is about,

262
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,469
because I know they do the double blinding where it's both the researchers and the

263
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:36,140
patients that don't know who's getting what is truly unbiased in every way it can be.

264
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:42,350
Yeah. So you do single one and don't want a single blinding. Might be you by the patient but not the doctor.

265
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,280
Double blind is you blind? Both of them. I so. But how?

266
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,560
Why do we need to blind people?

267
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:57,050
How would bias implicit or explicit bias, you know, how would that affect the results of our of our interpretation of a study?

268
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,920
Yeah, because like, if there was like a pill you were giving,

269
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,510
people knew they were taking the placebo pill or something, they'd be like, Oh, there's no change.

270
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,670
Then maybe people who are taking the difference would be like, Oh yeah, I feel so much better, so different, you know?

271
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,200
So I feel like, like just because of the patients don't even the doctors are like, Oh, we expect this one treatment to be better.

272
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:23,000
Yeah, it's going to kind of assume it's better. And that's partially why you need the control here, right?

273
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,780
If someone there's the placebo effect, well known placebo effect,

274
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:32,330
if you give someone something that oftentimes will feel better in general and then if you didn't if you blinded them,

275
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:36,020
maybe you'd lose some of that placebo effect in the control arm.

276
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:47,090
Now, the thing to it is, let's say I have some deadly disease and I know I'm getting the placebo or my doctor knows I'm getting the placebo,

277
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,440
then my doctor or myself, we might do other things that we otherwise wouldn't.

278
00:29:53,660 --> 00:30:00,379
If I think, Hey, someone's kind of neglecting me and I'm just getting a sugar pill or something,

279
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,700
injection or something like that, then I want to try something different.

280
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:14,090
And so you might do other things. And if people knew they were getting the treatment, maybe they'd, they wouldn't do some additional things as well.

281
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:20,510
So that's what we do, buddy. Now, you can't always blind people and.

282
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:28,890
I know, you know, for like some sort of surgery sometimes that it's difficult to, you know, blind someone that they didn't get the surgery.

283
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:34,980
Although I have seen cases where people where where people have done sham surgeries.

284
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,730
So they randomized people for like a knee arthroscopy or something like that.

285
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,670
And the doctor will actually, you know, cut an incision in the knee and then just close it back up and not do anything.

286
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:53,970
Um, and I have heard of some, like, some like a brain stimulation where they've actually put the, the device and people would just not turn it on.

287
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:59,010
Although for some of these things, apparently, like you can feel the electrical stimulation.

288
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:02,669
And so it's hard to find someone to to know that they didn't have it.

289
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:10,410
So sometimes it's technically difficult and sometimes it's probably ethically problematic to do a sham surgery on someone and expose them to a risk.

290
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:19,140
Um, in the control of something like think about I'm working on a project for we're looking at potential new vaccines and,

291
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:25,410
and want to ask a cost effectiveness question should we be giving kids this new injection?

292
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:31,680
And in the clinical trial they gave some kids this injection and the other kids, they just gave it.

293
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:38,520
Stanley, an injection. Now, when you poke someone in the arm with a needle, it hurts whether you put something in that or not.

294
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:43,410
Now, maybe if you put some sort of special antigens in, there are antibodies, you know that person.

295
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:49,410
Maybe it will hurt more, but if you just inject someone in the arm, even if it's just saline, their arm is going to hurt a little bit.

296
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:57,180
And so actually, in that case, we, you know, in many cases you do want to control arm.

297
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,310
But in this in the case of a cost effective analysis,

298
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:03,450
we want to know what's the difference between injecting someone in the arm and not giving them anything at all.

299
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:07,500
And if you don't do the policy of injecting kids in the arm, they're not the arm is not going to hurt.

300
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:17,850
So we want to actually look at the real world difference between, you know, injection in the arm and the injection in the arm,

301
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,890
which which is which is different from if you give someone a, you know, a placebo injection.

302
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:26,660
Yeah. How do you deal with that ethical issue? Do.

303
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:37,760
I mean, so I mean, there are so there are ethical concerns with these studies.

304
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,340
If you're giving people, you know, injections in their arm or sham surgeries, things like that.

305
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:48,589
I mean, typically that's what an institutional review board is is doing is considering what are those ethical

306
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:55,130
issues and considering do we think the potential benefit of this study is worth putting people in the arm?

307
00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:04,160
Now, typically an institutional review board, if it if they think that that drug or whatever shows promise they're oftentimes fine signing off on,

308
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:12,650
you know, an injection in someone's arm in the placebo arm of the study because they say, hey, that's not that's a minor inconvenience.

309
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,280
But when it's more severe or invasive,

310
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,749
like a sham surgery and your knee or you actually go into that room and they they make a

311
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:27,560
decision on your knee and then so a back up that's a little more invasive and and concerning.

312
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:32,780
And so that is kind of a bigger, more important ethical issue.

313
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:40,100
Yeah. And that that's really I think, though, the ethics of that really more the ethical concerns about the study,

314
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:45,920
not necessarily the the cost effectiveness thinking customers also think we have different ethical issues about,

315
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:50,620
you know, should we give this intervention to this group and not this group?

316
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:55,070
Should we give the intervention to the old population and not the young population or vice versa?

317
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:59,940
You know, those are more interesting, challenging ethical issues to cross to consensus.

318
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:10,970
So the thing is, is, you know, I wanted to cover here is is sample size.

319
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:20,600
Why is sample size important in a study? What is sample size?

320
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:25,350
How does sample size affect our interpretation of our. Saying.

321
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:34,750
A larger sample size removes random areas. So larger sample size reduces random error.

322
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,200
Exactly. Which doesn't. Doesn't it depend on the population you're looking at, though?

323
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:47,500
So if you're doing a study, you tend to create a policy that's going to impact like one certain area.

324
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:54,190
It makes more sense that you have a sample size that's more proportional to the area you're doing,

325
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:57,099
whereas if you're trying to create a policy that's going to be like federal,

326
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:01,510
which is going to impact the entire United States, you would want a larger sample size, right?

327
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:06,850
So I think we you typically always want a larger sample size,

328
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:11,200
but you want to make sure that your sample is appropriate for the population you're concerned about.

329
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:17,830
So if you're if you're interested in the impact of an intervention on low income people in Detroit,

330
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,740
you want to make sure your sample is of low income people in Detroit.

331
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:26,740
If you want to think about a policy that applies to the entire United States, then you want to sample people from the entire United States.

332
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:31,630
Now, the population of low income people in Detroit is smaller than the entire U.S. population.

333
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,870
But yet I think if you were doing a study, you'd always want more and more low income people in Detroit.

334
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:43,180
I mean, if you could have do a study of ten people or a thousand people in Detroit,

335
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,590
you'd prefer the sample of a thousand people, and then ten, even though.

336
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,040
So you always kind of want a larger sample size. The challenge is large sample size is more expensive.

337
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,840
It's more expensive to do a study, thousand people than ten people.

338
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,299
So but you're right, though,

339
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:07,790
a key thing is making sure you're looking at the right population to answer your question and often we'll talk about this,

340
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:15,790
oftentimes you have to generalize. So maybe there's a study done in Detroit and it shows this intervention is really promising.

341
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:21,850
And the question is, what should we do that intervention in Flint? Flint is similar to Detroit.

342
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:28,270
It's not exactly the same. Can you generalize? Can you take the results of that study in Detroit and apply that to Flint?

343
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:34,880
And often, as we do have to generalize and but acknowledge that, you know,

344
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,040
the results of that study might not be completely applicable in in the new setting.

345
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:47,620
So it's something to be aware of, too. So we found that we want bigger sample sizes.

346
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,950
That gives us statistical power, that reduces random error.

347
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:59,200
Let's say we were again studying face masks and we did a study where ten people didn't wear face masks and ten people could wear face masks.

348
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:06,520
And we see did they get COVID 19? And lo and behold, one person on the face mask group got COVID 19 and zero.

349
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,530
And the no mask group got COVID 19. Does that mean face masks don't work?

350
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:24,600
I mean, it was it was 10% of the facemask group got COVID 19 and.

351
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:33,270
It was 0% in the no facemask group. Clearly this is worse than this, right?

352
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:39,710
It's a sample size of, let's say, ten people in this group and ten people in this group.

353
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:48,690
Does that mean face masks don't work? What would your criticism about the study be that.

354
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:59,979
Like 20 people, you'll meet with 20 people. And it could have been just random chance that the person with the face mask one people on the face mask

355
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:04,810
group got COVID 19 and it could be just random chance and no one in the know face mask group got COVID 19.

356
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:08,560
Two. How do you really feel confident that this is a real result?

357
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:17,410
Maybe you need to do a study with 10,000 people in each group because COVID 19 is especially over a short period of time.

358
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:20,440
Maybe you did this study over the course of a month or something like that, a short period of time.

359
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:26,500
You know, the risk of getting COVID 19 is relatively rare. And so we need a large sample size to study.

360
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:35,320
You know, are these are we going to get enough events in both groups to really statistically be sure that it wasn't random chance that,

361
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:40,440
you know, the people with the face masks did you know better than people with a face mask.

362
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:47,439
And so if you did this with, you know, a large sample size of, you know, 10,000 people, then maybe you wouldn't see the random chance.

363
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:54,400
And maybe then you would see, you know, 100 people with no face masks got COVID 19 and maybe, you know, 70, 80% passed.

364
00:38:54,470 --> 00:39:02,920
And you could see, aha, there is a difference here. And you might it would be more statistically certain that that was actually a result.

365
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,770
You know, speaking of face masks, we all get in trouble here.

366
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:17,060
But has anyone studied the the Bangladesh or is aware of the Bangladesh face mask study for COVID 19?

367
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:31,390
So, you know, unfortunately, there are very few very few face masks studies actually, of the impact of face masks on unrestrained viruses.

368
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:38,260
Alison Aiello, a former you have a professor in epidemiology, did a study with students in dorms right out here.

369
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:44,860
This is like ten years ago and randomize dorms to get to be encouraged to wear face masks or no face masks

370
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:50,770
during flu season to see if it if it reduced infections didn't seem to actually have much of an effect.

371
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:55,360
Others, you know, they're very few. And that was actually a pretty good study.

372
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:59,950
Randomized, actually aren't many, many good studies on face masks.

373
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:09,250
But, you know, two years ago or so, a bunch of researchers did a large scale study with tens of thousands of people in Bangladesh,

374
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:13,750
and they randomized villages to get face masks or not.

375
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:19,120
They tried surgical masks, like many of you in the classroom, wearing and then cloth masks.

376
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:25,360
And they found that surgical masks seem to actually have have an effect in reducing COVID 19 infections.

377
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:28,030
Face that some cloth ones actually not so much.

378
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:35,080
So, you know, but again, they had to, you know, do studies with like tens of thousands of people and actually do that.

379
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:41,560
Again, they randomized communities to to get masks and not so that was, you know,

380
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:47,320
one of the few studies we've had in this era of the the impact of of face masks.

381
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,990
And they needed a large sample size.

382
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:55,569
Now, interestingly, if you talk to people about the study, there are some concerns about that study and how they did it.

383
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,740
And there wasn't blinding.

384
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:04,090
You know, the people in the and the communities kind of knew whether they were part of the face mask community or not face mask community.

385
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:08,830
People might have chosen to enroll in the study for different reasons.

386
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:16,360
And so, you know, these studies are perfect as well. So but sometimes you need large scale studies like that.

387
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:25,660
So over time with generalizability as well, under generalization and over generalization.

388
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:31,640
So overgeneralization is oftentimes a concern that academics have.

389
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:36,830
So they say, hey, yes, you did that study in Detroit, but does that really apply to Flint?

390
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:49,030
Flint is not the same as Detroit. And so, you know, that could be a concern if say, hey, you did this study on breast cancer in your population,

391
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,730
a people in their thirties, is that really apply to people in their sixties?

392
00:41:53,990 --> 00:42:04,330
So, you know, it is it is possible that you could overgeneralize and that you may be taken as a result from one population,

393
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:11,630
try to apply it to different population. And that might not be a fair generalization to apply to a different population.

394
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:16,100
Now with that said, there are also severe risks of under generalization as well.

395
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:23,540
So again, maybe you have a really good intervention for people in Detroit and that if you if if you refuse to generalize,

396
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:27,190
you might say, I refuse to give this intervention to people in Flint.

397
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,440
Maybe it's a lighting intervention, but you say, hey, look, has it been studied in Flint?

398
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,570
And you could prevent people in Flint from receiving a really valuable intervention, too.

399
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:40,940
So that could be a risk as well if you you know.

400
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:47,569
So I think there is a we always need to generalize a little bit and be aware that if you don't generalize,

401
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:52,340
you could be, you know, harming a population by not giving them timely intervention.

402
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:57,940
On the other hand, you can also harm population by over generalizing and giving them an intervention that's not appropriate.

403
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:04,860
And this is kind of an art to to decide what's what's fair journalism what.

404
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:15,820
Want to offer you some stunning designs as well, and consider what are the strengths and limitations of the difference that he designs.

405
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:20,800
You saw these in some of the videos you watched here. Does anyone want to?

406
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:29,380
Explain what they think the differences are between some of these different studies, say designs or strengths and limitations of these.

407
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:35,360
So. What is what is a case study?

408
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:43,850
You read about that in the medical review, some sort of journal article about a case study of someone who had diabetes or.

409
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:53,180
Foot and mouth disease. Monkeypox is what is like a case study agreeing about that.

410
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:57,020
What is what kind of a study is that retrospective?

411
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:05,350
Usually it's retrospective and typically it's just like 1% or something like that kind of small sample size so that, you know, time series analysis.

412
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:16,160
What what's that kind of study? Just subjects like the process with time.

413
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:22,970
Yeah. So you're watching someone kind of over time and oftentimes that can be useful and invaluable understanding what's happening over time as well.

414
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:36,440
And that cross sectional analysis, what's that to sample in different areas and get them together to find out if it's all or prevalence?

415
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:41,510
Yeah. So we sample a bunch of people, but actually we typically sample them all at one time.

416
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:46,910
So we just kind of take and hand out a survey to every one of you today and answer the survey.

417
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,750
And we get that back and we see it among different types of students.

418
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,360
You know, what are the different outcomes here? See for you.

419
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:03,250
That's we're taking a cross-section of the population and doing a kind of say just once,

420
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,610
although sometimes you'll see something about a repeated cross-sectional study where,

421
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,290
you know, surveys survey everyone or draw blood samples from like us, from everyone.

422
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:14,620
And then a month later, a year later, we'll do that again.

423
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:23,460
And then what's a case control study? No.

424
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,909
It's basically what were selected on the basis of whether or not they have the disease and there's

425
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:33,139
like matching of one person with the one person is out and they're just followed over time.

426
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:39,680
You just measure it like every year or so. I know that usually they use it for like diseases that are really rare because just taking a sample

427
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,150
of a big population would likely not really get an accurate picture of what the disease like.

428
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:50,660
So they usually pick it based on people who are both exposed and or who are not exposed at all.

429
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,800
And it's really compared to just like completely random, unbiased people.

430
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:00,439
So yeah, yeah. And so typically they get it typically for rare diseases.

431
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,129
And so it's hard to find people who have this condition.

432
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:10,730
Oftentimes it's it's retrospective and kind of looking back. So you say, aha, I've got these ten people who have this rare cancer.

433
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:14,620
And then I want to, you know,

434
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:24,290
look retrospectively at what their health has looked like over time and then try and maybe look into like an insurance data set or something and

435
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:33,270
find ten other people who I think are similar to these ten people with the cancer on many dimensions and look at their history over time and over.

436
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:36,740
Just try to figure out, you know, what is it that caused this, let's say, rare cancer?

437
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:42,690
And then we have, you know,

438
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:51,970
cohorts where we so sorry case controllers typically kind of look back and then we could have a prospective cohort analysis.

439
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:58,730
Um, what is, what does that look like? Framingham.

440
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:03,410
So even though with the Framingham study, it was a heart disease thing.

441
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:11,450
So what's the Framingham City? Yeah.

442
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:18,200
They like, um, like follow people for their whole lives, like our children or grandchildren to see, like, the incidence of heart disease and.

443
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,170
Yeah. So that's, it's a, it's a small city.

444
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:28,520
Remember Massachusetts, Framingham, Massachusetts. And the researchers study people longitudinally over time.

445
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:35,090
So they had them come in. They measure their height and weight and check their blood pressure and check their cholesterol levels and things like that.

446
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:43,970
And then they study them over time. And this is and they so they follow this cohort over time and observe what was happening to them.

447
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:48,110
And this study is one where we get a lot of really valuable information about

448
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:53,390
how blood pressure and cholesterol affect rates of heart attacks and strokes.

449
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:59,750
So they looked at people and saw that people with a high blood pressure and high cholesterol had more heart attacks and strokes and things like that.

450
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:06,709
And and you'll hear something maybe called the Framingham risk equations where they've actually,

451
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:08,780
you know, because they studied people over many decades,

452
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:17,510
were able to calculate what's your ten year risk of heart attack or stroke, given a certain blood pressure and cholesterol and a few other measures.

453
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:24,410
So they take you over time to understand how kind of early blood pressure and

454
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,780
cholesterol and other things affect your long term risk of these bad outcomes.

455
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:34,850
And then we have experimental studies, a randomized controlled trial.

456
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:40,730
So what's a randomized controlled trial? Kind of touched on this a little bit earlier.

457
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:51,110
Perspective right now. We design it at the beginning and then observe things that happen over time.

458
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:57,380
Again, retrospective means we we find people now and then look back in their history for things that were happening.

459
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:05,120
Prospective means we identify people and randomize them and to start with this randomized controlled trial and then look at things in the future.

460
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:14,230
So our city randomized controlled trial. So we're randomizing people to get something or not.

461
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:19,840
And again that intervention a placebo controlled or even in my control this trial.

462
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:27,670
Like one of one set of people gets the intervention, the other one doesn't or gets less people.

463
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:31,630
So you compare the results at. Yeah. And so, so yeah.

464
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:40,360
Some people get this intervention and it's very controlled because it's, it's probably blinded and people are observed very regularly,

465
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:48,400
you know, they're brought into the clinic maybe to get some, you know, measurements and so forth or surveyed every few months or years.

466
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:52,989
So that's, you know, it's highly it's a highly controlled environment as well,

467
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:59,330
which is something to think about when you're using the results of a randomized controlled trial to apply to the real world.

468
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:04,930
That is, in the real world, things might not be so controlled as they are in a randomized controlled trial.

469
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:11,800
Also, something to think about is it typically in a randomized controlled trial, the population is very highly controlled as well.

470
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:16,270
Only certain people are enrolled in a randomized controlled trial.

471
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:20,530
Often that's a very specific population to answer a very specific scientific question.

472
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:23,740
Now, when you want to roll that intervention out in the real world,

473
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:32,680
those people might not be as as controlled and as they are in the randomized controlled trial or specific.

474
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,190
What's a meta analysis? Analysis of analysis?

475
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,800
It's analysis of analysis. Yeah.

476
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:48,730
So typically and oftentimes people think this is maybe can be the best source of evidence because you might have one randomized controlled trial,

477
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:53,680
let's say that says one thing. Another one says another thing. Well, if you have enough randomized controlled trials,

478
00:50:53,680 --> 00:51:00,190
you can kind of try to aggregate them together and get a sense of the overall impact based on what you're saying.

479
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:07,210
So it's a challenging process. You have to pick which studies to include and grade all of that and so forth.

480
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:19,390
But that can be a powerful tool. So just in in summary here, cross-sectional studies, short term, less expensive.

481
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:23,200
But all these observational studies can be prone to bias.

482
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:31,070
So typically in your with this study here, you're sampling people and you're saying, do you have this characteristic, a disease characteristic,

483
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:37,990
those these characteristics of the disease and collecting all that information at the same time of the cross-sectional study.

484
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:44,140
Case control study. Again, you're finding those cases and controls and looking back on their history to see certain characteristics.

485
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:50,350
There can be challenges here that can be like bias and recall and selective survival.

486
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,600
If you have some really terrible condition.

487
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:57,610
Oftentimes you're thinking about that a lot and you're thinking about what could it have been in the past that could have caused that.

488
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,210
So your recall might be different than other people who don't have the condition.

489
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:10,719
They might not be thinking of bad things that happened in their past that would have caused something like a very simple prospective cohort.

490
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:16,000
Again, we're looking at people over time. All of these can be long term and costly with large sample sizes.

491
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:24,160
And then experimental. We start with this too. Although the cons are it's not realistic and representative.

492
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:28,480
And again, there can be ethical challenges. If you really think this intervention works can be ethical,

493
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:35,740
it's unethical to give someone that control so people often that it's about time to talk about this.

494
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:39,550
They say, well, you can't if you have an intervention, it's a parachute.

495
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:51,120
You can't randomize people with control of no parachute. He probably hasn't seen that.

496
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:10,870
Yeah. So there's the in this study here parachute use to prevent death and major trial jumping from aircraft randomized controlled trial.

497
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:24,230
So they did a randomized controlled trial here. Yeah.

498
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:34,620
Okay they screen people randomized them 12 that the intervention program control and everyone complete the the jump no one no deaths in his arm.

499
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:37,270
So parachutes don't work.

500
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:49,959
So here here's a picture of of the person jumping off the airplane and they actually about what to too but yeah they all kind of look like this.

501
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,810
The helicopters and planes are about this far off the ground.

502
00:53:53,170 --> 00:54:00,760
So yeah, you have to to study the, you know, make sure you read through the research site to make sure that going on.

503
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:11,050
So that's why it's important that you understand these studies, understand its rights and limitations and biases and so forth.

504
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:19,200
So I want to say, see also, again, all these data sources have knitting data together from different sources, sources.

505
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:25,209
But and oftentimes we have to do that in a cost because you have to gather some epidemiological data

506
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:30,280
from one a few studies over here gather some cost data from these databases or other studies over here,

507
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:33,430
gather estimates of quality of life for explosives were here.

508
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:38,230
And you're kind of putting that together, synthesizing it together to get your cost effectiveness results.

509
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:43,180
But I do want to caution you or just be aware for your projects,

510
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:52,330
but also as your consumer of these studies as well, it can be risky to pull data from different studies.

511
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:59,320
And in particular, I think my biggest concerns are probably if you gather, you know, effectiveness on so let's say you have,

512
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:04,000
you know, intervention, A intervention, B, you want to compare those two in your cost effective analysis.

513
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:09,730
But it can be dangerous to gather intervention effectiveness from intervention a from study one,

514
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:20,800
an intervention B from study to why could that be a problem? So let's say there's a study in the UK that says, hey, intervention is great.

515
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:26,650
And there's a study in Canada that says intervention is great.

516
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:30,240
It's it's here's the global effectiveness of this.

517
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:40,040
It comes back to everything, but the interventions are different, so the population that's being impacted or studied is different.

518
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:45,730
There's some other confounders in there that, yeah, so it can be really challenging.

519
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:52,180
What we ideally want to see is a head to head study that studies intervention versus intervention be with the same populations,

520
00:55:52,180 --> 00:56:00,729
same same methods and protocols and so forth. So we have to be really careful if you if you share the effectiveness of a from this study and B,

521
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:04,090
from this study, because the protocols might be different, the population might be different.

522
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:11,710
So it's it might be an unfair comparison to, you know, all those numbers from two different studies.

523
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:20,049
Same thing with cost. So we got the costs of this intervention from the UK and the cost of this intervention from the United States.

524
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:27,310
Well, we know U.S. health care costs are more expensive than the UK and so it might not be appears to be be careful about

525
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:37,180
or be aware of that when you're looking at studies that are pulling data from different sources and in particular,

526
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:44,589
again, if you're comparing intervention A versus B, you want the parameters for A and B to come from kind of similar similar sources

527
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:48,970
that are looking at them head to head and have similar ways of measuring counters.

528
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:56,130
Okay. And to finish off today, I want to talk about some biases.

529
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,520
Amos Buirski and Daniel Kahneman are kind of famous behavioral economists or sociologists,

530
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:08,370
and they studied heuristics and biases that I think are really important to be aware of,

531
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:13,260
three of which we'll talk about here today representativeness, availability and adjustment and anchoring.

532
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:24,690
So in a first point out that this is the enrollment in the School of Public Health in 2022, we have 250 students in biostatistics,

533
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:33,989
but 100 and epidemiology here, about 150, a little less than that in health insurance policy and so forth.

534
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:38,790
So these are different departmental kind of organization.

535
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:47,400
Our groups here within the School of Public Health. So University of Michigan, Ann Arbor student is well-liked and shows promise.

536
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:53,720
I'm sorry. And student student as well.

537
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:57,210
I can just promise. What's the probability that students and student.

538
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:16,130
So for me too. So what do you think the problem is that the students and HP student, if they're well liked and they show promise 100%, 100%.

539
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:19,410
Okay. It's about 100% here.

540
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:28,790
We've got a big advocate for HP, 85, 85% here.

541
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:42,060
I don't know. 90, 90%. Then you got to come out here.

542
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:46,440
Yeah. What do you think? It. It's 99.9.

543
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:56,160
What? 99.90 9.9. I thought as opposed to you'd love for your fellow by assassins.

544
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,670
So representativeness here I think we're showing this here. I mean, it lies about each of these students in this classroom.

545
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:09,060
They think PE students are well-liked and show a lot of promise, unlike those other students in other countries.

546
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:16,800
So we're saying you're really high percentages because we we think that those characteristics are representative of HP students.

547
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:21,500
And so, of course, this has to be an HP student. When you think about it here, you know,

548
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:32,310
we've got a lot of departments here and HP students are maybe only 20% or 15% of the total population of speech.

549
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:38,760
And so we're forgetting kind of, hey, mindset students are well-liked and show promise as well as students,

550
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:48,180
environmental health students, you know, they are also well-liked and and show promise as well.

551
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:54,000
And so maybe we forget here about the kind of base raids to here.

552
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:59,630
And we but we think about, hey, this is this is representative of an HP student.

553
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:02,730
So we think it's you know, it's really high here.

554
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:10,140
So that's that's something that can be a challenge when we're assessing we're thinking about these things.

555
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:14,940
And I guess I'll say these biases, these are kind of psychological biases.

556
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:20,640
But keep in mind that these are these really affect us, as is research, and it affected what we're doing, cost effective analysis.

557
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:27,030
Oftentimes you don't have the best clinical data you might have to ask for expert opinion.

558
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:35,000
And these biases can can affect people. And even when you're choosing study versus study, you might say not going to believe study.

559
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:39,900
That number doesn't look right to me. So pick study B and that might be partially because of bias you.

560
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:47,540
And then I want to mention the study here about pilot feedback.

561
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:54,500
So these researchers were looking at flight instructors for Navy aircraft.

562
01:00:55,310 --> 01:01:01,610
And the instructors noticed that if they gave someone a lot of praise for an exceptionally

563
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:06,260
great landing on the aircraft is typically followed by a poor landing on the next try.

564
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:12,620
But if they gave some really harsh criticism after a bad landing, they did better the next try.

565
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:20,690
So the instructors concluded that they shouldn't praise people because these verbal praise wasn't helpful,

566
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:33,110
but that the harsh, harsh criticism was more effective at improving improving their next landing.

567
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:38,300
So what's a challenge with this, or is this the right way to think about this?

568
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:45,820
Should I give you guys more harsh criticism? Yeah.

569
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:51,440
Doesn't really take into account, like, the progression to the mean.

570
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:57,110
Yeah. So it's progression or regression to the mean. It's like there's an average in this example.

571
01:01:57,530 --> 01:02:02,000
Average flight landing, you know, somewhere in the middle between poor and really good.

572
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:08,070
That's kind of more likely to happen than either the poor or very good.

573
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:11,310
So the feedback is kind of not really the point, I think.

574
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:16,520
So if you did that, you probably chances are the next time, if the average is, you know, in the middle, you'll just do in the middle.

575
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:21,280
If you did really good times their next target probably be closer to the mean anyway.

576
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:29,960
So the feedback is not good. Yeah. And if you're if you're your plane landing is just a die roll and you rolled bad.

577
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:35,120
Well, you're just statistically more likely to have a better wall the next time.

578
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:40,520
So if there is some random variation here to how your plane lands and by the way, I'm not a Navy pilot,

579
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,950
but I would I would assume there are a lot of random factors about the wind

580
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:46,040
gusts here and there that could cause you to have a rough or a good landing.

581
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:52,690
There's probably some randomness involved in the quality of your landing on an aircraft carrier of that.

582
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:59,750
Yeah, there's the next time you're likely to just get better. And if you had a really fantastic landing, part of that might be just due to luck.

583
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:06,170
And next time you're likely to have a worse landing, you're brought to be you're going to be go back to the mean value next time.

584
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:17,780
So the the effect of the treatment here of praise or harsh criticism might be irrelevant to this.

585
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:24,830
Now, this is an example of pilot feedback, but it also could be the case in medicine as well.

586
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:35,780
So if you're feeling bad today, you've got a stuffy nose or your stomach hurts or your arm hurts or whatever it is.

587
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:44,420
If you're feeling bad, you're probably feeling worse than average, and tomorrow you might feel a little bit better.

588
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:47,930
If you're feeling terrific today. Now might be better than average.

589
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:50,270
And tomorrow you might feel a little bit not as good.

590
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:55,790
And so I could give you a sugar pill and say, if you're feeling bad, give you a sugar pill and say,

591
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,850
hey, this is going to make you feel better and tomorrow you will feel better.

592
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:03,079
But that's just reversion to the mean that you had a sore arm today and tomorrow.

593
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:06,260
It's going to feel better in a sore stomach. Today, it's going to feel better tomorrow.

594
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:10,320
And so if you had a stuffy nose, but in a week from now, it's going to feel better.

595
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:15,590
So that might be just reversion to the mean. And so we have to be careful of that.

596
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:21,320
And that's one reason why it's nice to have a control arm as well.

597
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:28,540
So you can say, okay, I gave you the sugar pill when you're feeling bad or I didn't give you the sugar pill or give me something else.

598
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:36,610
When you were feeling bouncy, which works better at getting you back, it maybe gets you back feeling better, faster, or something like that.

599
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:42,910
Because if I have an uncontrolled study with just one arm and we just give you one thing and,

600
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,630
and typically in medicine we're giving you things, interventions when you're feeling bad.

601
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:53,590
When you came in to the emergency room and you're feeling really terrible, we give you something and lo and behold, you feel better.

602
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:58,510
But maybe that's just the what they call the tincture of time. Anyone heard that?

603
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:04,440
It's just giving someone time to get better. I mean, we don't have to give you anything.

604
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:07,750
Maybe you just kind of your body will get better.

605
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:13,130
And we don't know if it's just the tincture of time or the intervention if we don't have a control.

606
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:24,540
So a word with three letters at length is or more is chosen at random from an English text.

607
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,890
Is it more likely that the word starts with the letter R or the third letter is R?

608
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:34,810
If you minutes or so think about this,

609
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:46,810
it's going to randomly also text on Google and we're going to see if we were to find words with there are three letters or longer.

610
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:52,120
Is it more likely that the first letter is or are the third letters are things

611
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:58,360
the first letter is not things the third letters are the readings first.

612
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:05,110
So but you know, when you think about this, it's more easy or it's easier to think about letters.

613
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:11,800
This word start with one are then have the third letter is a lot easier to think about that.

614
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:19,820
One of the example here we have groups A, B and C and these three sections of the classroom here.

615
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:24,710
And what are we doing spinning wheel here? So I'd like group a keep your eyes open.

616
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:31,190
Group B and C, close your eyes. I want to spin the wheel here.

617
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:38,509
Okay. Group A. You see the number? Okay, now, group eight.

618
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:44,240
Close your eyes. And Group B, open your eyes here.

619
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:51,290
Okay, now, look, you're going to do this better here and see if you remember this number here.

620
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:59,660
All right. She's the number. Okay, now, group, close your eyes and group C, open your eyes.

621
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:11,750
So group errors. Remember, be your members, their number. And now we have group C, as you see this summer.

622
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:15,500
Group seats. Okay. Now, you can all open your eyes here.

623
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:19,040
So you remember your number. You remember your number. You guys remember the number.

624
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:25,000
And you remember your number. Michigan and Ohio State have a famous football rivalry.

625
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:31,270
Think about how many times Michigan has beat or tied Ohio State in their annual football contest.

626
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:37,570
And as you just saw, that number from the spinner and the caller number Z.

627
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:46,360
Okay. So then what is the number of times Michigan beat or title Ohio State greater than or less than that number you saw Z.

628
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:51,460
First like with that is a greater number of us then. Yes.

629
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:57,210
And then think specifically how many wins and ties as Michigan has.

630
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:11,080
So think about that first. Is it greater than or less than that number you saw from the spinner and then think precisely what is the number again?

631
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:16,930
Okay. So actually, this group here, A is is is Michigan's number.

632
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:21,610
When's greater less than is is. I would think it's greater than we think.

633
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:29,710
It's less than ten. In this group in the center who thinks that Michigan's wins are greater than that number you saw on the screen,

634
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:34,180
we think it's less than the number you saw on the screen. Okay.

635
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:37,450
And then over here, who thinks it's greater than the number you saw on the screen?

636
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:42,410
Anything less than the numbers on the screen? Okay.

637
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:46,540
So what are what are your what are your guesses for how many wins Michigan's had?

638
01:08:47,560 --> 01:09:01,030
Oh. Then ten, 2040s or 50, 40, two fifties, I would say 37, 37, 50, 15.

639
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:13,900
Okay. Over here in the middle, 30, 20, under 24 hours and 40, 44, 47.

640
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:28,270
You think that 40, 40, 40, 40, 30, 42, 42, 43.

641
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:32,290
Yes. 1637.

642
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:37,070
In the four. In the forties. 33. 33, 50.

643
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:43,380
Okay. So now what was your Z 35, 30, 25.

644
01:09:43,390 --> 01:09:47,600
I think the U.S. had 58, the U.S. had 56 or something.

645
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:56,200
And now if this works out here, I think you guys had lower maybe lower estimates of what you thought it was and you'd been anchored on that number.

646
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:00,280
You So even though you knew as a random number because I asked you, you were focused on it.

647
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:03,879
I told you, I ask you, is that number greater than less than the anchor?

648
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:07,620
And now now you guys also had found this here.

649
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:27,070
So you look at the Michigan State football rivalry and so it was a drama series.

650
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:33,880
Michigan leads 59, 51 in six. So Michigan has 59 wins over Ohio State.

651
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:41,930
But you guys have been anchored at different numbers here because, you know, theoretically, you've been anchored at a lower number.

652
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,780
You wouldn't give kind of lower numbers.

653
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:52,480
And it's been experimentally show when people asked a question, Americans a question, they have zero knowledge of how many countries are in Africa.

654
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:58,480
They they're given a spinner and Americans have no idea. And if they show like ten, they say, oh, I think there were ten.

655
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:07,960
So 99. That's happening in 90 actors in Africa. So, you know, people do get anchored on these, you know, what they know to be a random number,

656
01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:14,680
not something that they're anchored on that they think is related to that. You can see anchoring and adjustment also works in negotiations.

657
01:11:15,790 --> 01:11:26,799
When Michigan Medicine has negotiations with the insurance companies, they say our price for, you know, this heart procedure is $150,000 to do this.

658
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,610
Our procedures. They kind of try to anchor Blue Cross at this really high number.

659
01:11:30,610 --> 01:11:34,090
And then when Blue Cross comes in and says, we want to pay a lower amount of,

660
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:38,170
you know, different amounts, they've been kind of anchored at that high price.

661
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:42,580
When you go to a car dealership and they say the sticker price of an anchor, you want a higher price.

662
01:11:44,350 --> 01:11:48,130
And also framing can affect things, too.

663
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,780
So example here, let's say we're preparing for an outbreak of a rare disease.

664
01:11:53,530 --> 01:11:56,890
It's going to kill 600 people if no action is taken.

665
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:05,020
We have two options here. We have a 200 people be saved with certainty program b one,

666
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:10,630
there's a one third chance 600 people will be saved, but a two thirds chance nobody will be saved.

667
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,370
Questions about this. You guys are the elite.

668
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:21,279
So graduating from an elite school of public health here, you might actually be asked to answer this type of question.

669
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:28,950
So who would choose program a one vote for program, a two months program?

670
01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:33,040
Who would prefer program B? So sorry. There are three choices here.

671
01:12:33,190 --> 01:12:41,650
Program paren b a prime C which is kill everyone who wants a look at a few votes, but who wants B?

672
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:46,990
So the rest of your choosing. Okay, looks like we are kind of even. Yeah.

673
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:51,140
Questions. Question your question for.

674
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:54,340
Oh, no, sorry. I was I have a student program and again.

675
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:59,259
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven.

676
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:03,070
And then program B two, four.

677
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:10,110
About eight or ten or so. Okay. Now, here we have a different one here.

678
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:17,599
We have a program C and D, program C,

679
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:26,840
400 people are definitely on a diet and program D there's a third chance that normal diet and a two thirds chance that 600 people would die.

680
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:33,510
And so who wants program C? It's a different C, not ever nice.

681
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:41,780
So program C for people die with certainty. It's 1 to 2 and a half.

682
01:13:42,410 --> 01:13:47,170
Who wants program D? So now more.

683
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:55,540
So here we had more people choose D oversea and in the first one more 5050 chose program A versus program B.

684
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:03,610
What's the difference between A, B, C and D? Is there a difference between A and C?

685
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:08,590
Right. It's just the framing, right?

686
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:16,750
In a 200 people live and four people die and see 200 people than before and two people die.

687
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:22,320
But you had different answers. But whether you preferred A or C, right.

688
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:28,420
And actually B and De are the same, B is a third chance.

689
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:35,380
Six of our people we saved two thirds chance nobody will be saved for a D is a third chance.

690
01:14:35,410 --> 01:14:41,320
No one will die or six people saved. And to the chance that six or people will die or no one will be saved.

691
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:46,420
So it's just framing of how many will die versus being saved. It's the same numbers here.

692
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:54,009
Answer the same B and C are the same, but you have different preferences based on how it was presented to you in terms

693
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:59,680
of two people being saved with certainty before the people die with certainty.

694
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:03,520
It's kind of classic glass half full, half empty the way it's presented to you.

695
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:12,030
So that's that's something to think about. I mean, actually, when you when you and when you look at program, see when you think about that,

696
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:17,160
it sounds like you're being asked that you definitely will have 400 people.

697
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:22,590
You know, you're you're responsible. It sounds like, you know, for the 400 people dying with certainty.

698
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:26,740
And so that it's framed differently as though you're actively, you know,

699
01:15:26,850 --> 01:15:34,620
making sure those 400 people die versus program, hey, here, it's framed as you are saving 200 people for sure.

700
01:15:35,670 --> 01:15:41,280
So it's framed differently and it gives you, you know, different answer to the participants.

701
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:44,010
Seems like, you know, the perspective of kind of where you're at.

702
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:52,679
But keep in mind, whenever we're making decisions here, you're also making a decision about, you know, do we do we do this intervention?

703
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:58,950
Do we not do the intervention? If you don't do the intervention, you're kind of actively choosing the status quo anyway.

704
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:04,049
So framing can be a change and reversion mean.

705
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:10,650
Here is kind of inclusion. Here we have these Manicurist X and Carrie biases that affect our assessments.

706
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:16,110
It is actually these sticks can be useful for making decisions quickly, but they also can have biases.

707
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:19,730
Regression, careful. Okay.

708
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:25,070
And then I just wanted to quickly mentioned, okay,

709
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:35,600
you turned in your homework assignments and there's a new homework assignment here of sensitivity analysis.

710
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:40,730
It's kind of similar thing here. You you have a Google spreadsheet template.

711
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:47,240
This next for work assignment is on sensitivity analysis, which we'll cover on Wednesday.

712
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:52,820
I have no class on Monday next week, so you will have a full week to transition.

713
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:58,880
But the homework for is on sensitivity analysis and that can answer more questions about this on Wednesday too.

714
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:03,140
But there are several parts to this. Here you are.

715
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:08,960
The idea here is that you're an analyst looking at the cost effectiveness of a cancer medication.

716
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,730
And question one is about one way sensitivity analysis.

717
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:22,850
So you're going to be, you know, varying parameters up and down, see which parameters have the biggest impact on the results.

718
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:28,610
Of course, intuitive threshold analysis based on the results you did in Question one.

719
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:35,500
Question three is a two way sensitivity analysis. Question four is interpreting the results of probabilistic to.

720
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:43,610
I'm not going to ask you to do a couple sensitivity analysis, but you will.

721
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:58,880
You will interpret these. So here to show you kind of what this spreadsheet looks like.

722
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:05,840
There is a kind of a cost effectiveness mark of well, there are some inputs here.

723
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:10,160
There's a tab here for results, training results of this.

724
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:20,649
And then there's the question. When a beach town has some things, you're like question one.

725
01:18:20,650 --> 01:18:29,860
BE It's already the templates kind of filled out for you as you put in that incremental cost effectiveness ratio in this value as well as values high,

726
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:34,540
you plug it in there and so forth. So you create a little grammar.

727
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:37,300
And so maybe I'll talk about this more after class.

728
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:45,780
I might say to yes for the homework today I'm not seeking a submission like a place to paste the Lincoln on the assignment.

729
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:50,950
Oh, okay. Now I don't see too many credits.

730
01:18:50,950 --> 01:18:54,549
Put my way to the government. Okay.

731
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:58,810
I will update. Thank you for idea.

732
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:12,830
Any other questions? Sir.

733
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:18,400
Michael, thank you. All right. Okay.

734
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:22,150
Well, thanks for your time here today and hopefully this has been useful discussion.

735
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:26,350
You know, these data sources are really important. And I think it's you mean you're getting a lot of this.

736
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:29,530
I think also in some of your earlier classes, I'd have analogies for it,

737
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:34,059
but hopefully it's is useful reinforcing of the importance of thinking about the data

738
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:43,880
quality and the various studies just for general for specifically for students and.

739
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:54,710
Oh yeah.

740
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:58,180
Don't like. Oh.
