2
00:00:04,723 --> 00:00:06,383
By the 17th century,

3
00:00:06,383 --> 00:00:12,285
a more sophisticated approach to managing
the public's health began to take form.

4
00:00:12,285 --> 00:00:19,800
In 1639, the Massachusetts Bay Colony
required birth and death registration.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,940
Less than ten years later,

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:27,390
a resolution to prevent pollution
in Boston Harbor was adopted.

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,140
Officials started to isolate people
with diseases like smallpox and

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,990
quarantine ships from other countries

9
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:40,290
to assess whether the people on
board were carrying disease.

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,507
Infectious diseases like smallpox,
cholera, typhoid, yellow fever, and

11
00:00:45,507 --> 00:00:50,735
malaria persisted throughout the 18th
century as leading causes of death.

12
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:53,497
[MUSIC]

13
00:00:53,497 --> 00:00:57,495
In 1793,
a major epidemic of yellow fever in

14
00:00:57,495 --> 00:01:02,274
Philadelphia infected two-thirds
of the population and

15
00:01:02,274 --> 00:01:07,990
10% of the city's
population did not survive.

16
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,930
To address these and
other public health challenges,

17
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:17,252
the United States established
the Marine Hospital Service in 1798.

18
00:01:17,252 --> 00:01:20,816
Set up to deal with
disease on board ships,

19
00:01:20,816 --> 00:01:28,140
the Marine Hospital Service Act also
provided health care for merchant seamen.

20
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,471
And thereby became the world's
very first health care insurance.

21
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:36,606
[MUSIC]

22
00:01:36,606 --> 00:01:43,220
By the middle of the 19th century, the
Industrial Revolution was in full swing.

23
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:48,430
High densities of people settled
in industrialized areas.

24
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:54,800
Dangerous and toxic working conditions,
dangerous machinery, overcrowding,

25
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,010
and lack of adequate sanitation,
as well as poor access to clean water,

26
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:05,410
and massive air pollution from factories
all contributed to an increase

27
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:11,730
in the spread of infectious diseases,
and the emergence of chronic diseases.

28
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,967
This led to the need for
better living and working conditions and

29
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:20,138
improved sanitation efforts to
keep disease from spreading.

30
00:02:20,138 --> 00:02:23,148
[MUSIC]

31
00:02:23,148 --> 00:02:26,008
One of the most significant public health

32
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:31,570
achievements of the era came as
a result of the work of John Snow.

33
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:38,310
In 1854 during a cholera epidemic
in London, Snow successfully mapped

34
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,280
the location of cholera cases throughout
the city and discovered that people

35
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,120
who were infected all got their
water from the Broad Street pump.

36
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,401
This was the first noteworthy example
of modern day epidemiology in action.

37
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:57,075
[MUSIC]

38
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:59,290
Meanwhile during this period,

39
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,968
Lemuel Shattuck completed the report
of the Sanitary Commission of

40
00:03:03,968 --> 00:03:09,220
Massachusetts based on what he described
as a sanitary survey of the state,

41
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:15,230
making recommendations for the promotion
of public and personal health.

42
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,842
This is often considered the beginning
of the modern era of public health.

43
00:03:19,842 --> 00:03:22,874
[MUSIC]

44
00:03:22,874 --> 00:03:23,873
In 1873,

45
00:03:23,873 --> 00:03:30,470
Michigan became one of the first states to
establish a statewide health department.

46
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,080
During this period, the National
Port Quarantine Act, a precursor

47
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,640
to the Public Health Service and Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention,

48
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,900
made the federal government responsible to
identify and address disease outbreaks.

49
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,236
By 1910, every state had formed
a statewide health department.

50
00:03:51,236 --> 00:03:55,918
[MUSIC]

51
00:03:55,918 --> 00:04:00,796
While public health advances most
often produced a positive result,

52
00:04:00,796 --> 00:04:06,102
some public health undertakings
created serious ethical controversies.

53
00:04:06,102 --> 00:04:12,670
In 1932, the Public Health Service
launched the Tuskegee syphilis experiment.

54
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:17,899
The purpose was to study the natural
progression of untreated syphilis.

55
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:22,645
600 African Americans
participated in the study to

56
00:04:22,645 --> 00:04:27,725
evaluate what they
understood to be bad blood.

57
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:33,590
400 of these participants didn't
even know that they had syphilis.

58
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,620
And while they were given
free health care, meals, and

59
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,511
burial insurance, they were not
actually treated despite the fact

60
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:47,517
that penicillin was proven to
cure syphilis by the mid-1940s.

61
00:04:47,517 --> 00:04:49,917
Many of these participants died and

62
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:54,370
even passed on syphilis to their wives and
babies.

63
00:04:54,370 --> 00:05:01,890
The experiment continued until 1972,
when it was deemed an ethical disaster.

64
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:06,393
Leading to the establishment of more
stringent regulations guiding human

65
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:11,728
subject research.
