1
00:00:01,317 --> 00:00:06,417
>>Dr. Switzer. >>Yes, come in, I'm just just washing my hands.

2
00:00:06,417 --> 00:00:12,767
>>I'm Catherine Bigman. Janet Carlisle referred me.>> Oh yes.

3
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:16,697
You're being buried alive in a box>>  Yes.

4
00:00:16,697 --> 00:00:20,447
Yes, that's me. Should I lay down? >> Oh no, no, no,

5
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:27,197
We don't do that anymore, just just have a seat. And let let me tell you a bit about our billing.

6
00:00:27,197 --> 00:00:35,457
I I charge $5 for the for the first five minutes and then absolutely nothing after that.

7
00:00:35,457 --> 00:00:40,847
How does that sound? >>That sounds great.

8
00:00:40,847 --> 00:00:50,147
Too good to be true. As a matter of fact. >>Well, I can. I can almost guarantee you that that our session won't last the full five minutes now.

9
00:00:50,147 --> 00:00:57,047
We don't do any insurance billing, so you would either have to pay in cash or by check.

10
00:00:57,047 --> 00:01:04,547
>>Wow. OK. >>And I don't make change. >>All right.

11
00:01:04,547 --> 00:01:11,507
And go >> go. what?

12
00:01:11,507 --> 00:01:15,047
>>Well, tell me, tell me about the problem that you wish to address.

13
00:01:15,047 --> 00:01:25,377
>>Oh, OK. Well, I have this fear of being buried alive in a box.

14
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:36,357
I just I start thinking about being buried alive, and I begin to panic >> Has had has anyone ever, ever tried to to bury you alive in a box?

15
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:41,397
>>No, no. But truly thinking about it does make my life horrible.

16
00:01:41,397 --> 00:01:48,657
I mean, I can't go through tunnels or be in an elevator or in a house.

17
00:01:48,657 --> 00:01:55,387
Anything boxy. >> So what what you're saying is you're you're claustrophobic?>>

18
00:01:55,387 --> 00:01:59,227
>>Yes, yes, that's it. >>All right. Well, let's go, Catherine.

19
00:01:59,227 --> 00:02:06,287
I'm a I'm going to say two words you right now, I want you to listen to them very, very carefully.

20
00:02:06,287 --> 00:02:13,177
Then I want you to take them out of the office with you and incorporate them in into your life.

21
00:02:13,177 --> 00:02:19,297
>>So I write them down. >>Well, if it makes you comfortable, it's just two words.

22
00:02:19,297 --> 00:02:24,517
We find most people can can remember them. >> OK.

23
00:02:24,517 --> 00:02:34,227
>>You ready? >> Yes. >>OK. You're there. Stop it.

24
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:38,607
>>I'm sorry, >>stop it. Stop it?>>

25
00:02:38,607 --> 00:02:43,817
>>Yes. S-T-O-P New word I-T

26
00:02:43,817 --> 00:02:47,417
>>So what are you saying?

27
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:56,057
>>You know, it's funny, I say two simple words, and I cannot tell you the amount of people who say exactly the same thing you're saying.

28
00:02:56,057 --> 00:02:59,867
>>I mean, this, you know, this is not Yiddish, Catherine, this is English.

29
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:03,467
Stop it. >>So I should just stop it.

30
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:09,677
>>There you go. I mean, you, you don't want to go through life being scared of being buried alive in a box.

31
00:03:09,677 --> 00:03:15,417
Do you? I mean that it sounds frightening. >> Yes.

32
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:19,107
>>Then stop it. >> I can't I mean, it's been with me since childhood.

33
00:03:19,107 --> 00:03:22,317
>>No, no, no, no, no. We we don't go there.

34
00:03:22,317 --> 00:03:30,157
Just just stop. >> So I should just stop being afraid of being buried alive in a box.

35
00:03:30,157 --> 00:03:40,747
>>You got it. Bingo. Well, it's only been so only been three minutes, so that will be $3.

36
00:03:40,747 --> 00:03:47,037
>>I only have a five, so >> Well I don't I don't make change.

37
00:03:47,037 --> 00:03:51,597
>>Then I guess I'll take the full five minutes. >>Fine.

38
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:56,437
All right. What other problems would you would you like to address?

39
00:03:56,437 --> 00:04:01,347
>>Oh, I'm bulimic. I stick my fingers down my throat.

40
00:04:01,347 --> 00:04:05,617
>>Stop it. What are you a nut of some kind?

41
00:04:05,617 --> 00:04:09,757
Don't don't do that. >>But I'm compelled to.

42
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:13,957
My mom used to call me  fatty- >>Oh, no, no, no, we we don't go there.

43
00:04:13,957 --> 00:04:25,117
>>But I've been having this dream >>No, we don't go there either.>> But my horoscope did say, >> we definitely don't go there just to stop it.

44
00:04:25,117 --> 00:04:30,817
>>But what? What else? >>Well, I have self-destructive relationships with men.

45
00:04:30,817 --> 00:04:35,907
>>Stop it. You want to be with a man, don't you?

46
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:43,697
>>Mm hmm. Yes. >>Well, then stop it. Don't be such a big baby.

47
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:49,057
>>I wash my hands a lot. >>That's all right.

48
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:52,917
> It is? >>I wash my hands all the time.

49
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:58,957
There's a lot of germs out there. Yeah. Don't don't don't worry about that one.

50
00:04:58,957 --> 00:05:06,147
>>I'm afraid to drive. >>Well, stop it. How are you going to get around, get in the car and drive you

51
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:14,037
You cook. Stop it. >>You stop it. You stop it.

52
00:05:14,037 --> 00:05:19,137
>>What's what's the problem Catherine? >> I don't like this.

53
00:05:19,137 --> 00:05:24,357
I don't like this therapy at all. You're just telling me to stop it.

54
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:29,187
>>And you and you don't. You don't like that?c>>No, I don't.

55
00:05:29,187 --> 00:05:33,357
>>So you think we're we're moving too fast, isn't it?

56
00:05:33,357 --> 00:05:37,017
>>Yes. Yes, I do. >>All right.

57
00:05:37,017 --> 00:05:43,107
And let me let me give you 10 words that I think will clear everything up for you.

58
00:05:43,107 --> 00:05:51,607
You want. You want to get a pad and a pencil for this one. >>All right.

59
00:05:51,607 --> 00:06:14,114
>>Ready >> Mhm. >>All right, here are the 10 words. Stop it or I'll bury you alive in a box
