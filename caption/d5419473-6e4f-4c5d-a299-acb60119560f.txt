1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,470
The built environment
around us shapes

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,510
our lives and
influences our health.

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,750
In this module, we'll explore
how built environment

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,460
from the regional
level all the way

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,420
down to the level of the
building that you live,

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,480
or work, or study
in can influence

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,780
your health both
positively and negatively.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,460
Let's consider first
though different types of

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,930
built environment aspects that

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,030
might have an impact
on our health.

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,560
This would include things like,

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,160
how land is used and
transportation availability.

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,850
It would include things like
the design of neighborhoods,

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,010
and the siting of schools.

15
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,300
For example, a very
important factor

16
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,470
that can help determine

17
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,110
the likely outcome
of a neighborhood

18
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,970
economically is the quality

19
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,650
of the school in
that neighborhood.

20
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,070
Good schools tend to
attract economic wealth,

21
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,705
bad schools not so much.

22
00:00:56,705 --> 00:00:59,060
We can also think
about housing quality,

23
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,925
contact with nature,
street design,

24
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:04,400
public spaces that we
have available to us,

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,625
the amount of density of
the population in an area,

26
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,320
and things all the
way down to the level

27
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,150
of sidewalks and
paths that'll let

28
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,980
you travel throughout
the community

29
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,365
without getting into
a motor vehicle.

30
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:17,750
I'd like to draw your
attention to a map

31
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,955
here of the city
of the Ann Arbor.

32
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,865
So this is a land use
or land zoning map.

33
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:25,550
In fact, if we were to look
at the upper right corner,

34
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,080
we would see the School
of Public Health,

35
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,340
where I am right now.

36
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,245
So what do we have on here?

37
00:01:30,245 --> 00:01:32,870
Much of the map is
occupied by yellow colors,

38
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,435
yellow indicating
residential zoning.

39
00:01:35,435 --> 00:01:37,490
But you'll see the
center of the map which

40
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,530
corresponds to downtown
Ann Arbor tends to

41
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,510
have a lot more office space in

42
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,170
pink and commercial space in red.

43
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,560
Ann Arbor does not have

44
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,900
too much industrial
space but we do

45
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,480
have a fair amount of space
dedicated to transportation,

46
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,685
and communication, and utilities.

47
00:01:52,685 --> 00:01:55,270
We're quite fortunate
in Ann Arbor to have

48
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,780
a vast number of recreational
facilities available to us,

49
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,970
those are shown in
green on the map.

50
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,420
We have a relatively small
number of mixed-use zones,

51
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,855
meaning we often have
residential and commercial uses.

52
00:02:07,855 --> 00:02:09,640
This is a best practice from

53
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,500
a zoning perspective in that it

54
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,210
allows people to live

55
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,725
very close to where they
might work or shop.

56
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:17,590
Then we're very fortunate to have

57
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,765
a very small amount
of vacant land.

58
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,760
I do want to
highlight one feature

59
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,860
that university towns
like Ann Arbor are

60
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,705
often beset with which is

61
00:02:25,705 --> 00:02:28,300
the light blue
coloration on here,

62
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,925
which is public or
institutional areas.

63
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:32,055
What you're seeing here is

64
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:35,045
primarily the University
of Michigan footprint,

65
00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:37,670
and a downside from the
city's perspective is at

66
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,260
the University of
Michigan doesn't pay

67
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,850
property taxes in the city.

68
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,980
So that's a large
amount of real estate

69
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,620
that's not basically generating

70
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,335
property tax revenue
for the city.

71
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,200
So let's zoom out to
a regional level.

72
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,340
We might think for example,

73
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,950
the Great Lakes region
here in the United States.

74
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,140
What are some harmful
exposures that

75
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,120
might be associated with
the built environment?

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,575
Well, there things
we've talked about in

77
00:03:00,575 --> 00:03:02,330
other modules in the class;

78
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,655
air contaminants,
water contaminants,

79
00:03:04,655 --> 00:03:07,045
noise, heat, traffic.

80
00:03:07,045 --> 00:03:09,140
But of course, we also
have to acknowledge

81
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,430
the benefits that come with

82
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,930
the built environment
at a regional level,

83
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,190
things like access to

84
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,455
a great health care
service network,

85
00:03:15,455 --> 00:03:19,220
access to an amazing variety
of recreational facilities,

86
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,595
and ways for us to
contact nature.

87
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:25,160
So we do very much struggle

88
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,675
with environmental health issues.

89
00:03:26,675 --> 00:03:28,100
For example, here in the state of

90
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,855
Michigan and in
the nearby region,

91
00:03:29,855 --> 00:03:31,580
something that's been
in the news media

92
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,010
recently is public
water systems in

93
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,915
Michigan that have
tested positive

94
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,390
for a class of
chemicals called PFAS.

95
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,740
So here you can see we're just

96
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,420
zooming in on the
state of Michigan,

97
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,925
the purple sites
noted on the map here

98
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:46,580
are PFAS sites in the
state where there's

99
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,099
greater than 70
parts per trillion

100
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:51,965
of this type of chemical
in groundwater.

101
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,600
You can see also cities are

102
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,770
noted here with gray coloration,

103
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,950
so we often find the cities and

104
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,500
the contaminated groundwater
going hand in hand.

105
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,930
So this is very much
a regional issue of

106
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,880
water contamination
that the state has

107
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,835
to and is trying to address.

108
00:04:07,835 --> 00:04:10,400
If we zoom in now
to the city level,

109
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,500
we have the same
harmful exposures

110
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,420
possible that we saw
at the regional level;

111
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,510
air contaminants, water
contaminants, noise,

112
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,010
heat, traffic, also at

113
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,560
a city level we can
add things like crime.

114
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,200
But we do have very
beneficial exposures

115
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,270
that result from the built
environment in cities,

116
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,790
things like opportunities
for physical activity,

117
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,785
access to healthy food,

118
00:04:30,785 --> 00:04:32,150
hopefully good access to

119
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,884
health care services and
recreational facilities,

120
00:04:34,884 --> 00:04:38,035
and again, intentional
contact with nature.

121
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:40,460
Thinking about how
environmental health

122
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,900
and the built environment
can be viewed

123
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,190
at the city level or giving

124
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,170
example of urban heat islands.

125
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,110
So you may already be aware
that urban regions become

126
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,075
warmer than their
rural surroundings

127
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:51,890
in high temperature
circumstances.

128
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,795
So let's take a look
at the graph here.

129
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:55,490
On the y-axis of the graph we're

130
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,260
looking at increasing
temperature,

131
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,330
and on the x-axis
you can see we have

132
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,550
different types of
built environments

133
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,245
that we might be in for a rural,

134
00:05:03,245 --> 00:05:05,910
to suburban, to a more
urban residential,

135
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,890
to a downtown core area.

136
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,880
Then we have a sequence of
lines drawn upon these.

137
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,145
So I'll highlight the
blue lines first.

138
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:16,400
The solid blue line would
be the surface temperature,

139
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,000
basically the temperature
of the ground at night,

140
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,780
and you can see the
surface temperature

141
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,060
tends to be lowest
in the rural areas,

142
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,730
and rises somewhat to the
downtown core and then

143
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,430
dropped somewhat again
back out to a rural area.

144
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,305
The air temperature is very

145
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:33,185
similar to the surface
temperature at night.

146
00:05:33,185 --> 00:05:34,700
But in the day time, now we're

147
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,950
looking at the reddish lines,

148
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,105
you can see that the
air temperature is

149
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:41,390
relatively flat across
all of these areas,

150
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,020
but what is different is
the surface temperature.

151
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,010
So that very topmost
line on the graph you

152
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,140
can see rises pretty sharply from

153
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,135
the rural areas where
air temperature and

154
00:05:50,135 --> 00:05:52,820
surface temperature
are pretty similar to

155
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,170
the downtown area where there's

156
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,700
a huge increase in

157
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,925
surface temperature
compared to the air.

158
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,340
So as a result,

159
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,000
we have all of these
hot surfaces of

160
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,310
basically man-made
built environment

161
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,260
in this downtown urban core,

162
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,670
and those surfaces tend to hold

163
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,710
their heat and release
it at night which is why

164
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,060
we don't see as much of

165
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,580
a decline in the
nighttime temperatures

166
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,470
in the downtown area as we do for

167
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,675
example in the rural areas.

168
00:06:17,675 --> 00:06:19,670
So this is a
well-known phenomenon

169
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,559
of the built
environment in cities,

170
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:23,360
and it's one that
unfortunately can lead to

171
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,755
many fatalities during
extreme heat waves.

172
00:06:26,755 --> 00:06:29,450
Finally, if we zoom into
the building level,

173
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,590
we can think about lots of

174
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,110
different potentially
harmful exposures there.

175
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,165
We can have things
like high temperature,

176
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:36,440
and high humidity.

177
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,750
If we have both of those
factors present together,

178
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,420
we can get things like you
see in the image here, mold.

179
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,265
We also have light pollution.

180
00:06:43,265 --> 00:06:45,500
We might have indoor
air quality issues

181
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,335
from environmental tobacco
smoke or if we're in

182
00:06:48,335 --> 00:06:50,570
a region that burns
biomass for energy and

183
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,495
heat from smoke from
burning those materials.

184
00:06:53,495 --> 00:06:54,770
We might get exposed to

185
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,190
toxic chemicals or pests
and sanitation issues,

186
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,680
or our building may
be unsafe to begin

187
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,115
with and present injury
risks or crime hazards.

188
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:05,570
But of course, we also have

189
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,580
very beneficial exposures
from buildings.

190
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,140
The primary one
being they provide

191
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,910
us shelter from the elements

192
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,740
and a safe place to raise

193
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,505
and live with our family,
and pets, and friends.

194
00:07:15,505 --> 00:07:17,440
So just to highlight

195
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,330
one potential
environmental health issue

196
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,800
at the building level.

197
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,570
Many people are concerned,

198
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,955
I would say perhaps more
than they need to be

199
00:07:24,955 --> 00:07:27,970
about mold being
present in their homes.

200
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,460
Mold is of course an
aesthetic and certain types

201
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,370
of mold can cause
allergic reactions,

202
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,950
or asthma, or other
respiratory complaints,

203
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,810
but mold is nevertheless
a feature in many homes.

204
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,010
So you can see again

205
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,125
the right combination
of temperature,

206
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,660
and humidity can
basically encouraged

207
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,675
the growth of mold and
potential health impacts there.

208
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,360
So hopefully, in this module
you've gotten a sense that

209
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,770
the built environment
can influence

210
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,600
our health at a very broad scale,

211
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,940
perhaps regionally, but
all the way down to

212
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,960
the individual building that
we live or work or study in.

213
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,110
All of this built
environment is going to

214
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,870
increase our chances of
having impacted health.

215
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,270
What we want to do is design
that built environments

216
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,896
so the impacts are
positive, not negative.
