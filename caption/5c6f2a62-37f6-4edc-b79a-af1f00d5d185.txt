My name is Swati and this is an interview with Josh.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,720
Good morning. So could you tell me a little bit about why you're interested in this position?

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,410
Good morning and thank you for your time. I really appreciate it.

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:23,829
I'm really excited to interview for this really interesting position because I really enjoy how invested the company is in not

5
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:31,200
only safety and ensuring that I mean the bare minimum honestly of any safety position as make sure everyone goes home safe.

6
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:39,280
But I think the company really goes above and beyond and really enjoys and appreciates the work that your just does for our company.

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,060
It's not just an expense, it's something that really matters and it's part of their operations.

8
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:50,559
And in particular, I really enjoy how their company has a focus on sustainability and doesn't necessarily pay lip service,

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,170
but actually incorporates certainly that stuff.

10
00:00:53,170 --> 00:01:00,340
And I really want to be able to kind of combine both my background of sustainability and my graduate degree in drama,

11
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,030
both kind of combine that and be able to grow and use both of those skills.

12
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,070
What would be some of your strengths and weaknesses?

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:18,209
I think I'm really excellent detail and I really enjoy to be able to really dig into the weeds of particular issues, the nuances.

14
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,320
I can figure that out and apply to the situation at hand. I'm exceptionally curious.

15
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,300
I always want to learn more.

16
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,880
I'm in particularly a position like this where there's many different moving parts, different kind of emerging risks and hazards.

17
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:36,390
I really want to be on the leading edge of any kind of new thing that comes along on as per weaknesses of having an interest person.

18
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,450
And how that kind of reveal itself in my work is if I don't have clear expectations for a deliverable or work output.

19
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,860
Alison has become a bit of a perfectionist, or am I being a little bit too much time on a particular design?

20
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,430
However, I've been trying to get better at communicating with managers and the expectations or kind of a format deliverables near the end.

21
00:01:53,730 --> 00:02:02,540
So I can kind of more swiftly achieve what needs to be done. Finally, why do you think we should hire you over other applicants?

22
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:08,780
I think the future of your job is really blending the sustainability ESG components to us,

23
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,820
and I think I really bring that to this company where you don't need to have someone else do the sustainability.

24
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:20,450
That's how I can incorporate those, and I can assist either the ESG team or the address team and really working both of those.

25
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,919
And ultimately, I'm really passionate about protecting not just the environment but also human health

26
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,090
and something I believe in and really do happen for any kind of modern company.

27
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:37,550
And I mean, you know why you really need a strong you just got but I just ultimately think the idea that you're exposed to the culture I.

28
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,240
Thank you so much. Thank you.
