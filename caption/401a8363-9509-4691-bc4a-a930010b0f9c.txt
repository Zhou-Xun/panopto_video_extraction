1
00:00:06,732 --> 00:00:11,649
I'm smiling because I wanna go
through the same set of five questions

2
00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:14,192
about this segment of this course,

3
00:00:14,192 --> 00:00:20,540
the questions I asked myself as I was
designing this piece of this course.

4
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,370
So who, who are you?

5
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,960
Who am I talking to right now?

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,290
Well, you're all students, but
you're different kinds of students.

7
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,300
Some of you are public health students.

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,961
Some of you may already have other
kinds of professional backgrounds.

9
00:00:34,961 --> 00:00:36,930
You have varied experience and training.

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,870
Some of you may be coming
straight from undergraduate and

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,550
you don't have a lot of work experience.

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:47,780
Others of you may have many years of
work experience in different settings.

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,320
You may have been trained to communicate,
or this may be the first time you've ever

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,670
been asked to reflect
about how you communicate.

15
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:00,550
I can also assume some pretty broad
demographic and geographic diversity.

16
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:05,210
So I need to think about
reaching a broad audience.

17
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:10,060
And I can't tailor this, right,
I'm speaking to you through video.

18
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,590
So I need to make sure that my words and
my presentation is appropriate for

19
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,420
that broad diversity,
including thinking about the fact

20
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,250
that I don't know whether English is
the primary language for each of you.

21
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,655
And so I'm at least trying to be
conscious of my work choice and the way

22
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:35,840
in which I'm talking to prevent that
language barrier from being a problem.

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,080
What's the context?

24
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,980
Well, this an online lecture, right?

25
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,300
You're watching this on a screen.

26
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,440
But that also means you're
watching it anywhere, any when.

27
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,960
I don't know where you are,
I don't know when you're watching it, and

28
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,250
I don't know what you were
doing right before this.

29
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:01,390
And that means I need to think about
condensing down points into a chunk

30
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:08,340
that could be watched and understood
by itself, in almost any context.

31
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,600
That might mean, for example,

32
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,180
that I'm gonna repeat some things that
I might have said in other lectures.

33
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,620
Because I can't trust that you had
just watched that earlier lecture,

34
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,702
I have to make sure that it's all here,
right here, right now.

35
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:25,950
Why do you care about this?

36
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,870
Well, let's be honest,
this is part of a course and maybe you

37
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,860
have to take this course, so maybe you're
just taking it because you have to.

38
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,300
But I hope that most of you are at least
somewhat intrinsically interested in being

39
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,700
better professionals.

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,790
That's why you might watch this, that's
why you're taking part in this program.

41
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,660
So that identity of desiring to be
a better professional is something

42
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,570
I need to keep in mind
as I'm talking to you.

43
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:56,297
And so I'm gonna try and tap into
the kinds of things that ought to interest

44
00:02:56,297 --> 00:03:00,718
you, using certain types of examples,
alluding to different types

45
00:03:00,718 --> 00:03:06,506
of professional identities,
as a way to connect to you.

46
00:03:06,506 --> 00:03:08,030
What's my goal?

47
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,780
What am I trying to do in
this segment of this course?

48
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,580
Well, I'll condense it down for you.

49
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,022
I have one goal.

50
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:17,520
I wanna make sure that you know

51
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:23,300
that knowing your audience is the first
step to reaching your audience.

52
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:23,960
And in many ways,

53
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,540
that makes it the most important
step in any communication endeavor.

54
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,470
Lastly, barriers.

55
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,464
What do I have to think about as potential
reasons why this might not work?

56
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:37,192
This one's kinda tricky, but

57
00:03:37,192 --> 00:03:42,330
probably the barrier I've been worried
about the most is overconfidence.

58
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,570
I worry that you think
you've already got this,

59
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,310
that you're already know
how to communicate.

60
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,560
And hence that you are not
paying attention or not

61
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,030
recognizing the opportunities for learning
that I'm trying to build into this.

62
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,720
So my challenge is to try and

63
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,910
convince you that it's a little bit more
complicated than perhaps you think it is.

64
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,418
I also worry about language.

65
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:10,670
I come from a particular background,
English is my first language.

66
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:16,240
And I may or may not always
use the plainest language that

67
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,930
I could to make sure that this lecture is
as broadly understandable as possible.

68
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,040
But I at least try to think about that.

69
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,700
See, even in designing this lecture,
I basically went through the same process.

70
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,380
I asked myself those questions, and

71
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,290
really thought intentionally about who it
was I was reaching out to, why you guys

72
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:45,310
ought to care about it, and what kinds
of barriers you might be facing?

73
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,850
Asking yourself these five questions is
one of the best ways to ensure that your

74
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:55,061
communication is well-designed and has
the best chance of achieving your goals.
