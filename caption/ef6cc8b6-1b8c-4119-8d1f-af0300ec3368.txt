1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:13,260
Jake is confident and I am just going to require that I do have to come back to the Tigers and get back to you.

2
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,060
I thought you were presenting this. Oh, I am.

3
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:38,999
So I don't know. Do you really think I should attend the final?

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,570
And everybody can see. That was interesting.

5
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:53,130
So I keep saying, like, I want your first open mind.

6
00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:02,570
You know, I'm like, think I'll.

7
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:20,200
I'm like this. Right. Okay. If you ask questions like that, James is going to get started him so.

8
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:32,440
Probably saw the message man while he was supposed to come, but she could help me out of this.

9
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,750
So what I'm going to get instead, I got prostate cancer again.

10
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:45,820
Had about five this semester. This is what?

11
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:57,840
Especially with Dimitri Reza Poulos, who's a statistician.

12
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:11,580
And, you know, and he's done a lot of work on software and development of methods for longitudinal survival data together.

13
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:17,189
So he's they put these slides and actually we're going to present it them one day.

14
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:23,990
And that's where I was. Robert sent it to a group of prostate cancer statisticians and Greg describes.

15
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:33,570
So this is about prostate cancer and using sort of some parametric statistical models

16
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:40,080
to try and understand the effects of a potential intervention to the patients to get.

17
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:55,170
So the setting is that these patients who were treated with prostate cancer, prostate cancer diagnosis, they got surgery and then they followed.

18
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:04,970
And then in that follow up, they have PSA measured like a blood draw, an easy task.

19
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:12,779
It's a number. And when that tends, when PSA starts to increase, sort of a sign the cancer might be coming back.

20
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,370
It was removed by the surgery, but it might be regrowing somewhere with this study.

21
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:26,310
And so what gets considered then of a PSA starts to rise is sort of another treatment, salvage therapy as a.

22
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,890
It's either androgen deprivation therapy or radiation therapy, or sometimes other things, too.

23
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:39,890
So these have side effects, which is therapy with the salvage therapies.

24
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:48,600
And so you don't want to just sort of automatically take them. I feel free to ask questions along the way.

25
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,540
Robert Pass Transcript. Interrupt me a little bit to get me to explain things better.

26
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:08,249
So the question is sort of who should get this salvage therapy and when to start and how effective is that really going to be?

27
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:15,840
Looking at that through a third question in this stool, giving some estimate of how effective therapy is.

28
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:27,230
And so for me, looking at just how much of a salvage therapy reduces the risk of metastases, seven justices,

29
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:33,810
whether the cancer spreads to other parts of the body from a prostate and prostate cancer, that's what you die from.

30
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:39,000
And most cancers actually die of metastases. So that's sort of the bad thing.

31
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:47,290
So we have data here from Michigan. This is a data set.

32
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:53,570
3600 patients who were treated. 6033 was treated with surgery.

33
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,150
Had a certain age range and radical perspective is the name of the surgery.

34
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:07,819
And and I excluded some patients who had sort of low scores on some marker and

35
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,049
who had also had ADT androgen deprivation therapy for a long time beforehand,

36
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,480
were already on it. And we have some other variables measured on these people.

37
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,210
So if a PSA is a blood test. Listen this.

38
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,530
You look under a microscope, but how bad does what you precancer look?

39
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,050
And from the biopsy, it looks bad.

40
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:35,830
You get a high Gleason school t stage is some sort of how big of a cancer is locally a trace and a few other things.

41
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:46,429
Okay. Remember, salvage therapy is a little hard to define that sometimes what counts as salvage property.

42
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:54,079
So we sort of use some rules here from a data set as anything that's at least six months after your initial therapy.

43
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:01,790
It's called salvage. If it's stopped after a PSA reading, which is point five or bigger, we call that salvage.

44
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,330
We have a sort of a chart indicated they had a mechanical failure.

45
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,649
That's called salvage. But sometimes patients have actually planned therapy.

46
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:16,160
You know, the plan is to do the surgery and follow it up immediately with generation therapy.

47
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,910
So we don't call that salvage. So it's a little it's a little hard to tell that sometimes.

48
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:28,069
But Jeremy, are these like yours or and like, okay, it's six months after.

49
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:38,270
That's always called salvage or I guess or if I had a no and and anyone who who's also also actually had a PSA at two months

50
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:48,379
point five and that's followed by a surgery Corvette salvage two so a year later and PSA was 0.3 would be considered salvage.

51
00:06:48,380 --> 00:07:00,030
Okay so. And so, you know, this data isn't as perfect as you'd like to salvage.

52
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:03,059
Traffic can be many years after the initial treatment.

53
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,520
And so we had sort of access to medical records to some degree, but you'd see patterns of PSA.

54
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:15,410
So let's say for salvage therapy immediately, not PSA down from some sort of high number to zero, essentially.

55
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,650
So you see patterns of patients who had a major drop.

56
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:24,250
There was no indication of a record. They had suffered terribly because probably they wouldn't be seen.

57
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,100
So we actually had some we made up some salvage trackers.

58
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,089
We developed an algorithm which seemed to work quite well in identifying salvage practice.

59
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,560
So there's some aspects to the data which are less than ideal.

60
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,970
And so here's here's a picture of some.

61
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:50,510
These are four separate patients, though, years since surgery on the horizontal axis and low PSA axis.

62
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:56,030
And so you can see sort of just different patterns. You see a few more of his graphs later.

63
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,830
So this is a very common patterns, goes down to zero and stays there for a long time.

64
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,870
But you see these episodes, you know, sort of slowly rising off of and it's dropping down.

65
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,270
And that's probably some salvage giving back some salvage of that time.

66
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,950
So so this was sort of patents and you can see some different lengths of follow

67
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:20,120
up and irregular spacing between the measurements and all those things again.

68
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:35,170
Okay. So we have this follow up information of a surgical PSA measurements taken serially after surgery and a median of six for each two people.

69
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:41,540
Some people have 20, some people up to. So the number of people who actually get salvaged is pretty small.

70
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,540
271 out of 3600.

71
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:52,460
So it's not like on airplanes, you know, most people don't need salvage men doing fine over my died or something else before I'm a member.

72
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,420
We have some few measurements of, say, aftermath salvaged.

73
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:06,469
I mean, we're looking at metastases is a goal of think about predicting metastases and to salvage therapy help reduce metastases.

74
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:11,090
So this whole dataset of 3600, 102 people have metastases.

75
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:15,590
So it's not a much more likely die before metastases.

76
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,150
So that's very common in prostate cancer, more like to die of something else from a prostate cancer.

77
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:24,739
So we're trying to make models or try to estimate effects of salvage for our people.

78
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,700
We've got so not that much data really on us. We've actually got metastases.

79
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:40,509
So these pictures. So this is just some descriptions of the amount of metastases, the amount of death,

80
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:45,040
these accumulation incidence plots over time since surgery up to 15 years.

81
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:51,820
So just think of this as sort of a number of the counts of a number of people who actually got metastases.

82
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,870
So you can say it's like five something percent or something and people are dying.

83
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,720
20% of Americans are cancer specific.

84
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,060
This is before. This is not non-cancer because it's before metastasis.

85
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,780
Metastasis with death from cancer. This means just because metastasis.

86
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:17,050
This is the occurrence of death. So we threw out death after metastases were just three tons of intestines.

87
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,870
So, so sorry. Okay, so this is. So this is when metastasis happens.

88
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:31,320
So the graph is red graph stuff again. So you can see about 10% of people get get salvage therapy.

89
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,490
And so you saw this graph tell you, you know, as more deaths here.

90
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,500
So, you know, you know, the salvage therapies has side effects and there's a good chance some will die of something else first.

91
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:52,110
And so you don't just want to give everyone from remember that old and sickly already, you know, I still like to die of something else.

92
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,820
So what are we going to be thinking about sort of competing risks and death from other causes here as well?

93
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:04,930
Okay. Services. Observational data. This isn't just for patients who were treated at Michigan.

94
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,590
It's not a city. And there's various biases potentially here.

95
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:16,389
So down the bottom here. So this salvage therapy happens at different times for each person.

96
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:21,400
It depends on a previous PSA. It impacts the future PSA.

97
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,960
PSA is related to the outcome metastasis.

98
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:30,280
So there's all sorts of confounding issues here which are problematic to try and deal with.

99
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:39,129
And so we're doing causal inference. And so I don't know how many of these people have taken this class.

100
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,959
Of course. Listen to anybody that's critical.

101
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:52,160
Critical of this. Well, as a whole, there's a whole world of causal inference which uses which doesn't follow this sort of way of doing things here.

102
00:11:52,160 --> 00:12:00,310
Have I very much in to estimating equations and inverse probability weighting and marginal structural models and a whole machinery there.

103
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:08,400
And we're doing it very different way and may have some standard assumptions and we know if those assumptions are true.

104
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,910
And so one of the assumptions is positivity.

105
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:19,910
So you don't want you want to be. The patients are going to receive salvage therapy.

106
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:27,290
So when you think about sort of a treatment effect for a patient, if there's sort of no chance they would have ever been given salvage trip,

107
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:33,030
you don't really want to think compressed is not relevant really. If a person has zero PSA, they shouldn't get salvage therapy.

108
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:40,410
So that would be what we call non positivity. So that person would have basically zero chance of receiving salvage.

109
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:45,510
So that's that sort of assumption misses the sort of a critical one.

110
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:52,989
Sequential exchange ability as a counterfactual outcome.

111
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:59,440
So counterfactual means, you know, if you got the salvage or you didn't get resolved, just two possible outcomes.

112
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,849
You only get two. Actually, what have actually occurred to be able was a counterfactual one.

113
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:10,660
So you sort of contrast to those things. So counterfactual outcomes independent of a certain treatment condition, your history PSA.

114
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:20,830
So that sort of says to me that the person who gave decided to give a salvage therapy or not doesn't have any.

115
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,130
Extra knowledge about what might happen to a patient.

116
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,059
Open about what they already know about your current PSA. They don't have an upset.

117
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,120
They can't really predict what's going to happen over and above.

118
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,159
What they can predict based on the current PSA.

119
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:43,010
So means to me said during a question on that also conditional on like baseline covariates like Gleason.

120
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,520
Yeah. Yes. Yeah, I guess so. I provided. Oh, okay.

121
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:55,540
And then the positivity assumption. So you mentioned so someone who has zero PSA of zero at two years after surgery would have.

122
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,739
We didn't satisfy the assumption. Did you exclude those patients?

123
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:08,110
And you'll see what we we're going to make causal effects for different groups of patients and some of us would be excluded.

124
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,240
Okay. So this is the setting we have.

125
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,690
This is a measurements to time.

126
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,200
T is no salvage given and that's for sort of a decision point.

127
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,409
Are we going to give salvage to you or not to this particular patient?

128
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:32,230
What sort of appointment? We're going to be looking at the risk of metastasis in the next Delta T seven.

129
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:37,790
So T might be five years. You might be sitting out five years and Delta T might be two years.

130
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:43,820
So my next two years of time, what's the risk of that person actually getting metastases before I die?

131
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,810
You could be three years, one year or whatever.

132
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:55,180
And so by means of a sort of a counterfactual regime, you might think if salvage is not given anywhere,

133
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,160
my next two years compared to if you do give salvage immediately a baton.

134
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:07,530
So that's a contrast. You can request as well.

135
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:15,570
So this is a if you like my model, a little bit of a picture of a model is going to be tons of equations later.

136
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:23,940
So, so t three is this first patient had these PSA values for them.

137
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,990
Green is like a piece of average value.

138
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,650
So that's what the left hand side is. My right hand side is for risk.

139
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:45,610
And so within two years. What would be the risk of metastases if they did not get salvages of blue light and if they did get salvages the red wine?

140
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:53,060
I said, we're going to try and predict those to make a difference here as far as a causal treatment effect for that patient.

141
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:01,990
So we've got to sort of. Estimate these green lines of these blue lines of these red lines and then that sort of forgetting we're doing.

142
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:13,990
Sorry, dermatitis. And so that's a little different than what you might estimate in a randomized clinical trial

143
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:19,899
where like there was a clinical trial in this space and then patients who got randomized to not,

144
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,090
you know, some different type of salvage therapy couldn't.

145
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:29,350
Obviously, a year later, six months later, five years later, opt to write salvage therapy or treatment.

146
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,739
So that delta t you're making the same from both of the time interval over which

147
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,580
you estimate benefit and the time interval over which there's no salvage therapy.

148
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:45,640
Yeah, we're sort of saying you're not allowed as a metric. You're not allowed to have salvage for our page in the next two years.

149
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:52,200
So what's a little bit I mean, the rationale for that as opposed to making Delta T bag like what share is they would they wouldn't wait.

150
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:58,240
They might be willing to wait to hear. Okay. They're not going to be willing to wait five years if a PSA just keeps rising numbers.

151
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:05,440
So we'd say know we're focusing on a specific scenario that's at a fixed time, three years.

152
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:16,630
Okay. So just so this is a little bit about, I think some of that, so addressing some of my questions.

153
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,860
So what's the target group here? So first, a little bit of notation.

154
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:25,630
So we have a time to test the system and a time to death.

155
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,870
TD. This isn't that for the patient.

156
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,310
An H is the history of PSA up to that time.

157
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:40,270
So this whole sequence of PSA values, we have defined counterfactual outcomes.

158
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,630
For a patient who's at 20 now still alive, hasn't had salvaged scrap already.

159
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:55,760
What would happen to them? Salvage property is given acres of all known salvage for every note given April zero.

160
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,760
So this is the best for counterfactuals and this is sort of a standard notation for counterfactuals.

161
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:09,720
Zero one indicator in parentheses. This is a bread and butter for notation and causal inference.

162
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:19,020
Okay. So we have as to outcomes in men. So this is sort of getting a little bit at what's the population we're wanting to make a statement about.

163
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,430
And so this is this is a. Causal.

164
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:29,260
Quantity. So M stands for marginal here.

165
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:38,820
So some probability. Metastasis happens within the next unit of time, given that they're still alive and have not metastases.

166
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:47,810
When we got treatment group one contrasted with the same quality as if I were to get not not the salvage programs the were.

167
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,610
That's the quantity.

168
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:58,969
So this is you know, this is fast over everybody at this point in time, I call it marginal means that for everybody in the population.

169
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:06,410
So some reclaiming this is actually not quite so relevant to the to the person patient of a urologist who's treating a patient.

170
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:13,040
Because this is this isn't for that specific patient. This is averaging over a whole population irrespective of PSA time.

171
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,440
T is equal to zero or to 47.

172
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,830
So it's not really a sort of biased sense of what you want, but it's a, you know, you're going to average over a lot of people.

173
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:29,620
And so it's going to have less variability, I guess, to take more people in your data set,

174
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,969
you take the average of you, you might prefer that smaller, less variance, more bias.

175
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:40,540
So we're going to have a marginal. And then the next one is C conditional.

176
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:45,070
So this is for the patient for very specific questions. This corresponds to a picture I showed you.

177
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:56,320
Given a chance of mass next delta T given still alive and I'm at a person's history and I guess implicitly

178
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,840
that baseline variables as well for that person is if they got salvage or they didn't get salvage.

179
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,430
So that's sort of exactly the quantity you want,

180
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,959
but you're going to have a hot you're going to have a hard time estimating it because it's, you know, sample size.

181
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,420
You're basing that on is just one person, that person or potentially a few other people who look like that person.

182
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:21,340
So some smaller group of patients or higher varies.

183
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:29,280
Or something we've called M.S. marginal condition or something in between.

184
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:35,550
You define instead of average because either the Marshall was averaging or everybody the conditional was just one person.

185
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:44,670
So this marginal conditional is we're going to average just over the people who have PSA above some value

186
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:52,320
say to at that time T so people who might be at risk or might be considered for the salvage party.

187
00:20:52,740 --> 00:21:01,300
So this is sort of an average over a smaller group with everybody but a bigger group and just individual person, sort of a relevant group to choose.

188
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:09,150
So you get sort of, you know, more relevant as bias, but it's still not a it's a bigger group of patients, but it's not a massive group patients.

189
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,440
Okay. So that's the best we can do.

190
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,840
Matt, to answer your questions about who what's the population? This is all at fixed time to formulate a.

191
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:32,130
Okay. So. So we're going to build models and we need these so-called joint joint models for longitudinal time to view event data.

192
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,860
Talk about those. So here's where.

193
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,070
A little bit of a pick struck a picture of a joint model in action.

194
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,490
So this is, if you like, a PSA. So there you go.

195
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:54,950
This is being followed and you really get measurements of PSA and some of the lines smooth curve, and then you get measurement there on top of that.

196
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,020
And that's what you get to observe.

197
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:04,270
And then as you go along, the hazard at any time, say here four and a half years for that patient is for red light.

198
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:12,430
So that evolves, too. So we've seen it goes up has come up because they went down it goes down some of the red line.

199
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,400
So some function of the green line.

200
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:22,210
So that sort of linking them together, linking together along digital model of a hazard, which is the hazard of metastasis.

201
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:34,660
And so these morals. Mathematically made to completely specify the joint distribution of the PSA, time to medicine, time to death.

202
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:40,750
And so when you're sort of making use of sequentially,

203
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:50,140
no ability to allow us to deal with what might seem like a problem here is very patients who get the salvage therapy,

204
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,470
very ones that are doing doing poorly in terms of a PSA rising.

205
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,540
So you might think that's necessarily going to mess up your estimate of the parameters.

206
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:08,790
But this sequentially no ability assumption allows you to actually ignore the mechanism of watch when people started to salvage for a reason.

207
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:16,720
Some math. I'm not. You could also maybe interview. Okay.

208
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:20,550
So so it was different models here.

209
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,990
That's going to be a model for a longitudinal PSA pattern.

210
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:30,780
There's going to be a model for the causes of metastases, and it's going to be a model that has to specify those three sub models.

211
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:37,129
So PSA. If these are increases, the patient may receive some sort of pain.

212
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,480
So we're going to just some notation I guess you saw is going to add over time.

213
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,420
The patient is I received salvage for our. Do you remember?

214
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:51,040
It's only a small fraction of that. So for others, it's just figure with this infinity.

215
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,410
And after when salvage therapy happens, PSA will drop.

216
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,760
It's sort of just sort of dead since we sort of. Yeah. What the treatment does and.

217
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,740
But it may start to rise again off after the drops.

218
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:10,739
So here's his the model and this is sort of a general form.

219
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,870
So this is a mixed model and you might be doing 653 or something.

220
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,640
You've done that. It's a sort of somewhat of a standard mixed model, but with this change point of salvage.

221
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,190
So before salvage is a, you know,

222
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:31,769
a true curve plus measurement error minus fixed effects and random effects describing sort of patterns and we actually use spline.

223
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:37,080
So we have about five or six random effects from a very flexible model which can follow the data.

224
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:43,350
So that's before salvage of an after salvage is sort of a new, new trajectory.

225
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:49,680
It's a continuation of the old trajectory plus shifts in the way shifts.

226
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:57,000
See some details in a minute. So there's a new set of random effects for the post salvaged time as well.

227
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,640
So we have random effects before, random effects after.

228
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:09,989
So that's the model x I of T there's covariance that change with time or that's just a is a spliced line of sort of as a whole bunch of,

229
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,990
you know, T.A. squared and t cube type type things.

230
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,820
Yeah, it's is a bit general and I'll show you examples in a minute.

231
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:23,069
But again, it could also be Agent Gleason baseline.

232
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:27,500
Things didn't have to depend on time. Okay.

233
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:32,070
So this is a big mishap as it ends up being quite a big matrix because I got about.

234
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:40,570
I think six, maybe six random effects, implying a couple of random effects afterwards, some specific matrix and.

235
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:50,570
Okay. So this is so Dmitri's is much better at putting slides together on what I am saying.

236
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:56,390
His his PSA evolved but passing through this is a services ETF in the back to the.

237
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:02,150
This is a like of true. Businesses that feel that thing so true.

238
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:06,380
And what you actually get to observe, sort of a noisy version of that plus measurement error.

239
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,370
So they're being followed. PSA is starting to rise a little bit and oops.

240
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:17,900
At that point in time, I decided to have salvage therapy. So essentially the model says off to salvage.

241
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:26,120
After that time, you can have a continuum. If you want to help salvage this is what you continue on.

242
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,410
But if you do have salvage, you have a new. Semester model.

243
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:48,020
And okay, so this is just putting in words for salvage resource non-linear PSA trajectory based on spines and off to salvage this sort of a change,

244
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:52,520
a drop in PSA and a new sort of linear term in the slope.

245
00:26:53,810 --> 00:27:04,129
Okay. So that's the model I remember is two events can happen metastases which you're interested in or death,

246
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:12,980
which is a competing event and they have hazard models. So as a model for metastases is sort of linked to.

247
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:21,470
Potentially these models are linked to this longitudinal PSA pattern and linked to make up I've had salvage happy or not.

248
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,920
I'd also like to relate it to baseline covariance formulas here.

249
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:30,380
Okay. So this is a model for the metastases.

250
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:38,540
So as I said before, metastasis is sort of related to PSA as a sign of cancers requiring some hazard

251
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:43,640
of metastasis of an action at the time related to some aspect of a PSA.

252
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:55,220
So the sort of assess the hazard before salvage facelift sort of site model, baseline covariates plus some function of underlying PSA.

253
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,360
Then off to salvage.

254
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:10,870
So think about how long after salvage term there is a term which takes sort of a function of the current PSA, which is the salvage is noted by either.

255
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:17,660
Okay. So there's a lot of choices here. These models come. It makes a difference.

256
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:21,860
Which choices? Okay.

257
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:26,809
So we have these forms. We don't just I mean, we could just put it in my current PSA,

258
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:31,760
but maybe we want to be a little more flexible and have some sort of function of a PSA or a PSA history.

259
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,320
So F and G would just be identity function, but it could be more complicated.

260
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:48,870
And so they have something functional. And so one option here saying that the current hazard might depend on the value of PSA.

261
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:57,089
So it's a measurement error, I'm afraid, in which it's changing the derivative basis of formulas I have for all of these.

262
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:06,540
So I'm linking the PSA pattern to the hazard in a variety of different ways to provide actual value of derivative.

263
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:20,380
So pictorially it's not only the value of PSA but it's sort of a slope determines but has sometimes.

264
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,920
Or we could have a cumulative effect. This is just saying.

265
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:38,820
Amazing. So he has it depends on the sort of area under the curve so that the whole history of

266
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:45,760
average previous value of PSA in terms of the hazard at this time depends on them.

267
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:58,920
The amount of the average before. And so, you know, it was a few weeks later and a lot of these models and some choices.

268
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,670
And so we tried a few different ones.

269
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:12,820
So we tried all these has a before salvage of max depends on the slope and things like that.

270
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:16,360
And after salvage, you have choices too, of what you could do.

271
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,850
You could do some of the current value or just sort of slope itself or change.

272
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:26,130
Lots of choices. Man.

273
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:33,360
This is def. So we're saying these. Fascism is definitely not from cancer free, not for metastasis.

274
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,600
We didn't die for prostate cancer, so we didn't say it.

275
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:42,000
This model means that the only thing we have is sort of baseline covariates, like how old they are,

276
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:52,620
how much comorbidities and potentially a change in the hazard has after salvage therapy because it's toxic in some sense in my own life,

277
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:59,159
because it gives you heart disease or something like that, probably that's more or less that's a real, real outcome.

278
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,700
And metastasis, the probability of death of the causes you.

279
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:12,459
Okay. So there's some mafia services, a quantity we're interested in for subject.

280
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:21,580
I bet if they were to get treatment, I got some metastases in my next delta t given.

281
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:27,770
History and baseline covariance after time. T So this is what quantity we want.

282
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:33,680
We have models which involve parameters, feedback and random effects, which I'm calling you here.

283
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:42,590
So we get to this quantity. You have to integrate alpha for random effects and dismisses the Bayesian estimation scheme.

284
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:51,740
So you can see here we've integrated out. You are an fetus of feet, a posterior distribution of feet.

285
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:59,390
Given the data, the menu here is random effects of a need for conditional distribution of a random effect.

286
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:04,940
If that person is still alive, given their history, given the acts of Messina.

287
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,870
So this is sort of just technically how you get that.

288
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:19,760
So this is a mess to do something as integrations, integrating out drivers, these integrals have to be done in some sort of numerical way.

289
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,810
So we want to follow the integration path.

290
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:29,509
So that means just like lots of random draws of something, on average, it's become an integration.

291
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:36,920
And so we first sample feeder from a posterior distribution when we saw memorandum of fact from this distribution.

292
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,430
Then once you've go back, you can calculate the probability.

293
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:49,800
Which is a messy formula. Very messy formula that's calculable when you do that.

294
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:55,260
Capital L times an average integration, you get to get a number.

295
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,450
You're interested in the next step. That was for one treatment time.

296
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:02,210
And we do also figure example treat the numbers of whether they did not get stalbridge.

297
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:12,900
Your questions have dried up, Matt. For now. Okay, here's one.

298
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:20,879
So it's therapy duration. Like when you were talking about that PSA after salvage, like a lease up front.

299
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,060
Salvage therapy can range from six months to 36 months.

300
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:27,540
Yeah, seemed like that to impact the PSA model.

301
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,209
Well, I guess we're. Yes. Salvage isn't just a one thing.

302
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:37,620
I mean, some people get radiation, some people get anti-depression therapy.

303
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,630
Some people computers have actually done work out.

304
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:47,180
And when you have an agent deprivation therapy as a pill or an injection on the shelf, but you get once,

305
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:51,240
once a month and so you can choose to get it for three months or six months or two years.

306
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:56,010
And we're just lumping it all together, sort of a heterogeneity.

307
00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:01,980
You might see a PSA pattern will be captured by the random random effects for a person.

308
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:05,400
So that will, you know, absorb some heterogeneity that.

309
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:14,720
I guess that when we say salvage trip is like what's happening as practiced in Traverse.

310
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:26,309
Okay. So that was from the individual menu. This is v superscript m right.

311
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:30,240
For marginal. So we just average about treatment effects for everybody.

312
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:38,100
Give us a marginal. If we looking at a subset of patients who were in MSI, just average of a subset of patients.

313
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:47,070
And. I just happen to have some subset of patients get more emotional part of this.

314
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:55,800
And then there's. We want variances to hear services.

315
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,510
This is so it gets even more tricky to somehow.

316
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:07,710
Think about this data was a different realization of the data about some component of a variance.

317
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,389
Then we've got the posterior distribution of the parameters too.

318
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:19,660
And so this is a paper by Allianz Dominici, which sort of lays out a sort of a way to approach that.

319
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,750
So this again involves Monte Carlo integration.

320
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:29,200
I'm not going to go into details. Anyway. So anyway, so I'm going to show some results and more data here.

321
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:34,100
So this is plots of 12 patients.

322
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:40,070
These are your time from surgery, five, ten years and PSA.

323
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:45,410
You can see different patterns here. So this is, you know, this top three here.

324
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:50,780
That's a very common response for cells. If you remove the prostate, you don't have a prostate.

325
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:56,600
You shouldn't really be producing any signs of a value of that test should be basically zero.

326
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:00,950
So that's what happens in a lot of patients and other patients.

327
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:09,889
You see as long as zero this person had. Actually measurements of PSA started to rise above the red red figures when they got salvaged.

328
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:14,620
For our opinion, you can see. The parents tried to drop visitation.

329
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:18,190
It dropped dramatically because it wasn't very hard to start living it.

330
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:23,500
We don't have much data from salvage. It's not one where I drop dramatically.

331
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:31,960
As a patient where? Actually we do have a stadium and I chose not to have salvage for our party despite increasing PSA.

332
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:36,659
So if you can see heterogeneity, you can see heterogeneity.

333
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:44,220
Even the amount of you draw a pattern of a people's choice to have of salvage therapy or not when it looks.

334
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:53,780
I really need salvage for our personal risk of prostate cancer, of getting metastases in the next five years.

335
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:57,950
It's probably pretty low. Okay. So there's are some patterns.

336
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:05,420
In his small. And. I guess people who didn't get salvage.

337
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:09,680
I'm going to actually show some individual data a minute from before 90.

338
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:13,490
So this is someone who has, you know, steadily rising pace for whatever reason.

339
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,860
Perhaps I would try and. Miss Tyson.

340
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:24,380
327. So it was just a message to disperse, to show up.

341
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:31,380
This skyline model we have is sort of adapting rather well to the to the date

342
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:35,790
express which was joining group through line through the data for effectively.

343
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:50,310
And and you know, it's capturing the blue has the effect of capturing post or salvage trajectories as well.

344
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,740
So bizarre estimates for sort of.

345
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:02,250
Okay, so the first one is for patient for 90. And this is vis a vis causal effect.

346
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:07,530
So if we just look at top line from a. So this is a 1% change here.

347
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:13,670
This is if you were to get the salvage of five years, nine years or 13 years.

348
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:18,749
So just just get back to the picture again. 90 is here.

349
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:22,290
So. So in five years, they basically have PSA equals zero.

350
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,210
Nine. So we've got increasing PSA and it's pretty high here.

351
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:37,809
And so the model estimates for that chance of improvement in the outcome of metastases.

352
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:41,379
If I were to get salvage therapy peaking, not getting salvage appropriate time.

353
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:46,120
Five. Nothing with you at time nine.

354
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,570
It would be 2%. Time 14.

355
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:54,820
It would be 3% improvement in. 1.3 probabilities.

356
00:38:55,070 --> 00:39:00,340
Oh three Probability improvement having salvaged not only salvage of probably maximal experience.

357
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:07,300
Okay. So what's the next? So the next one is three 2327 at the same.

358
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:17,330
What sort of pattern? If I had an increase in PSA as well, when PSA starts to get bigger for them, we predict to higher.

359
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,990
It's pretty small, but a non-zero treatment effect.

360
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:31,760
But then these bottom ones, this is the marginal we average of absolutely everybody in the population at time five,

361
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:37,969
even if they had a PSA equals zero. So I remember I told you, you get smaller variants.

362
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:44,570
So you do you get smaller, smaller intervals where it's not a very useful estimate for this person.

363
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:51,290
And I mean, this is the sort of in between long rights of people who are at risk at that time.

364
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:54,769
Five. So you get some smallish treatment.

365
00:39:54,770 --> 00:40:01,069
The fact that these numbers are small, obviously a big difference, 1% difference,

366
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,300
but their risk of metastasis is pretty small anyway, so it's hard to backtrack.

367
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:15,460
Yeah, I think so. Why is the current PE for 90 the.

368
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:24,300
I guess the treatment effect is growing over time, but for the marginal conditional, it's like moving to the right.

369
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,500
You know, that seems weird to me. So it's not.

370
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,129
So this is this is a group of patients throughout time.

371
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:38,430
Five school life time. Five to.

372
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,220
So just control diminishing numbers of patients going into this.

373
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:51,950
Okay. And I don't I don't really know why, but it's not it's not it's not remarkable, in fact, for this patient.

374
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:55,970
As a matter of fact, for the rest of this patient, for nine, he doesn't have a value.

375
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:59,149
Isn't part of the group who are averaging over time.

376
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:02,890
Right this is only patients who have PSA above two events on.

377
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:08,110
You have 10 minutes getting towards the end.

378
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:14,830
Okay. So let's go over ways you can think about this.

379
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:26,570
Just have a actually think about death afterwards. So bring that into the afternoon, just as if you're interested in that multistate model.

380
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:30,650
So this is sort of a multistate model you might think about. So what?

381
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,640
We did was. We had.

382
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:43,250
You had all of the stuff, but we didn't bother with. This hour was basically what we just about everyone knows about.

383
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,780
Salvage. We could model as a state.

384
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:54,020
We had various models of state as well as there was different ways you could think about sort of setting up a model.

385
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:00,230
So all. So this is Dimitri is a policies package.

386
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:07,820
Works very hard to make this sort of flexible and friendly, and it's sort of added some stuff to it as a result of this project.

387
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:16,080
There is a shiny app. And so I think I just I can carry on.

388
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:24,959
I can stop two of the four getting the equation of the quantity or estimating for those marginals.

389
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:32,370
But the in the data, I assume that, you know, 2% to patients with similar PSA may be both rising.

390
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:41,700
If one of them 60 and healthy, they're more likely to initiate salvage therapy than someone who's 82 and has heart disease and diabetes.

391
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:53,110
Yeah. So. Your model for metastases is just like a cause specific it's in the it's modeling

392
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:57,730
the hazard of metastases in the absence of the competing risk of death.

393
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,990
But in your data, there's that competing risk of death.

394
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:05,840
Clinicians can estimate that to some extent, patients have some knowledge about it.

395
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:09,480
So we have a most by age, though, right. Have anything besides it?

396
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:14,680
We have comorbidities. Oh, you do? Okay. Sorry I missed that. Which am I missing?

397
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:19,460
In about 40% of a people. So we had to do some imputation strategy to fill them in.

398
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,930
Okay, so those differences in probabilities,

399
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:30,190
those are differences in the absolute risk of metastases within some time interval between the two counterfactual.

400
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:33,880
Okay. Okay. Allowing them to die from other causes.

401
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:40,750
In the meantime, that might be different depending on what make up the salvage camp you didn't get the salvage from.

402
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,809
And he said this I just spaced.

403
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:54,250
But you talked about these different functions of the I have t the PSA trajectory considering the slope and the cumulative effect,

404
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:59,240
which one did you end up using for these results? Were there any differences between them?

405
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:05,890
So we. Yes. So you're talking about the models we used in the hazard part of this one?

406
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,460
Yeah. These sort of these sort of these sort of options, right?

407
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,420
Yeah. We actually did them all. Oh, I'm not sure which one I'm presenting.

408
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:23,520
I mean, you can do things like B, C or D, C to sort of assess which fits best.

409
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,950
And so they do. One of them does appear to fit better than the others, and that's the one we used.

410
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,200
I was going to ask if they were different, but I guess they were.

411
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:36,659
They're not they don't give dramatically different answers, but they are they are slightly different.

412
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:41,190
But there was some attempt to assess the appropriateness of a model or a physical.

413
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,050
So it's a little work here. Didn't work for me at which you set up an app.

414
00:44:53,100 --> 00:45:10,340
Mental work. So it's sort of you can you can play around with intervening on it.

415
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:14,420
You can grab a patient from a data set in a patient for 90 days.

416
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:18,600
What if we gave him a sandwich for two years or five years or seven years?

417
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:23,870
What sort of a projected path to say? What's a predicted of that person and things like that.

418
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:31,040
So this is a little bit about there's a lot of computation here. So it's a Bayesian scheme.

419
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:35,570
So Hastings steps in here. I actually don't know what this is.

420
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:43,670
I can give an algorithm some something clever to make these things work fast and converge better and be stable.

421
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:48,950
Because this is a model with a lot of parameters in there, a lot of random effects is quite challenging.

422
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,520
Doesn't parallel things on sentences about mattresses.

423
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:03,780
Is there like a minimum number of PSA values that the patients are gonna have to be able to estimate all of these parameters?

424
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:11,870
Do you exclude people who have, like, less than like sleep? I mean, it gets absorbed by the random effects of it.

425
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:20,360
Just I mean, are many patients don't have more than one value of PSA after the salvage.

426
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:22,640
Right. Some have programs aside,

427
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:31,290
but we're still going to just sort of predict their random effect from by drawing from a distribution of a random effects in the population user.

428
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:45,000
So there's a lot of computation here. This is the argument for why you can ignore the selection.

429
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:54,660
So this is a, if you like, a posterior distribution for all the parameters you might have.

430
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:58,979
So this is a prime it is massive. This is a random fact.

431
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:05,430
Some visa parameters we're specifying for model for whether you take salvage therapy or not.

432
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:13,240
So you can imagine there is a model for that reporting, that model P and it sort of indicated whether you took salvage for every.

433
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:22,709
And so a full likelihood is the product of models for Y and T, which is what I gave you.

434
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:34,250
I'm the model for the ascertainment. And you know, and this is sort of put it in discrete time, some ascertainment might depend on sort of a PSA and.

435
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:37,260
History, PSA and covariance.

436
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:45,889
And that might also depend on the time and the baseline covariance parameters of random effects and then all the prices and stuff.

437
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:49,520
So. But, but this term. What we.

438
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:54,110
You know, it has UI in it. So UI is a problem.

439
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:59,629
That's sort of the a factor that what we're trying to do is like basically say we can factor that term out.

440
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:06,470
So we don't need to think about it. But it could be problematic because it has some of the same terms as saying random terms in the app.

441
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:13,160
But the sequential ignore ability assumption sets the chance of getting the.

442
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:19,989
So much therapy. Given all this stuff doesn't actually depend on the random effect.

443
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:26,680
That depends on the observed value of PSA so that the complicating bit UI drops out.

444
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:30,700
So that factors out of a likelihood. So we get to ignore that. The thing which people.

445
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:35,040
Worry about in the setting with the very people who are getting the soundtrack people,

446
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,040
ones who are actually sick out and said, I got to do worse anyway.

447
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:42,550
So that's we're saying this. We capture all that information of interest.

448
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,410
You are just playing a role. All right.

449
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:51,490
Sorry. There is that assumption festival there. Probably not.

450
00:48:55,210 --> 00:49:03,450
That the traditional causal inference, people would hate this sort of information.

451
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:09,870
So I think I'm going to make the questions right.

452
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:27,800
You conclude. Just so much better.

453
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:44,570
Know that your last one that I know this was supposed to be a long time ago.

454
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:52,680
I know that.
