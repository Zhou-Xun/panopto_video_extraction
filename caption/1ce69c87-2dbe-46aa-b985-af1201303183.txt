1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:15,060
What now? We were hopeful. We were coming back to 235 and have a break, then we'll come back for next session.

2
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,620
Okay. Great. Thank you. It's.

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,450
It's unbelievable. How does that happen? Oh.

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:33,300
Yeah. I got.

5
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,250
Yeah, that's.

6
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:48,520
Other guest speakers. Excuse me. So, yes, I'm going to I think I might have to do that.

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:58,260
I think it's just like getting medical treatment.

8
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,940
But Will. The second person.

9
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:09,230
I just watched the third person for a year. Yeah.

10
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:13,700
The second would be like, Oh, he's going to be.

11
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:22,610
Yeah. And so most of our lectures would be in person because they are from your friend.

12
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:32,730
So let's say the only thing is that time didn't stop him.

13
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,980
He's from Philadelphia. Oh, yeah.

14
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:52,650
So I think that right now we are not in New York.
