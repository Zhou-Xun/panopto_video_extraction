1
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:12,970
So some day you are gonna end up
being an organizational spokesperson.

2
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,160
Even if you don't think so,
trust me, this is gonna happen.

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,860
And the reason why it's gonna happen,
is some day, you're gonna be the leader

4
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:27,240
of a group, maybe it's a small team,
maybe it's a huge organization.

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,278
And you're gonna need to speak
on behalf of that group.

6
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:35,630
Or maybe someday you
are gonna be the one who has

7
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:41,950
the critical piece of information about a
project, about a public health emergency,

8
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:48,340
about the organization's finances,
whatever it is.

9
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:53,880
Or maybe, some day you're just gonna
be the right person in the right place.

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:00,340
You're gonna be the person who's there,
when the big thing happens.

11
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:05,730
Whatever the cause, trust me,
at some point, you're gonna end up having

12
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:12,090
to have to speak in the moment,
in a crisis, on behalf of others,

13
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,930
to communicate broadly the most critical
information at that moment in time.

14
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,020
Now, whether you want to
take those kinds of roles or

15
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,730
not, the honest truth is you need
to be ready for when it happens.

16
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,490
And this is a very different
kind of communication

17
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,480
than stuff where you get to
plan in detail, and wordsmith,

18
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,530
and choose exactly what it is
you wanna say way in advance.

19
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:45,030
Because the very definition of a crisis
is there's little preparation,

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,100
at least in the sense of the content,
there's little preparation.

21
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,470
But health crises happen all the time,
right?

22
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,650
This isn't something that
we've never seen before.

23
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,100
So there is a way that which we
can anticipate the kinds of things

24
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,670
where we might need to be talking to
broad populations about a crisis.

25
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,520
Now, the kinds of health crises that
I'm talking about might be things like

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,900
outbreaks of disease.

27
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,830
Let's say there's a food contamination
issue that needs to be talked about.

28
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,125
People need to throw away food.

29
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,360
Or they need to not visit
a particular restaurant, or

30
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,888
they need to contact people if
they have eaten certain things.

31
00:02:23,888 --> 00:02:28,950
Maybe it's an infectious disease problem,
influenza outbreak,

32
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,990
or a hepatitis outbreak,
or something like that.

33
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:37,000
Different kind of communication,
I mean different type of crisis.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,690
Discoveries of contamination,
maybe there's been been an oil spill or

35
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:48,390
some kind of release of contamination
into the air or into the water.

36
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,570
People need to know about this.

37
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:55,930
Maybe we've just discovered that there is
exposure to risk, like there's a product

38
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:01,960
that might leech a particular
chemical into a water supply.

39
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,120
Or maybe it just is
recalled because it fails.

40
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,389
Then, of course, there's the natural
disaster crisis, right, floods,

41
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:13,030
earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanoes, etc.

42
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,358
And then,
there's a different type of health crisis.

43
00:03:17,358 --> 00:03:22,100
This is a really unfortunate and
common one, times when we discover that

44
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,430
the science and
the recommendations that public health or

45
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,610
medicine has been giving us for
a long time, they're just wrong.

46
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:36,900
We learn new information, and
we discover our guidelines need to change.

47
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,350
And so that's a different kind of crisis,
but it's still a health crisis.

48
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,650
And even if we're not
talking about health crises,

49
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,440
there's organizational crises
that happen all the time.

50
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,900
Let's say someone important has died or

51
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,940
been arrested,
has a big impact on the organization.

52
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,030
Or maybe the organization's
finances are in trouble.

53
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:08,360
You didn't get the grant or the contract,
or you're not growing fast enough.

54
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,290
Or, Your loan is coming due, who knows?

55
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,380
But there's some kind of problem.

56
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,765
Or maybe there's some new,
sudden challenge or

57
00:04:18,765 --> 00:04:21,966
directive that is coming down from
on high that everyone to stop,

58
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:25,900
we've gotta change gears,
and do something different.

59
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,680
Whatever it is, it there's a crisis.

60
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,090
Notice the common thread here.

61
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,310
Across all these different
health situations and

62
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,500
organizational situations,
the common thread of a crisis is changed.

63
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:48,160
Something is different now than it once
was, and everybody has to react to it.

64
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,440
Now, when something has changed,
this change evokes fear.

65
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,490
Fear because I don't know what's coming.

66
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,760
There's uncertainty.

67
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,460
I might be at risk.

68
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,500
I don't know what happened.

69
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,870
I don't know what this means for me.

70
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,690
And I don't know what to do.

71
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,980
And that fear and

72
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:15,540
uncertainty are the common thread of
people's responses to crisis situations.

73
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,950
Fear and uncertainty also mean that
crisis moments are a question of trust.

74
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:27,370
I don't feel as safe and
secure as I just did before this moment.

75
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:33,180
And so you're gonns have to worry about,
is the audience going to trust you?

76
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,020
Who do they trust?

77
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,670
Do they trust anybody in this moment?

78
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:42,920
And how can we help them trust
that you're trying to help?

79
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:51,340
So crisis communications at their core
about two things, facts and emotions.

80
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,730
Now you may thing that the most
important thing here is the fact, and

81
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,610
you would be absolutely completely wrong,
cuz it's not.

82
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,170
Yes, you do need to have good facts.

83
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,480
And you are trying to
communicate those facts.

84
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,360
But by far in a crisis,

85
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,490
the most important thing is to address
the emotions of the audience, that fear,

86
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:18,240
that uncertainty, that question of
trust that I was talking about before.

87
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,580
When you recognize that your goal is
to speak to the person to what they're

88
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:29,580
feeling, then you can help to shape
the way in which the facts are delivered.

89
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,250
So that they're gonna be willing
to hear them and respond to them.

90
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,230
So how do you do that?

91
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,340
Well honestly, it's not that different.

92
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,640
You have to fall back on
the basic principles.

93
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,930
Who are your audience?

94
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:48,330
What do they need in this moment?

95
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,900
What is their information needs?

96
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:57,160
What do they need to do, or think, or
feel right now in this crisis moment

97
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:03,200
in order to be safer, to be healthier,
to be able to move on?

98
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,440
And when you think about your audience and
your goals, what's your central message?

99
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:15,080
What is the one thing that they need
to take away from this moment in time.

100
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,630
In a crisis,
the important thing is not what you know.

101
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:22,960
You could know tons of
relevant information.

102
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,870
Doesn't matter.

103
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,950
It's what the audience needs.

104
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:32,774
And by focusing in on that question,
being clear about your purpose,

105
00:07:32,774 --> 00:07:36,523
will help you achieve that goal.
