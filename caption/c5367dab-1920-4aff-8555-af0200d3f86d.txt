1
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:25,650
Yes. There.

2
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:32,170
I. You don't have to die.

3
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:39,190
Right? Good morning. I hope you had a restful weekend.

4
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:51,310
Um, so today we start a two session discussion on a second type of study design.

5
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:56,049
Third types study design and their observational studies.

6
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:06,110
And these are case control studies. So again, is this a reminder of what we have done and where we are?

7
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:23,120
Lay here. And I thought today I would try something, which is perhaps I'd like to give you the scope of the essence of what we are going to review.

8
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:34,070
Because, you know, I realize sometimes we may get lost into so many technical details and and sometimes the actual lessons of,

9
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,900
you know, the big picture of what we are trying to understand might be lost.

10
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,020
So maybe I'll tell you what this is about.

11
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,750
But the main issues are and then we mean if you want, you can leave.

12
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:57,020
And then then we will delve into the those sort of details that sometimes are more convoluted.

13
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,490
Okay. So let's see.

14
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,320
Well, last time we talk about budget studies.

15
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:19,520
Right. And the essence of the cohort study design really is that you have to recruit a bunch of people, usually quite a few of them.

16
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:26,510
You have to make sure that at baseline they are at risk of developing the outcome.

17
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,320
Right. Um, meaning they don't have the outcome already.

18
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:36,170
And then you typically assess exposure at baseline.

19
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,910
Right. Then you follow them.

20
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:49,120
So if your exposure has two levels exposed and unexposed in a way you would have two cohorts a cohort of exposed and a cohort of and exposed.

21
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,530
And within each cohort you will. Periodically ascertain who has developed the new count.

22
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:08,620
Count below. But the key is that from some perspective, you always start with people who do not have the outcome.

23
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:14,570
And in home you have measured the exposure when you begin the observation.

24
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:20,510
So you go from exposure? Well, that's the essence of it.

25
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:27,590
I would say that. Now. In real life and practical.

26
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:35,510
Sometimes there are outcomes that are actually very rare, very infrequent.

27
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,440
And believe it or not, you know, even outcomes like cancer, in fact,

28
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,230
some of the cancers that are relatively frequent at the population level are actually relatively rare.

29
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,120
Meaning for us to study them in large numbers.

30
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:58,750
They are, in fact, relatively rare. You know, even breast cancer at the population level is relatively rare.

31
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:07,839
So that that might be a problem if we want to conduct a cohort study to make causality in friends,

32
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,879
meaning to identify causes or exposures that may cause those types of outcomes.

33
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,040
Why? Because if there are so few.

34
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:28,460
That we expect we would have to recruit a very large number of people to just be able to capture those few occurrences, those few events.

35
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,140
Right. So that's one problem.

36
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:39,550
The other problem is that also some of those events and actually cancer is also a good example, may take a long time to develop.

37
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:51,400
So again, this compounds the problem of having a large number of people to be followed because now we have to follow them for a very long time.

38
00:05:52,300 --> 00:06:03,390
Right. So. Doing a cohort study for such outcomes is inefficient, but some people have done it, actually.

39
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,580
But, you know, it's very, very high cost. And.

40
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:18,430
The more complex the operation, the more likely there might be problems that actually might translate themselves into bias.

41
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:25,300
They may give you the wrong answer. You know, it's hard for many people to continue on their follow up for so long, etc.

42
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:36,250
Okay, so there is one alternative for those outcomes, and the alternative is to do a case control study.

43
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:47,680
So what's the essence of a case control study? As opposed to a cohort study in which you begin.

44
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:55,100
With everybody not having the outcome. You measured the exposure and then you follow them.

45
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,250
In the case control study, you are actually going to start from the outcome.

46
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,680
That's the big difference. We've got states.

47
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:16,860
So you actually are going to identify some people who already have the outcome of interest.

48
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:24,100
And then you are going to identify a group of people who do not have the outcome of interest.

49
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:30,460
Then you are going to ascertain the exposure.

50
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:38,930
In both groups. And then you are going to compare the two groups with respect to their exposure to status.

51
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,390
Because most of the exposures we are interested in.

52
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:52,260
You know, happen before the outcome. That's that's a critical condition for us to be able to make causal inference, right.

53
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:59,210
The exposures have to precede causes have to precede consequences or events.

54
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:07,200
Right. The issue or one of the main issues we case control is that is that by beginning with the outcome,

55
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:13,560
you usually have to go back in time to find out what the exposure status was.

56
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:22,490
And that brings about problems. Because in many of these studies.

57
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:32,020
You might actually be. Stuck with just asking people about the exposure status.

58
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:41,270
So like if you are interested in the effect of adolescent diet on breast cancer,

59
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,880
if you are conducting a case control study in which again you begin with the outcome,

60
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,790
you will get a bunch of people with breast cancer and of people without breast cancer.

61
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,179
And you will ask the two groups. Hmm. Because, you know, breast cancer develops late in adulthood.

62
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,190
Right. Who does them?

63
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,800
Hmm. How much red meat did you eat when you were 12 years old?

64
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,160
So, you know, there would be problems with that, right?

65
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:26,900
The other problem, and again, which is part of what we will try to dissect in detail, is how do you pick?

66
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:38,620
The people without the outcome. So the people with the outcome are actually good cases and the people without the outcome are cold controls.

67
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:46,050
And. The selection of controls.

68
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,630
Brings about also a bunch of problems potentially.

69
00:09:52,850 --> 00:10:03,230
What is the consequence of these problems? Both the problem of ascertaining exposure remotely and the problem of.

70
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:09,420
Potentially selecting the wrong group of people to compare against the cases.

71
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:18,660
Those problems may lead. To something called bias and what is bias?

72
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:26,240
In simple terms, getting the wrong answer. The measure of association that you get.

73
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:35,930
That's not actually represent. The direction or the magnitude of the association between that exposure and adult.

74
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:42,710
Getting the wrong answer. That's bias. Okay.

75
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:56,840
The other big thing with case control studies is that what we have described as measures of frequency and measures of association.

76
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:04,820
You know, in the causal inference lectures, in cross-sectional studies, in cohort studies, the theory breaks down.

77
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,440
With case control studies. They have very specific.

78
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,500
Measures of association. That are only specific to case control studies.

79
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,910
They are not even measures of frequency in case control studies.

80
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:28,290
Yeah. That's the awful truth. Only measures of association.

81
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,350
And it's it's something that, again,

82
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:40,330
maybe a little bit counterintuitive is not related to what we have been studying proportions and stuff not something totally different.

83
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,990
Right. So that's what's coming. Are you now more?

84
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,340
Excited to see what's going on. Okay.

85
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:02,630
So now I will start with, you know, the actual thing. But again, I always try to bear in mind this kind of.

86
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:11,690
Essence of what this is about. Okay. And as usual, please stop me if you lose track of anything.

87
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,270
Um. Okay.

88
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:24,040
So first we will discuss case control studies as an efficient form of cohort studies.

89
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:34,840
Then we will discuss a key concept to understand the appropriateness of selection of controls which are the study basis.

90
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,560
And then we will discuss three.

91
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,480
Strategies. That are available to select.

92
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,930
Cases and spatially controls the comparison group.

93
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,700
And the advantages, these advantages when they can be used, etc.

94
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:10,560
Then we will talk some practical issues regarding where will we find controls and again, what are the potential issues with those sources.

95
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,340
And then generally, we will talk about. We.

96
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:20,850
The examples are kind of fun examples. Some real life examples.

97
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:31,500
How the problems that I mention with ascertainment of exposure and selection of controls might lead you to get the wrong answer.

98
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:41,390
Bias. Right. And at the end we will also discuss a very super cool design that's called case crossover studies.

99
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:47,209
I mean, this is amazing. With these designs, you only need people with the outcome.

100
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:57,460
You don't need controls. Wow. That was a big leap forward in epidemiology some 20 years ago.

101
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,440
All right. So again.

102
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:12,210
We really need to understand. Case control studies in the context of cohort studies because this is how they are understood nowadays.

103
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:19,380
So to do that, I'm going to start reminding you, you know, what a cohort study is again.

104
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:25,319
So just briefly, this is a close cohort study in schematic representation.

105
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:32,310
We have got the most outcome represented by the full circles and we have a fixed exposure.

106
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,680
The exposures are in red, the unexposed are in blue.

107
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:45,090
We have followed this cohort for a ten year or ten minute period and then we

108
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:51,090
have counted the outcomes that have happened among exposed and among unexposed.

109
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:58,960
Alright. We have summarized our data here, and this is just exactly the same as as we went through last time.

110
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:12,150
Same example. So we we we can both count the actual numbers of, of, of people and we also can count the person time that people have contributed, etc.

111
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:18,179
I have brought back here a couple of measures of association, the cumulative incidence ratio,

112
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:23,930
relative risk or risk ratio, which is calculated in the multiplicative scale using the count.

113
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,320
And we have a 4.5 CAGR.

114
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:34,799
And I have also brought back the incidence rate ratio which uses as denominator the person time in each exposure cohort.

115
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,240
And we have 4.9. Goldstein.

116
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,910
No. Is there a more efficient way to estimate these measures?

117
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:53,240
And again, this is what I call a rhetorical question, because if the answer was no, I would probably just buck up and go home.

118
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:05,070
So the answer is a resounding yes. To do that, we are going to do a sort of thought exercise, not not to fence.

119
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:15,840
Let's assume that that cohort I showed you the previous slide was actually that cohort study was actually conducted.

120
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:28,620
Right. And you guys have, let's say, access to the data from the cohort and also a biobank meaning and repository of samples,

121
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:35,700
blood samples that the investigators took from everybody at the beginning of the call at baseline, the original time not.

122
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:45,320
They took a sample from everyone. But let's assume that the main aim of the cohort was to study something else.

123
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:49,640
You know, because they have these bias, let's say, diet with questionnaires.

124
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,530
So they did their study on diet and some outcome.

125
00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:03,680
But then in addition to that, they, you know, obviously kept the data and kept a blood sample in a freezer from everyone.

126
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:12,390
Right. So the main study that was to us is that it is already conducted and you have the data,

127
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:18,270
you have access to the samples, and now you become interested in a different question.

128
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:27,650
A different exposure. Your exposure, let's say, is a molecule that you can measure in blood.

129
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,090
By that, it is extremely expensive to measure.

130
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:45,820
There is no in a grant that can pay for you to measure that molecule on everybody in the cohort who provided you with a blood sample at the beginning.

131
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,900
Okay. And this is actually how a lot of research happens, right?

132
00:17:52,080 --> 00:18:00,420
Right? Yeah. Because, God, those are such huge investments that people always keep their data and samples and they make them available,

133
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:05,310
you know, to doctoral students and others to do additional studies.

134
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,950
Right. Okay. So what do we do?

135
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:14,650
If we cannot do that, that new study on everyone because it's just too too costly.

136
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:23,570
Well. We can take a sample.

137
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,760
Of the participants in the call. Okay.

138
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:36,360
And by doing that, we would actually be conducting a case control study.

139
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,890
The thing is that to sample participants in this study.

140
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,680
At least in the most common case control size.

141
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,730
Now we are going to focus on who developed the outcome.

142
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,290
From the data in the cohort that we already had and then.

143
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:03,660
Take a sample of those who did not develop doubt the outcome to compare.

144
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,780
Because it's a sample we don't have to send.

145
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:17,530
The blood from everybody to the lap and not be able to pay that that we can use in the samples to assess

146
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:26,890
our new exposure of interest from those that make it to that selection of people from the underlying or.

147
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,180
So I may be start I may start calling the cohort.

148
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:43,580
The underlying goal. Because again, the easiest way to grasp is controller studies is to think them as a sample from.

149
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,200
And actually existing coal. Okay.

150
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:52,660
Still with me? Look.

151
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,890
So a few pointers here. And again, this is.

152
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:12,030
It's good to emphasize this. The case control study is typically conducted after the occurrence of outcomes in a goal, in an underlying goal.

153
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:24,140
So it will include people who develop the outcome, who are the cases, and a sample of people from the cohort who did not develop the help.

154
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,960
And they are the controls, right? Okay.

155
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,690
What is the role of cases and controls?

156
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:44,110
The cases will give you information about the numerators of the measures of frequency in the exposed and the unexposed.

157
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:55,700
That you would have calculated in the cohort study. So cases, the sample of cases would give you information about the numerators of,

158
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,900
you know, those proportions you would have estimated in the courts that.

159
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,770
What are the controls? Would give you information on the denominators?

160
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:11,120
Of the measures of frequency in the exposed and unexposed from the cohort study.

161
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,740
So there's a role of cases and controls.

162
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:23,420
And again, this should become a little clearer when we provide specific examples of how this works, how this sampling works.

163
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,520
Right. Okay.

164
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:40,850
Now let's review two concepts that are also critical in understanding the sampling of controls, particularly, and its potential problems.

165
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,850
These are the concepts of a study base and a base population.

166
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:58,430
So a steady base. In a cohort study is only person time contributed by the members of the Corps.

167
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:05,080
So if you went back to that initial light and you counted all the circles.

168
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:09,340
Really? That final count would be the study base.

169
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:21,750
And in the context of conducting a case control study, of taking a sample of people from that underlying cohort.

170
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:30,080
The study base can then be understood as the person time that gives rise to the cases.

171
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:37,610
So the cases come from that very one time experience.

172
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:50,250
The other concept is the use of a base population. The base population is just the people who contributed to all the person.

173
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:56,250
So basically everybody in the cohort who was at risk of the outcome at the origin of the core.

174
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:02,840
The most important consequence of this, too, from now on, is the steady base.

175
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,650
Let's talk about this database a little. There are two types of study basis.

176
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,690
There are primary study bases and there are secondary study bases.

177
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:33,550
What's a primary study base? A primary study base as a potential source for a case control study is a cohort study that actually.

178
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,420
Exists that actually has been already conducted.

179
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:44,650
As in the example I started. The Glaswegian.

180
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:52,930
Meaning, you know, the nurses health study is is a primary study based.

181
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:57,450
Because it's a study that has already been conducted.

182
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:04,710
You know, for sure investigators have data and have samples and know exactly which outcomes happened when it said there.

183
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:17,530
Right. Um, so typically these are closed cohorts that have been completed or that are in progress sometimes.

184
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:20,560
Actually the nurses health study is probably still under follow.

185
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:33,030
The case control studies that you can conduct. On cohort studies with primary study bases are called misfit case control studies.

186
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:41,370
So the sampling of cases and controls from a primary study place is called nested because it's sort of done from within,

187
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,570
already a well-defined existing goal. Okay.

188
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:55,120
And the study makes obvious these older person time contributed by people who were enrolled in the cohort in the first place.

189
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,590
Now. What's a secondary study base?

190
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:08,780
That's that's a bit more problematic. But it has been very helpful as a conceptualization of how.

191
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:21,550
Historical case control studies were being done. A secondary study base is a cohort that is actually not well characterized.

192
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:30,040
He's a cohort, not from an actual cohort study that has been conducted.

193
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:35,620
And so you may be learning. So how is that possible? What could be examples of that and hoping cohort?

194
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,190
An open court, a population from a city observed within a well-defined period.

195
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:51,690
It's a secondary study based. He's not well-characterized because you may not necessarily know exactly who is coming into the

196
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:59,850
cohort and who is dropping off and who has contributed steady person time or who has gone back.

197
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,990
He's not well-characterized. You don't have databases with detailed information on.

198
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,879
Those people. On the exposure status.

199
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,880
On the outcome status, you don't know. Right.

200
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:21,920
So again, it's typically you can think of it as an open cohort that was not initiated by an investigator,

201
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:28,700
a free living population within a relatively well defined geographic confines.

202
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:37,320
So if you are to conduct a case control study. From a secondary study base.

203
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:47,400
Well, you will do the same. You will identify people with a disease of interest from that population.

204
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:59,430
And then you would have to deduce. From which actual population those cases arose.

205
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,580
And once you have did use that, I guess.

206
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:08,160
Good luck. Um. You can select people.

207
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:16,210
From then. As controls to compare with those cases or people with the disease.

208
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:25,280
Yes, I. Right.

209
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:29,640
So there is there is there is a possibility of bias here.

210
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,940
And this is this is why I mean, we will go in detail.

211
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:45,170
Through the potential problems with this approach. But before we came to understand.

212
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,230
Case control studies as.

213
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:59,500
Always really nice that within a cohort people didn't know that the case control studies they were doing were actually from a secondary study base.

214
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:11,830
So as a historical note, you know, the first case control study was conducted in the 1950s or so by Cornfield, and they were,

215
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:23,230
I guess, the perhaps the medical doctors or future medical doctors might have been exposed to do this type of clinical research.

216
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:30,440
Basically what was doing is they would go to University Hospital and let's say to

217
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:36,040
the coronary unit and big a big a bunch of people who are at the coroner unit,

218
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:39,830
you know, people who had had a anemia, myocardial infarction.

219
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,190
And let's say they were interested in the causes of myocardial infarction.

220
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:52,270
They would be the cases. And then they could go to another ward, you know, the orthopedics ward or something,

221
00:28:52,900 --> 00:29:00,490
to pick a few people without a myocardial infarction and then compare them with respect to some exposure.

222
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,830
Right. That was a typical historical.

223
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:12,910
Case control study. So you you know, they would not be thinking about databases and stuff.

224
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:17,670
But now what we believe. Happens.

225
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:27,780
Is that right? They picked those people from the coronary work from the clinic who had any Ms. cases.

226
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:36,690
And the people who they pick as controls from the orthopedics were actually represented.

227
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:42,030
Some population from which the guys with an MRI came.

228
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:50,829
They had to. And if they did not, then there is bias.

229
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,820
And you will see what? Okay.

230
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:04,400
So in those classic initial case control studies, this was still at work that perhaps optimal judges just didn't realize that the time.

231
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:16,220
They were actually sampling, for example, controls and cases, in fact, to from an underlying population, usually an open call.

232
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,400
They just could not characterize it, of course, and not even today, because those studies are still being done like that.

233
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:35,470
Right. Any questions so far on these mysteries? Thank you so much.

234
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,450
Right. So for this example, the underlying cold study doesn't need to have been done.

235
00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:01,810
No. No. Now that brings about, again, complications.

236
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:09,110
To the investigator. Yeah. Any other questions?

237
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:20,000
Are you still in flow? All right.

238
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:31,830
Now a few words on this campaign. You are actually, you have to when you conduct a case control study, you have to sample both cases and controls.

239
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:38,819
When you have a primary study base, again, an already conducted,

240
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:45,510
well defined cohort with data sets and sample stuff, you typically pick all the cases.

241
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:56,580
Of whatever outcome or disease of interest you you have like that because you know that maximizes sort of.

242
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:06,160
The precision of your estimates. You could also take a sample of of cases.

243
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:16,600
There are way too many cases. But. But again, typically you take them now for the controls.

244
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:24,799
You do not want to take everybody who did not develop the outcome because that would defeat the purpose.

245
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:30,790
Right. You were to do that, but you would rather conduct the goal. So you do have to take a sample of controls.

246
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:43,220
And the procedure to select the controls depends on whether the study base is primary or secondary.

247
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:53,360
There are three. Ways of selecting controls for a case control system.

248
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:58,710
They are called. Density or concurrent.

249
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:13,520
A sampling of controls. Case code or inclusive sample of controls and cumulative or exclusive sample of controls.

250
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:19,040
And again, don't worry about the that their names may not mean much.

251
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,890
Important thing is that we understand how each one of these is conducted and what are the implications.

252
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:31,300
All right. So if you're ready, we can begin with the first one.

253
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:37,670
Density or concurrent sampling of controls. Let's go back to our cohort.

254
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:47,790
You know, we are. It's a. Agnostic to exposure status, obviously.

255
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:58,300
Right. Because. This is a sampling that can only or can typically be done in.

256
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:10,709
We primary study bases, which means you may approach a group of investigators who have already conducted a study and tell them,

257
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:16,050
hey, I see you have been studying diet and environmental exposures and so on.

258
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:21,630
I want to study, you know, whole genome sequencing of something.

259
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:28,800
And I wonder if we can collaborate and you can, you know, provide me with samples and data.

260
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:38,690
So obviously this would be how your dataset would look like from the core study before you begin your selection and you

261
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:44,839
will not know who is exposed or unexposed because you would need to do this election and then send the samples to the lab.

262
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:50,440
Right. Okay. So you get the dataset and it looks something like this.

263
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,320
So to do a density sampling of controls and a case control study, we do the following.

264
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:05,010
First, let's select all the case. We only have. Six cases yet.

265
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:12,030
Of course it's made up. We can afford to select six cases of.

266
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:20,080
Then for each case. We are going to define what's called a risk set.

267
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:37,340
To pick. Controls for that case was the definition of a risk set because it's also part of the name of this type of sample risk that is every person.

268
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,160
Who was at risk of becoming a case.

269
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,540
At the time, each case became a case.

270
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:51,550
Uh huh. Yeah. That's, uh, sounds like a rhythm, right?

271
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:57,170
So. Let's let's implement it.

272
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:08,860
And it should become clear there will be more than one person for each case or within each case.

273
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:18,250
Cases reset. For sure. So depending on how many controls bird cage we can afford.

274
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:25,250
Then we can pick a given number of controls for each case randomly.

275
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,910
I think the important thing is to to pick them randomly. Okay.

276
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:35,380
All right. So this is the first case.

277
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,740
Right. So let's call it case number. What?

278
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,340
For this case, we need to define a risk set.

279
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:50,550
And the risk set for this case is everybody who was at risk.

280
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:58,530
Of becoming a case of getting the outcome. At the time, this person became a case.

281
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:10,460
Is that a clear definition? So who would be on the reset for this person?

282
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:20,180
Is is the first participant you know, the one right above this case is this first participant on the risk set of this case.

283
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:27,590
Remember each to be on the risk set for a case.

284
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,060
The person has to have been at risk.

285
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:41,590
Of becoming a case of developing the outcome. By the time the case we are trying to find controls for became a case.

286
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:53,880
So I can also ask the question. In other words, was this person at risk of getting the outcome when case number one became a case?

287
00:37:54,490 --> 00:38:05,100
Meaning in this specific example, at person time you need seven because this is the seventh one, this quadros inkosi seven is he?

288
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:14,810
Question again. Was this person at risk of becoming a case when this guy became a case?

289
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:26,850
Yes. How do you know? And this is why I like this graphical representation, because the person was and their follow up was contributing person time.

290
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,320
And we can see that because there is a circle here.

291
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:36,210
And the circle was. Empty was not full.

292
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:42,409
Had this equal been full, that means the person already got an outcome.

293
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:45,790
And this is not. He's not at risk.

294
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:52,059
Okay. So most definitely, yes, this person is on the risk set.

295
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:56,830
And so I'm going to highlight them like this. Right? How about the following one?

296
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,040
Is this person on the risk set for this one?

297
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:03,880
In other words, was this person at risk of becoming a case at the time?

298
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:08,280
Case number one is this person terminated. Seven became a case. Yes.

299
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,830
Okay. How about the next four? Yeah, same situation.

300
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,760
How about this? The following one. No.

301
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:27,580
In this case, if. If the outcome happens exactly at the same time as the case, we do believe that the person was not at risk.

302
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,630
It was an interesting question, less than one couple in my ear about these ties and so on.

303
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,490
So in this case, it is clear cut. This person is out.

304
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:41,260
Aha. There's an interesting situation next.

305
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:48,830
How about this person? Is this person should this person be in the risk set for this?

306
00:39:50,090 --> 00:40:01,430
Yes. Because even though this person became a case later on, by the time this one developed the disease or whatever, you know, you need time seven.

307
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:06,650
This person was in. So, yes, this person is on the risk set for this one.

308
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,990
The next one is the same situation as before. How about this one?

309
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:14,160
Which also became a case? Yes.

310
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:20,700
Because, again, at unit seven, seven here was at risk.

311
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,810
So these guys do the following. How about this one?

312
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:36,040
Well. This is a little bit um could be controversial but it's f the outcome is something that can only happen once.

313
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:45,970
And if it hasn't happened, that means or if the person came back without the outcome, it means it hasn't happened yet.

314
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,600
We could say yes. So it depends on the type of outcome, right?

315
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:53,980
In this case, we can say yes. How about this one? Nope.

316
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,130
Developed the outcome before this index case.

317
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,299
So we remove this, then they are all part of it.

318
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,770
And the last one is also removed because, uh.

319
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:12,960
Got the outcome before. So this is the risk set for this case.

320
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:20,820
The next thing to do is to randomly sample one or more controls per case from the case risk set.

321
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,970
So for simplicity, I'm going to sample just one.

322
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,020
Right. So have a really good.

323
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,800
Random generating system doesn't.

324
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:38,120
So I. I got randomly. Selected this one.

325
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:46,430
Okay. So this person is going to serve as control for this person.

326
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:51,440
And this is how I'm representing them here. Okay.

327
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:59,040
And now we have to do that kind of painfully. For everybody else, every case.

328
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:03,660
So we are done with case number one. This is case number two.

329
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:09,460
And we have to define a risk set. For case number two.

330
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,410
So I have a shortcut a visual shortcut for you.

331
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:20,020
She's. Hey, if we trace. A vertical window.

332
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:28,330
At the same time, you need to in each case become a case and remove every other case that is within that window.

333
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:33,370
Everybody else who remains with an open circle within that window should be part of the reset.

334
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:37,060
Right. So let's let's use that visual shortcut here.

335
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:41,530
So I need to remove only this person.

336
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:51,820
Right? And that's the risk set for everybody else who is within this window is going to be part of the risk.

337
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:57,870
So this person is not right and this person didn't exist to begin with.

338
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:16,690
But this other one is not. So I remove these two and then with my random generating selection procedure here, I get this one as.

339
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:26,160
The control for this case. How about case number three?

340
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,330
We do the same procedure. This would be sort of the window we have to.

341
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,739
There is nobody who also got the outcome at that time.

342
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:41,070
So everybody else should be, except the ones who got it before were end and should be in the risk set.

343
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:46,320
And we randomly select somebody to serve us. They control and use that person.

344
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,300
The same for all over. Cases one by one.

345
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:57,610
So this is the summary of my random proceeding. Um.

346
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:08,770
Right. Going to remove everybody else because we won't be needing your samples.

347
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:15,160
Right. Okay. So we are left with this. I have left in only the cases and their controls.

348
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:19,930
Note that a case number one.

349
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:26,020
Can be another two cases. Number five, control.

350
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:30,040
You see this? And the reason is that.

351
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:36,290
Number one. He's number one was actually in the risk set for case number five.

352
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:44,049
You know, so there is no reason to exclude that person. All right.

353
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:47,680
So we are all excited. We have our our sampling. What do we do next?

354
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:56,110
Well, we just you know, we hit the the freezer and get the samples and send them to the lab for them

355
00:44:56,110 --> 00:45:01,300
to measure that very expensive molecular gene or set of genes or whatever.

356
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,320
Um, and we get the results back.

357
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:12,390
So we. You know, add that variable exposure to our data set.

358
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:18,290
And here it is. We can summarize.

359
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:23,650
The data. On a little table with respect to.

360
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:33,000
Who were the exposed cases where the exposed controls and who were the unexposed cases were the unexposed controls like this?

361
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,900
So who are the exposed cases? Who should go on these?

362
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:43,340
So. Exposed cases. Is this exposed case?

363
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:48,960
Yes. How about this? How about this?

364
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,800
How about this? No. Okay.

365
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:56,190
So it's one, three, four and six, right?

366
00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:03,540
Okay. And who are the unexposed cases should be two and five, right?

367
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:07,500
Okay. Who are the exposed controls?

368
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:13,750
Controls were in red. Uh, this one?

369
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:19,620
Yeah. There's one. 512596.

370
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:26,600
Action. Right. It is very hard to see these.

371
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:40,450
And who are the unexposed controls? One, two, four and three.

372
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:45,820
That was easier. Nicer to my nick when I edging Nick.

373
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:51,700
Right. Right. So we have our accounts and we can summarize them.

374
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,780
We don't really care specifically who was who at this age.

375
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,820
And here is the question, therefore. Uribe.

376
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:17,990
Can we estimate marginal probabilities? What do you think, Jamie?

377
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:22,060
You know the story. I'm sorry. I didn't mean.

378
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:37,980
Would say yes. Okay. What? Let me see if if I give you further information and perhaps I can persuade you to reconsider.

379
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:48,140
Well, the important thing is to actually earlier, if you have a question on there, that means.

380
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:56,580
Yes, there are. But I didn't say this was a rhetorical question it gave.

381
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:59,610
No, no. That's good. That's good. So.

382
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:09,220
Or perhaps let's consult with somebody else who may think, know, and might want to provide a reason for this.

383
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,170
Okay. I mean, look.

384
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:20,570
No. Why?

385
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,990
Okay. Well, the answer is correct, but I guess we knew that. No, but.

386
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:34,840
But perhaps the explanation could be worked out a little more finely.

387
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:40,640
You are. Alison, there's.

388
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:51,170
I think that's closer to it, but not yet. Quite exactly as.

389
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:55,070
And you are. Hayley. Is it because you're older?

390
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:12,920
Yes. Yes, exactly. It's a sample and the number of code is a sample from the underlying cohort recall and the

391
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:21,110
number of controls I picked or I decided to select for each case is completely capricious.

392
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:29,070
You know what that word means? Arbitrary. I mean, I just took it from wherever.

393
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:34,600
There is no logic to that number. So in fact.

394
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,040
As Haley said, I'm oversampling in a way.

395
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:44,720
I'm over sampling the cases. I took all the cases. They just took a few controls.

396
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:52,190
And the number of controls is not necessarily even proportional to the absolute number of people who were exposed or unexposed.

397
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:57,960
Right. So, no, we cannot estimate marginal probabilities in a case control study.

398
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:07,740
Forget about. That's why I mentioned in the beginning that all that theory we had been working through on, you know, comparisons of.

399
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:13,430
Conditional permit. And so that breaks down here because of something, right?

400
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:18,360
Right. Okay. Can we estimate conditional probabilities?

401
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:21,790
I think I inadvertently told you the answer, but we cannot.

402
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:26,350
And the answer is the same. Since we don't have meaningful.

403
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,790
Marginal totals for exposed and unexposed.

404
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,510
We cannot estimate conditional probabilities.

405
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:48,140
So then what do we do? Well, we are is that we that relatively weird measure that's called the arts.

406
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:58,030
And the arts is basically a ratio of having something to not having something.

407
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:03,490
And actually odds are used in some real life.

408
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:12,610
Uh, situations if, if anybody's, for example, into a horse racing and gambling and horses.

409
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:17,450
Anybody. So horse racing aficionado.

410
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:24,350
Yes. Okay. So how do you express the, let's say, the.

411
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:30,520
The horses that you should bet on. You are.

412
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:35,430
Right. That says a lot. Every time I got on.

413
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:43,540
Okay. Well, that's an excellent criterion.

414
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:48,490
I think there might be, you know, some evolutionary biology.

415
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:59,259
Okay. Right. But maybe even, you know, if you have watched movies where they do that, uh, plenty of movies.

416
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:09,070
And, um, you may, you may have noticed that they describe the sort of quality of, of a horse in terms of.

417
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:16,880
This horse is a 9 to 1. Right or this horse is 5 to 5.

418
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:23,750
What does that mean? That means out of ten races, the horse.

419
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:28,100
The first one is expected to win nine and to lose just one.

420
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:43,410
And that's an arts. The odds for this horse is 9 to 1 or 5 to 5 means a horse is sort of averaging that of ten races, wins five, loses five.

421
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:47,860
But that is more or less the same concept or exactly the same same concept.

422
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:55,990
The thing is, we have to. Estimate the odds.

423
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:02,320
Separately for cases and contracts.

424
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,450
We do not estimate odds.

425
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:19,600
For exposed and unexposed. Conceptually, that's wrong because as they said in the beginning, in case control studies, we do not begin with exposure.

426
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:23,890
We begin with. Case or no case?

427
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:36,710
Disease or no disease. Right. So we can only compare the odds of being exposed among cases, with the odds of being exposed among the controls.

428
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:41,750
And we typically don't really mind the odds of being unexposed.

429
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:45,740
In this case, we are pretty much interested in the odds of being exposed to the unexposed.

430
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,350
That's the order of the ratio, right?

431
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:58,160
So the odds of exposure among cases is simply the number of exposed cases divided by the number of unexposed cases.

432
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:04,630
In this particular example, what would that number be?

433
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:11,230
Exposed cases is this far right? Unexposed cases is.

434
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:18,850
These two. Okay. As the odds of exposure among cases.

435
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:27,650
And we do the same for the controls. The odds of exposure and controls are going to be the number of exposed controls.

436
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:34,520
These two divided by the number of unexposed controls, which is these for two divided by four.

437
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:44,340
And then. The measure of association is going to be the ratio of those two arts,

438
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:50,070
the ratio of the odds of exposure among cases to the odds of exposure among controls.

439
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:55,470
And guess how that measure is called? It's very creative here.

440
00:54:55,770 --> 00:55:00,420
It's called the odds ratio. Voila. The famous, infamous odds ratio.

441
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,600
Is is infamous nowadays. That's a different discussion for a more advanced.

442
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:10,980
Um. So the ratio of those to numbers is four.

443
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:20,490
Is Emily in the room? Emily, you're me, right?

444
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:31,270
Uh, Emily, who's from the, um, M and Miss C program because she was asking earlier in the course about the odds ratio.

445
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:40,270
So I just wanted to let her know this is what this is sort of where it belongs, at least in my understanding of it.

446
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:44,960
Yeah. She's the right one. Right.

447
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:55,200
Only they're only there. Maybe this is a good time to give you a bit of a warning again.

448
00:55:56,330 --> 00:55:57,380
Strictly speaking.

449
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:09,250
The alteration should only be used in the context of case control studies and case only studies which act as part of a family of case control studies.

450
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:21,910
You are going to be taught. That odds ratios can be used as measures of association in other study designs such as cross-sectional studies.

451
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:32,050
Some people might even boldly go to teach something called the prevalence art and in cohort studies.

452
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:37,380
That's wrong. Odds ratios do not belong.

453
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:42,740
In studying science other than. Case control studies.

454
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:49,500
And because. No matter how much I fight about this.

455
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:58,280
It may not, I mean, but sometimes you must be just first anyway.

456
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:06,240
So I mean, it, it may be, you know, perhaps on a homework or exam that that would make it unforgettable.

457
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:15,830
Right. The measures you use in those are the designs are the measures I told you.

458
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:21,420
Using the odds ratio in those other designs is extremely problematic.

459
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:33,400
Not only because of issues of interpretation, but because of actually confounding and some mysterious conceptual collapse ability.

460
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:37,210
But just please believe me. Don't use them.

461
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:48,520
Don't use them. The reason why people have been using them is only historical and is because up to 25 years ago we did not have the technology.

462
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:56,070
We'd not have algorithms in statistical software to, for example, model risk ratios or prevalence ratios directly.

463
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:07,020
Now we do is is easy. The only thing that was available sometime ago was something called logistic regression, which only models us.

464
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:11,060
So then people were stuck and they had to use it for everything.

465
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:19,990
But now that we know, now that we have the technology is absolutely no reason to use odds ratios in studies other than case control studies.

466
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:24,459
So we can interpret this.

467
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:32,200
There is a positive association between exposure and this is the odds of exposure are four times or 300% higher in cases than in controls.

468
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:38,380
Note I said the art of exposure. You didn't say the risk of exposure or the prevalence of exposure?

469
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:41,620
No. Is the art. That's it. All right.

470
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:48,600
A few pointers on the odds ratio. The odds ratio is the measure of association in case control studies.

471
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:55,700
I you knew that. The US difference is something you typically do not estimate.

472
00:58:55,720 --> 00:59:03,670
So again for you, you can just assume that there is no additive scale in case control studies.

473
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:10,510
No additives. Okay. You're stuck with a multiplicative escape. The ratios range.

474
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:17,520
And odds are really are not measures of frequency because of what we discussed before.

475
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:25,860
We cannot estimate marginal probabilities or conditional probability.

476
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:29,290
So there are really no measures of frequency in case control studies.

477
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:38,910
Only one measure of association, right? So I'm going to I'm not going to delve into this too much.

478
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:45,569
Only the conclusion. You are welcome to look into this in your readings and you are welcome to consult with me.

479
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:57,399
I'll be happy to explain it in detail, but. Basically what this refers to is to the relation between the numbers,

480
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:06,160
the counts you get from the selection of cases and controls in a case control study and what they represent from the underlying cohort.

481
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:14,170
Because recall we are doing a case control study sampling from the underlying core.

482
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:19,060
So the one thing that you know, if you want to follow this a little bit, you have to imagine.

483
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:27,740
What would have happened if, in fact, we could have ascertained exposure on everyone in the coal?

484
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:38,100
Useless. A thought experiment. This is what would have happened because actually I'm using the same example.

485
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,150
So if you have been able to ascertain exposure and everyone in the cohort.

486
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:50,120
You would have had the same number of exposed cases and unexposed controls as you picked in the case control study.

487
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:56,510
And you would have had these number of person time units in the exposed and these number of person time in the unexposed.

488
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:00,980
Right. If you had that possibility.

489
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:10,020
It's theoretical. But it's important because the idea is that the probability of selecting any potential control.

490
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:18,520
Using density sampling is proportional to the amount of person time they would have contributed in the cohort study.

491
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:22,750
In other words, this count of two.

492
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:32,040
Export Controls represents the 68 person time exposed units in the underlying cohort

493
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:41,490
proportionally to how this count of four unexposed controls represents the 167.

494
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:45,960
There are some time and unexposed units in the underlying CL.

495
01:01:50,150 --> 01:02:02,220
And you can actually. Compare that ratio and the idea if the case control if the control if the selection of controls is done properly.

496
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:09,960
That ratio should be the same. So the ratio of exposed controls,

497
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:17,879
the number of exposed controls in your case control study to the person time exposed in

498
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:23,490
the cohort should be equal to the ratio of the number of unexposed controls you picked.

499
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:31,740
To the person time unexposed in the coal. If that's the case, you are saved.

500
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,220
That means you selection of controls is adequate.

501
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:49,610
He's unbiased because you have selected accounts that proportionally represent exposed and exposed sometime in the by the same proportion.

502
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:59,700
So these numbers, you know, in the in the theory of of case control studies are called control sampling rates.

503
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:09,890
So they control sampling rate for exposed controls should be the same as that for unexposed controls.

504
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:15,460
And in this particular case, you can actually make the calculation.

505
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:25,590
So it would be two divided by 68 or 29 and these would be four divided by one 67.0 24.

506
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:30,840
So, you know, it's kind of close, but problem is a big search.

507
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:39,890
So few controls that there is no way these small numbers are going to give me an exact exact controls sampling rate.

508
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:42,980
But hey, you know, let's give it a break and pretty similar.

509
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:52,219
Morris. You could make it even more similar by using the person time that day.

510
01:03:52,220 --> 01:04:04,260
Controls, exposed and unexposed contributing. So this is the person time that the controls contributed according to their exposure status.

511
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:10,230
And if you use this in the numerators instead of the count, you actually get pretty much the same numbers.

512
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:18,370
Again. There is no need to worry too much about this. The important thing is to understand that.

513
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:26,700
For. A controlled selection to density sampling, to work well, to be unbiased.

514
01:04:28,190 --> 01:04:34,970
The drawing of exposed controls and unexposed controls needs to be proportional

515
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:39,660
to the exposed version time in the cohort and the unexposed person timing.

516
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:52,730
Nicole. Okay. So this is a very nice algebraic demonstration that I'm not going to get into.

517
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:56,700
But the idea is that.

518
01:04:58,610 --> 01:05:05,840
When they controlled sampling rates for exposed and unexposed are the same.

519
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:11,500
Meaning your selection of controls is adequate. The odds ratio.

520
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:20,480
Is equal in a case control study sample is equal to the incidence rate ratio.

521
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:32,180
In the underlying core. And I typically, you know, I get very moved and emotional and I go through this proof because I think it's so.

522
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:40,950
Nice. But the idea, again, is in a density sampling of controls.

523
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:52,970
Strategy situation. When they control sampling rates in the exposed and unexposed are the same meaning your selection of controls is adequate.

524
01:05:54,380 --> 01:06:01,350
The odds ratio should be an unbiased estimate of the incidence rate which oc.

525
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:09,299
Now in this case, numerically, again, these numbers differ a little bit,

526
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:15,930
but that's because my visual schematic example is really small and they have very few counts.

527
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:20,040
So there is no way mathematically I can make this the same.

528
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:23,249
But if you use large numbers in a large study, you should get this.

529
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:33,250
And. Yes. Well, that's a great question.

530
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:38,050
Was it racial to know sort of the difference between these two and how you never know?

531
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,580
Well, I mean, I'm sorry. I guess.

532
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:52,010
There is no threshold. And the reason there is no threshold is because you can only do this in theory.

533
01:06:54,950 --> 01:07:01,880
You can only you could only do this if you actually had the chance of assessing exposure on everybody in the court.

534
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:09,330
So these numbers come from just a theoretical example where I actually had that possibility.

535
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:17,549
Yeah. Vida in real life, if you could ascertain exposure on everybody in the cohort, you wouldn't be doing it.

536
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:26,090
Sampling of controls. You would be conducting a cohort study. So in real life, you really never know how close these numbers are.

537
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:35,720
Well, that's a great question. Now there are ways to get a sense of whether this worked or not.

538
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:44,330
That we is actually more advanced courses. Or I'd be happy to talk to you about these in office hours if you are interested.

539
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:52,610
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, there are sort of ad hoc ways, convenience ways to do this.

540
01:07:53,510 --> 01:08:02,530
All right. So some final pointers on these are the relation of the odds ratio with the ratio.

541
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:05,050
If selection of controls is adequate,

542
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:15,489
they should be the same in the density selection of controls and they could differ because there is random variability as in my example.

543
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:20,559
In other words, I have very few counts and there is no way arithmetically that I can.

544
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:27,850
I could make the numbers be the same or the control sampling rates differ.

545
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:33,300
Between exposed and unexposed. When that's the case.

546
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:42,530
Case control study has failed. And you have what's called selection bias.

547
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:46,820
We will have a full selection bias.

548
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:50,780
And in the second part of the culture, don't worry about this.

549
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:55,070
All you need to know is that this is how this bias happens.

550
01:08:55,650 --> 01:08:59,650
If you select your controls wrongly. Right.

551
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:07,090
In other words, this election was not independent of exposure status.

552
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:17,340
You selected controls that were more likely to be exposed than in the underlying cohort or annex,

553
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:20,510
or more likely to be unexposed than the underlying or.

554
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:30,210
Okay. So you would get the wrong answer. If you were able to conduct the underlying cohort there, you would get the right answer.

555
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:34,350
In the case control study with one selection of controls. Selection bias.

556
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:45,280
You'll get a wrong. Okay. So a few final summary pointers on density or risk said sampling.

557
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:50,870
The primary uses the primary study based. It is very rare for them to use as secondary.

558
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:57,170
It is possible, but you would need a population somehow enumerated like with a census or something.

559
01:09:57,410 --> 01:10:06,559
Israel can be done in Israel. The controls obviously come from the same population that gave rise to the cases because the cohort has been conducted.

560
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:13,580
And you should have the data right? You should know exactly who is in that pool of potential controls.

561
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:19,280
And each case is much to is controlled by the time in the court basically.

562
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:24,830
Right. Decision has to be at risk of becoming a case for each index.

563
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,300
The same person might be both a case and another case is control.

564
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:38,040
We actually had that situation in our example. The sampling of controls must be independent of exposure status.

565
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:43,740
That is kind of the lay explanation of the difference between control sampling rates.

566
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:52,760
And when it is well done, the odds ratio is an unbiased estimate of the incidence rate ratio in the underlying goal.

567
01:10:56,980 --> 01:11:04,710
Any questions on density? Something. Okay.

568
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:08,130
So we have time to move into the next strategy.

569
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:16,630
For a selection of controls. We already. So let's go back to our you know, now you've.

570
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:21,620
To expose your status close cohort represented.

571
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:29,860
We do schematic. And the next we are going to implement is called the case cohort sampling approach.

572
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:36,600
How do we do that? Okay, first step, silicone cases.

573
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:41,040
Okay. We only have six. So we are going to select them.

574
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:50,890
Next, select a random sample of participants at the beginning of the cohort.

575
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:55,870
Regardless of whether or not they became a case.

576
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:08,400
That's why it's called gays cohort, because you pretend that you were at the origin of the call.

577
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:16,950
And picks on people at the origin of the cohort, ignoring whether they actually became a case in the first step.

578
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:21,600
Recall you have already selected the cases, right? So you don't have to worry about that step is done.

579
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:28,500
The selection of controls is done as if you were at the origin at baseline at the beginning of the call.

580
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:39,170
You don't have to match any. Case to any control with respect to anything?

581
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:42,280
Certainly not. Okay.

582
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:47,760
So I've done that here with my random procedure.

583
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:58,480
And I got these people who are enclosed on a box like a purple box as my controls.

584
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:09,210
So I'll have six. Casey's and I capriciously decided to select, I think.

585
01:13:11,690 --> 01:13:16,400
Then he then controls, you know.

586
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:25,170
Real life is not so capricious. You have to do something called statistical power calculations for these capricious.

587
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:33,709
All right. So the number of controls doesn't have to be equal to the number of cases.

588
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:40,970
You pretty much needs to fulfill precision conditions and budgetary conditions.

589
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,190
So I'm going to remove everything else and just leave this.

590
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:55,670
Now, there is something interesting here. You may note something, which is that a case can be included also as a control.

591
01:13:56,690 --> 01:14:01,330
Right. So which one is included as a control?

592
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:07,130
This guy, right? So this person was a case.

593
01:14:07,490 --> 01:14:13,219
But because I made that random selection at baseline blindly to whether they had become cases.

594
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:17,390
Hey, chances are somebody who would become a case might actually.

595
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:21,980
Fall into my selection of controls and that's okay. That's alright.

596
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:34,260
No problem. So I sent my sample only of these people to the lab and I get assessment of exposure and I get the results back.

597
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:39,090
And these are the results. Again, blue is unexposed, red is exposed.

598
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:42,720
I can organize this data and a little table.

599
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:51,340
The same cases for Exposed to Unexposed. But now we have three exposed controls and seven unexposed controls.

600
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:55,210
You can just count it bluer red circles.

601
01:14:57,950 --> 01:15:04,550
And the measure is the same. So we first have to estimate the odds of exposure among cases, which is four divided by two,

602
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:08,690
and the odds of exposure among controls is three divided by seven.

603
01:15:09,530 --> 01:15:15,290
And then our measure of association, the odds ratio only multiplicative risk case control studies.

604
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:21,000
These two numbers divided each other. 4.67. We can.

605
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:32,670
Uh, interpret it. The odds of exposure are 4.67 times higher in cases than they are in control, such as positive association, etc.

606
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:37,440
But then I have a question for you and I know is is late.

607
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:42,640
But, you know, let's let's do it.

608
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:53,660
Which measure of association in the underlying cohort is the odds ratio of a case cohort study an unbiased estimate of.

609
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:58,220
You know, it's sort of a, an exercise on intuition.

610
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:05,090
Um, and here is the, the policy if, if you can access it.

611
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:14,630
Okay. Let's see. We hit 60, at least in the.

612
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:19,130
New York. So.

613
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:26,190
This is the correct response. The cumulative incidence ratio.

614
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:33,750
How did you know that it. Well in other than because you actually did the readings.

615
01:17:34,470 --> 01:17:40,950
Um, well, it's not the incidence rate ratio because we already went through that.

616
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:44,130
And, you know, incidence rate ratio is only for density.

617
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:55,260
So that's out. Is is not the excess fraction because this is just gibberish and prevalence.

618
01:17:55,260 --> 01:18:06,570
And I tell you, mind you, I sometimes say in the exam, say me or in the homeless, I may read gibberish as the the the stratas always to help you.

619
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:10,290
So don't be tricked on my gibberish. Yeah.

620
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:16,530
Things that don't just don't make sense, even in English, it's just just sort of a present for you.

621
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:27,569
But let's see why it is the cumulative ratio. So this is the situation in the case control study that we conducted and this would have

622
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:33,420
been the situation in the cohort study had we been able to assess exposure on everybody.

623
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:37,710
So here we are really not content with person time.

624
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:44,640
Here we are concerned with counts late because we picked controls at the beginning of

625
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:49,710
the cohort when we did not know how much person time people were going to contribute.

626
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:55,830
So we cannot think of personal time in this situation.

627
01:18:55,860 --> 01:19:05,400
We are stuck with guns. However. Because we selected people at the beginning of the cohort.

628
01:19:05,670 --> 01:19:15,450
The probability of selecting any given control with case code sampling is proportional to the total number of people in the cohort by exposure group.

629
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:20,880
It is just very beautiful. This is really amazing.

630
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:28,410
So these three guys represent these eight guys in proportion to how these seven guys represent these 18 guys.

631
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:36,830
That's why the odds ratio would be the same as the cumulative incidence ratio, risk ratio, relative risk.

632
01:19:37,870 --> 01:19:43,220
Uh huh. The numerator is what is going is going to be the same.

633
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:51,440
And if the denominator is between exposed and an exposed sort of change proportionally to each other, you can estimate no problem.

634
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:56,840
The risk ratio from case cohort studies. Okay.

635
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:58,420
Wasn't that sort of.
