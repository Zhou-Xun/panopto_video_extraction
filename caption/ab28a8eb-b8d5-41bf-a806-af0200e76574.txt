00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,440
Hello, everyone. Good afternoon. How are you all doing today?

2
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,450
Did you have a good fall break last week? Have you already forgotten about it?

3
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,800
Does it seem like it was ages ago already? Yeah. Yeah, I feel it too.

4
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:11,930
Well, nice to have you here today. Today, we're going to continue on with our focus on different epidemiology careers.

5
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,260
So we'll I'll introduce our guest here in a second.

6
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:20,600
And then Dominique and I, of course, will stay at the ends if you have any questions about anything going on.

7
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,400
Any apex related questions, anything you need, just please let us know or reach out to us.

8
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,209
Tell your friends to. If they're not here, we want to help you and talk to you if you need anything.

9
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,780
Okay? So just pass it on, okay? All right.

10
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:40,729
So today, I'm very excited to introduce Dina Hoffman, who is an alum from our program, General AP, I think a while back.

11
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:46,520
So she'll tell you more about that. She is here representing our careers in industry, in the private sector.

12
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,540
She's at OAM one which I'll let her tell you more about that.

13
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:57,319
So similar to our last session, she'll go over a little bit of what her work is like, but really this is meant to be kind of conversational.

14
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,810
So think of questions you have I've got lots of questions. You've got them all written down right here, Veena, in my pocket.

15
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:09,320
So we'll let you get started and come on up and you can tell them about your work and then we'll think about our questions.

16
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,670
Thanks, Laura. Around. We've got these little microphones that we can take around.

17
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,500
Oh, nice. Throw them. And then we can make up for anything.

18
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,120
I'm going to try and project, but just let me know if you can't hear me.

19
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:28,820
But my name is Nina Hoffman. I'm a senior epidemiologist at a company called In One.

20
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:36,020
And before I get into about what I'm one is just going to go through my career journey a little bit.

21
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,940
So I was born and raised in Michigan. I've lived here my entire life.

22
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,799
I went to undergrad here as well as getting my MPH in general.

23
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:52,550
AP And most of my professional experience has been in industry,

24
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,690
but my internship when I was in my program here was at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services,

25
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,950
which at the time was called the Michigan Department of Community Health. And I worked in the infectious diseases group there,

26
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:13,940
and I spent the summer tracking hepatitis C reporting across the different local health departments.

27
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:22,879
At the time it was being underreported, and the nature of the infection, whether it was acute or chronic, was also being underreported.

28
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:31,970
So we were just trying to get a handle on how to the extent that that was happening and how to better improve those reporting practices.

29
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:42,079
But after graduation, I went to work at Michigan Medicine as a clinical study coordinator, and this was in the gastroenterology department.

30
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:50,150
And I helped a hepatologist or a liver disease specialist recruit patients for some biomarker clinical trials,

31
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:57,380
as well as some treatment trials for treatment of a cellular carcinoma or liver cancer.

32
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:05,030
But after about two years of that, my peers funding was starting to get a little shaky.

33
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:10,400
So I started looking at other options. And one of the options wasn't industry.

34
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:18,920
One of the coordinators I was working with at Michigan Medicine happened to know someone who worked at what eventually became Optum,

35
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,340
and I learned they had an epidemiology group there.

36
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:29,810
So I thought this would be a good chance for me to really immerse myself into epidemiology and maybe do more of the work that I was trained in.

37
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:42,170
So I started at Optum in 2007 as a research associate, so I was supporting the epidemiologists and the research analysts with primary data collection,

38
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:52,130
helping to write reports and putting together figures for protocols and just supporting whatever was needed from that standpoint.

39
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,690
And after a few years, I eventually became an epidemiologist myself.

40
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,720
And at Optum what we did was something called Pharmacoepidemiology, where you were,

41
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:12,860
you're taking electronic health record data or claims data, and we were conducting post-marketing research studies there.

42
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:20,030
And then on one is where I'm currently at now is also a smaller company.

43
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,800
It's more electronic health records based from different specialty sources.

44
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:32,750
And here I do more like health resource utilization studies, and I can get more into that in a minute.

45
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:44,260
But backing up into my first industry experience at Optum, Optimus, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, and it has been since 2011.

46
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,910
It's a very large company. There's over 10,000 employees worldwide.

47
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:57,520
And I was in the epidemiology group at Optum, which is part of Optum Insight, and that was more of the life sciences arm of Optum.

48
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:04,419
But the epidemiology group was actually very small compared to the larger company of Optum.

49
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:12,580
So it was about 60 employees consisting of epidemiologists, research analysts, project managers and research associates.

50
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,750
And here is where we did the Pharmacoepidemiology study.

51
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:26,530
So using claims and electronic records data sources, it primarily focused on post-approval safety studies of medications and vaccines.

52
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:32,650
So typically, when a medication is approved by the FDA for use in the larger population,

53
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:39,610
they often have continued regulatory requirements to ensure that they continue to stay safe as more people take these medications.

54
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:49,060
So an example research question would have been what is the incidence rate of myocardial infarction in users of drugs compared to users of drug?

55
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:55,930
Why? So I did that work for almost ten years and I found it to be very rewarding.

56
00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:03,010
But I also was looking to expand my horizons, maybe move on and try something different.

57
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:12,100
So I ended up leaving Optum in the winter of 2021, and I'm currently working at a company called All in One.

58
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,670
So All in one is a much smaller company than Optum.

59
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:19,030
It's a it's a startup. It was founded in 2015.

60
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,110
It consists at this point of about 200 employees.

61
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:28,240
And we're made up of epidemiologists, biostatistician and research analysts,

62
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,900
data scientists and project and clinical site managers is headquartered in Boston.

63
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,890
But there are in-office employees as well as remote employees.

64
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,200
I'm fully remote and I work from home. I live here in Ann Arbor.

65
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:52,150
And what we focus on here are retrospective studies using real world claims data from a range of specialty networks.

66
00:07:52,150 --> 00:08:01,510
So our networks range from mental health to neuroscience, cardio, metabolic dermatology, gastroenterology, EMT and rheumatology.

67
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:08,079
And we do prospective studies also with ANOVA data collection from clinical sites.

68
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,650
And it's something our company calls next generation registries.

69
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:17,590
And we also have a group of data scientists who use artificial intelligence to

70
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,790
identify patients at the greatest likelihood to develop a target condition.

71
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:28,780
So a project I'm working on now is in patients with major depressive disorder.

72
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:33,639
How does initiation of an antidepressant change their patient reported outcomes and

73
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,660
health care resource utilization before and after they start that antidepressant?

74
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,600
So it's a different focus and a different type of work than I was what I was doing at Optum.

75
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,660
But it was still with the same types of observational claims and our data sources.

76
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,490
So that's a nutshell of my journey and what I'm doing now.

77
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:03,220
And I think at this point I'm happy to answer questions or talk about anything in more detail.

78
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,209
That sounds good. So, you know, people think about the questions that I'll start with.

79
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:12,100
One is just what is your day to day look like? You know, is it kind of the same stuff you're working on?

80
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:17,139
Like what? What does it look like for you in your work right now? Each day just looks so different.

81
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:24,670
I have a range of studies ranging from outcomes and patients who are treated for depression or schizophrenia.

82
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:32,600
I'm also working on studies in the EMT space, particularly around treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis.

83
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:39,429
I'm also mentoring a more junior epi in her studies, so I feel like every day is different.

84
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:45,670
One day I could be writing a protocol for one study, the next day and analyzing data for another study.

85
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:50,560
And there may maybe a third day where I'm on proposal calls,

86
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:56,260
trying to get more information from clients about the types of studies they want and trying to,

87
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,979
you know, work with them to design something that meets their needs.

88
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,910
So it it varies and it keeps me on my toes for sure.

89
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:09,350
You said it's a smaller company in one, but it sounds like it's spread across, like you said, U.S.

90
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,930
India. I'm just curious how many how many employees are there approximately?

91
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:21,360
So it started when I started a year and a half ago, it was 50 employees and I became 5505 zero.

92
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:27,190
Everybody was in the US at the time. Everybody was working from the Boston office.

93
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:35,469
They didn't have remote employees. I think the pandemic changed that quite a bit and they were more open to hiring

94
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:41,080
qualified people who didn't live in Boston and couldn't relocate for whatever reason.

95
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:50,919
So it spread and we're at about 200 employees now and we're all over the US and we

96
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:57,309
recently started a group in India who does particularly clinical abstractions.

97
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:03,160
So if we're trying to get information from unstructured data in the medical record,

98
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,510
they go in with a natural language processing technique and they actually pull that

99
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:12,580
information out into snippets that we can use as part of our analytic datasets.

100
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,910
So do you have people that report to you? It sounds like you are mentoring a junior epidemiologist.

101
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:25,000
So I have one direct report right now which is temporary because her her boss is on parental leave.

102
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,180
So for going into management and feeling that out for the first time.

103
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,390
Yeah, yeah. I was going to say that sometimes it's a whole different skill set.

104
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,070
Questions from the group. I know you're thinking about what you want to know.

105
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:50,650
My other question while you think about yours is in your first job at Optum, you went from the, I think the associate level to the senior level.

106
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:57,100
What were the differences in what you had like what were the job requirements or the changes in your job as you moved up to the senior level?

107
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,939
So as an associate, it was more of a support role.

108
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:06,550
So I was supporting the epidemiologists as they were developing protocols and study reports.

109
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:14,050
I would run some analyzes for them, help them format their reports, take care of IRB approvals.

110
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,880
If we were going to the National Death Index to link to the mortality data,

111
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:27,550
I would write those applications up and just be that liaison between the AP and the MDI staff in Washington.

112
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:33,639
So it was very much a support position when I became an epidemiologist.

113
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:39,370
Then I became in charge of writing the protocols, working with the clients and study design,

114
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:48,370
working with our analysts on looking at the data and making sure the results made sense and writing the reports.

115
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:54,850
I was able to start writing my own manuscripts and publishing and as a senior epidemiologist,

116
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,840
it just took that responsibility to another level in that I was assigned more

117
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:04,600
complex studies with slightly less oversight from more for more senior staff.

118
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,170
And what about the skills that when you came out of our program, General?

119
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:15,060
AP Right. You had probably your SAS skills and all your methodologies.

120
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:22,500
Did you feel prepared? Were you ready or was it like kind of entering the workforce with what you had from our program?

121
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:31,229
I was prepared. I had I had a very good foundation and it gave me a foundation to build additional skills

122
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:37,440
on because I didn't learn all of the skills or all the methods in a two year program.

123
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,079
There were things like propensity score matching,

124
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:49,320
which is another way to balance your your cohorts on factors that may predict what medication you take.

125
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,810
Those are things that I didn't learn now, and maybe they offer the courses at this point.

126
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:03,810
But there were things I had to learn on the job, and I think my skill set here really gave me the foundation to be able to do that.

127
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,700
So you look like a cross.

128
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:14,010
Do you have any advice for us going out into the field, coming out of the program, like any things that you saw that you come across,

129
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,690
reflecting back on your experience, the things you would have done differently than what you actually had done?

130
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:27,719
I think I'm more of an introvert, and I think in hindsight I would have done more to network and reach out to people and

131
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,420
just to get just to get a better sense of the types of industry jobs that are out there.

132
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:39,180
And just to get a better sense of the culture of the different companies and what they prioritize.

133
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,950
I feel like networking is something that our students always say they want to learn more about.

134
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:49,180
Feel like it's hard to do, but you guys are networking right now by talking to Veena.

135
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:56,640
So there you go. You've already expanded your network. Um, can you talk a bit about like who the clients are for your work at?

136
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:05,470
What types of clients? So, um, primarily pharmaceutical companies like Abbott, Pfizer, Eli Lilly.

137
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,010
We also work with device companies.

138
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:18,669
One of them is called Intersect EMT and they, um, they manufacture a sinus implant for patients who have chronic rhinosinusitis.

139
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:27,790
So they insert the stand and it's supposed to open up the airways and make them feel better and make it easier for them to breathe.

140
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:32,980
So we're also doing more effectiveness studies with them on that implant.

141
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:39,940
Um, so I've noticed it's been there are more device companies with all in one than we had at Optum.

142
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,030
At Optum, I was primarily working with the pharmaceutical companies.

143
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:54,000
I said over here. As new technologies advance.

144
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,139
And, you know, the tools that you use on the job are going to be different in a few years than they were when you started.

145
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:07,379
Are there any particular skills or even just like softwares or techniques that you think is really valuable for

146
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:13,230
people entering the job force right now to have for AP students to know that'll make them more marketable?

147
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:24,300
I think no have no access or data are as important having a good foundation and the Microsoft Word or office suite.

148
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:36,470
And really I think what would be helpful is having a grasp on creating visuals like graphs, figures, because SAS is terrible at that, as we all know.

149
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:43,079
But just being able to like take take that information and not just put it in a table,

150
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:50,070
but really put it in a concise graphical form that you know, is easy to read and take away messages from.

151
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,290
And this is a question I like to ask.

152
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:08,520
What are the red flags and green flags in terms of like applications and going into interviews that you would give to people in our position?

153
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,150
The things I look for when I'm reviewing a CV or resumé is attention to detail.

154
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:22,690
Like if I start to see like typos or, you know, things that are spaced inconsistently,

155
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:31,900
I tend to step back a little bit just because the nature of the work is so detailed and it's so fast paced that it just requires,

156
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,670
you know, just a good amount of focus and attention just on even the smallest.

157
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:45,950
Just things like, for instance, and I know this sounds basic, but you want to make sure two plus two as up to four and not ten.

158
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,630
And sometimes we've had results go out to clients where they just didn't add up.

159
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:57,530
And you're thinking, how do we miss this? Yeah, that's excellent.

160
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:06,869
But also on the other turn, what like when you've walked into interviews are home and like people have asked things of you

161
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:11,129
like what are the red and green flags that you've also looked for in terms of your employers?

162
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:16,590
Like my employers, yeah, I think one of them is the culture.

163
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:24,630
It's just getting a sense of what effort or how much they invest in their employees in terms of their professional development.

164
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:31,320
Are they willing to send you to conferences so you can learn more and, you know, keep growing within your field?

165
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:39,420
Do they give you the time and space to really conduct a study and be able to write a protocol and

166
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:45,030
put that in there and to really be able to look at your analysis and and figure out what it means.

167
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:54,390
And is it accurate? A lot of companies tend to really try and crunch timelines and things that are just not realistic.

168
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,129
This manuscript writing kind of part of the job. Are you expected to be writing manuscripts?

169
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:09,910
And a lot of my job is writing protocol, writing, manuscript, writing, and it's collaborative.

170
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:14,550
I mean, you get input from your coauthors and. And so forth.

171
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:21,710
But really driving that first draft and, you know, and the development of the ball then calls out the epidemiologist.

172
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:28,450
I was also curious, what are the different other job categories of people that you're working with, like in your team?

173
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:32,310
Who are you working with? Bio statisticians or physicians?

174
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,230
Or who are the different types of people that you work with?

175
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:43,350
So I work with these statisticians so they'll, you know, collaborate with me to draft the analytic plan, for instance, for a study.

176
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:52,290
And they'll work with a research analyst to help actually program the analyzes and to review things from a statistical standpoint.

177
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:59,650
And then I'll come in more from that epidemia epidemiological standpoint to really interrogate the data and figure out what it means.

178
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:06,690
We do work with clinicians. We have a psychiatrist on board as well as a dermatologist.

179
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,160
Our chief medical officer is I'm nephrologist by training.

180
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:20,009
So they're also very helpful to trying to provide some clinical insight and having that viewpoint that I don't necessarily have,

181
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,340
especially when it comes to their special specialty fields.

182
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:30,090
We have project managers to help keep us on on task and on timeline.

183
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:38,660
If clients start asking for things that are out of the scope of what we originally agreed to do, the project manager will step in and be the bad guy.

184
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:49,680
So you don't. So yeah, we work with a wide range of people and we also have data engineers who I don't work as closely with,

185
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:55,230
but they process the data and put it in a cloud so we can use it on the research and.

186
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:06,650
Oh, sure. So how come you decided to go remote for this new position?

187
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:11,720
Or like, what are some likes, likes or dislikes versus being like in person versus like remote?

188
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,820
Yeah, that's a good question.

189
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:24,620
When I was when I started at Optum, it was initially full time in the office and then eventually it morphed into more of a hybrid role.

190
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:29,839
So I was going into the office maybe two days a week and then staying home for the other three days.

191
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:36,799
And I really liked that balance because it gave me a good work life balance to do what I needed to do at home.

192
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:42,860
But then I was still getting out, seeing my colleagues, you know, having those conversations that you don't always get, obviously.

193
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,880
But with this new opportunity to get on one,

194
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:55,160
there were no other employees in Michigan and they were willing to let me work remotely because moving just wasn't an option.

195
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:06,650
But I like the remote work. But I also miss being in an office sometimes and having those side conversations with colleagues,

196
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:14,180
because sometimes those organic conversations just give you ideas and thoughts that you can apply to your day to day.

197
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:18,680
So I do miss that. I mean, I don't mind the remote work.

198
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,720
It does give me a good amount of flexibility, but I think there are parts to being in an office too,

199
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,860
and it really depends on your personality and and how you work best.

200
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:33,500
So. Oh, yeah. So yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm kind of kind of adding on to that.

201
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:38,780
Did you have to bring like the remote position to them or did you apply to it like as a remote position?

202
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,440
I am a fly, but I was very open with the recruiter that I have.

203
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:49,420
Okay. Thank you. Yeah. That's sort of what I was going to ask, too, is like, are they?

204
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:56,320
It sounds like they're mainly hiring in the hybrid form possibly, or their like conversation happens.

205
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:03,550
I know for some of my projects we've posted some that are like hybrid or in-person and we kind of talk it through with the candidate.

206
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:11,530
Exactly. In this case, it didn't specify when I applied and I just was honest with the recruiter.

207
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:19,420
And, you know, if it didn't work out, it didn't work out. Yeah. But but I think just being transparent upfront about how you see yourself working.

208
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:25,870
Is the important thing that makes sense. Oh, hi.

209
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:33,670
I kind of like a two part question. The first one is like, what kind of programing languages do you use on your day to day work?

210
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:40,000
And then the second one is just like, do you feel like you got a lot of on the job training throughout your different roles?

211
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,130
So for the programing, languages are the different processes.

212
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,520
The data is equal and then they actually run the analysis on SAP using SAS.

213
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:57,550
And as far as on the job training, I got a lot of that at Optum just in terms of,

214
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,850
you know, shoring up my methods that I wasn't familiar with when I started.

215
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:07,710
I had a. At all. And one, I think there's a little bit less of that.

216
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:13,290
But at the same time, there are more senior people who are available to me.

217
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:19,110
So I can ask questions and talk through any study, design or analytic questions with them.

218
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,200
So it's less formal training.

219
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:29,400
I feel like with a smaller company, I think you get more that little larger company just because there are more processes in place and.

220
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:34,340
They've just been doing this at work for longer. Thank you.

221
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,329
Was there anything that drew you to the industry type career you started off?

222
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:46,219
I think with that, the more clinical health system job, I think and then made your way over to industry,

223
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,980
is there anything that drew you to that or any differences that you've seen?

224
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:57,170
I look for variety of the work because I've been exposed to different disease areas, different therapeutic areas.

225
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,270
You're not working on that thing for too long.

226
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,860
So I just like having that variety in my in my experience, in my day.

227
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:12,999
And what about the like the stability of funding and sort of the stability of the job?

228
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,610
We were hearing from another guest thinking about like jobs that were funded by grants or things like that,

229
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,420
like is this does this feel like it's sustainable, kind of secure?

230
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:26,259
I mean, I guess I know everything can change, but I know everything can change.

231
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:33,339
And layoffs have been everywhere. But I do feel like it's more secure because you're getting funding primarily

232
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:38,260
from the pharma companies and sometimes even directly from government agencies.

233
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:44,580
And you're not, you know, you're not worried about. Have your grades funded, which I don't.

234
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:53,470
I can't speak to that. People have that experience. But I know that's a concern with a lot of people in the academic and clinical space.

235
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,970
I think there's different kinds of pressures. That makes sense.

236
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,730
There's all kinds, right? Depends on what you're facing.

237
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:07,399
What about sometimes our students will ask about you or they're thinking about getting their Ph.D. someday.

238
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,090
Or they might want to go to work for a bit and then maybe go back to get their Ph.D.

239
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:16,040
Is that something that you've encountered or thought about, which is what have you seen with those opportunities?

240
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:23,020
My intention when I graduated with my age was to work for a little while and then go back and actually.

241
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:29,330
I think my work opportunities took me to another path and I didn't do it.

242
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:33,639
But I think that's also a good approach.

243
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,710
I mean, go to work for a little bit, maybe decide what you're interested in and then apply for your future.

244
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,160
But I also know people who went straight into other programs and they're doing great.

245
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:49,480
So I think it really just depends on the opportunities that are presented to you in the moment.

246
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:55,750
If you did get a stay with it, would that change the opportunities that you have at, say, 0m1 does?

247
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:01,150
Are there different things that you could do or would do? You see, people would do that online.

248
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:08,080
I could potentially be in more of a senior leadership role with my managers,

249
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,720
the vice president of research, and she has a she hasn't graduated from Harvard.

250
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:21,639
But at the same time, I also like my work life balance. Yeah, I see myself with that level of responsibility.

251
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,959
You know, I still like doing the science and being in the data.

252
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,820
And actually the further up you get, you know, you get less.

253
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,970
Your preferred location. That makes sense.

254
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:44,200
Any the other questions from the group. He was like, You don't.

255
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:53,490
I'm going back to I. It's sort of like this stability in different like grant funding versus like farmer funding.

256
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:57,020
Do you feel that being like having.

257
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:08,500
Funding from pharma influences your research in any way or like is there are there any pressures on what methods or outcomes look like?

258
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,850
That's a really good question. That comes up quite a bit.

259
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:18,880
There are people involved say that pharma is influencing how we write or interpret.

260
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,850
Our results, and we try to make it very,

261
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:32,370
very clear that we as the consulting company are the first and last senior officers who do not let as much as we can.

262
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:38,510
And we don't allow our sponsors to be anything more than a coauthor and that

263
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:42,950
we take suggestions from them while we will review them and consider them.

264
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,280
But ultimately, the decision is ours as to another one.

265
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:53,659
So it's it's a fine line, especially when, you know, they want to draw conclusions about their draws.

266
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:58,550
That may be a little too strong, but it's just something.

267
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:02,390
You work with them and you have several people involved.

268
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:11,030
I always make sure those conversations start to give a little bit, and so I have someone more senior involved for me to make those decisions.

269
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:24,030
Good. We like the question. I guess this is another kind of like tough question, so I apologize in advance.

270
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,069
But this is something that's been on my mind for actually many years.

271
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:33,690
But I'm curious if you have any advice just for women in this field,

272
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:40,860
because I already know how differently I'm treated and like the assertions I made are always questioned or my work is always double checked.

273
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:45,450
Do you have any advice or just general comments on being a woman in this field?

274
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:49,560
I can be difficult and I still struggle with that sometimes.

275
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:57,060
Yeah, I just make sure my voice is heard and I will keep repeating what I say until.

276
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:05,580
You hear it? I know at the beginning I was like, okay, I'll say this once and I'm sure they heard me and it's fine.

277
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:12,379
But sometimes you just have to keep. Repeating yourself and speaking your voices only listen.

278
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:18,220
And it's it's hard. And I do feel like I have to sometimes back up my.

279
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:25,530
You know, whatever I'm saying with more evidence, I guess, or more documentation.

280
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:33,730
Yeah. I mean, I think that's unfortunately.

281
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:40,260
A thing that happens. Luckily for me, I feel like I have a very supportive group now.

282
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:45,560
And people are very open minded. But yeah, it's difficult.

283
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:51,379
Was curious a make up two of the employees like is it half and half, you know, male female.

284
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,680
Just curious. Like what? We have a lot a lot of women in public health.

285
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,610
But what does it look like in the company that you work for?

286
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,360
Well, I would say in the what we call research, which is epidemiology and biostatistics, it's mostly female.

287
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:10,610
We have more male statisticians. More female epidemiologists.

288
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:20,280
When you look at our data engineering group and like the the artificial intelligence data science group, all men.

289
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:31,870
They just hired one woman. And I just I hope she goes, well, I'm not saying this to be negative, but they have a very different way of interacting.

290
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,420
And I think as a woman, it's really hard to break into.

291
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:49,660
Interesting. So are companies like oh and one of them hiring like what is it like, you know, as,

292
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:57,719
as our students are thinking about their time to be looking for jobs and getting their applications out, like when should they be looking?

293
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:05,549
What's the best way to keep an eye out for postings like LinkedIn is a really good place and eventually the recruiters will

294
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:11,790
start looking at your profiles and start connecting with you and you'll start getting you may start getting messages.

295
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:16,589
Some of them are like, okay, this is totally not a good fit.

296
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:20,310
I'm not going to respond to this. And those are others where you may want to have a conversation.

297
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:27,390
Yeah. What's it like working with recruiters? Actually talk about that experience, like if someone's reached out to you.

298
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,910
I know. Yeah.

299
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:38,940
I mean, I have them reach out to me quite a bit on LinkedIn and sometimes they just say, Well, okay, we think you're a great fit for this.

300
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:44,249
Why don't you set up some time with me and we'll talk. And then there's the other time.

301
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:48,120
We're all available tomorrow from 9 to 10. You want to talk to me about this?

302
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:56,380
And I'm thinking. Yeah. What sorts of things are like the record is looking for to be on their like LinkedIn pages?

303
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,739
Um, I think a lot of them are looking for the experience.

304
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,570
So if you can see publications with some of your LinkedIn.

305
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:13,180
They'll look at those, your actual professional experience and job titles, which you get over time, and that doesn't happen overnight.

306
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:24,770
But I think any descriptions you can provide about the work you've done during the unpaid internships, any publications you've been a part of?

307
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:35,760
I think recruiters do still things. And a lot of it is just applying straight out for the jobs and seeing what happens.

308
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:48,590
I've noticed since the pandemic, there have been a lot more job postings and more flexibility in terms of location.

309
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:52,770
That's good. And the other questions.

310
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:08,730
Oh. I'm wondering in your experience how you what the opportunities have been for vertical movement in becoming

311
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:15,750
more specialized versus moving into more of a manager role if there's more opportunity one way or the other.

312
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:20,860
I think that depends on the company also and the size of the company.

313
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:31,030
I felt like without them there was less opportunity for that vertical movement, especially in some more of that managerial area.

314
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:39,580
But all of mine, I'm finding that I am able to have more opportunities for vertical movement, probably because there would be more layers.

315
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:50,400
And when I expressed interest in looking into management and exploring that, I was able to get the opportunity even on a temporary basis.

316
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:05,229
All right. If no other questions, then my last question for you is just what advice might you have for our students or anything to leave

317
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:10,060
them with as they're thinking about what they're going to do after they finish their MPH program?

318
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:18,700
I would say don't be afraid to network and reach out to people on LinkedIn and them to know, you know, just introduce yourself briefly and.

319
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,190
Let them know why you're interested in maybe having a conversation with them.

320
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:27,150
You'd be surprised at how many people respond to a request like that.

321
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:32,240
It's good. It's something I never did. And I wish I did in hindsight.

322
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:37,010
That's great. And can our students reach out to you then, if they have questions after anything?

323
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:43,200
We'll post my LinkedIn and my perfect.

324
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:47,010
They're good that that'll be there. And well, I can share this out with the class.

325
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,249
So awesome. Well, thank you, Bina.

326
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:57,860
Thank you so much for coming with often, you know, taking her time to talk about her work and everything and enjoy those questions.

327
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:03,920
I really appreciate it. Next week we actually have Katy Macomber coming from DHHS.

328
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:09,350
She'll be talking about her work at the school and DHHS with a focus on wellness.

329
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:15,709
So really thinking through the challenging times that that our public health workers have faced, especially through the pandemic.

330
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:21,980
And really how she's tried to lead the group that she supervises and keep people hanging

331
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:27,170
out and surviving and maybe even possibly thriving a little bit during that hard time.

332
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:31,280
So I think it's a really interesting talk. So you'll please join us for Katie next week.

333
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,750
And then after that, we'll actually have more.

334
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:38,750
Another focus on specifically on careers in government and public health, which at both the state and local health department representative.

335
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:43,930
So those will be fun ones too. Thanks. Everybody will be here if you need anything or have any questions.

336
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,780
Okay. Have a good day once again. Thank you.

337
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:56,900
It's nice meeting you. You know.
