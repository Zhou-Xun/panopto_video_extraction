1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,640
Social Determinants of Health.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,790
The Influences of Ethnic Identity and
Discrimination.

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,980
As we consider social determinants of
health, we must consider root causes/ And

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,500
key determinants of health
differences observed.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,280
Fear and just opportunities to be healthy,

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:24,910
require a focus on structural conditions
that contribute to health risk factors.

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,050
Differences in health
outcome can be attributed to,

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,450
inadequate income,
one socioeconomic position.

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,070
And the quality of the physical and

10
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:38,740
social environments as examples
of structural influences.

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,630
In addition, family context,

12
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:46,510
household composition,
parental involvement, employment status.

13
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,302
And working conditions must be considered.

14
00:00:50,302 --> 00:00:55,350
Individual factors such as, race, gender,
childhood trauma, exposure to violence.

15
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,980
And the ability to cope with
adverse experiences, matter.

16
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,300
Culture is also a contributor
to health through ,for example,

17
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,630
the influences of belief system,
cultural practices.

18
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:14,738
Linguistic heritage, and immigration and
acculturation experiences.

19
00:01:14,738 --> 00:01:19,570
Moreover, family context, individual
factors, and cultural experiences.

20
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:25,014
Interact with structural conditions
to produce inequalities in health.

21
00:01:25,014 --> 00:01:28,810
Let's take the case example
of Arab American Health.

22
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,691
An understudied population for

23
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:34,745
understanding social determinants
of physical and mental health.

24
00:01:34,745 --> 00:01:39,420
With 3.7 million Arab Americans
living in the United States.

25
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,920
One of the biggest challenges to
research on Arab American health.

26
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,390
Is the lack of specific ethnic identify
clarifications on most official forms.

27
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,120
Arab Americans are typically
classified as White

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,030
because of their origins
from the Middle East.

29
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:59,940
The lack of a specific category for Arab
Americans in the United States census.

30
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,980
Limits our ability to identify health
disparities, and address health needs for

31
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,648
this population from
a national perspective.

32
00:02:08,648 --> 00:02:14,270
The Census Bureau's currently testing the
implications of including a Middle East.

33
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,750
And North African category
in the 2020 census,

34
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,350
like other ethnic minority
groups in this country.

35
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,350
The influence of stress, stigma,
and discrimination on health and

36
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,180
mental health.

37
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,840
Are critical determinants of health, in
addition to immigration and acculturation.

38
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,808
Past research has demonstrated
the damaging influences of

39
00:02:34,808 --> 00:02:37,595
discrimination on Arab American women.

40
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:42,657
For example, Lauderdale and Colleagues
conducted a study of birth outcomes for

41
00:02:42,657 --> 00:02:45,170
Arab-named women in California.

42
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,622
Before and after September 11, 2001.

43
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:55,420
This study's important because Arab women
typically had low risk for preterm births.

44
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,210
Their findings showed an increase
in discrimination and

45
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,240
harassment after September 11th.

46
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,090
Also, Arab women were 34% more likely
to experience low birth weight and

47
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,085
preterms birth.

48
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:12,400
Six months after September 11 than before,

49
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,250
because of maternal stress
linked to discrimination.

50
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,010
Other women in California had no
change in birth outcomes before and

51
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,865
after September 11th.

52
00:03:24,865 --> 00:03:28,690
These findings support other research
documenting the detrimental effects of

53
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,470
racial discrimination on health.

54
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,610
They also support the need for
a biopsychosocial framework for

55
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,820
examining discrimination in health.

56
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:44,030
The biopsychosocial framework
can address internalized racism.

57
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,980
Or acceptance of society's negative
characterization of a racial or

58
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,420
an ethnic group that can
adversely affect health.

59
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,060
Racism, which creates conditions that
increase exposure to structural stressors.

60
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:01,590
Such as, poverty, unemployment, and
residential conditions and restrictions.

61
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,520
Cumulative exposures to chronic stressors,
with implications for

62
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,680
health anticipatory stressors.

63
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:15,910
Or anticipatory vigilance that matter,
and experiences of discrimination.

64
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:22,298
That may be an overlooked psychosocial
stressor in health outcomes.

65
00:04:22,298 --> 00:04:26,628
More research is required to assist with
identifying relevant health disparities

66
00:04:26,628 --> 00:04:29,608
for the Arab American population.

67
00:04:29,608 --> 00:04:31,171
What would you do?
