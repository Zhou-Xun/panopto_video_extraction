00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:09,821
Hi, welcome back to Public Health 513.

2
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:14,420
In this module, we will discuss negotiation.

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,760
It is a very important skill you'll need for

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,260
the success for your professional career.

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,060
I will also go so far as to suggest that,

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,850
knowing how to negotiate or benefit every aspect of your personal life,

7
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:37,591
making you a happier, most satisfied and more confident person.

8
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:44,210
Like it or not, or whether you know it or not, we all are negotiators.

9
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,150
We negotiate on a regular, perhaps daily basis.

10
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:55,040
Many of the negotiations we take part in, are informal and not so obvious to us.

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,490
For example, persuading your daughter to put on a coat

12
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,850
before she goes off to school on a freezing day.

13
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,560
Discussing with your husband about

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,370
whose responsibility it is to drive your daughter to her piano lessons,

15
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:16,130
or haggling over the price of a new Subaru Outback with a car dealership.

16
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,208
Other negotiations may be more formal.

17
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:22,970
Working on a work plan and deciding how to share the work

18
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:28,640
with a co-worker, hammering out a contract with a supplier,

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,150
convincing a client to accept a late deliver, discussing the terms

20
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,720
of a job offer with a recorder or more relevant to us,

21
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,810
to many of us or all of us, asking your boss for a salary increase.

22
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,890
The list of negotiations can go on and on and on.

23
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:57,900
The bottom line is this, no matter where you work and no matter what your job is,

24
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,790
you need to know how to negotiate, this is non-negotiable.

25
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,760
A few years ago, Thomas Friedman, a New York Times columnist,

26
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,380
wrote a best selling book on globalization.

27
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:18,000
He basically argued that new technologies, information, people,

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,740
and commerce activities are convergings to create a flattened and

29
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,610
more competitive world.

30
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,740
Therefore, the book title, The World is Flat.

31
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:35,340
In a way, organizations are becoming flat, or flatter too,

32
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,510
because we have come to rely less on hierarchy to get things done,

33
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:46,600
because there are more of fast innovations that compel us to change.

34
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,950
Because information is much easier to access usually right at the tip

35
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:59,300
of our fingers and because the workplace has become a lot more diverse.

36
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,880
Diversity as we know means differences.

37
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,010
Differences can potentially lead to conflicts

38
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,760
because of unproductive misunderstandings.

39
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,670
Fortunately, all these undesirable outcomes can be prevented and

40
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,800
mitigated by effective negotiation.

41
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,180
Having said that, I'm certain that very few of you

42
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,491
will consider yourselves an ultra negotiator meaning who has

43
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:33,260
mastered the art of negotiation and love negotiating.

44
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,020
Most of you, I'm sure, don't like negotiation.

45
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,910
More likely, you may avoid negotiating, even when the avoidance works

46
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,890
to your detriment, preventing you from getting what you want and deserve.

47
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,810
The fact that you don't like negotiation and

48
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,310
try to void it whenever you could is actually quite understandable.

49
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,440
It is very common among us.

50
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,730
The feeling I believe, is primarily due to a misconception that negotiation is like

51
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:06,000
a tug-of-war and is a zero sum game, a win-lose situation.

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,490
And whether you are a winner or loser, there are always bad feelings.

53
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:18,640
As a matter of fact, negotiation doesn't have to be a zero sum game or

54
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,010
a win-lose situation.

55
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,680
I like always seeing the clip from the movie Erin Brockovich.

56
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,698
If done right, negotiation can be win-win.

57
00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:36,111
If your goal is to make a positive difference in your world as

58
00:04:36,111 --> 00:04:40,523
a public health professional, as a manager or as a leader,

59
00:04:40,523 --> 00:04:46,438
an important skill that you'll need is the ability to envision, negotiate and

60
00:04:46,438 --> 00:04:52,920
bring about sustainable agreements among parties that have conflicting positions.

61
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,150
The word I want to emphasize is sustainable.

62
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,480
Zero sum games and win-loose situations are not sustainable.

63
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,820
They lead to retaliation.

64
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,930
To be sustainable, the parties involved in negotiation

65
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:15,770
have to walk away feeling satisfied and feeling they are winners.

66
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,860
In the remainder of the module, we will explain four things,

67
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,930
four important aspects.

68
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,720
First, what negotiation is, and what it involves.

69
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,630
Second, how negotiation may help to advance interests.

70
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:37,280
Both your interests as well as the interests of your negotiation partner.

71
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,379
Third, how negotiations will be perceived as a joint problem-solving process.

72
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:52,552
And finally a 3-D strategy for solving joint problems.
