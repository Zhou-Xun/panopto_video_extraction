1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:12,120
What you want us to do, have to wait just another minute or two.

2
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:25,030
But then apparently something that is important.

3
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,130
Yeah, I think there was.

4
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:47,510
And that's why you have to talk exclusively with MAXINE.

5
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:54,360
But I just know in this crisis, which I didn't have any faith in the networks.

6
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:18,590
I am. Yeah, that's.

7
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:42,200
From a senior executive coming to terms with his sense of security in of this election.

8
00:01:43,820 --> 00:02:14,210
N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A. So we'll go ahead and get started just to be respectful of everybody's time.

9
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,420
There's four more people, three or four more people signed up, but then maybe they'll come in at the last minute.

10
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:27,350
I see a couple of new faces. Who are you here last week? Ah, you just saw Sochi.

11
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,330
Sochi at Sochi. Okay, I can see.

12
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,510
I'm trying to learn everybody's name. So you want to if you. I don't want to put you on the spot, but we introduce ourselves last week.

13
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,430
Okay. I'm Sochi. I'm from Chicago. I'm a senior in the program.

14
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,030
And I thought this sounded like an interesting question. Well, welcome.

15
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:57,140
Yeah, I'm here. Okay. I'm a senior in the U.S. program.

16
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:03,290
I'm just also interested in public policy, and it's great.

17
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,930
Well, everybody else is here last week, so welcome back.

18
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,690
I hope you guys had a great weekend. And yeah,

19
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:21,860
so today this will be the second of the long days of my just kind of going through the some introductory

20
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:29,810
toxicology and also talking about aspects of chemicals that make make the chemicals hazardous to health.

21
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:37,909
So we're going to pick up where we left off on Wednesday of last week and then we'll

22
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:42,319
also have some lecture on Wednesday and then we'll start on the case studies.

23
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,750
Yeah, I was just wondering if you want to get this to that.

24
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,530
Yes. Yeah. Did you see the hum. You pull them up really quick.

25
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,890
So if you go to canvas, if you want a module.

26
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:05,090
And I did open this week, right? Yeah. So if you go to January 9th, January 4th is where the slides for last week were.

27
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:12,470
And then I have to check and make sure because I'm notorious for posting them and

28
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:17,360
then not publishing because you have to do like an extra step to publish them.

29
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:27,230
Yeah. So the slides for today are here. And yeah, the other thing I wanted to mention is that I made up the signup sheet for the case studies.

30
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:34,309
I'm going to post that right after class, so I'll release that to all of you if you can sign up.

31
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:41,630
That would be fantastic. Our first case study is you just pull that up really quickly.

32
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,700
So this is quickly.

33
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,229
So the first case study is on January 18th.

34
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:05,800
So we're not here next Monday. So it would be it's coming up relatively soon and.

35
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:11,710
Well, actually, it's two weeks from today. Yeah. So it's not we have a little more time or about a week and a half.

36
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:21,280
It's coming up relatively soon. And I know I usually have a hard time getting people to sign up for a case study that soon.

37
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,120
Especially going first. They don't really know what to expect.

38
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:31,180
There are some example case studies, as I mentioned, posted on here.

39
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,890
These are the modules. Yeah.

40
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:44,650
So they're example case study in journal club presentations as an incentive for somebody signing up for the first case study.

41
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,490
I will remove a homework assignment for that individual.

42
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,230
So you will still have the same number of homework assignments.

43
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,970
You'll just get full credit for one and you won't have to turn it in whichever one or one of your choice.

44
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,589
So hopefully that'll incentivize somebody to sign up for that case study.

45
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:09,970
Otherwise we'll figure something else out. But does anybody have any questions before we get started?

46
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,950
Okay. So.

47
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,960
Here is. So we're going to talk about a number of different case studies in the class.

48
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:28,980
This is a picture of one that we don't cover in here, but is another good example.

49
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,910
Does anybody want to throw and I just throw out there which one they think this one is?

50
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:46,710
Yeah. So this is the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. And in addition to the ecological catastrophe that it was,

51
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:52,590
there was a lot of health issues associated with the exposure to the components of the

52
00:06:52,590 --> 00:07:01,020
oil to to any to all sorts of different volatile compounds that that make up that oil.

53
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:04,889
And so that's one example.

54
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:08,970
I try to pull up some additional examples outside of what we're going to talk about in class.

55
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,860
But another thing that I wanted to do in this class,

56
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,889
what I like to do is in each lecture I'll have a couple of starter questions or I'll have some questions kind

57
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:27,170
of interspersed throughout on the on the days when I'm giving a lecture and what these are meant to do.

58
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,580
They're similar to what will be in a homework assignment.

59
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,290
And so they'll give you a chance to kind of get a feel for what the homework assignment might look like.

60
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:42,270
And secondly, help kind of gauge where you're at thinking wise, where you're at with the material.

61
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:50,420
This these couple of questions or a combination of what we covered last week and also what we're going to be covering this week.

62
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,630
So if you encounter something that you're you're like, wait, me doesn't even talk about that yet.

63
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:01,229
We're going to get to it. So at least maybe if we don't get to it this week, we'll get to it at some point in the class.

64
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,709
These are kinds of the kinds of themes that we'll revisit regularly.

65
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:16,140
So have a look at this first one and see if anybody has any thoughts about which one of these statements makes more sense.

66
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:43,549
Yeah. Is, is he right? B Yeah, that's this is that one's the correct answer.

67
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:51,230
So the applied doses obviously is what's reaching at the site of absorption, but it may or may not be.

68
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:58,940
It's probably higher than the biologically effective dose because the the chemical has to be absorbed as it goes through the body and B,

69
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,060
metabolize and reach the actual site of its target.

70
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,700
The dose response relationship for a particular toxicant may differ between two people.

71
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,020
This is absolutely true.

72
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:19,820
And as I'll show you in a couple of examples today, hydrophilic toxicants cross cell membranes more readily than do lipophilic toxin toxicants.

73
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:27,380
This is the opposite is true, right? So the chemicals lipophilic are our skin.

74
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:38,030
The lining of our digestive tract, for example, epithelial layer of our tissue is comprised of lipid by layers.

75
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:48,290
And so chemicals that are lipophilic tend to have an easier time just crossing that lipophilic, that lipid bilayer compared to hydrophilic toxicants.

76
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,329
And then finally, to assess the effects of chemicals on humans, we talked about this last week.

77
00:09:53,330 --> 00:10:01,490
So in some cases, if you're looking at the effect of a chemical applied to the skin and whether it's causing cancer,

78
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,630
that's an easily accessible because you're doing a skin biopsy.

79
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:13,220
But if you're talking about how some volatile organic compounds, some chemical solvent is affecting the brain,

80
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,980
how LEDs affecting the brain, for example, obviously, brain tissue samples are hard to come by.

81
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,550
So here's one more question.

82
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,650
Which of the following statements is true? I'll let you read through those.

83
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:54,570
Any thoughts? Yeah.

84
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,760
Is it a yeah.

85
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:04,450
Yep. So we're out of exposure is really important when you're talking about whether a chemical is going to be toxic.

86
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:13,840
Right. Because say you've got DDT powder on your skin, it's not going to be as toxic as if you're ingesting it.

87
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,740
You're going to have to absorb weight a lot more of it and you're going to have toxicity.

88
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:25,180
But if you're if you're just getting it on your skin, that's that's going to be far less harmful.

89
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:30,770
For be toxicants most often have the same effects on both males and females.

90
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,320
This is an area of my research interest.

91
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:44,480
And what we're finding is that a lot of chemicals, a lot of drugs have very different effects on people based on sex.

92
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:52,710
And so most studies up until recently have focused only on males.

93
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:59,330
So a lot of clinical trials exclude women because of hormonal reasons or concerns about pregnancy and that type of thing.

94
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,950
And the results of these studies are affiliated to males and females.

95
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:13,490
And but we're finding that there are very that that women and men respond very differently to chemicals, drugs, toxicants, for example.

96
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:22,040
The D and absorption add me. It's absorption, distribution and metabolism and excretion as we'll talk about.

97
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:28,850
And passive diffusion does not require energy from ATP, hence the name passive.

98
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,130
So don't even have any question so far. Okay.

99
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:40,540
So we left off talking about kind of big data approaches to toxicology.

100
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:49,410
And an area that has become increasingly important in this field is the exposure zone.

101
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,700
And so. And where I talked about last week, how you can focus on how a chemical regulates a single gene.

102
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:06,090
There is there's a single gene approach versus a whole genome transcriptomics approach to understanding how chemicals affect gene expression.

103
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:14,610
There's a similar approach where instead of looking at a single chemical and how that single chemical affects our health,

104
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,360
we can look at the broad array of chemicals that we're all exposed to at any given time.

105
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:31,140
So none of us are going to be exposed to a single type of force or a single family or just one heavy metal.

106
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:37,410
We're going to bring in being exposed to all sorts of different things. So this includes reactive electro files.

107
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,770
These are chemicals that are very that attack proteins and DNA.

108
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,210
We'll get into this a little more next week and throughout the course of the semester,

109
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:51,930
metals and occurring disruptors, things that modulate our immune system and receptor binding proteins.

110
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,590
We have a whole section on just about every single one of these.

111
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,420
There is also the internal chemical environment.

112
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:08,170
So how chemicals cause inflammation, how they interact with preexisting disease.

113
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:15,360
There are effects such as lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress effects on the gut microflora.

114
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:21,269
So just kind of the in the definition here,

115
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:25,840
the exposure then represents the combined exposure from all sources that reach the internal chemical environment.

116
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:33,480
So this is an area, not my area of expertise, but certainly this is something that the field is moving toward.

117
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:41,700
A lot of epidemiology studies, for example, looking at mixtures of gas, looking at mixtures of phthalates and how they affect our health.

118
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:55,740
So dose response relationships. If you take any further toxicology mean pharmacology, you're going to encounter this concept.

119
00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:01,829
And so this is kind of one of the classic ways of depicting a dose response relationship where

120
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:09,030
you have the percentage of people who are going to respond to a given dose of the chemical,

121
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:18,510
and the majority of individuals will fall within some range of doses of chemicals, kind of like a bell curve, but you're going to have outliers.

122
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:22,560
And so if you're looking at pack years of cigarets, for example,

123
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:30,660
you can have people who are exceptionally susceptible and people who are very lucky, people who are resistant to toxicants.

124
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,370
For example, Nat King Cole died at the age of 46 of lung cancer,

125
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:42,660
whereas George Burns smoked his entire life and lived to be 100 years old and

126
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,160
died of I think he died of heart failure or something related to old age,

127
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:56,160
so not related to cigaret smoking. So there's a range of range of ways in which people respond to chemicals.

128
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,280
And this is based on a number of factors that we'll get into.

129
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:05,190
So just to kind of start thinking about this a little more,

130
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:10,679
what are some other factors that might influence our susceptibility to the adverse effects of a chemical exposure?

131
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,509
Does anybody have any thoughts? Ridge Age, absolutely.

132
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:25,110
That's a big one. As we age, obviously, our our defenses decline with age.

133
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:33,959
And that's going to make us more vulnerable to to toxicant exposures, any other genetic predispositions and hundred percent.

134
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:41,790
Yeah. So what if you have so certain people have familial cancer syndromes where they have lost one

135
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:50,070
copy of a tumor suppressor gene and they're exceptionally sensitive to things like UV light,

136
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,990
other things that are carcinogenic. But.

137
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:01,690
Most of us have the ability to repair our DNA and can tolerate them, at least up to a certain point.

138
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:08,530
Whereas people with Lynch syndrome, for example,

139
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:18,580
there's one people who have retinoblastoma have lost a copy of the the retinal r b gene, which is a tumor suppressor gene.

140
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,000
And so they are prone to developing tumors in the back of their eye.

141
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,610
So there are a number of different lifestyle factors.

142
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:31,370
Anybody have any other toxin? Yeah.

143
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:40,380
So. And you can think about even things like sleep, your nutrition for example,

144
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:47,200
if you have a diet that's deficient in calcium and iron, you're going to be more vulnerable to the effects of wide exposure.

145
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:53,760
If you if you have certain.

146
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,330
If you exercise or if you don't, there may be you may be more.

147
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,960
There may be you may be more or less vulnerable to two different chemical exposures.

148
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,820
Just depending on your overall health.

149
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:20,610
So this is another example of another way to depict a dose response relationship where you have the log, the log of the dose of the chemical.

150
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,300
In this case, it's phenobarbital. And you have an effect.

151
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:30,000
The percentage of responders on the Y axis.

152
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:37,829
And so if you're looking at your increasing the dose here and the E d 50 is the effective dose 50,

153
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:47,130
which is the dose at which 50% of respondents, 50% of the subjects respond in the way that you you want them to.

154
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,190
The lethal dose will be 50. So now we're so we're on beyond ten.

155
00:18:53,310 --> 00:19:00,750
So now we're going up in dose here. The L 50 is the dose that kills 50% of the respondents.

156
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:10,950
So some of the the outcome here is that all these 50 studies are still conducted in the pharmaceutical industry, for example.

157
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:19,200
But we've gotten away from this a lot more than what it used to be, used to be conducted a lot more than it does now,

158
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:26,040
because obviously the ethical issues surrounded with developing an experiment to directly kill things.

159
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,950
So this is these are kind of classic 80, 50.

160
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:40,050
All these 50 you'll see these in the literature, other dose response terms that you'll come up with.

161
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:49,740
If you have a dose response curve and toxicology risk assessment, you'll see the Noel or the no observed adverse effect level.

162
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:54,330
And this is the measured dose at which there was no observed adverse effect.

163
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:01,080
And then you have let's say you took another dose measurement here and then you had doses.

164
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:08,490
These are your doses that you've measured. The lowest dose at which you're observing an adverse effect is going to be your Lowell.

165
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:16,260
And then typically for a dose response curve, you get this sigmoid old pattern and the pattern B,

166
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:21,390
the curve will plateau at the top and this represents your maximum effective dose.

167
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:33,359
So it's also notably the the Noel and the Lowell are a function of how long you're exposed to a certain chemical,

168
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:43,860
because this dose may be you may have no adverse effect for X period of time if you're exposed to it for an hour.

169
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:50,910
But maybe if you're exposed to it for six months, you're going to see a very different relationship here.

170
00:20:52,410 --> 00:21:01,980
So that's important to note. So the dose response curve can be affected by our lifestyle factors.

171
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:13,050
For example, people who consume alcohol chronically are going to be more vulnerable to liver failure from acetaminophen.

172
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:24,330
So you may know that acetaminophen, if you take it out really high doses or you take or you're taking it for a very prolonged period of time,

173
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,500
can lead to liver failure, leads to liver damage.

174
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,980
So you have your therapeutic dose of acetaminophen over here.

175
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:41,000
And the therapeutic effect is, you know, diminishing your headache or your muscle pain.

176
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:48,120
And you have to get up to in a non alcoholic, you have to get up to, you know, 8 to 10 grams per day.

177
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,930
And these are just generic numbers, examples.

178
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,820
So you have to get up to this level to see liver failure.

179
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:04,120
But if you are an alcoholic, you're going to have liver failure at a much lower dose of acetaminophen.

180
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,390
So you have to be much more careful. And this is why have you heard this?

181
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:15,389
I remember people telling us this in college and I didn't really know what, why, what, why?

182
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,850
At a molecular level, this was a concern.

183
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:24,570
But they would tell you, don't take if you're going to go out drinking, don't take acetaminophen and take something else for headaches.

184
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:32,219
I don't think this is as much of a concern unless you are an alcoholic or you're drinking heavily all the time.

185
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,400
That I would have. I'd never. And then there's other painkillers.

186
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,340
So I mix acetaminophen with alcohol. You don't even have to.

187
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:49,740
And we'll get into a little more detail about why how acetaminophen exacerbates or how liver failure in acetaminophen cooperate to.

188
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,630
Oh, I'm just tired today how alcohol in a set of.

189
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:06,930
Often cooperate to produce liver failure. Another type of dose response and I want to touch on is the concept of jaw misses.

190
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,230
Has anybody heard about this like for medic stress?

191
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:21,620
This is a very this concept is touched on a lot in the in people who are really interested in longevity and types of

192
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:29,690
lifestyle approaches that might increase our resilience to disease and increase our health span in our life span.

193
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:35,480
And this idea is that there is a dose that is stimulatory and presumably

194
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:41,300
beneficial at a low dose that's that's stimulatory and presumed to be beneficial,

195
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,930
but it can be inhibitory at high doses.

196
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,190
And so what this produces is a you or j-shaped dose response curve.

197
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:55,520
And I'll show you that in just a moment. And this is exhibited by some nutrients and hormonal substances.

198
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:01,030
It's not always clear that the stimulatory effects are beneficial. It depends on it depends on the chemical.

199
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,680
It depends on the stimulus that you're talking about.

200
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:15,440
But this concept of horny says it's the idea that exposing yourself to some low level of stress will make you more resilient to disease later on.

201
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:21,620
Whereas you want to have a level of stress that is that is effective at.

202
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,850
Helping you become more resilient but not so, so severe that it causes injury, if that makes sense.

203
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,170
So people will.

204
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:40,720
A lot of people are into cryogenic ice baths exposures or there's these facilities where you can go have, I don't know, liquid nitrogen.

205
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,809
You can get exposed safely somehow to liquid nitrogen.

206
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:51,740
And I've never had these and never had any of these treatments or things like hot yoga, sauna.

207
00:24:53,780 --> 00:25:03,740
There are all these different stressors that activate pathways that make us more resilient to subsequent insults.

208
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:12,740
And so this is actually a this is from a paper and it put the reference in there.

209
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:19,820
I'll go in there and fix that. But this is from a paper actually where they're comparing the linear no threshold model.

210
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:25,550
So this would be the idea that any amount of a chemical is going to have some adverse effect.

211
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,670
So this would this is very common.

212
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,840
This paper actually refers to radiation or misses.

213
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:41,690
So the way that we've evaluated the effects of radiation and its potential to cause cancer is that there is no threshold, right?

214
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:53,060
No, there's no safe dose of radiation. But there's actually a group, a camp of people who feel that if you provide a small dose of radiation,

215
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:59,030
that it will upregulate pathways that will protect you across the course of your life.

216
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:06,200
But obviously, you're going to reach some threshold where that becomes toxic.

217
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:14,090
And I'm not in there. I'm not a radiation expert, so I don't really have an opinion on this one way or the other.

218
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:22,490
I would say the vast majority of people still subscribe to the idea that any amount of radiation you probably want to avoid.

219
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:32,240
But yeah, is the amount of the protective face like is that known like the dosage of how much radiation is considered safe or is that still debated?

220
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,040
And it's still very much debated.

221
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:43,520
And there are people who debate whether it's even safe at all and it's going to be highly dependent on the individual.

222
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:50,510
You know, how much how much radiation exposure have they had over the course of their life or how much other, you know, exposure to other chemicals?

223
00:26:52,460 --> 00:27:00,350
You see this type of dose response for for things like vitamins.

224
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:03,890
So you need vitamins at a very, very small dose.

225
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:11,450
And let's say this is the let's say this is some adverse event event like cognitive decline.

226
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:17,420
And so things like B12, iron, they're really important for normal cognitive function.

227
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:28,010
And if you have the dose that's in the healthy range, you're going to have a beneficial effect.

228
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,440
But if you get out here, then you're encountering toxicity.

229
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:37,430
Since this all makes sense, you know what is going to stand for again, linear, non threshold.

230
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:44,060
Yeah. So that type of model is used for things like radiation.

231
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:48,559
Is this like a similar mindset, like when parents introduce their children to like peanuts,

232
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,010
for example, so they don't become like allergic to peanuts and they're older.

233
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:56,030
So like they like give them a little bit of it is a similar concept.

234
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:07,309
Yeah. Kind of. In that case you are activating your, your, your body is learning to not to recognize that as,

235
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:12,230
as a as a toxic exposure because you're seeing you're seeing it in very small doses,

236
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:19,550
whereas if you if you, you know, aren't exposed to it and then say you're prone to developing an allergy to it,

237
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:24,830
then then that's that becomes a problem. So yeah, yeah.

238
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:29,240
It's the idea that the dose makes the the dose makes the poison.

239
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:36,270
Right. And the other questions. Okay.

240
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:41,400
So moving to how chemicals get into the body, how they get out,

241
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:47,760
what are some ways we talked about this already, so you know how the chemicals get in the body?

242
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:55,950
How do they how do they get out? Chemicals and adjusting inhalation, dermal pressure.

243
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,480
Yeah. Ingestion, inhalation, dermal.

244
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,090
Those are the type. Those are the major ones. Things can get in, you know, through your eyes.

245
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:16,800
There's other, you know, minor routes of entry to the skin lungs and GI tract are the big ones might arouse include injection

246
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:23,970
wounds or yeah you get something some things you can get exposed to by you splash something in your eye.

247
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:34,950
So in order for absorption, distribution and excretion to occur, toxicants have to cross cellular and tissue barriers.

248
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:41,110
So I'm just going to show this quick. This video was like less than a minute.

249
00:29:41,110 --> 00:30:10,299
And I think it provides a nice illustration of how a chemical absorbed in our skin can get into the cells inside our body across a lipid bilayer.

250
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,050
And your skin begins shivering.

251
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:22,340
Skin too interstitial fluid between your skin and your capillaries in your blood.

252
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,740
There's another interstitial layer between your blood vessel and your tissue.

253
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:40,500
Now it's inside your cells and then it can cross your organelles also have membranes and it can get inside of different organelles,

254
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:47,940
nucleus, mitochondria. For example, I wanted to I forgot to mention this at the beginning of class, but this talks.

255
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,600
Tudor is a really great site. Have any of you check this out before?

256
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:57,209
It's a really great site for just providing a basic overview of toxicology.

257
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:01,650
So it has all sorts of topics that we're going to touch on in this class.

258
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,329
But we go through things pretty quickly.

259
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:11,850
And because this is such a this is just one semester, we can only kind of give a high level touch on these at a higher level.

260
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:19,920
So these dig in a little bit more and provide some more in-depth resources if you're interested in learning things in more detail.

261
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:27,389
The cancer and duals toxicology textbook that I have in the syllabus is like,

262
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:33,480
if you want everything down to the the detail, that book is going to be excellent.

263
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,860
But it's quite big and it is very, very detailed.

264
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,099
So that's something for kind of supplemental reading.

265
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:50,370
If you if you feel like you really want to learn, you know, at a level that we're not able to dive into in this class, that's a great resource.

266
00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:00,240
So. Memory cell membranes are selectively permeable.

267
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,760
As I mentioned, you have the lipid bilayer.

268
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:11,580
You have things like cholesterol which control the rigidity of the membrane and then within the cell membrane you have.

269
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:15,840
So this is your extracellular fluid and this is the inside of your cell here.

270
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:22,379
On the cell membrane, you have channel proteins that span the entire length of the cell membrane.

271
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:29,100
So they go from the cytoplasm in the intracellular space all the way to the extracellular fluid.

272
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:39,720
And this is how chemicals, this is how things like micronutrients, magnesium, calcium, etc., get into cells.

273
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,760
This is also how things like lead, cadmium.

274
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:51,390
They can hitch a ride on these transporters that we use to absorb beneficial nutrients.

275
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:57,360
And then there's other types of proteins that we'll get into in more detail on Wednesday,

276
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,070
where we'll talk about how chemicals can modify the functions of proteins.

277
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:12,420
So as I mentioned, this cell membrane forms a lipophilic barrier and ion channels form pores for

278
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:17,940
selective diffusion of small hydrophilic molecules like different metal ions.

279
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:22,440
And then there are selective carrier proteins that actually transport molecules.

280
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:34,150
So there are few different cellular membrane transport processes that are important to think about in the context of toxicology.

281
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:40,750
The first one is simple passive diffusion. This would be the unassisted movement along a concentration gradient.

282
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:44,620
So it requires a concentration gradient. It does not require ATP.

283
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,950
So, for example, if you are inhaling benzene,

284
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:55,450
benzene is going to cross is going to get down into your lungs in the alveoli and cross

285
00:33:55,510 --> 00:34:02,980
the the layer across the alveoli into your capillaries and into your bloodstream.

286
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:10,690
And that's a passive process. Facilitated passive diffusion would be movement via special transport proteins.

287
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:17,200
This is not ATP dependent. This is, for example, a metal cation exchanger.

288
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,070
So a sodium, sodium, potassium exchanger.

289
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:27,549
And there again does not require ATP.

290
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,860
And then there's also active membrane transport.

291
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:42,190
And these are so like the sodium potassium ATP ace is one example of that that requires ATP to pump ions out against a concentration gradient.

292
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:52,059
And we you don't need to. As I mentioned, we'll use several examples throughout the course of the semester to illustrate some of these.

293
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,710
This is just kind of giving you an overview of some toxicology concepts.

294
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:09,860
So what properties promote passive diffusion? The lipophilic city of a toxicant determines whether it's going to diffuse across the cell membrane.

295
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:21,590
This is quantified by a partition coefficient, so you don't need to memorize the partition coefficient other than knowing that if a.

296
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:31,130
So a partition coefficient is the ratio of a concentration of a chemical that is soluble in water.

297
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:37,520
So they usually use alcohol all in water. So there's an organic phase and there's a water in aqueous phase.

298
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:43,280
And if that chemical is more soluble in the water phase, then it's more hydrophilic and vice versa.

299
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:47,000
And that's that's how you get to the partition coefficient.

300
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:54,079
It's technically the concentration of the chemical that partitions into the

301
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:59,270
aqueous phase over the concentration that partitions into the organic phase.

302
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:07,250
So you can think just kind of qualitatively how that reflects how lipophilic a chemical is.

303
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:13,910
And then small hydrophilic molecules can diffuse through membrane ion channels.

304
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:21,110
Open channels can allow the diffusion of toxicants that meets some channel selectivity characteristics.

305
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:28,630
For example, if you have a die valence cation such as lead, it has a to plus charge.

306
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,940
It kind of looks like calcium in some ways at a molecular level.

307
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:37,700
And so life can kind of travel and similar mechanisms in the body to calcium.

308
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:45,920
This usually applies to small ionic toxicants. Large hydrophilic molecules are not going to diffuse across cell membranes.

309
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:54,320
So simple passive diffusion. How what factors affect the rate of simple passive diffusion?

310
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:10,040
There is a chemical B formula called fixed loss where the K is constant A is the surface area at the site of absorption C two minus C one.

311
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:17,360
This is the concentration gradient across the membrane and then D is the thickness at the site of absorption.

312
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:21,290
So you can see D is in the denominator, right.

313
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:31,730
So what happens if you what happens if you increase the surface area at the site of absorption, you're going to get more more diffusion or less.

314
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:40,280
Based on based on this formula. Just based on intuitively what you might think.

315
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:43,940
Confusion. Yeah. What happens if you.

316
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,470
What happens is the barrier or the sort of absorption is thicker.

317
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,710
Was less. Yeah. So. So that's why this is in the denominator.

318
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:58,000
So if you're dividing by a bigger number, this this rate is going to get smaller.

319
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,909
So these are this formula.

320
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:05,239
I'm not going to give you calculations to work out for this,

321
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:14,330
but just kind of intuitively or qualitatively helps you understand what factors affect diffusion across an epithelial layer.

322
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:28,360
So I'll go through a few the skin. I'll go through a few different organs that play an important role in absorption and excretion of chemicals.

323
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,120
And then in about 5 minutes, I'll take a quick break.

324
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:39,490
So the skin, because it's the body covering the skin, is the first line of defense.

325
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:46,300
And the outer most layer or the stratum cornea is this layer right here.

326
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:51,600
I don't expect you to memorize all of the the structures of the skin.

327
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:56,260
I have an image of here the lung, the kidneys, some other organs.

328
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:59,230
That's beyond the scope of this class.

329
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:07,980
But what I do just want to illustrate some components of this that are relevant to the absorption or distribution or excretion of the toxicant.

330
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:18,219
So this area, the stratum cornea, is the most important barrier because it's really high in the level of the protein keratin.

331
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:22,450
So it's a very tends to be thicker and harder to penetrate.

332
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:31,110
Although we have these protective layers, we have this our skin is our protective layer.

333
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:41,070
There is some role for skin absorption of different chemicals, for example, volatile organic chemicals and drinking water.

334
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:44,090
This is an old paper. This is from 1984.

335
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:53,010
But I think it's interesting just to illustrate that we do absorb some chemicals through our skin, for example.

336
00:39:53,010 --> 00:40:00,450
So so this is talking about how assessments of drinking water safety rely on the assumption that ingestion is the principal route of exposure.

337
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:05,160
But you're showering every day in in this same water.

338
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:16,620
And they actually found that there was a significant component of skin absorption for volatile organic compounds that are in drinking water.

339
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:21,600
And they concluded that skin absorption has been underestimated and that just

340
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:25,440
ingestion may not constitute the sole or even the primary route of exposure.

341
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,770
There have been further further studies on this,

342
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:38,190
but it's clear that that there is the skin is an important mechanism for absorption of chemicals, too.

343
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:41,640
So that's one example.

344
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,510
What are some other examples of chemicals that are absorbed through the skin?

345
00:40:46,560 --> 00:41:01,330
Anybody. One example that sticks out in my mind are phthalates.

346
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:15,249
So phthalates are plasticizers that are found in not only things like food, packaging, medical, medical tubing that is really high in phthalates.

347
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:26,530
So you get a lot of family exposure. If you are, say, in the ICU and you're on a feeding tube or breathing tube or you have you're on dialysis.

348
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:34,480
But there's also phthalates are also found in things like personal care products.

349
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:37,900
So they help perfume, for example.

350
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:46,149
They help perfume adhere to the skin. So you may have some you may have tried different types of body spray or perfume.

351
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:53,830
And you'll notice that you put it on and it's like the smell is gone after an hour and then some of them stick with you for like two weeks.

352
00:41:55,210 --> 00:42:04,210
Phthalates add different components. Phthalates are one important component of that that affect how well the chemical adheres to your skin.

353
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:12,130
So I still occasionally wear her human body spray, but something to think about when you're using some of these products.

354
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:19,690
So there are different types of lipophilic chemicals that are that can be found in cosmetics and personal care products.

355
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,010
Yeah. Any federal restrictions on phthalates?

356
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:27,520
Yeah, there have been.

357
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:36,690
I'm not sure what the formal restrictions are around that. Certain chemicals like bisphenol A have been banned.

358
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:40,110
Phthalates are still widely found in.

359
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:50,940
And like I said, personal care products, housing, building materials, food, packaging, they aren't really highly regulated.

360
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:59,220
And this is a problem with we have a very permissive regulatory environment for chemicals.

361
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:06,959
Lots of chemicals are released onto the market and then the burden is sort of on the consumer to show that there's toxicity.

362
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,660
So there is some toxicity testing that is done by the EPA, for example.

363
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:22,050
But most of the there's just the there's so many chemicals that are released that companies are generating and we just can't keep up.

364
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:28,620
The EPA is relatively small and they can't test every chemical that's that's in commerce right now.

365
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,600
So, you know, I was going to say that. Oh, yeah, go ahead.

366
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:39,150
I was Andrew's. But it's like other descriptors on the receipts.

367
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,290
Yeah. That's bisphenol A is on.

368
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:48,750
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I seen. So I always like I never take receipts, I don't know.

369
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:52,049
It's just like weird. It's, it's like, oh, I don't want that.

370
00:43:52,050 --> 00:44:00,360
That's gross. But yeah, they have phased out Bisphenol A from children's toys and that type of thing.

371
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:05,280
And, and so there is some regulation of that.

372
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,689
But what happens is they they ban bisphenol A.

373
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:14,130
So now chemical companies have developed similar chemicals.

374
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,390
So it's not bisphenol A, it's bisphenol F or S.

375
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:25,470
And so then the research community is trying to catch up and actually show, no, this final absence is toxic, too.

376
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,000
It has its own problems.

377
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:34,290
So this is kind of there's kind of a chemical Whac-A-Mole process that goes on with these chemicals, which which is really frustrating.

378
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:40,500
Yeah. So chemicals exposed, the chemicals absorbed through the lungs.

379
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:45,620
It's kind of not a not a trick question.

380
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,309
There's lots of things where we're inhaling in a given day.

381
00:44:49,310 --> 00:45:01,180
Right. Cigaret smoke and think about air pollution and particulates, volatile organic compounds.

382
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:08,660
When you've chlorinated drinking water, then you have volatile organic compounds in the shower, maybe in the swimming pool.

383
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,430
I love to swim, so I'm going to swim no matter what.

384
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:19,510
I swim out at the at the lakes around here, even though I know that there's pee fast and other things in the lake.

385
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:23,920
So you just kind of think about, you know, there's always trade offs, right?

386
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:30,130
You have to think about what what risk you're willing to tolerate to to get a certain amount of joy out of life.

387
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:36,200
So. There are. Those are some good examples.

388
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:44,420
So the respiratory tract, because of its high surface area, is effective for absorption of gases.

389
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:50,719
Aerosols, particulate and toxicants absorb from the lungs are returned to the heart,

390
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,740
and then they're directly circulated throughout the body so they don't pass through the liver first.

391
00:45:55,610 --> 00:46:02,810
And this is important because they're not they're not undergoing any sort of metabolism or breakdown by the liver.

392
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:08,600
And it's interesting. So the lungs,

393
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,819
as you as you've probably seen in a picture branch out into these smaller and smaller

394
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:18,650
branches and eventually they terminate in these tiny little bags called alveoli.

395
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,450
And so the lungs aren't just these gigantic bags.

396
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:29,179
They have they're are broken down into these alveoli that have a really high surface area.

397
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:33,650
And if you were to take the surface area of a of the alveoli in a lung,

398
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:42,470
I've heard the the estimation that the surface area is as large as a tennis court, so very high surface area.

399
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:49,550
And because of that very efficient absorption of oxygen, which is great, but also you pick up other garbage in your environment.

400
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:54,950
Most gases are non ionized and absorbed into the blood by simple passive diffusion.

401
00:46:54,950 --> 00:47:00,320
So something like benzene, for example, methylene chloride is I'll touch on in a minute.

402
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:06,650
Particulates undergo phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages.

403
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:15,980
So we have a whole section on this and how that promotes lung inflammation, fibrosis, lung cancer and then the capillary beds.

404
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:25,640
So there are these massive networks of capillary beds that surround the alveoli and provide opportunity for absorption of oxygen and also other,

405
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:33,860
unfortunately, chemicals into the bloodstream. And then this is the last slide I'll talk about before we take a five minute break.

406
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:42,169
And this is an article from 2018 that was talking about a number of deaths there.

407
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:50,870
So there's there have been many, many deaths in this country linked to a paint stripper chemical called methylene chloride.

408
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:54,650
And the deaths were going back for decades.

409
00:47:54,980 --> 00:48:01,250
And for the longest time, I think this chemical is on the market until I think it was finally banned in 2019.

410
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:10,580
But they were finding this that these people could go, you know, people who are kind of the they wanted to do it yourselfers.

411
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:18,080
They wanted to renovate their house, you know, strip the paint from their bathroom and, you know, replace their bathroom or whatever.

412
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:28,310
And these people could go to Amazon or to Home Depot and buy these paint strippers, and they contain this chemical called methylene chloride.

413
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:32,569
And a number of people died because we all do this.

414
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:36,559
I think to some extent when we're in our house, we kind of let down our guard.

415
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,800
And you don't really think about your house being a dangerous place.

416
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:45,230
The chemicals that you use in your house, the you know, you're still there.

417
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:54,349
There are things you can you can have fires. You can have dangerous chemical exposure, spills, burns, whatever, you know, where, where.

418
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:57,829
And the research lab were always wearing our personal protective equipment.

419
00:48:57,830 --> 00:49:03,319
But when we're at home, I personally I don't know if there's chemicals in our house.

420
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:09,950
I'm always like very, very aware of ventilation and I don't want my kids breathing garbage and I send them outside.

421
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:17,180
We don't do any house repairs or we try not to do anything in the winter where you can open the windows.

422
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:28,730
But people would buy this and then, you know, they'd be found in their bathroom dead like they suffocated as a result of exposure to this chemical.

423
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:35,900
And the reason that it is so insidious is that methylene chloride is metabolized to carbon monoxide.

424
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:43,490
So if you know that methylene chloride causes a buildup of carbon monoxide in the bloodstream,

425
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:51,050
what are some other factors that might influence whether a person is more vulnerable to toxicity from methylene chloride?

426
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:56,090
Anybody? Ferrous smoker?

427
00:49:56,630 --> 00:50:03,710
Yeah, absolutely. So so somebody who smokes is going to have a high baseline level of carbon monoxide in their bloodstream.

428
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:13,630
The others. You can think about.

429
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:20,470
And this has been brought up a lot during the COVID pandemic, where people have these oxygen,

430
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:28,750
people are buying these oxygen meters that they put on your fingers that measure the percent oxygen saturation in your bloodstream.

431
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:30,640
If you have some sort of breathing,

432
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:42,640
some sort of issue where you where you're not getting adequate oxygen delivered through your tissues or through breathing,

433
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:47,620
that could be that could make you more vulnerable to the effects of a toxicant like this.

434
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:57,070
So, yeah, this is kind of illustrates that there are different lifestyle factors that can influence whether something is this toxic to you or not.

435
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:04,300
I think I'm going to stop there and it's 1221.

436
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:12,710
Let's just come back at 1226, maybe a few seconds after that.

437
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:16,750
I thought we'd just take a quick break. Anybody have any questions?

438
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:25,180
All right. Actually, first I have to run to the restroom, and we're not on this floor.

439
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:41,820
I can't believe that the first part of registration, number one.

440
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:55,390
And I think this is anyone doing more detail, right?

441
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:59,450
Yeah, that's what I agree with that people are interested.

442
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:09,240
Why did you guys go to war? I mean, if you had to cut it.

443
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:16,940
Yeah. Well, this is a lot of interesting stories, right?

444
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:37,460
It's an I letter. Sure. This was paid off as an introduction to, you know, we're going to be working for one week.

445
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:42,120
And then there's the one instance of an argument we were proposing.

446
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:50,440
Let's see whether there's two more or less than anything.

447
00:52:50,440 --> 00:53:05,560
You read those two articles together. So we had to do that for I wasn't sure if that was because it was already done today or how they are.

448
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:12,370
I have no idea. I you know, I hope that those other soldiers have participation.

449
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:17,950
And I did a lot of this for this class.

450
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:28,640
And we have different. But what do we have to do before anyone got our eye on her?

451
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:41,350
I think we present them with no vision for our purchase and to just read it before the first three months of September next.

452
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:48,890
I think it is always like them.

453
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:54,940
The beginning of the semester. Yeah. It's like, I'm sorry, I was going to say this.

454
00:53:54,940 --> 00:54:02,440
And then Apple keeps saying. And I think.

455
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:11,190
Yeah. And there's a good chance of that and that's why very have.

456
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:22,360
So I'm really happy about this. 53 And you know what's going to happen to me?

457
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:32,490
She was like, Yeah, but she had to take an alien section because I don't think that's what the government wanted her to do it at home.

458
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:38,350
Yeah, there's only one Elisa that's like most stuff is the cheese.

459
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:43,390
So you can't. On the second day. I can't.

460
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:52,350
It's just it's just like a similar to one incident in Tucson, just like last time.

461
00:54:52,580 --> 00:55:03,490
So I think I would say have I don't know.

462
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:08,010
I don't know. Um, so, I mean, I'm.

463
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:11,610
I've watched their and their families. Oh, yeah.

464
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:19,860
Was that when you were just wondering if if we'll discuss that and that because I had never heard about that incident about chromium six.

465
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:23,730
Yeah. Because they were like, yeah, yeah. We actually covered that.

466
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:28,680
We covered that case in a previous class. Is that one that you're interested in?

467
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:33,989
Oh, I was just kidding. We were assigned it for a day at the time I was at the movie.

468
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:39,020
And so yeah, so it was just like, oh my gosh, they had offered something like I was thinking,

469
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:42,959
just making connections to that because yeah, yeah, yeah.

470
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:48,870
There's so many different. So to pick the different environmental disasters,

471
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:56,790
I tried to find a diverse list of disasters in terms of what chemicals are involved in their mechanism of action,

472
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:59,940
so that we could kind of fit it in with the different things of the class.

473
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:07,020
And I can't remember why there are just so many that I think we ended up doing some other ones instead of that one.

474
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:11,720
And so, so it's like, oh, is it really like a Yeah, I know it.

475
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:13,380
It's pretty, pretty sad.

476
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:22,820
But um, so with the whole we are this, it's what we teach the groundwater they use, they were using they it was using it for like it was,

477
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:33,840
it was a part of the pistons or something to prevent across the river rusted machinery in the water that was like being pumped to the people down.

478
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:43,170
And then that water removed and put into pools outside and outside in the back seat into the groundwater.

479
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:50,970
Yeah, but then the company went to also a real two mile radius of that, that whatever mile radius in the factory.

480
00:56:51,370 --> 00:57:00,150
And they went to them and said, we're, we're putting chromium three into your water from our site, from our practice.

481
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:03,350
They got us and they said, Chromium three is really great for you.

482
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:10,530
It has all these health benefits and there's like all these people, all these people, all these families have cancer.

483
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:16,739
And my kids, dad. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

484
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:22,380
That was a pretty, pretty egregious and ominous environmental case.

485
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:32,070
Yeah. Erin Brockovich has a couple of books and she's come out with a book called That Superman's Not Coming or something like that.

486
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:45,120
And it's about there's a little bit of yeah, she is trying to sell stories like that because her character is just like how it's portrayed the movie.

487
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:49,139
I was curious how it'll answer her, but yeah,

488
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:59,220
she has a this book is called A Superman's Not Coming Our National Water Crisis and What We Did and What the People Can Do About It.

489
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:10,440
And this is all about kind of, um, not just not just pollution of the, but she talks about the Hinkley, California and the pollution,

490
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:19,049
but she also talks about just the general concerns around climate change and how that's impacting our water supplies.

491
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:22,410
And, uh, yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a good book.

492
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:26,280
She also has a podcast, or at least she did at one point. Have you listened any of those?

493
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:35,550
I haven't, but I read that she does have a podcast. Yeah, she had she had like Rob the Lot, who was an environmental attorney.

494
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:41,549
He actually was an attorney who was defending chemical companies against lawsuits,

495
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:48,170
but he ended up going after DuPont for the past year or so, which we'll talk about that in a couple of weeks.

496
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:55,170
If Pete, best case study in the Ohio River Valley another great book he he he has a great book.

497
00:58:55,830 --> 00:59:05,069
I can't remember the title, but he's actually coming to the environmental symposium in February, which I'm excited.

498
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:13,350
I'm glad to see hear him talk. So yeah, there's unfortunately lots of the third.

499
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:19,130
Yeah, yeah, it's coming in sixth and it's role in cancer.

500
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:26,550
Um, we ended up talking about, um, we have like the arsenic in Bangladesh,

501
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:34,700
arsenic in drinking water, but that one else's kind of metals and how they cause cancer.

502
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:42,360
Remember that in more detail in the class. But yeah, lots of interesting and horrifying case studies.

503
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:46,690
There's a grandfather in over here that spoke. Fix them.

504
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:56,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was I was signed up for a triathlon this summer, and I was very.

505
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:00,730
No, this was actually right before I did a ten K swim in August.

506
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:07,480
And it was in the whole if you're familiar with the area, there's a chain of lakes up near Howell, Michigan.

507
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:14,830
And so you use you swim five K through these five different lakes and then you turn around, swim all the way back.

508
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:22,240
And I was like, they better not cancel that route because I spent the whole summer doing these like 6000 yard workouts in this pool.

509
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:32,140
And I was just I mean, it was and but thankfully, it turned out that it was a smaller release than what people originally thought.

510
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:41,319
And the the levels weren't very high and the the lakes were where they had the race.

511
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:49,180
So yeah, it's it's infuriating that these companies get away with this stuff and they're not very good at cataloging.

512
01:00:49,720 --> 01:01:00,430
Cataloging. How much of that chemical is there, you know, in the release and causes so much headache for for, you know, the public health community.

513
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:06,069
Um, yeah. So we'll continue.

514
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:12,250
We have about another 19 minutes. Small intestine and another major side of absorption.

515
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:16,270
Another area, another place where you have very large surface area.

516
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:29,139
I think, um, if I recall, if you take a small intestine from a human and you just like pull it out and all the way unfolded all the way,

517
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:36,490
it's about 25 feet long or something like that. But baseline message is that there's a very large surface area.

518
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:44,110
They're 4.4 to 5 million of these villi that project into the lumen of the intestine.

519
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:52,870
So they're they have all these cells that actively transport various micronutrients across the cell membrane and into these blood vessels.

520
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:58,930
And this is how we absorb the nutrients from our food, which is excellent.

521
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:05,980
We want to be able to do that, but we also pick up other things that we don't want from our food.

522
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:14,830
Yeah, I touched on this briefly and that chemicals that you breathe in or chemicals

523
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:18,100
that are absorbed through your skin or picked right up into your bloodstream,

524
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:26,680
and they don't have this first pass effect. But the first pass effect is chemicals that or food.

525
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:30,159
Anything you ingest is going to go through your liver.

526
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:39,670
So you have your gut. Well, here, your food components of your food are picked up in your bloodstream.

527
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:42,430
They travel through the hepatic portal vein to the liver,

528
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:49,870
and then it's at the side of the liver where that's the primary site of metabolism of these different chemicals.

529
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:53,710
And so liver metabolism has a big effect on the bioavailability.

530
01:02:54,250 --> 01:03:05,709
In some cases, the liver metabolism can reduce the amount of an active drug or it can detoxify a

531
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:11,410
chemical so that there's less of it that's available for having some toxic effect.

532
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:16,600
In other cases, liver metabolism, as we'll talk about, can make a chemical more toxic.

533
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:23,230
So add in a chemical in its parent form may not be directly toxic,

534
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:26,980
but it has to go through liver metabolism where it gets oxidized through these

535
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:33,490
nasty these nasty metabolites or what go on and have adverse effects on the body.

536
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:36,760
And again, we'll get into some specific examples of this later in the class.

537
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:44,350
And again, things that are absorbed through inhalation or scan do not have are not subject to this first pass affect.

538
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:52,360
Blood delivers toxic cancer tissues distant from the site of absorption.

539
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:58,600
So you may absorb benzene or some other toxic chemical in your lungs.

540
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:08,620
And then it gets it travels to your brain, your nervous system, for example, your bloodstream diffusion out of blood occurs in these capillaries.

541
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,109
Again, you have your blood vessels,

542
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:22,060
both your veins and your arteries eventually branch out into these tiny little capillary networks that allow a single red blood cell to pass through.

543
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:25,570
Kind of they have to pass through in single file. They're that small in diameter.

544
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:36,220
So talking about blood as a as a mechanism for transporting toxicants throughout the body,

545
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:45,040
blood is a complex fluid containing cells, proteins, lipids, most toxicants in the blood, most drugs in the blood are bound up to.

546
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:50,890
And so, for example, if you're a drug company developing a drug of interest,

547
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:55,570
that's going to be an important component of understanding how a drug is going

548
01:04:55,570 --> 01:05:01,960
to be distributed throughout the body is its ability to bind to proteins.

549
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:06,520
Albumin is the most abundant blood protein that binds toxicants.

550
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:16,179
And when we get into p fast section, we'll talk about P fast likes to bind to proteins in the body, in particular albumin.

551
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:24,729
So a lot of our p fast exposure is bound up in albumin and chemicals that are that

552
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:31,990
are bound to proteins in the blood have this an off this dynamic on off equilibrium.

553
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:40,450
So you have this equilibrium between the amount of drug bound to the protein versus the amount of free drug or toxicant that's available.

554
01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:49,690
And that's that's the last bullet point. So major routes of excretion are the kidney, the intestines and the lungs.

555
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:55,780
There are some minor routes that I believe I touch on later in the class.

556
01:05:55,780 --> 01:06:02,410
So can anybody think of any minor routes of excretion? But sweat is a big one.

557
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:08,500
Yeah, it's minor compared to the kidney that has intestines and lungs,

558
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:18,130
but things like heavy metals do have a fair amount of heavy metals can be excreted through sweat tears.

559
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:22,810
Tears? Yeah, that's another. Another one. Any others?

560
01:06:25,650 --> 01:06:31,740
Another one that is important to note for lipophilic chemicals, things like dioxin,

561
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:35,340
that once they're in your body, they're very difficult to get rid of.

562
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:41,250
Unfortunately, one important mechanism for ridding yourself of dioxin is your breast milk.

563
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:46,559
And so you're obviously exposing your child in that case.

564
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:53,730
But breast milk is a is a not insignificant route of excretion for lipophilic chemicals.

565
01:06:53,730 --> 01:06:57,450
And even though in spite of in spite of that,

566
01:06:57,870 --> 01:07:03,509
we still the scientific community still thinks that the benefits of breast milk

567
01:07:03,510 --> 01:07:08,760
vastly outweigh any concerns with chemicals that are found in the breast milk.

568
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:12,210
But yeah, what about like hair growth? Exactly.

569
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:20,010
I guess it would be temporary. Or is that usually like a round of excretion or is it just kind of like a byproduct?

570
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:22,680
I guess you know what I'm saying? Yeah. Yeah.

571
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:33,700
So because hair and nails and stuff grow so slowly, I don't know if that's a if it's really a meaningful root of excretion per se,

572
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:37,770
but it is that is a really important point for things like arsenic.

573
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:48,060
Arsenic in your toenails and in your hair is a really great biomarker for how much arsenic exposure you've had in your life.

574
01:07:49,390 --> 01:08:02,280
Yeah. So in the kidney, kidneys, another kidney, obviously the site of in the bladder is the site of urinary excretion.

575
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:07,080
Again, this is a very busy diagram of a single nephron.

576
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:12,780
You're not I'm not going to get into a lot of details around the structure of the kidney in this class.

577
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:17,520
But just know that circulating blood passes through the kidney at a really high rate.

578
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:27,000
Some 25% of cardiac output goes to your kidneys and there's a high exposure to blood borne toxicants because of that.

579
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:32,580
Nephrons are the functional unit of the kidney and the urine is formed from

580
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:37,770
fluid and fluid leaks out of capillaries and it's collected in a ductal system.

581
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:47,340
The urine, as you go across, as you go through the course of the nephron and get down to the bladder is modified and concentrated,

582
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:54,420
and that process of concentration can result in significant chemical exposures.

583
01:08:57,030 --> 01:09:03,840
As I mentioned, approximately 25% of cardiac output goes through the kidney greatest rate of blood flow for any organ.

584
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:08,520
Most small. I'm about water soluble toxicants.

585
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:10,710
This is how they're eliminated into the urine.

586
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:22,770
In the kidney, there are a number of carrier metered, carrier mediated transport mechanisms that are important for regulation of iron balance,

587
01:09:22,770 --> 01:09:27,840
regulation of how much water we have in our body and how much gets excreted in the urine.

588
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:35,250
And these transport processes can facilitate excretion of some toxicants into the urine.

589
01:09:36,150 --> 01:09:43,260
This is a separable process because you can imagine that if it's if it's dependent on a carrier,

590
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:48,540
that you're going to reach some dose at some point that can exceed the threshold for elimination.

591
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:54,150
And we talk about age and susceptibility to toxicant exposures.

592
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:59,909
Carrier meta transport is there's a reduced capacity in newborns.

593
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:09,930
For example, children have have reduced capacity for excretion of phthalates, for example.

594
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:16,500
So that's another you know, that's kind of a phthalates are actually excreted by in the urine as well.

595
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:23,040
And children have the reduced ability to metabolize phthalates and excrete them from the body.

596
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:26,249
And so children who are in the McHugh, for example,

597
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:32,040
and are on all sorts of tubes and things through that medical tubing, they can get really high family exposure.

598
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:38,399
And that's kind of one of the areas of my research interest is how chemical

599
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:44,370
exposures during these really early developmental windows can affect human health.

600
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:56,099
Throughout the way, of course, is that they have reduced capacity as their size, in part because their size and you remember the specific enzyme,

601
01:10:56,100 --> 01:11:00,450
but they have lower levels of certain enzymes that are important for metabolism of the phthalates.

602
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:11,760
Yeah. And they have these impaired mechanisms for elimination as well.

603
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:21,210
Yeah. Another, another this is a little bit of an aside, but speaking about newborns and their vulnerability,

604
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:28,830
especially children who are then who are premature, their blood brain barrier is incompletely formed.

605
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:37,230
And so chemicals that would normally be prevented from getting into the nervous system in the brain through the blood brain barrier.

606
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:44,400
Children who are very early, who are born very early,

607
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:52,680
have a reduced ability to ever have an incompletely developed living barrier and therefore more vulnerable to chemicals.

608
01:11:56,100 --> 01:12:01,750
So if you have somebody who is who has was poisoned by a particular drug, for example,

609
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:09,240
barbiturates, there are different clinical mechanisms for clinical interventions for poisoning.

610
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:14,909
We won't get into a lot of these in this class. I want to pull up.

611
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:22,160
There's a podcast and I'm blanking on the name. I'm going to make a note to myself to look it up.

612
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:30,680
I think it's called tax caster. There's a bit anyway, there's a podcast on toxicology.

613
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:35,810
I don't know if he's still putting out new podcasts, but there's a whole bunch of old ones that are really interesting.

614
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:44,299
And this guy is a clinical toxicologist. And so he talks about how different chemicals affect the body and what a patient looks like who

615
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:49,100
has been poisoned by a particular chemical and how they go about treating that in the clinic.

616
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:55,810
And so if you like to nerd out on those kinds of things, I find it fun to listen to these types of things.

617
01:12:55,820 --> 01:13:03,680
We won't get in to as many discussions around clinical interventions, but this is just an example in the context of urinary excretion.

618
01:13:05,570 --> 01:13:11,210
You can in some cases increase urinary excretion by increasing urine flow.

619
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:19,160
So if you're giving somebody water to flush out water soluble toxicants, you can also modify urine.

620
01:13:20,030 --> 01:13:28,040
So for an example, like something like a barbiturate such as phenobarbital, the drug is acidic.

621
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:38,900
And so if you alco, if you make the urine more alkaline or basic, then when that chemical gets excreted into the urine, it's going to become ionized.

622
01:13:39,050 --> 01:13:44,230
Once a chemical is ionized, it can't cross back across that membrane.

623
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:48,350
It can't cross the barrier again. So it's trapped in the urine and it's excreted from the body.

624
01:13:51,530 --> 01:14:00,540
We are close to being done GI tract, so material that's not absorbed by the stomach or intestines is excreted in the feces.

625
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:07,460
Generally, lower molecular weight chemicals are excreted in the urine and the higher molecular weight chemicals and up in the feces.

626
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,860
Biliary excretion is important.

627
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:17,629
So many toxicants metabolized in the liver get excreted into the bile.

628
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:24,050
So that shown over here and there excreted into the duodenum of the small intestine.

629
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:32,510
And then these salts, many of these biliary biliary salts are recycled.

630
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:36,320
So they're reabsorbed and transported back to the liver via the portal vein.

631
01:14:36,650 --> 01:14:42,110
But unfortunately, some chemicals can also be reabsorbed and can cause toxicity,

632
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:49,040
repeated toxicity through this mechanism of intrahepatic circulation, which all I think is on the next slide.

633
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:56,630
Yeah. So this is hepatic circulation is a reabsorption from the intestines.

634
01:14:57,020 --> 01:15:00,170
So toxicants excreted into the bile along with bile salts.

635
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:08,899
These bile salts we need to recycle and reuse, but things like methylmercury kind of hijack that process.

636
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:15,110
And so they're secreted into the small intestine and then they're reabsorbed and they can cause repeated toxicity.

637
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:22,340
Lung excretion is another major mechanism for chemical excretion.

638
01:15:22,970 --> 01:15:27,770
Gases with low solubility in the blood get rapidly eliminated and expired.

639
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:34,879
Air and the lungs are efficient for elimination of lipophilic volatile compounds because because

640
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:40,040
of the membranes of the alveoli are so thin and they're in close proximity to the capillaries.

641
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:43,520
And so if you have that chemical in your blood, you're going to be able to exhale it.

642
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:48,049
This is how we eliminate ethanol to some extent.

643
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:53,510
It's not the major out of elimination of ethanol, but it's how? Because we can pick it up in our breath.

644
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:58,069
That's how we know how you're pulled over for drunk driving.

645
01:15:58,070 --> 01:16:01,100
They know how much blood, how much ethanol you've consumed.

646
01:16:02,690 --> 01:16:05,900
That breathing is maintaining that concentration gradient.

647
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:11,210
So you're reading ridding your bloodstream of that chemical and maintaining a concentration gradient

648
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:17,630
in the high blood flow is going to keep delivering a blood borne toxicant to the lungs at a high rate.

649
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:28,610
So minor outs of excretion as I touched on sweat saliva here and Neal's using used as

650
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:34,670
a biomarker to monitor exposure and can also be relatively minor out of excretion.

651
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:38,810
But so what was sneezing?

652
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:47,990
Sneezing. Yeah. Yeah. So when you sneeze you're getting rid of you tend to like spit, saliva and respiratory droplets.

653
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:56,570
Yeah. So any of those I don't have respiratory droplets on here, but I think that that would also be a route of excretion as well.

654
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:04,340
So yeah, I think next time I'm going to talk about metabolism in our next class.

655
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:12,920
So there were just a couple more slides and I'm just going to wait to touch on those on Wednesday, so we'll stop here.

656
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:17,180
Does anybody have any questions? What's your first assignment?

657
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:22,760
I'm going to post that on Thursday or Friday of this week.

658
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:29,720
And. Then just if you want to try and stay on schedule, the roughly going to be once a week as we get going.

659
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:35,479
And but again, the I'm not going to make anything due until the end of the semester.

660
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:39,230
So just feel free to tournament as you're as you're able to work on them.

661
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:48,770
Your husband, when you mentioned that two of the routes were not subject to the first massive factors inhalation and then something else.

662
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:52,470
What was the section on dermal absorption. Yeah.

663
01:17:52,490 --> 01:17:56,430
So those both of those out. So you're getting picking up the chemical in the bloodstream,

664
01:17:56,430 --> 01:18:03,590
but it doesn't have to go through the we've had a portal that will deliver gut components is going to do.

665
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:07,790
All right. Well thank you. Have a great week. I'll see you on Wednesday.

666
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:42,260
I'm Suzanne. I do.

667
01:18:45,370 --> 01:18:53,070
And. Oh.

668
01:18:56,350 --> 01:19:01,060
So on all sides people assume that you're talking on their own that open for a.

669
01:19:01,510 --> 01:19:06,310
Mm hmm. What absence? In February. Yeah. A symposium looking.

670
01:19:13,570 --> 01:19:36,510
And be very. Hi, Laura.

671
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:40,710
Hi. How are you? Good. So can I just jump right in here?

672
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:53,860
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And also, if you can't find the date now, those files appear every week, so.
