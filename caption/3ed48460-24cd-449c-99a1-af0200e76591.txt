1
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,960
All right. Good afternoon, everyone. Nice to see you all.

2
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,300
All right. Well, I'm very excited for our class today. I always love having Katie McCumber with us.

3
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,320
I've known Katie for a few years now. Just said I got many. I got. It's been a while now.

4
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,320
Right. I got lucky to meet her during my own training.

5
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,630
I spent some time at the Health Department and got to see all the great work that Katie and her team was doing up there.

6
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,880
And we invited Katie to come to our class. I think last year was the first year that you came virtually.

7
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,650
Yeah, that's right. We did it virtually.

8
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:41,030
And we were focusing on sort of wellness and resilience in the public health field, and especially during a really challenging time.

9
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:48,139
And I think, you know, recognizing that COVID 19 was a very challenging time, but really, really, there's always lots of challenges going on, too.

10
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,700
And I was just getting hearing a little bit about monkeypox and there's, you know, there's always something happening.

11
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,360
And I think we really want to think about, you know,

12
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:04,069
why it's great to go into the field of public health and how the challenges that are faced, like how do we handle those things?

13
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:10,520
So Katie will tell us a lot about what she's experienced, and I think we'll have some time for questions to Makita.

14
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,669
I'll let you kind of take it away and maybe introduce yourself a little bit more.

15
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,120
I forgot to say she's an alum of our of HMG actually.

16
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:26,900
So Hospital Molecular Abby and now she is the director of the Bureau of HIV STI at HHS and really oversees all kinds of things.

17
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:31,040
Yeah, not just I feel like it sounds like your title doesn't really say all the things you do.

18
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,020
Yeah, I kept checking out is that I feel like she's the director of a lot of things that I'm doing.

19
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:41,059
Data, so welcome. Thanks. Thanks. Nice to see you guys this afternoon.

20
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:47,719
Thank you for having me. I want to disclaimer this presentation that I am not a therapist nor a person

21
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,820
that anyone has really given a lot of resources on well-being and resilience.

22
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:59,209
I just sort of lived through it and I was a manager through it and tried to be supportive of myself and my staff.

23
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,480
So take all these with a grain of salt.

24
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,010
There are probably many days that I did not exemplify the characteristics in this presentation.

25
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,850
Yep, I graduated in 2002 from HIV from the HIV program.

26
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,320
So if you're in that program and you don't think you want to work in a lab, you can totally not work in a lab.

27
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:26,030
It's very doable. That program makes you people incredible scientists and you can really pivot the science to other places.

28
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:31,519
I really wanted to do infection control and did an internship and kept passing out and throwing up from

29
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,610
the smells and really thought that I would be fine and then realized I probably needed a desk job.

30
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:43,620
So I was very lucky when I graduated. Dr. Bolton was did a professor a present.

31
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,620
You know, he taught a class very much like this.

32
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:51,940
And he was mentoring people who wanted to go work at the state because he had a joint appointment and there were two jobs open.

33
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,350
One was a gonorrhea epidemiologist and one was a bioterrorism preparedness epidemiologist.

34
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,770
I don't even know what a bioterrorism preparedness epidemiologist would do.

35
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:07,790
So I said, Well, let me do the gonorrhea one. And I stayed in HIV and STIs my entire career.

36
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,600
So 20 years.

37
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:19,250
So if you're ever interested in sexual health is, I guarantee you 100% the best place to work at CDC or at local health or the State Department.

38
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:23,879
Okay. So a little bit I'm going to cover today. Can you guys hear me?

39
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,590
Okay? Where? I'm right here. Yeah. Okay. So just talking a little bit about what happened.

40
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:33,750
My story in terms of how I was deployed during the pandemic, what I did.

41
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,810
A little bit about what resilience and well-being means, how we're addressing it.

42
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,629
We being like sort of public health professional organizations and sort of next steps.

43
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:51,960
I'm hoping we have time for questions at the end. I was deployed to COVID for a long time, a little bit less deployed now,

44
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:57,809
but I'm currently the co-lead on the monkeypox or impacts response in Michigan.

45
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:06,270
And then do obviously I have a lot of a big program in HIV and STI prevention and control, so maybe we have time at the end for questions.

46
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:15,120
So, you know, I think the main thing is that the first cases of COVID 19 were reported in Michigan in March of 2020.

47
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:23,970
And on March 13th, the decision was made for all state employees to work from home indefinitely.

48
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:29,040
We did not have a flexible work situation at the State Health Department.

49
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,660
We all worked in the office every day.

50
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:37,710
I had two offices, a big office in Detroit with probably 75 people, and then an office in Lansing with 75 people.

51
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:45,420
And we were told about ten. And people had to pack up and go home, I guess.

52
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,770
And definitely. And people. There's two types of people in emergency situation.

53
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:56,180
Maybe you guys went over this in your emergency preparedness, but there's people that are like commanders, like they're ready.

54
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:01,049
Like I had people that had all of their box and they were out the door in like 6 minutes.

55
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:05,160
And then there were people that just stared at a wall and they would say, But what?

56
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,340
How will I get the mail? And I was like, I don't know, you need to leave.

57
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,419
Well, who? Where? You know what? How will I order sticky notes?

58
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:19,920
And, you know, there are just two types of people. And so that was a very big thing for us and it was amazing.

59
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,040
It was amazing as a manager to see how successfully that happened.

60
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:28,349
I think I think that's a take home message in America is that people have a better

61
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,620
work life balance and people can work from home successfully and it's great.

62
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:40,319
But at the time that was also March 13th was my 44, 41st birthday, which was a real rough birthday, to say the least.

63
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:48,870
But, you know, I think the other thing that happened is that that kids came home from school that weekend or that following week.

64
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,520
And so, you know, for people that works for me that were in daycares closed, right?

65
00:07:53,550 --> 00:08:03,570
So there was this huge issue where people are very anxious about the pandemic, huge pivot to home schooling, huge change with technology.

66
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,400
We had isolation, very constantly changing information.

67
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:16,560
And as you can see in the next slides, people very quickly got deployed to not doing their job anymore and doing a new job very within a few days.

68
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:23,210
So this was my regular job. Like I said, I started 20 years ago.

69
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,980
I was an epidemiologist and then I became a senior epidemiologist and I became a manager of epidemiologists.

70
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:35,850
And then I became a manager of multiple types of epidemiologists like HIV epidemiologist and Hep C epidemiologists.

71
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:44,520
And then a number of years ago, maybe seven, an opportunity came to be the director of the bureau,

72
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:56,520
which includes a whole bunch of different types direct medical access for people living with HIV surveillance and informatics evaluation training.

73
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:02,339
You know, our group is responsible for a lot of the medical continuing education training across the state.

74
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,840
So I had been doing that job for a few years. So this was my sort of regular job.

75
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,750
And very quickly, this was like a daily schedule.

76
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,130
So really, you're meeting you're in meetings.

77
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:21,910
With no breaks from really 6 to 9 and then lots on Saturdays and Sundays.

78
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,120
And it was just really rapid fire decision making and every meeting.

79
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:36,270
You know, just very, very, very intense, very quickly. And then this became my job.

80
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,790
So I got deployed to contact tracing and case investigation.

81
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:44,370
That's because my bureau in a regular day has Diaz.

82
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,120
Do any of you guys know what Diaz are? You guys heard that word before.

83
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,110
Discuss our disease intervention specialist. They're like the OG contact tracers.

84
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,540
Like before contact tracing was a thing. We've been contact tracing for syphilis, for tuberculosis, for HIV for a million years.

85
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,640
I have always had about 50 people underneath me that are deceased.

86
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,149
So when they said, Oh,

87
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:14,740
who knows how to talk to people who have been exposed to something in a way that's culturally competent and recorded in a database?

88
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,040
They were like, That's Katie. So that quickly moved to me.

89
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,620
And then we very quickly realized that the number of cases a day there was a goal

90
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:30,219
early on to really try to talk to every person with COVID 19 who got infected,

91
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,950
to call them to try and collect case report form data, to try and provide education on quarantine and isolation.

92
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,970
And so I had about 50 contact tracers.

93
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,079
And then all the other people were surge capacity case investigators.

94
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:50,930
So let's say Washtenaw County Health Department, they said, oh, we had 800 cases today which our staff can only call 500.

95
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:55,900
They would give the other remaining to this group. So we were trying it quickly failed because no one cared.

96
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,070
You could never hire enough people to call all those people. And then people stopped answering the phone.

97
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,900
But we also had to build all the IT systems and informatics to go with that.

98
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:10,670
And training very early on, contact tracing in Michigan.

99
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:16,290
Does anyone know who did contact tracing early on? So anyone else was volunteers.

100
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:24,020
So there are a lot of retired, a lot of people associated with the university, retired nurses, retired public health professionals.

101
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:30,709
So we created an online registry and people who are willing to volunteer went and registered.

102
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:35,600
And then we had to vet them, like somehow make sure that they were competent and not, you know,

103
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,270
like didn't have a criminal history or something like that and train them and deploy them to work from their house.

104
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:47,840
So that happened probably from March until. June or July until we got permanent people on staff.

105
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:53,090
So I was coordinating all of them, like signing people up for chefs being there.

106
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,930
They contact Trace on Thanksgiving of that year on Christmas Eve.

107
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:02,689
Someone had to be there to answer questions and things like that. So what did they experience?

108
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:07,159
The frontline staff? Many people on my staff were deployed to the hotline.

109
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:12,920
So, you know, we had a hotline you could call and ask where to get a test or various questions.

110
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:18,600
I don't think anyone should ever underestimate the amount of data that came in.

111
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:29,870
So you have to remember. There's like 50,000 chlamydia cases a year and like 20,000 hep C cases a year and everything else is less in Michigan.

112
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:40,090
So we have a database that was literally taking in. Thousands and thousands and thousands of records an hour.

113
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,050
And so there was just tons of data cleaning.

114
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,860
They would need deduplication. Stuff was still coming on paper.

115
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,959
We were getting faxes like people like all of the electronic feeds would break and

116
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,920
like Quest Labs would send stuff and flash files and someone had to hand tape it.

117
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,160
So we had a whole bunch of people sent to that. We had people sent to contact tracing in case investigation.

118
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,910
Like I said, we worked seven days a week, including holidays.

119
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,700
Some really thing rough things that happened to my staff early on.

120
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,870
We would call people who had been newly diagnosed with COVID 19 and they were

121
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,310
confused and short of breath to the point where they couldn't answer questions.

122
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:27,370
And our staff was like, oh, my gosh. And we would we would call 911 and have 911 sent to their house.

123
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:35,769
That happened a lot. We had people who were okay with their COVID 19 but were suicidal either because

124
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,459
they were afraid or because they were worried that they gave it to someone or

125
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,150
because of like mental health that was compounded by isolation and economic stress

126
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:48,850
and all those things called the police to do wild child or well-child visits.

127
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:53,079
We would have parents where the parents were really doing not well.

128
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:59,110
And you could hear that there was like very small children and the parents couldn't really answer questions.

129
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,579
And so we would say, oh my gosh, someone needs, you know, for a long time, people are so isolated.

130
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,969
And people, you know, I mean, you guys know in New York City,

131
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:13,240
like they found people that had passed away in their apartments and no one knew because it just happened and people were so isolated.

132
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:19,750
We would call people and they had just died and the spouse had the phone.

133
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,450
And so we would call and say, Oh, hi, we're from the State Health Department.

134
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:30,190
We're here to, you know, interview Jim about his COVID 19 infection and the partner or mother or whoever would say, oh, well, he just he just died.

135
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,230
And we're like, okay, I think, you know, I mean, just that was very traumatic for staff.

136
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,129
And then, of course, we had people, staff that were sick, kids that were sick,

137
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:45,160
children in quarantine, people that had elderly, parents that were sick. And it was just very like a very, very disruptive time.

138
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:50,690
I didn't, you know, experience a lot of that because I was working at a management level.

139
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:57,310
But we had equally rough things, a lot of media scrutiny, a lot of audits, right?

140
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,960
There was unprecedented amount of money coming into the state health department that is associated with a lot of audits.

141
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:10,490
So we were, you know, answering a ton of questions. Obviously, we had staff out sick, a lot of burnout and fatigue and mental health.

142
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:16,329
But I want to be really clear that I think what happened at the State Health Department really

143
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:20,410
doesn't compare to what was experienced by people that worked at local health departments.

144
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,840
Many local health departments in Michigan, if you if you know what a health officer is,

145
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,040
they're the person that is the sort of executive leader of the health department.

146
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:41,040
In most counties, about half of them have left, either left or they've lost their contract because it was really, really bad.

147
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,440
So. So the health officer in Kent County was actually sort of.

148
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:53,550
Pushed off the road by a parent who is into the like, let them play sports thing that sort of like pushed him off the road with our car.

149
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,860
The how the medical director in Genesee County, her name is Pam Hacker,

150
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:04,080
she actually had a legitimized threat of violence against her house and family and have police protection.

151
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,960
We had a person who was at the grocery store and a group of people in the store like heckled them.

152
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:16,440
I guess that's the only word I can think of is to say is heckled like publicly heckling mom in a in a public place.

153
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:20,280
We had several health officers that were sort of cornered.

154
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:25,620
It would be like this where they would be talking to the community and they would kind of get cornered by like,

155
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,910
I don't know, angry mob type situations. So that resulted in a lot of them.

156
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:37,440
Many of them took an early retirement. Many of them went on medical leave for like stress, anxiety or physical manifestations of stress.

157
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:45,270
And then many of them lost their contract because you have to remember, the contract for those people are managed by the county commissioners.

158
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:53,280
And if the county commissioners sort of have a different political leaning or decision making leaning, they can end that contract.

159
00:16:54,770 --> 00:17:00,140
So it is very high stress levels. And just remember, your body's meant to deal with high stress levels.

160
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:04,810
It's just meant to deal with high stress and situations where the stress comes down.

161
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,400
And this was a very prolonged stress situation.

162
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:14,990
So we know when that your nervous system is sort of stuck on the things that can happen as a people can be anxious panic.

163
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:21,700
I won't read all those. But digestive problems, sleeplessness, chronic pain.

164
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:30,920
That was really one of my things. I everything for me was up here in my neck and my shoulders and I would spend the whole day like I would

165
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:36,620
work from 6 to 10 p.m. laying on the ground because that was the only way I could even get through the day.

166
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:41,600
And you have to remember, like, you couldn't go get a massage, you couldn't go to a chiropractor, do you know?

167
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,790
I mean, so that was my symptom was really and I had a ton of pain in my arms and wrists,

168
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:53,300
I think from being on the computer all day and being like, had this other people really had problems sleeping.

169
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:57,860
Yeah. That is one thing that you hear a lot about is people just really being unable to sleep.

170
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:07,260
So I think when looking back, I think on most days we were sort of in the orange range and we would have days of yellow and days of red,

171
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,540
but not I mean, I don't think we had two years of green.

172
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:15,390
I don't think anyone had a green day in a long and a long, long time.

173
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:22,110
So two things that can come out of that hyper stress situation are two common

174
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:26,489
things called one is called magnification and one is all learned on thinking.

175
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:33,090
So this is magnification. And I was telling everyone that this was something we sat in meetings about every day.

176
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:41,670
We would say, okay, well, CDC recommends that everyone should wear a mask, but people in Michigan don't want to wear a mask anymore.

177
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:49,530
So what if we go lighter on that public health recommendation and us in the room that worked in COVID were like, Oh my gosh, that will be a disaster.

178
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:57,269
Like the world will end. And we were very you know, we were very, very or if we made a mistake, we would be very like,

179
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,020
oh, my gosh, like people 100,000 people will die now because of that mistake.

180
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,460
And it was very, you know, magnifying the situation.

181
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,450
And now, looking back, I can say, oh, yeah, that was like things were okay.

182
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:15,209
The world kept turning. But that's one symptom of stress. The other one is all or none.

183
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,630
And I think this is one thing that is really important.

184
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:24,600
I think epidemiologists by nature are really sort of pioneering in their thinking like it is or it is not significant.

185
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,930
Right. Or that survey is or is not valid.

186
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:33,179
And public health used to be that way. And I think there's a lot more gray area now.

187
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:40,310
And that's because of the influence of politics, because of the influence of everyone's an expert on social media, etc.

188
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:50,159
But we got into Barry Island, I'm thinking where, you know, if we had one little thing that went wrong, we just the whole week was a failure.

189
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,640
And, you know, that was one thing that we really got into.

190
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:59,879
But I think it's important to remember that an abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behavior.

191
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:07,500
And now looking back, we think that has and that's a once in a generation like what we went through was a once in a generation experience.

192
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:14,570
And it's easy. To sort of underestimate what a big deal that was.

193
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,330
You know, unprecedented work, unprecedented times.

194
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:25,250
And so that really sort of gets to what is resiliency and how does resiliency help you get through things.

195
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:33,859
So resiliency is the process of adapting well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats are significant sources of stress that can be family,

196
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:38,840
that can be relationship problems, that can be serious health issues or workplace or financial stressors.

197
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:46,850
Some key traits of resilience are connectedness, support, system, being self aware, being help seeking.

198
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:51,430
Having coping skills. Problem solving skills. And resourcefulness.

199
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,020
What is one thing on here that really got disrupted during the pandemic?

200
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,560
I mean, I would say people's support systems really got changed, right?

201
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:11,149
You couldn't see your friends anymore. And connectedness probably got changed because you weren't working in the office with your coworkers.

202
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:15,050
You didn't have these networks of social support. Everything was virtual.

203
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:18,970
And I think those things not that you would ax them off, but they really changed a lot.

204
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,100
So you had sort of less traits of resilience, I think. Don't rely on.

205
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,830
Personal resilience is really related to a lot of factors,

206
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:33,430
including biological things like just your temperament, the control you have over the situation,

207
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:40,930
your personal autonomy, a sense of purpose and attachment with other people, and the capacity for empathy, compassion and joy.

208
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:46,500
And these are some things that cultivate resilience, right?

209
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:52,390
And so some things that really worked for us as we my group.

210
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,320
Like we. We laughed every day and the humor got dark.

211
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:04,239
Trust me, it was dark humor. But we laughed every day and we would spend probably every hour.

212
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:11,139
We would just send a text that would just say, smile, because that was where we thought, oh, my gosh, like we are, you know?

213
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,850
And that that group was so funny. And that laughter really made things.

214
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,380
Tolerable. We really tried to have a positive attitude.

215
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:28,610
You know, we kept saying, okay, well, that went bad. And that was a really bad meeting and now we all feel bad, but tomorrow will be better.

216
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:31,820
And sometimes it wasn't, but we really did have to try to have a glass half full.

217
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,430
And the other thing is, I, I am not a nature person.

218
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,970
I've never slept in a tent. I don't own hiking shoes.

219
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:51,550
I'm not a outdoors person. But during during all this time, being outside for me was really, really, really key.

220
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,889
And now I'm a person that spends, like, weekends in nature trails.

221
00:22:54,890 --> 00:23:02,360
And so that is a strange thing for me. But I would walk outside and just the air and the sun and all that stuff would really help me.

222
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,830
So some other things that affect resilience are social supports.

223
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:15,730
So, you know, that doesn't have to be just at your house. It doesn't have to be a partner or children or parents or whatever.

224
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,080
It can also be your supports and your organizational climate.

225
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:25,480
So that impacts job satisfaction, productivity and decreases turnover and absenteeism.

226
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:30,310
And there's a positive organizational relationship between coworkers and supervisors.

227
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:40,150
And this is the one thing where I think I think looking back, we could have done better on my direct supervisor was wonderful to me.

228
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:45,760
He would call me and he would say, listen, you're doing a great job, like we couldn't do this without you.

229
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,329
And that does a lot for people just saying those words like people can handle a lot.

230
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:52,959
If someone says, Listen, you are doing an awesome job.

231
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,450
You mean a lot to me and I'm glad that we're doing this together.

232
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:03,910
We had people that said that, but they said it as sort of like a like at the beginning of every meeting, they would say it is like a catch phrase.

233
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,570
And so after a while it sort of lost its significance to people.

234
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:15,570
And so trying to think in the future of how you really do that in a way that's meaningful to people, I think is really important.

235
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:21,340
Luckily, I and I tried to do that for my staff as best I could, and I had a supervisor that had that.

236
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,300
But across the whole public health system, I don't think that that was a standard.

237
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:31,569
So again, other types of social support are emotional support, esteem support.

238
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,719
That's kind of what I just talked about, like saying you're really smart,

239
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,250
like this really stinks, but you're really smart and I know you can figure this out.

240
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:43,720
That really helps people. The other thing is informational support, I think especially people and AP.

241
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:48,880
No one likes surprises and I don't like to work on something for three days.

242
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:56,190
And then someone tell me like, Oh, we changed our mind on that. And not people can do a lot if they just know why and when.

243
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,709
Just tell me. Just tell me. Listen, we're not doing that anymore.

244
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:05,260
Here's why I can really pivot on that. But people don't like to be surprised and they don't.

245
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:11,460
I think in general, if people just know the why, even if they don't agree with it, it's better than not knowing the why.

246
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:17,530
And there was a lot of things that happened where something changed and we didn't always know and that wasn't good for people.

247
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:25,120
And then tangible support, you know, like, I don't know, my parents would like bring food to my house or my dad would come mow my yard,

248
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,420
you know, just like people sometimes in really stressful situations, whether it's health or job or whatever, just need help.

249
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:37,479
That's actually like practical help. So a little bit about compassion fatigue.

250
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,870
I don't know if you guys experienced this, but in addition to doing this job,

251
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:47,979
I was like the COVID 19 consultant for my entire family and that got real old.

252
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:54,550
And I know that's probably something I think if you even generally had any background in science, you became the COVID 19 expert for your family.

253
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:04,300
That got rolled. Like my sister would call me and say, Can my kids go to an outdoor birthday party if there's ten people there and they wear a mask?

254
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:07,890
And I would have to say yes. And then she would say, Can they do this?

255
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:11,090
And I would say no. And then she would say, But they really want to.

256
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:16,400
And I would do this, somebody like that, you know, and, you know, like my parents,

257
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:21,290
I had to make all their vaccine appointments because I'm like, Oh, Katie, we don't know how to do this.

258
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,420
Like, can you just do it because you work in the health department?

259
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:30,080
And so that I think that's a really real thing for people, whether you're actually working or just a student still like that got old,

260
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,750
especially when people directly didn't do what you told them to do, which still, you know, happens every day.

261
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:39,559
Right. So compassion fatigue leads to burnout and trauma.

262
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,780
And what all of us want is for our compassion satisfaction to be higher than our compassion fatigue.

263
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:54,890
And I think for a lot of us, I think even for me still, it's kind of like this because, you know, people still die every day of COVID in Michigan.

264
00:26:55,010 --> 00:27:01,280
Every day people are still dying. And that's, you know, hard when you've been working on it all this time.

265
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:08,870
I know things can't be at that level forever, but there's still a lot of, um, you know, long COVID and people still are really sort of moved on.

266
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:13,730
And so that burnout and secondary trauma to compassion fatigue is a real thing.

267
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:20,580
So burnout is an observer, has observable symptoms and is a diagnosable disorder.

268
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,220
The World Health Organization has upgraded its definition to an occupational

269
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:30,450
phenomenon that comes from chronic workplace stress that has not been managed.

270
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,800
So what are the signs? Substance abuse, anger management.

271
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:40,380
I'm laughing because I'm seeing this in conference call meetings. I'm in isolation.

272
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:48,180
People that have chronic illness like stomach issues or pain, anxiety, dysfunctional relationships are inadequate performance.

273
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:54,040
I think the one thing that I saw was people drinking. You know, you're at home.

274
00:27:54,050 --> 00:28:01,650
You don't have to get up and drive to work in the morning. People can't sleep. They're ramped up and they need something to help them sleep.

275
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:05,330
And there were people that I really worried about that I thought were drinking too much.

276
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,570
And I watched that for myself really closely because I think that gets into a cycle.

277
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,080
You can't sleep and you have to drink.

278
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:22,110
That I think I would not be surprised if they do studies of public health professionals later on and talk about increased substance use,

279
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,580
whether it was, you know, something to help people sleep, sleep, aids or alcohol.

280
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:31,400
So CDC did a can you guys see those hunters?

281
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:40,560
Okay. I know. Right. Okay. So CDC did a study of the percent of the public health workforce with symptoms of PTSD by what their experience was.

282
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:48,120
And you can see that the percent of people with PTSD, which is the red bar, was just much higher for people that experienced a threat.

283
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:52,800
People that were bullied felt underappreciated, overwhelmed with work life balance,

284
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,870
felt isolated alone, were unfairly compensated or worried about their health.

285
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,900
Which makes sense, right? None of that is a surprise.

286
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:13,430
This is from the same CDC article. So it shows how depression scores increase based on the percent of COVID 19 response activities people did,

287
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:19,160
and the number of hours people worked and the PTSD symptoms that people had, again,

288
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:24,710
based on the percent of time on response activities and the number of hours worked per week.

289
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:33,290
So things I did for my group. I brought in a counselor to try and talk to people during meetings.

290
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,950
We tried to laugh. We had chats going all day.

291
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:45,200
We had a lot of means that we would use every day because we were like, Oh my gosh, how are we back to this same thing?

292
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:50,840
You know, on a different day. We had small groups, safe spaces, where sometimes people just needed to vent.

293
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:56,000
Sometimes it was about a person. Sometimes it was about technology. Sometimes it was about whatever.

294
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,040
We tried to say thank you and say, I'm glad that we're doing this together.

295
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,730
We force time off when people when we saw people crack.

296
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,030
There were key high level people at the health department that said you're you're done for this weekend.

297
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,780
And that's a good thing for a boss to do. It's a good thing for a friend to do.

298
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:18,110
We had people that said, if I work tonight, I'm going to get divorced.

299
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:22,400
Like, you know, you have to remember, people have spouses. Like people hadn't cooked for their kids in weeks.

300
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,750
People hadn't talked to their spouse. They'd be down in the basement on the computer.

301
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:32,060
And I think divorce is another thing that I'm interested in to see longitudinal data on.

302
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:40,300
We had a lot of seminars and videos on self-care and mindfulness and yoga breaks during the day, and that wasn't really something that I thought.

303
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:44,680
But for some people that really worked, breathing, you know, like active breathing, belly breathing,

304
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:50,090
that really matters, especially when people have that pain and people need reminders to do that.

305
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,580
So I think Ari talked about this. What are some things that help me?

306
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:04,400
And here are some self prompts. So these are things that you really need, like in a time of stress, what you know,

307
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:10,050
these are good questions to ask yourself so that you can promote things that work in your life and remove the things that don't work in your life.

308
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:17,040
I had people tell me I didn't sign up for this and I said, No, this is exactly what you signed up for, you know?

309
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:22,500
So it's really important for everyone here to know this like something will happen and public health is going to be different from here on,

310
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:25,559
like it's just going to be different and something will happen and it will be stressful

311
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:30,180
and hopefully it won't last as long as COVID 19 because that was a really long response.

312
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:35,400
But things will happen and people need to be prepared for what works for them.

313
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,750
Oh, I already talked about expert fatigue.

314
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:47,620
I just took my dad in the summer to San Francisco. So my dad loves to travel and my mom is disabled.

315
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:52,240
So I have to take him a couple of times a year on a trip and he's just desperate to go somewhere.

316
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,800
And on the plane, you know, this is he's had all these boosters.

317
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:04,240
I made him wear a full and 95 and compression socks because what is COVID 19 vascular?

318
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,450
People forget that. So he had compression socks on and I wouldn't let him take his mask off to drink.

319
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:18,280
So I ran a flexi straw up underneath because I was like, Well, you have to be hydrated because you're cloudy in A-fib anyway.

320
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,260
That's too much. Like, I freely recognize, like I still wear a mask everywhere.

321
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,980
I wear a mask at the grocery store. I'm not really sure.

322
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,100
Do you know what I mean? Like, it's too much. There's the anxiety of knowing too much.

323
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:34,780
That's not always healthy. You know, I drove my son crazy.

324
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,840
Absolutely crazy, absolutely crazy.

325
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:43,170
Drove my sister crazy, drove my parents crazy with anxiety.

326
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:49,819
And that's that's fatiguing. So some things to remember to remember is politics is here to stay.

327
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,950
I think how public health is paid attention to.

328
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:59,070
Like back in the mid 2000, there could be a syphilis outbreak somewhere and you know,

329
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:02,329
we would get a media request and they would say, oh, how many syphilis cases?

330
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:07,430
And I would write back seven. And that was the extent that was public health seven.

331
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,299
That's not the questions we get anymore. I don't think we're ever going to get questions like that.

332
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,600
I think people are to say, Why? What are you doing? Have you done enough?

333
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:22,970
You know, it's just and I don't think it'll be forever, but I think for a long time that's going to be something that we need to work on.

334
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:30,650
And I really encourage you guys to work in groups do like fake mock interviews with each other, pretend to be someone you know.

335
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:35,660
It doesn't have to be the public. You don't have to change the hearts and minds of, you know, your neighbor who doesn't believe in vaccines.

336
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:43,760
Right. We're not talking about that. But even working in public health like we've been exposed to public media, legislature,

337
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:56,900
lots of people who really make you work hard to explain things in a way that we haven't I don't think we've been necessarily trained to do before.

338
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:02,780
So long term, I think there's going to be more studies on chronic disease outcomes.

339
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:09,890
Right. There's a lot of people that have cortisol levels right up here for years that's probably going to do something not great for people's health.

340
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,319
We also I work in ACS. We no one cared about us for three years.

341
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,530
No one did anything. So no work, no one nothing.

342
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,370
So now I have to, like, get that back. I have to get people to care.

343
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:26,900
I have to get there's a whole bunch of stuff that didn't happen for a few years, and that's not a good thing.

344
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,690
We've had a ton of brain drain because people have left.

345
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:35,180
But the good news is there's tons of new people coming to public health and that's a real exciting opportunity.

346
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:40,280
I was just going to show you this because this is a DePalma and ASCO survey.

347
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,180
It was just sent to public health people. It had nothing to do with a pandemic or mental health.

348
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:51,880
It was, I think about it, capacity or something. And at the end they said they have a link to the suicide prevention line.

349
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:55,030
And I was like, Oh, wow. I was like, That's good that they're doing that.

350
00:34:55,030 --> 00:35:01,320
But also weird that I would take a survey about like whether I could use SAS and they would have a link to a suicide prevention line.

351
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:05,560
So people are caring, but it is also, I think, unprecedented.

352
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:11,940
And a little bit more is that there's really good things that happen from post-traumatic growth.

353
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:18,060
People have a greater appreciation for life, for their relationships, increased compassion and altruism,

354
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:25,560
creative thinking and new possibilities, awareness of people's personal strengths and creative growth.

355
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:31,919
I can tell you from working in that pandemic, I can now actively listen on a conference call,

356
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:40,800
type an email and probably text with someone like my brain has been wired to do three or four things at once for 10 hours a day.

357
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:45,660
That's not always good, because sometimes I just need to, like, take it and I don't have to do that anymore.

358
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:50,459
And so I'm sort of I think it's sort of like ADHD, but, you know,

359
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:55,410
like I've really learned some of my strengths that I hope I can use successfully if something like that happens again.

360
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,310
So those are my references to that. MMW are.

361
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:05,180
And that is all I had for slides. Thank you very much, Katie.

362
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:12,150
I think you guys can all see why I think Katie so awesome and everything she's done mean.

363
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:20,350
She's really. Been through a lot and to be able to step back and reflect on it and think through, you know, how you've made your team,

364
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:25,910
what you learned about yourself, think that moment of reflection is, is, I think, a really important learning lesson.

365
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:33,020
See if there's questions from the group or any comments, questions, things that surprised you.

366
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:38,680
Things you want to know more about. I'm glad to hear you're getting lots of new people coming.

367
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:45,370
We are. We are getting I feel like one question is like, okay, so why do we want to work in governmental public health?

368
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:48,920
Like what? What brings people to it? Because it sounds pretty tough, too.

369
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:57,890
Um, I mean, I think governmental public health is, that's where you make the really big impacts, right?

370
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:06,250
I mean, I have people on my staff that are new grads from public health programs, some of them from policy,

371
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:16,090
some of them from AG that are working with insurance companies to remove the explanation

372
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:20,770
of benefits that minors could get if they're on HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis.

373
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:29,430
Like that's kind of big stuff. Like when you work at the state, over time, you get exposed to like big systems, like corrections,

374
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:37,930
like I work with corrections and how do we take people who have HIV either in prison and not and get them to a doctor when they leave prison?

375
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:42,610
Like, that's sort of big things. That's a big impact. So you have to want to work at that level.

376
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:49,580
But in terms of. Systems and policy and big data.

377
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:55,400
Right. There's. If you're an abbey. I got 50,000 chlamydia cases a year, 700 HIV.

378
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:59,089
That's big data. You know, like if you do West Nile, like how many people have West Nile?

379
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:02,329
You're like 20 rabies. Like, no one even gets rabies, you know?

380
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:05,810
I mean, like, we have big data, so that's really cool.

381
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:13,290
I mean, that's a really cool experience. And at least for my group, we talk about sex and drugs all day and that's kind of fun.

382
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:18,180
Do you know what I mean? Like like it's, you know, there's a lot of cool things that are happening.

383
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:27,450
Not in not just in my area. All the other areas are cool too, but it's just really the ability to impact big systems of care.

384
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:41,110
Think. All righty.

385
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:48,370
Hi. Thank you. So I kind of had, like, a question about, like, more the burnout that people experience.

386
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:56,200
Do you think that this field just inevitably attracts people who are, like, anxious and just constantly think about this stuff?

387
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:00,069
Absolutely. I had a friend who was a person.

388
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:03,220
I don't know what the word what's the phobia where people are afraid to vomit.

389
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,650
A metaphor. Phobia? No idea.

390
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:13,510
She went into food borne disease at the state because she inherently knows where people are getting Nora in the whole state.

391
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,490
I think there's a lot of germ. I think there's a lot of germaphobe.

392
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:22,670
I raise my hand and people are I think people are here because you're trying to control something in your life.

393
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:27,969
I think this is and people have probably a little bit of OCD and a little germ stuff.

394
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:33,850
And so going here, I think there's some anxiety that has contributed.

395
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:40,520
Contributed. People went in. May be a little anxious and they're still anxious coming out.

396
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:46,659
A little anxious. All right. And just as a follow up, like something like you kind of mentioned this, like,

397
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,440
you know, you kind of became an expert for people around you is annoying.

398
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:59,530
But also, I feel like there was an element of like policing when it came to like mask wearing vaccines and stuff.

399
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:03,099
And so all of a sudden you became like the bad guy. How did you deal with that?

400
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,720
With people who just didn't agree? I stopped talking to them.

401
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:12,610
That's not a good example. I actually signed up to be a chaperon at my son's one of my son's dances.

402
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:16,599
I guess this was must have been February 20, 21.

403
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,860
And I signed up for that. And I walked around and yelled at every kid because their mask all them.

404
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:26,350
I was like, You need to pull your mask up. I was like, You need to leave off your mask. Not. And I police that whole student.

405
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:29,410
Or is it it was the best last couple of hours I had in my life.

406
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,100
It was so it was so empowering because they thought that I would kick them out if they didn't have them.

407
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:38,440
I was like, your mask is not over, you know? You know, it's not good.

408
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,280
Right. And all of us know people that smoke.

409
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:49,019
Behavior change. People that write this is people that are way too much like they try.

410
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:53,320
Right. They're they're on a diet and then you see them eating people that smoke.

411
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,970
It's behavior change takes a long time. People have.

412
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:02,069
And so I think, again, public health people are very binary, like, yes, you should get the vaccine.

413
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:05,459
Why not just get please just get it. Like, I don't want to talk to you.

414
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:09,210
I don't think people are very patient. And that's very frustrating.

415
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:14,280
And I don't have a good answer for you there then. I really I think we all still struggle about.

416
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,229
I feel like sometimes just reflecting on that question, too,

417
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:28,830
just thinking about when you have to like picking your battles sometimes goes for me or I experiences in a different way,

418
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,380
like working in infection prevention. So, you know, like being in the hospital and.

419
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:38,550
This is before COVID, of course, but just, you know, dry people who are eating in a place they shouldn't be eating.

420
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:41,400
You know, everyone likes to have their coffee on the floor, but they're not supposed to have it.

421
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:45,630
I became the coffee police and there was times I was like, No, I'm just going to eat.

422
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:50,370
I purposely saw the coffee and I wouldn't say anything, right? So you had to pick your battles.

423
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:54,450
Like if I tell this person to put their coffee down, they're not going to do this other thing that I used them later.

424
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,070
That was hard. You know, you didn't have to think about your relationships and it was a gray zone at times.

425
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:07,889
It's just kind of annoying. I did want to mention that, you know, if you guys are if anyone has interested in impacts or monkeypox,

426
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:11,490
I did do a whole presentation on that for the spectrum center,

427
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,290
which I think those I think those if you go to their website, I don't think that's a closed website.

428
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:19,260
Right. Is that open for everyone? I would think yes.

429
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,250
So I think if you're interested in that, you can go to that website and no one came to our presentation.

430
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:29,909
We put together like it was supposed to be a live event, not like two people showed up, but anyway,

431
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:37,469
they recorded it and there was a good presentation about impacts on the spectrums of for you have students on the spectrum center website that I

432
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:45,900
did so if you're just interested in learning more about it it's it's now I don't know how long ago I did it so it might be a little bit old now.

433
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:55,450
But still interesting about that induction being now like with our students are often doing internships.

434
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:01,530
Are you seeing changes in how people are interacting or just different behaviors or maybe, you know,

435
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:07,210
it's like side effects kind of from how we've all been isolated and kind of coming back into working together.

436
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:14,110
Sometimes we talk about just what it's like in the classroom. We're working, just working in general, not just students, but all of us.

437
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:19,570
How we are interacting. Getting back to our and trying like our new semblance of normal.

438
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:24,760
Are you talking about STI rates or people in the office? Oh, well, it could be both.

439
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:29,020
I was thinking more about just people behaviors, but also us guys would be interested.

440
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:34,810
Yeah, I think with people in the office, I think a lot of public health people are natural introverts.

441
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,610
I think we're very comfortable at home, very happy at home.

442
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:43,659
I never need to leave my house again. I'm happy there forever.

443
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:47,860
I don't ever want to go to a meeting again. I only need to do virtual meetings for the rest of my life.

444
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,590
Thanks for coming in. Thanks for coming in. But that's not a good thing.

445
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:59,650
That's not always a good thing. And I think in other areas, people's personalities might be more mixed.

446
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,670
Right. So you have a few people that want to come in and they're socially my area.

447
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,550
They never no one ever wants to come back ever.

448
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:12,459
And they are coming back like we have in-person staff meetings and there's stuff that I'm making them come back for and I don't want to come either.

449
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:17,110
But we're trying, you know, we're trying because it's important to do. And they're completely.

450
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:24,790
Like overstimulated after one day. If we have a one day meeting, by the end of the day, people are like noise.

451
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:31,060
It's it's sort of like sensory overload, you know? And that's I think that's going to be like a new thing.

452
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:37,000
I don't I mean, I'm forcing people to come back. Maybe I should let that go and just let everyone stay home forever.

453
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,130
But you don't really know how that's going to, you know, I mean, whether I stay home or not is determined by the governor.

454
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:46,660
And the governor will not be the same forever. You know, that's like a policy at the city health department.

455
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:50,140
So I think that's the main thing.

456
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:54,910
My people are very happy, very, very calm. They're very comfortable.

457
00:44:55,810 --> 00:45:01,990
What about for people like new hires that you brought in or your students coming to do the jobs to like?

458
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,070
What's it like? How do you.

459
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:08,770
Any advice you have for new people coming in and trying to get to know a team or get to know that type of work environment?

460
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:15,220
Yeah. I mean, the other thing that's a real hard thing is that when you're in a remote environment, everything is a meeting.

461
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:20,290
You can't just stop by someone's you can't just stop by someone's cube and say like, Hey, what do you do?

462
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,810
Everything has to be like a meeting on a calendar.

463
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:31,629
And so we just have meetings all day which used to be like little casual decision making and that gets really old, I do think for the new people.

464
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:35,380
Like I've onboarded a ton of new people. We have a really good training schedule.

465
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:39,729
We do do team building staff. They have a lot of online meetings.

466
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:45,580
So I think that they're good in their team. I think they're lacking a little bit of big picture, right?

467
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,780
They're really good on their team. They're really good at their job. They're very competent at their job very quickly.

468
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,150
They're very much an expert.

469
00:45:53,170 --> 00:46:00,459
I don't know if they're getting in the whole big picture because, you know, you lose some of those, like, cross-pollination moments.

470
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:04,060
But so far, at least for me, the being a really good expert at your job.

471
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:09,190
I think people's job satisfaction is okay. And I think they're really good at their jobs.

472
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:15,000
And so that probably is more of a plus than. People not getting the whole big picture.

473
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:20,010
Even now, people that work for me will be in meetings and they don't even say what area they work in.

474
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,389
Like I'll say, where do you work?

475
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:28,980
And they don't even get this right because you know, because the hole above them is a little bit harder to conceptualize, I think, in their head.

476
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:37,650
Because we throw it. Yeah.

477
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:49,870
Yeah. So I'm wondering, like, what was it like for you when you first started working as an epidemiologist for the health department?

478
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:54,680
Oh, it was awesome. It was the best job ever.

479
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:58,429
I was working on a you know,

480
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:05,220
I was working on a study where we are collecting enhanced behavioral data from people with gonorrhea diagnosed at a health department.

481
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:11,690
So mostly with STIs, there's very little case data rates are so many STIs, no one can call everyone that has chlamydia.

482
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:18,730
So it was like an enhanced pilot and it was awesome. And I'll tell you next week, we have to.

483
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:22,180
Oh, yeah. You'll love Joe. You'll love Joe. Like a good plug.

484
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:27,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes. Are more about working and. Yes, Joe and I, we're on the same team.

485
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:34,360
We have pretty similar personalities. We work together every day, literally every day we talk together.

486
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:38,979
And he is a passionate epidemiologists and he is also a supervisor.

487
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:44,650
Now, like me, we have the same level. And both of us, if we could probably be an epidemiologist, we would be so happy.

488
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:52,360
Good to hear from Joe. So, Joe. And then we also have Rachel. I think it's Rachel went on to say from Kent County, I don't know how.

489
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,750
So she's representing sort of like a local health department. Yeah. Yeah.

490
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,270
And then Joel represents sort of the state health department.

491
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:05,380
You also get to hear a little bit more about their kind of career trajectories and what it's like working in local and state health department.

492
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:10,809
But I hope that you really took a lot away from what Katie brought to us today.

493
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:16,389
I feel like a lot of different things in there probably resonate with the experiences you may have had to just just

494
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:22,270
kind of get going through COVID and then just thinking about whether it's COVID or other challenges that you do face,

495
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:29,470
like what you learn about yourself and how you can recognize those symptoms of burnout or stress.

496
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:32,709
And at least the little things that might help you and recognize the different

497
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:36,430
things help different people and how you kind of lead lead teams through that,

498
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:36,759
too.

499
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:44,379
So I really appreciate Katie coming and talking about this with us, and I'm just glad you all got to meet her because she's a pretty amazing person.

500
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:50,560
Thank thank you so much, Case. Thank you. And oh, yeah, I was going to put my email.

501
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:55,150
Let me just type it up here and then you can email me if you have any questions.

502
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:01,420
I don't know why I didn't do that too, so I'll make sure that we have all this on our class page as well.

503
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:05,730
I'll send you these slides. Michigan.

504
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,280
Very good. All right. Thanks, everybody.

505
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:15,990
Oh, my.
