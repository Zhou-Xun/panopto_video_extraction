1
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,370
Everybody. So we have two basic things we're trying to do today.

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:17,770
One of them is make sure that you do really well on your next policy memos. We're nearly done grading the policy memos from the previous one.

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,990
We're just at the point where we're cross-checking in case to the graders disagree, spelling going up pretty soon.

4
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:30,310
Obviously, as usual, we'll give you a review on Monday as to sort of common themes and things you can address.

5
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,430
I don't think I'm giving away anything. That targeting remains a problem.

6
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,480
You should really write to people who can and will do what you want.

7
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,350
So if you ask the governor to pass legislation,

8
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:50,019
I can assure you right now that's the point of and if you ask state lazy Republican to do something in order to reduce health inequalities,

9
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,460
you probably don't do that either.

10
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:59,140
So target right now, however, we're going to do a preparation of the Federal Register and it's going to achieve two things.

11
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:05,800
One is it's going to help you do a better job on the next policy memo or continue to do an excellent job on the policy memo, which most of you did.

12
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:14,750
And it's also going to show you something about how basically the United States actually makes most of the policies that matter to you.

13
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:19,480
And the purpose of the slide. So we'll be talking about a different kind of administrative burden.

14
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,640
Sally Sara, what is the difference between legislation and regulations?

15
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:33,470
Legislation, as discussed, is something that is asked through the legislature because it is only done and then

16
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,580
signed by a governor and not vetoed and not written by the Supreme Court's majority.

17
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,140
It is really hard stuff. You can't break laws.

18
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:49,940
Sometimes there's penalties of various sorts, but most of the time if you're in public administration, it just instructs Medicare to do something.

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,490
And if Medicare doesn't do it, you're not doing your job.

20
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:00,110
So they're passed by Congress and they tend to, in the case of making the micro-level decisions that are much of what governments do.

21
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,490
Can this person enter the country legally? What should we pay for this procedure?

22
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:13,820
Is this person actually disabled? What's your tax bill? Well, agencies get to decide that on the day by day, case by case basis.

23
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,830
It's for two reasons. One is you can't, as I say, write a complete contract for everything.

24
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:24,020
Remember when I talked about the need for courts is because you can't write a piece of legislation that includes every eventuality.

25
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:32,440
Seeing case by case adjudication, right. If you're in the immigration system, this case by case adjudication by an administrative law judge.

26
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,259
I'm sorry about the backlog group that got cut off,

27
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:41,110
but there's people who decide on the basis of administrative law whether or not somebody has a right to remain in the country.

28
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,450
And there's also legislation that deliberately empowers agencies because stuff changes.

29
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,060
So, for example, we have a law called Tosca, the Toxic Substances Control Act,

30
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,350
which was passed in the 1970s and not updated until about six years ago.

31
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:05,500
What things changed in chemistry? Everything to do with, for example, nanomaterials changed in the period during which Tosca was not amended at all.

32
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:14,110
To the extent that Tosca empowered an agency to keep up with the science, Tosca continued to function as a way to protect it from attempts.

33
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:20,170
Clean Air Act. Clean Water Act. Neither of those specifies particular chemicals.

34
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,680
Congress didn't sit down and legislate the amount of PCBs you can have in your oatmeal.

35
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:32,049
What they did is they empowered the agencies to use adequate scientific procedures to identify threats and

36
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:37,870
the most relevant technologies in which to address the threats and what they delegated to the agencies.

37
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,640
This is what makes modern government and therefore modern societies.

38
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,320
We'll come back to that.

39
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:52,460
And so this means establishing the agency and giving a broad authority and then is also directing the agency to address this specific problem.

40
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,810
So the EPA is both established and given broad authority to regulate clean air and clean water.

41
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:06,760
And it is directed to do certain things. The EPA is remiss if it does not take action to address a threat to clean air.

42
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,380
You can sue them for not doing their job.

43
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,220
Likewise, CMS has broad authority over Medicare and Medicaid and it is directed to do a certain number of things.

44
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:25,320
Most recently started negotiating prices for some medicines. There is a or less always a reasonable amount of discretion of the ability of individual

45
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,540
program managers or officers to decide what they're going to do within the law.

46
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:35,889
And as in any organization, what do you decide to do within the policy situations?

47
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:40,080
The value depends a lot on your boss. Which gives us executive orders.

48
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,259
This was an extremely hot topic under Trump because Donald Trump really likes

49
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,720
the executive orders he can about executive orders is that they are weak tool.

50
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:57,899
First of all, they will be changed by the next president. So Joe Biden came in and passed the bill by vote to find a whole bunch of executive orders

51
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,980
that basically undid most of Trump's consequential executive orders took about three days.

52
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,970
Absent storm of executive orders, the Democrats clearly have been ready to go.

53
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,620
The other is that executive orders must exist within the law.

54
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:19,270
So here's a similar story from the Trump administration. As a result, President Trump wished to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

55
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:25,600
He cannot repeal a law on his own as president. All you can do is wait for Congress to pass a law that you can sign.

56
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:31,150
But he wants to do something to communicate to the public and to other Republicans that he really wants the ACA gone.

57
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,230
So he signs an executive order saying,

58
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:42,070
I am directing Health and Human Services to study all means possible to undermine get rid of the Affordable Care Act.

59
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:50,440
This gets reported for what it is, which is it? Was the president signaling that he had a priority, which was that the Affordable Care Act should go?

60
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:57,280
When actually content was, of course, was he ordered an agency to study a question.

61
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,730
And that really doesn't matter very much.

62
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,780
He basically directed a certain number of analysts in HHS to redouble their efforts to find a way to

63
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,980
make the Affordable Care Act function less well and therefore more in accordance with his priorities.

64
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,620
So executive orders come and go as really important, highly visible things in politics, but they're fundamentally academy tools.

65
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:26,170
And probably the best example that I've been using for teaching for my entire teaching career is what we call Mexico City policies.

66
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,620
Anybody familiar with this? Okay.

67
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:36,010
If you do global reproductive health, there are big deal. It's under law and therefore very hard to change.

68
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,530
The United States cannot finance any agency for performing abortions internationally.

69
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:47,020
We can't use our foreign aid budget to do that. We can use any of our budgets to finance an abortion outside the United States.

70
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,340
However, there is a question in the margins, which is discovered by Ronald Reagan's administration,

71
00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:00,150
which is can you finance somebody who doesn't use American dollars to pay for an abortion, but which does advise people on abortion?

72
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:09,750
Right. So you go to a clinic funded by USAID and they say if you want an abortion, go across the street to some other charity not funded by USAID.

73
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:16,220
The Reagan administration said, no, we don't like that. We don't want anybody in councils on how to have an abortion because abortion is murder.

74
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:22,639
So the Mexico City policies were an executive order signed by Ronald Reagan saying the United States foreign aid

75
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:29,210
budget cannot U.S. budgets specifically cannot be used to give support any organization that does any portion.

76
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,410
Bill Clinton comes in. Democrat immediately signs an executive order saying, yes, sure, go ahead.

77
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,190
You can use it.

78
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:46,520
George W Bush comes in Republican stance and gets executive orders, say can use it, reinstate the Reagan policies a little bit tougher.

79
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,450
Barack Obama comes in no prizes for guessing what happens at this point.

80
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:56,170
So once again, you can do abortion counseling with U.S. foreign aid money.

81
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:03,430
Donald Trump comes in, delegates it to Mike Pence who cares intensely about this issue and they write a much firmer version of it,

82
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:09,129
which doesn't just say USAID, but no federal agency of any description like State Department can use any part of its

83
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,790
budget to support anybody who does any counseling and has any identifiable relationship.

84
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,030
And the idea was that they would work with like evangelical church networks and so

85
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:24,830
forth in order to find people who were cheating and reporting back to Washington. So when it comes in, how the story ends now there's two more.

86
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,630
One is, look at it. It's not that big of a policy. It really makes somebody extremely angry.

87
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,270
Every time we came to the White House.

88
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:40,700
But the poor thing is that we're talking about counseling abortions, not doing abortions, which is covered by the U.S. legislation.

89
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:47,660
And the other thing is Reagan on, Clinton off, Bush on, Barack Obama off, Trump on.

90
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:56,100
Biden was not that strong. So you hear about them because they're sometimes very consequential.

91
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:02,550
Like executive orders really matter in the immigration system because the immigration system is largely the law free zone in many ways.

92
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,190
You're very responsive to the executive, but also because presidents use them to signal things.

93
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:13,110
And signaling is important in politics, but it's not necessarily important in the White House.

94
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:23,170
Real stuff, regulations and rulemaking. So when you say regulation in a general sense, you mean regulation like I keep you from selling bad medicines.

95
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,640
Regulation also has a technical term under the Administrative Procedures Act,

96
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:33,670
which is essentially this use of agency discretion in a formal way, and it's governed by the ACA.

97
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:41,680
The purpose of the ACA past 60 years ago is to make sure that federal agencies are very clear about what they're doing,

98
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,470
and everybody has a chance to hear about what's going to happen and comment on it and have input to the process and shape the debate.

99
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,340
So you don't just have agencies running around making unaccountable decisions.

100
00:09:52,090 --> 00:10:00,610
You have agencies making decisions you don't like and you have agencies making decisions that you didn't pay attention to until they happened.

101
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:04,060
And then you got mad at them. But you don't have agencies making decisions in the dark.

102
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:11,940
In other words, this is one of these technical, boring things that is open to anybody with access to Google and a keyboard,

103
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:18,180
and yet somehow it gets treated as if it were some great industry. Well, I'm going to build history for that.

104
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:22,560
On the point of the delegation or regulation, remember I was talking about a major question sculpture.

105
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:32,190
This whole thing is a massive to many conservatives because it does is it creates authority for government officials to unelected bureaucrats

106
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:39,900
to make decisions about what CMS will pay for things or about whether or not that piece of land is a wetland and merits protection,

107
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,340
or about whether or not your development is going to interfere with our supply,

108
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:50,430
or about whether or not part of that outside of the atmosphere climate change is a threat to human health that these regulated.

109
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,930
In other words, this enables modern regulation. This enables modern democratic.

110
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,350
It is therefore offensive to many conservatives who combine an ideological preference

111
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:07,530
for less regulation with a political preference for Congress to make the decisions.

112
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:15,600
Because if Congress makes the decisions, the House is going to get the less regulation you conceive of Congress legislating a pass acceptable level.

113
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,700
And if the science changes, they need to concede a conference with Congress because I think it.

114
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,860
The whole of nanotechnology happens between revisions of Tosca.

115
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:33,360
We didn't have the legal framework said anything relevant about nanotechnology for essentially all the formative years of that tech,

116
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,060
because Congress could be persuaded to do anything about it.

117
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,640
So the major questions doctrine basically says if conservative judges think it's a big enough question,

118
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:47,850
slash don't like the outcome, then it's not with an agency regulatory discretion, despite what the law says.

119
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,740
That was the lesson of West Virginia versus EPA. So we're standing on the precipice of something.

120
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,330
Conceivably, if the Supreme Court gets his way, I'm going to cut this lecture.

121
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:03,930
At the same time, if the Supreme Court gets his way with anything along the lines of the nonproliferation doctrine,

122
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,350
I have literally no idea how the health care system or most of the country will actually function.

123
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,740
It remains to be seen. That's your know.

124
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:16,770
Let's go into the EPA, which is still good law and how the United States government makes most of its decisions.

125
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,569
Their state equivalents are not, but equally easily offered.

126
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:28,430
The websites are slightly worse. So the IPA and if you don't like high performance,

127
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:33,920
there's a lot of graphics and stuff about this because everybody works in the federal government has to understand this.

128
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,020
You have to have a statement of rulemaking authority on the Federal Register.

129
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:47,210
So point one is the Federal Register or more likely regulation scope is your source for all of this, and fortunately it's pretty easy to use.

130
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:53,280
Well, we have the unified agenda. Every autumn, agencies publish a regulatory plan.

131
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:58,460
Hi, I'm CMS. So this is what I'm planning to do. Hi, I'm the EPA and this is what I'm planning to do.

132
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,020
See how they advance. Notice that they're thinking about a particular pollutant or a particular technology or a particular kind of problem.

133
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,970
They also published the specifics of the agenda.

134
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:13,830
Regulatory or deregulatory actions is the high on the EPA, and this is specifically what I'm going to do.

135
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:20,940
I specifically want to do something about CFS. I'm specifically going to open a consultation about this is at the mention of wetlands policy.

136
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:29,510
They do that twice a year. This gives everybody notice of what's going to happen, specifically the content of the agency decision to issue a rule.

137
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,510
Now you can ask the public for the agency to open a rulemaking process.

138
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:42,760
There's also a lot of informal information gathering. People from the federal government are very attentive to what's going on in the science,

139
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:48,399
what's going on in the politics, what's going on in the communities. Furthermore, they get a steer from the administration.

140
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,570
The Biden administration explicitly, overtly cares about environmental and racial justice.

141
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,940
The Trump administration explicitly and overtly carries out a very tough immigration policy at the border.

142
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:07,170
The people in the bureaucracy took their messages from it. So the agency decides to issue a rule based on a lot of informal soundings.

143
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:16,590
And sometimes this produces artifacts. For example, the EPA, if the FDA is authorized to go after Beijing for several years and it didn't,

144
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:24,059
because they were trying to figure out both the science they wanted unimpeachable science and also the politics and the effects,

145
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:31,350
the social science of, for example, going after Jewel. Because the whole issue with vaping is, is juvenile reduction techniques.

146
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,770
That means people quit smoking or is a gateway into combustibles.

147
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:43,069
And that's a science question. There's also a social behavior question, right?

148
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,630
So high school bathrooms smell like gummy bears because of joule.

149
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,240
Does this then lead to purchase of combustibles,

150
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:57,469
which are far worse for you by any standard that we know that a goods that are relatively reputable then plus the question of what about bad vaping,

151
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:05,780
you know, weird stuff that got imported developed over. So the FDA had authority to regulate this and it treaded very, very lightly.

152
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,500
It was doing a lot of informal information gathering in trying to make sure

153
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,759
that they had good enough science to survive the challenges of social science.

154
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,470
To answer this question about whether it's a harm reduction technique or a gateway drug,

155
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,940
and also figuring out whether they had the political support to do it if things go.

156
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:32,380
So they eventually did. But this is one of the most acrimonious that nobody ever knows is really important.

157
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:38,800
This was also created by Reagan. Much of the modern world, the Office of Information Regulatory Affairs in the White House.

158
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,940
When Ronald Reagan came into office, from his point of view, that vast,

159
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,659
sprawling federal bureaucracy churning out regulations on all sorts of things

160
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,549
and collectively and narrow mindedly interfering with people doing legitimate,

161
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,010
reasonable things like running businesses and raised standards.

162
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:04,609
And he said, what we need to do is get one central office that will allow us to have an oversight of the government and veto any regulation that we,

163
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,740
the White House, see through the politically elected representative of the country, I think is too burdensome.

164
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:18,320
So if you're writing a proposal to regulate any agency, you have to frame it in a way that makes sense to OIRA.

165
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:27,169
The director by Aura is a very, very powerful person. So, for example, under the Obama administration's guidance, Cass Sunstein,

166
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:32,660
who is a law professor at the University of Dayton, so professor at Harvard.

167
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:40,579
So it is no longer so it's like, how did you manage to be a professor at Harvard Law School and not know that?

168
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:52,540
Oh, Harvard Law School now is it? Anyway, so Sunstein had a gave a strong vibe that he needed to fit with his concept of behavioral economic analysis.

169
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,750
And this was actually a thing Obama likes behavioral economic analysis,

170
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,150
something like behavioral economic analysis agencies took the encouragement

171
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,260
that they would do better if they had behavioral economics in their framing.

172
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:09,700
Obviously, the Trump administration says the main problem with you regulatory agencies is they regulate too much.

173
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,870
And so they applied a very tough hurdle to regulate.

174
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:17,540
The Biden administration is obviously more accepting of regulations on, for example, environmental grounds.

175
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,900
And in some areas, they're actually kind of pushing agencies to.

176
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,910
Be a little more attentive, for example, to racial justice. Okay.

177
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,660
So you have to please the IRA because they can kill your process at any time,

178
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:35,370
which means that it's good form to make sure that you think you're aligned with what they're trying to do.

179
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,330
Because we do have elections and elections do have consequences.

180
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:42,020
And the Biden administration and the Trump administration, we're not trying to achieve the same goals.

181
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,600
Once you've done all that, you publish a notice of proposed rulemaking.

182
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,430
This is basically a little essay, often quite lucidly written.

183
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:58,980
You have to write them well because people read every word closely about what you're trying to do.

184
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:03,370
What's the problem we're trying to solve? Why are we trying to solve this problem now?

185
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:07,740
On what legal basis are we trying to solve this problem? Are you going to do.

186
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,770
And you put it out there for Common Period.

187
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:16,090
And people who don't think they can get their comments into their comments together can ask for extensions.

188
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:21,570
And the agency issued an extension. The case we're going to be working through today actually have an extension built in.

189
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:28,940
In all public hearings, and you can, even if the comments are significantly interesting.

190
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,950
So to create a reply period so that if people say interesting things in the comments that other people

191
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:38,060
can comment on the comments and the whole thing could be like a ministerial regulation stuck in.

192
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:45,300
Based on that and everything else. They're not issue a final rule.

193
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:49,950
That's what this agency described. They are legally mandated to listen to everything.

194
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:58,710
I was once reading a comments on proposal and somebody who I think was confused offered to sell the government quote and excellent for him.

195
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:08,459
I think he thought he was I think I think he was on some marketplace website set of regulations so that it were 330 million Americans.

196
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:15,770
Right. If 10% of us are having a bad day and what's going on, that's 33 million people, one of whom has a second good fortune, Howard Cosell.

197
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:20,560
Okay. Agencies are required to respond to all of it.

198
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:26,139
A lot of the time, if it's a steady response, they'd like to see if they'd be helped by a consultant job specifically to kind of

199
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,310
go through and show how they deal with and interpret it each one of these cuts.

200
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:35,560
So even if you're offering something completely misguided, such as trying to sell a forging hammer.

201
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,300
You nonetheless are going to get a response. Okay.

202
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,190
So we are asking you when you write these to submit them.

203
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,360
Do it for real. And you're guaranteed that people are going to have to look at it and consider it, even if they don't listen to you.

204
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:56,219
I mean. As the president in the lyrics and of things.

205
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't recommend coming out with a rule that has any kind of environmental and justice racial injustice component right now,

206
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,710
and ignoring racial justice and expecting the White House to give you an easy ride.

207
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,879
Likewise, I would not have, under the Trump administration,

208
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,130
recommended putting forth anything that touched on immigration or reproductive rights and would please respectively,

209
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:24,290
President Trump and Vice President Pence. So after that, the final rule goes into effect, usually 30 days.

210
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,080
Sometimes the rule requires sort of quite a lot of work,

211
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:32,180
like you have to do capital investment or something for pollution, scrubber or clean technology.

212
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:40,110
So you might have more time. Now, interim final rules and direct final rules into your final rules can be altered.

213
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:44,360
But basically, they published the final proposal, like the text, and you can comment on that.

214
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,280
But they don't go through the two step process and indirect final rule is they publish it.

215
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,600
That happens unless they get really bad comments. So these are typically super low profile things.

216
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,570
Another bubble is typical of federal regulations. That's what we call administrative law.

217
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:05,380
Congress does not pass the code of federal regulations. This is all the stuff that happens through the Administrative Procedures Act.

218
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,300
Any immediate questions? Basically, it's about all things, right?

219
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:20,090
So you start with an inside agenda and you get it onto the agency agenda, which involves the decision to issue the rule.

220
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:29,170
You make sure that the White House and y are happy. You put in a notice of proposed rulemaking with the broad sense of what you're trying to achieve.

221
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:34,660
You make a final rule based on those comments partially, and it goes into effect.

222
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:44,640
Now the question. Yes. Libby, is it a short question that I repeated or over that.

223
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:54,340
Got now? So would you be writing articles to the agency because they ultimately decided not to do that?

224
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:59,310
Oh, I think treatment. That's what I'm going to do next.

225
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,580
You don't need to figure this stuff out.

226
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:10,440
In the first policy memo, you're saying, hey, what do I want Greg Abbott to do and how do I persuade Greg Abbott to do it in this policy memo?

227
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,390
The agency under the APA is telling what you're commenting on.

228
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:21,840
So let's. Go over.

229
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:28,210
And this is where. This is where I convince you that I don't know how to type it.

230
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,190
I think this is really pretty intuitive, but maybe I just deal with a lot of bad websites.

231
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:55,370
Now. Let's do.

232
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:03,110
Let's get this. Environmental justice.

233
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:15,380
I want to do that specifically because this is something I discovered. Was an interesting thing.

234
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:22,510
Look at all the suggested text. A lot of people seem to be looking for this and they're having trouble figuring out exactly what they're doing.

235
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:27,060
Okay. But let's do environmental justice scorecard.

236
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:33,480
Because you heard about this. Okay.

237
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:39,390
This is, as you would predict from a search, everything that involves that. Notice the three tabs right beneath the search.

238
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:43,620
Dockets, documents, and comments. Okay. It defaults to documents.

239
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:47,070
I don't know why. Because what you want to do here is you want to find an issue.

240
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,469
A docket refers to kind of the file that you can imagine, a literal file.

241
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:55,860
In Europe, they call these dossiers and dossiers French for like a binder.

242
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:03,390
So when you see docket, you have to picture somebody like pulling a box, file off a shelf containing all the really key documents for this.

243
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:11,420
So let's do environmental justice. We go over the dockets. Dustin got a lot clearer, didn't it?

244
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,150
I didn't even have to use a filter. So I'm going to go back out.

245
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:24,019
Make it harder again. So now we have quite a large number of things.

246
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:31,880
If you check the documents, you will see that at this point we have 50,000 things you could read on the subject.

247
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,400
Over the dockets. You see, it's a lot simpler.

248
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:43,229
We have 47 things that you can read from across the federal government and all sorts of interesting stuff.

249
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:50,820
Right. Okay. U.S. Coast Guard Environmental Justice Strategy.

250
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:55,830
Department of Transportation. Improving regulations on Environmental Justice.

251
00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:01,400
Children. Elderly. Now I can see the one we're looking for today because I took this example.

252
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:06,760
But there's a couple of ways to do it. One is to say, do we want non rule making, a rule making?

253
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,600
For example, when you're writing a strategy that's non rulemaking,

254
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,990
you're trying to figure out how to do something as against make a rule out of the API.

255
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:21,550
But I'm going to do is I had to hop over to our target organization today, which is the Council on Environmental Quality.

256
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:29,120
Now they don't happen to give you an abstract, but that's okay. We have two documents.

257
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:34,140
Here we have. The extension of the comment period.

258
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:40,020
I don't know why they did, but this is why they notify you that you can comment on this until November 3rd.

259
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:53,470
Here we have what we really care about, which is the RFI on the Environmental Justice Scorecard from the Council on Environmental Quality.

260
00:25:55,310 --> 00:26:01,310
Now, if you prefer PDFs, this is what the Federal Register actually looks like.

261
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,210
Right. So, three column print. Very beautiful.

262
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:15,620
I mean, it's been decades since I've seen a physical copy of this, right? As a three column crisis means that you need to start here.

263
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:19,730
I don't know what this thing about the National Marine Fisheries Services that you don't need to care either.

264
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:23,350
Okay. So you can read in PDF here.

265
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:32,790
Most people just read it in HTML. It's not an enormous document. So what we're going to do is we're going to go back to PowerPoint.

266
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:39,360
And your first task is going to be to pair up and find your way to this document.

267
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:45,500
And in many ways it's a simple website because if you look at it.

268
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:51,660
All right. You want to pay attention to the docket? You want to use the basic search term.

269
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:59,130
You don't want to get too specific on the search terms because, for example, all those let's see, for example, what happens to this one.

270
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:04,680
Does it actually get you the right thing? Right.

271
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:10,829
I don't know precisely what search term is wrong when you add RFI August 3rd, 2022.

272
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,930
But this is not the kind of search engine that likes this.

273
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:20,610
This is the kind of search engine that rewards typing in environmental justice and then using filters on the docket.

274
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:26,020
Okay. As you noticed, purely from environmental justice, right?

275
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:33,680
All of you could write comments on notices of rulemaking and nominal making activities just on the subject of environmental justice, if you want to.

276
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:40,200
But you can type all sorts of other things in as well get. Now what I'd like you to do in Paris.

277
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,840
For about 20 minutes is up over.

278
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,110
Regulation scope. Find the Environmental Justice Scorecard.

279
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:57,210
RFI Request for information. Figure out what it says and then answer these three questions.

280
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,370
What's the purpose? What would an effective common look like in your heads?

281
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:04,900
And then go read the comments. They're quite variable and they're all interesting.

282
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,780
But we chose this partly because people are writing interesting stuff,

283
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:11,110
as well as a couple of people who are writing stuff, as we say, less professional.

284
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:17,140
Okay. Pairs three if you're desperate to hang out together.

285
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,579
Take about 20 minutes. And then we're going to evaluate the quality of the comments.

286
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:29,290
And bear in mind, as you work, of course, that. These clemency or evaluating going to be the comments that you're going to be writing and submitting?

287
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:51,740
Please, I. So is.

288
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:10,990
So this is kind of like.

289
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:39,540
It's important to talk about it.

290
00:29:50,820 --> 00:30:11,080
You. All right, it's.

291
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:41,420
So it's just like these comments and I'd be like, Yeah, yeah, yeah.

292
00:30:55,130 --> 00:31:26,880
Obviously it's. So it was 25 years of experience.

293
00:31:28,550 --> 00:32:00,350
Yeah, that's it's really interesting.

294
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:19,800
This wasn't the first time I have been here since I was 30.

295
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:32,500
How important is that?

296
00:32:34,420 --> 00:33:16,090
Yeah, that's how I would do something like this.

297
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:37,720
You know, I'm not one person.

298
00:33:38,830 --> 00:34:48,310
I don't think that's what it is that I was so excited to know that it was kind of like this.

299
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:59,100
So. Yeah, well, I was at a property.

300
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,280
Yeah, right. So I don't know.

301
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:56,230
I don't know. I was surprised to find somebody else just out of curiosity about what's been.

302
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:12,280
Virus. This is not gentle and I believe this is just so.

303
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:48,400
I think there is no doubt that this is very good.

304
00:36:55,570 --> 00:38:31,380
I think, you know, one thing is for certain.

305
00:38:35,800 --> 00:39:16,260
I really like to see how it works.

306
00:39:32,790 --> 00:40:59,000
Once I got to the last few years, I don't think I actually think right now it seems like everything works tirelessly for.

307
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:06,990
It's better than ever before.

308
00:41:13,440 --> 00:42:48,840
I wonder if there is any indication that that was done, that according to the fiscal policies that we just didn't know.

309
00:42:51,270 --> 00:44:10,700
I think it's another thing, you know, it's hard to make yourself and I think in terms of ignorance and I think that,

310
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:53,870
you know, you have to have said, well, you know, I don't have anything like that.

311
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:56,790
I was born in the United States and it looks like is not.

312
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:11,910
Okay. 5 minutes, actually. Four. And remember, you are this is a dry run for your next policy memo.

313
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:19,560
So once you understand what's in the RFI, what's going on, you really want to focus on this is a good answer and here's why.

314
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:21,690
This is a bad answer and here's why.

315
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,220
Because in a sense, when we sit down and write them, we're going a federal civil servant, please sit down and read them.

316
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,550
They're implicitly putting great on their head. This is completely unprofessional.

317
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:36,080
See, the policies on this is really excellent and useful, she tells us.

318
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:45,260
Okay, so grade them. You don't have to literally end upgrades, but think about why the essay prompt is the RFI.

319
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:51,770
The answers are the comments you need to think through which ones are clearly one point relevant and persuasive.

320
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,820
And which ones just make you look kind of like we should have a conversation.

321
00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:01,570
The difference is you school here and I say we should have a conversation.

322
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:08,700
You screw up the politics. You have more friends. Well.

323
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:24,040
Whoa. Do. Yeah.

324
00:47:24,820 --> 00:48:12,980
Yeah. You know, I have to tell you, you got to be very nice.

325
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:18,610
I know that. I know.

326
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:25,920
Yes, I.

327
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:51,730
Absolutely. I was using that as much as well.

328
00:48:55,410 --> 00:49:13,220
Interestingly, I don't think there's an answer to how.

329
00:49:21,680 --> 00:51:15,120
This is one of those jobs to make sure they're making money or, you know, legislation to decrease checks and all of those things.

330
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,910
But I don't think I don't know.

331
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:42,160
I just think it's all over now.

332
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:50,070
But I think you have to have a strategy.

333
00:51:50,080 --> 00:52:01,060
But I think it's as good as it gets.

334
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:15,570
Oh, I think what we decided this week.

335
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:32,650
Think so. Well, and you said about the potential consultants and how do you respond to that?

336
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:46,930
Like I said, you know.

337
00:52:53,400 --> 00:53:20,470
Right now, there is a lot of noise.

338
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:33,410
Why is it so crazy?

339
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:56,860
I would like to go over the format of what works with people whom I still.

340
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:02,170
I just like to help each other.

341
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:18,260
I like to try to do what I tell them right now so that they can write with Stephen Smith if they want to exaggerate.

342
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:24,900
Okay, let's do this.

343
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:34,330
Okay. I'll take this side of you.

344
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:39,160
Okay. What is this RFI trying to do?

345
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:43,580
What is the essay problem? What is the question on which to ask the questions?

346
00:54:43,750 --> 00:55:01,650
Your advice? Consultation. Responses. But either way, the purpose of this proposed house.

347
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,570
I'll be honest.

348
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:24,970
But basically what I thought they'd have to do is make some sort of crazy scheme for federal agencies that puts environmental justice on their agenda.

349
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:29,610
And there were like three categories I forget,

350
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:38,830
and I would basically say three really big categories that it didn't get a lot of quantitative measurements into.

351
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:45,850
But it's just a. Okay.

352
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:49,870
That is correct. You have your Europeans over here. Yes.

353
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:56,410
So you have so few things going on, right? One is that they want to create a scorecard.

354
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:04,799
Scorecard, right. If you are in debt to figure out where you're doing what you're doing.

355
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:11,760
All right. I'm very good at math and I'm very good at biology so that I need to either do biology or cataract.

356
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:17,040
So this is work. I just love to see where it's not performing.

357
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:24,360
And I really like to work on there, which is that we got these three categories and they go to quantitatively.

358
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:30,120
So what are they asking for or asking for? More conceptual conversation about the nature of time?

359
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:46,150
They're asking for more by asking for better indicators, probably quality, because they want to be able to say the Department of Energy is right.

360
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:51,020
Department of Transportation is yellow and the Department of HHS is clean.

361
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:58,660
Right? They want to be able to say, hey, energy, get your act together, your environmental justice, performance support or FEMA.

362
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:04,150
You should like disseminate good practice because you're doing really well, all things.

363
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:09,880
So they're asking for hearings to pose a scorecard within the conceptual framework that they have,

364
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,320
because there's not a lot of arguing about what environmental justice means, that they're.

365
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:21,900
There is a lot of argument about how you make environmental justice work and everything else that the federal government and the decide.

366
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,410
So then I thought that was kind of fun.

367
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:32,540
Everybody even like Stephen Smith and basically everybody went to the plumbers and then most of you went to other dentists.

368
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:37,880
But you read a lot of them. So I'm going to kind of collapse live to ask questions.

369
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:43,970
What are your favorite or least favorite comments? Bear in mind that you are going to write comics.

370
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,540
Okay, so how should I format this? What might be pleased?

371
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:51,649
Same. We'll start by we're really standards for the federal government.

372
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:55,000
So what do you do to please the kinds of people read this?

373
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:58,640
Right. See all of these, he said. This one is a reality.

374
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:04,070
I'm not a law firm hired by a union. What are good and bad sides.

375
00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:16,600
But this is honestly what the bad comments do are to. So I read the commentary from the American Leading Institute, and I really liked about this one.

376
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:22,340
It was very organized and it separated out each paragraph by the citizen framework.

377
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:27,650
That makes it very clear to the reader what they were commenting on and.

378
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,030
That's a really big one.

379
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:39,600
It has a set of specific questions in line with the politics and format and the number of that's what the format of the site is.

380
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:49,310
The boldface question is the typeface hence. You can see why here in the federal government and you want to find out how to work through this topic.

381
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:56,030
This is exactly the kind of thing I like to see. Or some other good points or bad facts.

382
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:04,250
We have to done this. Okay.

383
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:05,959
At first first I have you know,

384
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:14,840
I liked it because it gave a very specific like the dental model was very specific and it showed how it impacted communities disproportionately.

385
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:23,149
And it seems like this is a the question. So you're saying we need to we also need to take a sense of an environmental scorecard

386
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:28,520
nationwide to have three categories that benefit the communities and such great justice.

387
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:33,450
And then for us, the category of projects that they're all going to save.

388
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:40,580
And so it's kind of that it can be useful, but it's not necessarily interconnection.

389
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:49,700
And it doesn't make sense to have like a super broad environmental justice scorecard and then have a score on that.

390
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:57,680
So that was a helpful comment, but not necessarily interim.

391
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:06,290
Yeah, like in a sense, props to them for, you know, doing right by people who are paying and is actually an issue, I think.

392
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:12,980
But what are we going to have for principles now on principles being introduced to help you in that district?

393
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:20,850
Imagine sitting at this house with environmental quality. You're like, This is great.

394
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:24,440
But tell me, we posed the question and we didn't ask the question, but.

395
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:32,330
Surely somebody has got some bad practice. I think every single person in this room laughed.

396
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:44,290
That's what you do on. Well with on Smith.

397
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:48,729
First of all, he didn't do any sort of such things for like reasoning for his point of view.

398
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:52,350
It was kind of like, this is going to hurt communities. That's it.

399
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:58,380
So we didn't really provide any account of how that's going to help in cases like this.

400
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:06,820
They don't want you there. That's one and all. And then you kind of get sick to provide for.

401
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:14,300
But like better security and better education, better infrastructure is kind of, I would say, a very flawed statement of what's necessary.

402
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:25,120
And so it doesn't really highlight what's his primary problem and then is documentation for our society.

403
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:31,490
And it's just that Americans should. Oh, yes.

404
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:42,430
And Save the Queen and maybe strengthen the other one that in the Plumbing Association is like you didn't even have a good argument against it.

405
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:49,630
But when you have the fact that this is a more clear goal, that's something I like about the funding.

406
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:56,870
It was just like, Oh, you know, it's kind of funny, the same way you say you're going to invest in community.

407
01:01:56,870 --> 01:02:00,470
So what does that actually mean? As if this is just one specific.

408
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:08,400
I love the parallels in the Internet. Right. Because Stevenson basically wrote a letter to the editor.

409
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:14,940
I would not be surprised to read Stevenson. And the problem in a letter to the editor doesn't answer any questions.

410
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:22,860
Whereas the plumbers think this relationship to this agenda looks like what they're doing, the questions they're saying, okay, we think you.

411
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:29,939
We're not 100% sure that this is the right priority for you in Miami to say we're going to do security in a way

412
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:36,660
that brings us closer to our utterly rational viewpoint as as we can and will lose in a properly organized way.

413
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:44,510
The theory is that they hired lawyers to do it. The lobbyists, lobbyists, law firms, the difficult associations often.

414
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:57,440
Any more of practice. I didn't like anything that they were proposing.

415
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:12,570
The good thing is having specific. Suggestions for the agency to actually do.

416
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:21,150
Like I was reading one from the Center for Coalfield Justice and they also had been split up into sections into the questions.

417
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:30,050
Like one specific thing they said was the scoreboard should double the number of public meetings held in environmental justice communities.

418
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:33,860
I think there's a very concrete suggestion that actually.

419
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:40,030
And it's perfect, right? They genuinely fight.

420
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,580
And this is the fight over it.

421
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:49,780
Now, I think we can all think of reasons why a number of years ago, the advantages of between a bad metric and no metric.

422
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:53,800
What do you think's going to get fixed? We're getting a scorecard.

423
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:54,810
We have to give you. Great.

424
01:03:56,710 --> 01:04:03,790
And if we're going to use the number of meetings in a given place as an indicator of public engagement and community engagement.

425
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:08,019
Well, okay, let's do it. You can see it.

426
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:10,540
All right. How do you say I understand what that means?

427
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:16,630
And I want to say 2.7 million people spread across a couple of dozen different cabinet agencies.

428
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:21,880
The extent to which the suffering communities. Bit of an right.

429
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:28,540
And that's why it is our real you know, one of the questions you might have is, is the toughest kabuki?

430
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:32,590
Are we just going to take a little show ahead and do what we want to do?

431
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:40,150
Did you get the sense you got an agenda that they have a real need for and that is going to pull it out after you go through this tough.

432
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:45,100
And you see it in both directions, right?

433
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:52,690
If you read a lot of immigration law stuff from the Trump era, you saw very clear and constructive comments on how to make life harder so that more.

434
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:59,930
I got to know that there were a lot of good ideas for that that were available at the time this.

435
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:05,950
Anything else you can take away as you start formulating your own?

436
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:10,330
Because please say this. I can't make use of the federal government.

437
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:15,940
But if you read something, the quality that we see in this class, you get something of the quality here.

438
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:28,529
So lots of things, the auditors organizing and answering their questions, all facing the evening so we know exactly which of their questions.

439
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:32,510
The answer evidence. This is the negative thesis.

440
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:35,570
Stephen Smith is going to explain. Make a good point.

441
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:41,540
Answer their questions more broadly. If they say We have great theory, but what we need is metrics.

442
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:47,240
And the most powerful thing to do is get the metrics. Now.

443
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:50,660
That's how it is. This is a scorecard, scorecard, a set of metrics.

444
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:54,870
Therefore, it says, let's ask for the understanding, the intent.

445
01:05:54,890 --> 01:06:02,360
Right. That's the background sections about. Before we ask you specific questions, here's the thing that we're trying to accomplish.

446
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:02,690
Right.

447
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:10,210
And if you don't like what they're trying to accomplish, there's a whole next level of how you persuade or you want to help while actually harming.

448
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:16,849
So for example, on this one, I would make a case for metrics that would take years to classify in collaboration with state

449
01:06:16,850 --> 01:06:23,780
governments to be able to access it together because eventually you have to pay for it all.

450
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:30,020
And I think the UN office and there won't be the budget for it and healthcare at the end of the day,

451
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:35,840
that's what I would do if I kind of defined the state of states. We want to.

452
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:44,050
What's. I think you correctly identified the really good points as the positive.

453
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:50,210
So if the individual for the comments thing is no point regulation [INAUDIBLE] up I care about.

454
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,570
And you saw what I did. I type environmental justice into the facts.

455
01:06:55,110 --> 01:07:00,490
There was something else right here about refugee status. Refugee status?

456
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:05,130
Remember? No specific. But justice boarded by.

457
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:06,030
Justice just supported.

458
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:15,650
And then rummage around until you see a rule making process or not rule making processes open for comments and activities or this case.

459
01:07:16,850 --> 01:07:21,180
I look at it and say, What can I contribute to this? And play like an adult.

460
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:29,970
I think an American citizen knows more about public health in the old days when people in United States have something to say like.

461
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:38,700
And by and large, the quality stuff we see, the pluses as well as the quality of service.

462
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:43,400
The Washington Post the way. It's a lot.

463
01:07:54,490 --> 01:08:26,540
They are pretty much more.
