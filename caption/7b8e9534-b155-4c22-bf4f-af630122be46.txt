00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,180
Hi, I'm India Ornelas.

2
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:34,340
I'm an associate professor in the Department of Health Systems and Population Health and also currently serving as our interim chair.

3
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:40,879
I'm also the director of our MPH Core Curriculum, our first year curriculum for the MPH program,

4
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,150
and I've been teaching in public health for about ten years.

5
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:53,370
I am Enrique Neblett, a professor of Health Behavior and Health Education at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.

6
00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:02,190
I teach classes in social determinants of health and also thinking about race, ethnicity and mental health

7
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,319
here at the University of Michigan.

8
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:22,500
My name is Yesenia Merino.

9
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:14,159
I am at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the Gillings School of Global Public Health,

10
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,479
where I am the Director of Inclusive Excellence, Education and Training.

11
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,500
And what that means for most of my days is that I work with faculty,

12
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:30,420
staff and students on developing anti-racist curricula, on making classrooms more inclusive,

13
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:38,670
I provide trainings for those that are interested in doing a little bit more around fostering an inclusive environment.

14
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,520
My name is Jannah Bierens and I am the founder and principal of Phreeedom Consulting and Facilitation.

15
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,340
Phreeedom, spelled with a P, H and three e's,

16
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:54,879
stands for Public Health Racial Equity through Exploration and Engagement to Dismantle Oppression for Movement Public Health.

17
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,660
We love acronyms. And the work that I do aims to deepen relationships with self and others, disrupt normative

18
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,739
and either/or thinking, the colonizing and democratizing the data,

19
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:11,140
but ultimately just dismantling false narratives and ineffective systems that impact our health.

20
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,340
My name is Dr. William Lopez, and I'm a clinical assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.

21
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,760
I teach many of the core public health courses, including social determinants of health and communication fundamentals,

22
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:32,560
but also teach many other courses about race and health, including one I developed called The Health Impacts of Law Enforcement in the U.S.

23
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,820
I teach. I do research. I write.

24
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,540
I'm also a poet.

25
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:48,760
I'm kind of trying to do what I can to open up another lane for how we think about what counts as knowledge and evidence and testimony in terms of,

26
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,380
you know, what we do it for as as public scholars and educators and scientists.

27
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,829
But I think that, you know, mostly in terms of, you know, my presence in the field,

28
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,700
I think that it's in terms of education, it's the teaching aspect of it.

29
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:10,790
Right. And then, of course, I think indirectly on some level, by opening up new conversations and trying to push the envelope a little bit.

30
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:16,960
I think that that's also an opportunity, I think, for me to kind of inform the field, I think, and inform future scholars.

31
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,850
My name is Dr. Sharrelle Barber.

32
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:26,570
I'm a social epidemiologist and an assistant professor of Epidemiology at the Drexel University Dornsife School of Public Health.

33
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:34,610
I am also the inaugural director of the Ubuntu Center on Racism, Global Movements and Population Health Equity here at the school.

34
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:40,940
That's kind of my first role, is in training mostly master's students, but also doctoral students through teaching.

35
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:48,500
And I also engage in research which has the involvement of students at the master's level and at the Ph.D. level.

36
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:56,870
And so I'm kind of involved in shaping kind of the next, the up and coming generation of public health practitioners and

37
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:04,610
folks within the field of public health and also the next and up and coming kind of scholars within the field as well.

38
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,770
My name is Kelly Gonzales. I'm an enrolled citizen of the Cherokee Nation.

39
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:20,730
My role is associate professor at the Oregon Health Science University, Portland State University, New Joint School of Public Health.

40
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:28,800
In that role, I serve as researcher, educator and advisor to students.

41
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,920
I also work in community as a community advocate and leader in the native community.

42
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:43,110
My specific role at the School of Public Health is changing or expanding.

43
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:51,060
This fall, I will be director of the new Indigenous Health Concentration that we'll be implementing in the School of Public Health.

44
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:59,190
This new education pathway gives students an opportunity to learn about public health from a decolonized perspective.

45
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:04,710
It situates in the lives, and values of indigenous people.

46
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:17,580
And we're really using this pathway or building this pathway to create a future workforce that has the capacity for decolonizing practices,

47
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:24,060
whether it's in data, research, health policy and in community engagement.

48
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:35,310
My name is Chandra Ford. I am professor of Community Health Sciences and founding director of the Center for the Study of Racism,

49
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,390
Social Justice and Health at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.

50
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:52,010
The most immediate role is the role I play in the classroom developing and teaching courses around primarily around health inequities.

51
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:57,110
The secondary role is a role in advising. Formal advising.

52
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:09,270
Advising Masters students who are interested in becoming public health professionals, often at the master's level and advising doctoral students.

53
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:14,090
Most of my doctoral students are interested in the way and studying becoming

54
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:21,870
researchers around issues of racism or social injustices as they affect health.
