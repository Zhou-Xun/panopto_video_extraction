1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,180
Okay. So what's left over?

2
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:23,670
Okay. And my recording.

3
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,910
Cool. All right. So just as some of you may recall, I actually moved your quiz number four.

4
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:37,070
So your quiz number four is not due now rather than being due Sunday night.

5
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:42,750
It's due Monday night after winter break or night of winter break, Thanksgiving break.

6
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,780
So it's due Monday, the 28th by 11:59 p.m.

7
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:53,320
Most of the answers to the quiz will be based on today's lecture.

8
00:00:54,070 --> 00:01:03,340
Just as a heads up at your behest. You don't have class next Tuesday, so that's why we're consolidating.

9
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,890
So I'm going to do psychosocial factors of ergonomics today and then also talk about train the trainer models.

10
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:16,900
So I will not see you at all next week. So if you don't have class after Tuesday morning, you're free as a B.

11
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,950
But I will just say we are barreling towards the end of the class.

12
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:28,059
So by now I hope you have downloaded my comments right here where your questionnaire.

13
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:36,190
Right, because you'll have to revise and uploaded version of that and also do a write up that includes a potential analysis plan.

14
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:44,640
But the big one is that we have research posters and presentations do on December six.

15
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,820
This is relating to a topic that you're choosing.

16
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,170
Have examples on canvas. There's we're about three weeks out from that.

17
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,190
I have the whole 15th week's schedule for that.

18
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:05,710
But given the number of people we have in this class, pretty sure we can knock it out on Tuesday and then you have Thursday to go do what you want.

19
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,949
But just as a reminder on canvas, you will turn into me the the actual poster.

20
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,529
But in class you'll maybe have an accompanying slide show that kind of zooms in on your poster.

21
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,210
So we're not all just staring like trying to make out what's on your poster.

22
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:30,010
And that is basically your final thing besides the quiz and then the worker questionnaire, you're not starting from scratch.

23
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,200
So while we're really towards the end of the road, can you believe it?

24
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,399
It's really helped me today to finish another class two days. I'm like, Oh, you are.

25
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,350
You finish another class to do the assignment do but much.

26
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,720
I was like the last class before with presentation.

27
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:52,440
Was that with Dr. Fleming? No, it was. What is her name?

28
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,130
Her first name? Anthony Yeah, it's right.

29
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,340
There you go. PERSON Okay. You're like, I don't know. No, who teaches?

30
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:05,460
It's going to tell you what she looks like. What, him, I think this instructor.

31
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,640
Oh, kind of thing. So who that is? Who? This.

32
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:14,160
She just does this class. It seems that she has her own business. Hello? Okay, well, that's nice that.

33
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,140
That's wrapped up. Yeah, I know. Okay, great hesitation.

34
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,210
Super fun, great groups, great group presentation.

35
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,399
Yeah. Yeah. Do you like those? I like I believe in assigned group.

36
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,740
Yeah. It's like. And you do. I don't with me people in each group.

37
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,850
Yeah. How is it. Like one of my friends group. They have seven people in it.

38
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,120
That's a lot for like trying to schedule. Yeah.

39
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:51,299
It's, it's too much like we've never all been on the same meeting, so everything's like, really like disjointed three 3 to 4 score.

40
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,910
Seems like the max. Really. So it's it must be a large class.

41
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,330
It is, yeah. I have many complaints about this class.

42
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,359
Put it in the course of hours, by the way, I'm not sure when those get released,

43
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,700
but when they do, I think they give you bonus points if you fill it out.

44
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,090
Also my other class. So if you fill it out that we greatly appreciate it.

45
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:23,010
Yes. So. Okay.

46
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:30,210
Pick it up. Yes. Bridgette, do you have, like, research posts or templates that you want us to use?

47
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:39,450
Yeah. You know, also on canvas, I put in two templates for you under the it's in the resource.

48
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,130
Yeah. So there's a horizontal one and a vertical one.

49
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:51,320
Whatever you want to do. Or if y'all want to get super fancy and use Canva, that's fine.

50
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:57,420
But you have to turn it into a format that I can actually like open PDF, some PowerPoint,

51
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:05,880
something like that because some of your with the with the macbook's be challenging to but the weird file formats.

52
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,470
Yeah. But whatever you like or you can use a template.

53
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:19,830
I'm good. Okay. So, you know, on Tuesday.

54
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,710
Yeah, it's Thursday. On Tuesday.

55
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:33,809
You know, Cheryl kind of went into detail on the issue with ergonomics and specifically musculoskeletal disorders, which she talks about.

56
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:39,440
It comprises over 150 diagnoses that affect the muscles, bones, joints.

57
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,660
You've had tennis, elbow. I have carpal tunnel.

58
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,620
Some people may also have, you know, renowned syndrome.

59
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:58,620
Right. So these work related messages are a significant portion of worker's compensation claims every year in terms of days away from work disability.

60
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:05,130
And according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics accounts for about a third of workplace injuries and illness cases.

61
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,620
The cost, it depends on who you ask, what the cost is, but it's definitely in the billions.

62
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,530
And so, you know, any work related disorder has multiple factors.

63
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:24,269
So physical, organizational, the psychosocial, which we'll focus on and then the sociological in particular.

64
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:29,370
And Cheryl talks about the general risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders.

65
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,730
This is more so within the physical or organizational side.

66
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:46,320
So there are certain things, for example, like physical capacity or even like distance of lift that could be modified by the organization.

67
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:52,740
Right. They can change their workflow. They can, as she talked about, they could change the way they do shift rotation, all of that.

68
00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:02,130
Some things are kind of unavoidable, though. So, you know, in particular, like one of the groups that I work with are nail salon workers.

69
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:09,030
And nail salon workers get a lot of musculoskeletal disorders, particularly cumulative trauma disorders,

70
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,890
because they work with a lot of tools that do fine motor movements.

71
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,290
And they often work on like edges, like hard edges as well that put strain,

72
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:27,779
but they have no idea what ergonomics actually is or like how to adjust their chair or how to get padding any of that.

73
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:34,200
They'll do a lot of awkward posturing and bending, even when performing pedicures, for example.

74
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:43,050
So it also totally depends on your profession as well your age, your gender, previous conditions and all that.

75
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:50,609
So harkening back to earlier in the semester when we talked about, you know,

76
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:55,950
the job demands resources model, when we're looking at job characteristics like work,

77
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:03,720
stress, work load, etc., the worst combination that you can have is you have high demands and then low control.

78
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:09,930
And then from the organizational sense, if you have communication issues and a lack of clarity,

79
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:15,239
poor interpersonal relationships, the temporal aspects in particular,

80
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:23,910
if you do shift work or you work third shift or what they call night shift or graveyard shift sometimes, and then the cycle time of tasks,

81
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:31,380
what are the financial aspects, community aspects and prestige, and then conflict at work and then also job satisfaction.

82
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:37,530
So what we know about the physiological physiology of the body in particular,

83
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:45,780
you know, for something like carpal tunnel disorder or if you have renowned syndrome,

84
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:55,830
generally when you have these nerve traumas, they tend to get worse in colder temperatures than warmer temperatures.

85
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:02,130
And the reason for that is that, you know, your blood vessels constrict, right?

86
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,080
Your body becomes more rigid because of these cold temperatures.

87
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:13,290
And so you're like, you know, with your Gumby example, you're less flexible in the colder temperatures.

88
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,820
But when you turn up like.

89
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:26,530
But that also makes you more prone to injury, because if you think about like if you're like a Gumby, for example, and just say you bend Gumby.

90
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:33,060
Imagine Gumby is you in the summertime, your leg will bend really easily.

91
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:36,820
Whereas if you're like, think about you as like a Barbie.

92
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:41,530
But in the wintertime, if you try to like bend her leg, it'll snap.

93
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:48,190
Not that your leg would snap in half, like in the winter, but, you know, people get injured more so in the winter.

94
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:58,210
And if you're thinking about things like human hair, right. When people snow shovel in the winter, they tend to get a lot of cardiac issues,

95
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,980
but also musculoskeletal disorders as well, because they underestimate,

96
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:12,760
number one, how your mechanical load when you're doing work, when it's cold, feels less than when you're doing it in a hot temperature.

97
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,649
But also people don't lift properly and you're supposed to like bend your knees when you throw the snow,

98
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,310
but people just do it with their upper body and then strain their back.

99
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:31,810
And then, you know, it's not uncommon that people will just get heart attacks when shoveling snow sets, possibly someone someone random.

100
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:38,670
So I think is just the door. It's just the way I was like.

101
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:51,150
So within that same, like keeping that analogy in mind with what the cold does to your body in terms of musculoskeletal disorders,

102
00:10:51,480 --> 00:11:04,260
the same thing can be said with stress. So when you're more stressed psychologically, your body is more tense, it is less relaxed, you're more rigid.

103
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:11,460
And therefore, when you're doing physical or mechanical lifting or load, you're more susceptible to injury.

104
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:23,400
So if we think about factors outside of the workplace, right, you have to think about things like this is just a a cartoon there.

105
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:29,910
This was early in the pandemic about working remotely with kids when we think about responsibilities and function here.

106
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,070
This one is just like, you know, like a lady working from home, as we've talked about before.

107
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:43,710
We know that there have been significant disparities between men and women in traditional caretaking roles, even when they're working from home.

108
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:53,249
So now the tricky world that we've found ourselves in is with so many people doing remote

109
00:11:53,250 --> 00:12:02,130
work and still getting psychosocial stressors that lead to musculoskeletal disorders.

110
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:08,730
It's hard to get that treated or like find accountability because it didn't necessarily happen in the work space.

111
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:17,660
It happened in your house. So what are the like employee protections or regulations that fall into place when you're at your home?

112
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,470
Home. So that gets complicated.

113
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:31,560
Now, Sheryl talked before about, you know, genetic factors that make you more susceptible to MSD, as well as physical factors as well.

114
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:42,479
But also, you know, psychosocial work influences can directly influences biomechanical load through your changes in posture,

115
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:49,230
movement and exerted forces. So just think about like, I mean, I generally always have a really bad posture.

116
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,190
I'm like a natural slouch or yeah,

117
00:12:54,030 --> 00:13:01,499
I would have not like I think they still have those like prep manor schools or whatever where you like go on the air like in Princess

118
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,770
Diaries when they like tired her and maybe I'm dating myself like tie her back with a scarf to the chair so she should sit up straight.

119
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:13,860
But think about like when you're, like, really sad or stressed or like dejected, right?

120
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:21,239
Are you sitting up tall in your chair or are you, like slumped over in your bathrobe with, like, bed?

121
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:30,209
And Jerry's right. But also, like the rate at which you move depending on what kind of stress you're experiencing, you know,

122
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:38,460
depending if you're like a fight or flight, fine, freeze person, you might be moving at a more rapid pace than you normally are.

123
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:46,170
When I'm like in a stressful situation where I'm a lot of anxiety about it and I'm moving very quickly, I tend to make a lot of mistakes.

124
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:53,840
I'm very clumsy. Or if you're just like super stressed and you have a lot of other things going on in your mind,

125
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,630
your, your movements might change in terms of like slowing down as well.

126
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:04,229
And these factors in particular, like I said, they trigger physiologic mechanisms.

127
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,980
So increases, creates muscle tension. You tense up.

128
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,990
There's more, more hormonal secretion, particularly of cortisol in particular.

129
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:21,720
And it changes the intensification of symptoms so it can change how pain is perceived in particular.

130
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:30,540
So when you're you have more stress, you have greater cortisol, less dopamine,

131
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:36,780
less serotonin, less oxytocin, these kinds of things less yeah, I said dopamine.

132
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:42,420
So in terms of pain perception and numbing in your body, generally,

133
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,460
like when they talk about thing like people getting, how many of you have ever gotten a runner's high before?

134
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,970
You have like I have, yeah. I run a lot.

135
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:58,589
What does it feel like? Like a good cup of coffee I had described, but it's just, like, really energetic.

136
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:03,239
It's just, you know, you're able to kind of go off and, you know, it's no worries.

137
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,110
So it is really it's like just a good, I think a good cup of coffee.

138
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,460
That's how I describe it. Have you ever gotten a run okay?

139
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,200
Yeah, I think so. I always feel like I'm flying.

140
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:20,780
Yeah. Oh, very low pressure.

141
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,099
I've never gotten to that point.

142
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:29,370
I've got to the point where I'm like tired and I feel like my lungs are burning and I'm like, Let me just lie down on the grass.

143
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:36,090
I usually stop. Yeah, but the reason for that runner's high is because, you know, with.

144
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:44,630
Hormones being secreted a lot is dopamine and, you know, endorphins that naturally serve as a analgesic.

145
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:51,140
It has you know, the body's amazing. You can have natural like pain relieving properties.

146
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,759
Right. So even like things people do to make them feel good.

147
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,720
I mean, drugs, obviously. Yeah. Right now, you know?

148
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:06,740
Yeah. Or like even like online shopping, like people do that just for like the short, like dopamine hit.

149
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:12,230
So people who have trained themselves to kind of have this like practice and exercise,

150
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:21,440
they can naturally like get into these situations where they secrete more of these analgesic hormones.

151
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:31,910
So when people are stressed in particular or they're anxious or depressed, they're actually producing less of those pain healing kind of hormones.

152
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:36,260
And so the perception of pain may actually be greater.

153
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:40,430
So if you think about like I'm sure at one point or another you've seen or you've done it yourself,

154
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:47,239
there's like that happy face scale that they give you at the doctor's office that's like like a like omigod,

155
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,100
I'm like, dying, and I'm in so much pain and like, ten is like, I'm so happy in a circle.

156
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:58,190
Which one you are? You know, just say we use like a force machine, right?

157
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:02,210
And we apply the same amount of force on, like your hand.

158
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,930
Like my hand in your hand, like the same amount of Newtons pressure, and you have your runner's high.

159
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,250
So you're like. And, you know, other factors that contribute might be like, this is nothing.

160
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,829
And then for me, I might be like, Oh, my God, this is like the worst pain I've ever felt in my life.

161
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:24,889
And this is just like one thing to just add to the day, you know, so it can change how your pain is perceived.

162
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:33,469
But when you perceive your pain to be higher, that also makes you more prone to musculoskeletal disorders.

163
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,160
It's kind of like a a self-fulfilling prophecy in a way.

164
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:46,070
And then psychosocial factors also change your ability to cope with illness, and it can influence reporting of musculoskeletal symptoms.

165
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:57,230
So as we talked about in previous weeks, about like those studies of folks returning to work after they've been on worker's compensation for a while,

166
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:04,670
they're like a lot of your inherent confidence and ability to rehabilitate yourself,

167
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,680
and that fear of getting reinjured can hinder you again from, you know, recovering from that illness.

168
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:19,969
So folks who experience exacerbated psychosocial factors like job dissatisfaction,

169
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:24,200
for example, or they might have a lot of presenteeism where they come to work,

170
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:31,069
but they're like not engaged, they're not like mentally, they're it can change their ability to cope with illness.

171
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:39,920
You might be sick longer and you might experience like higher levels of dis tolerance for musculoskeletal symptoms.

172
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:45,080
And then of course, this is all still confounded by physical factors in the workplace.

173
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,030
So this is by bloggers and this is, you know, a little old. It's from 1993.

174
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:58,910
But he tried to put a framework here that shows the possible association of psychosocial factors at work with stress and musculoskeletal symptoms.

175
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:08,030
So first, obviously, you had, you know, the psychosocial factors at work that influenced potentially your mechanical load.

176
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:17,150
But then you have stress symptoms which can either increase muscle tone or affect another muscle, another mechanism.

177
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:25,370
And then you might have some physical and behavioral health indicators that lead to essentially back troubles, neck troubles, shoulder troubles,

178
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:34,250
and then eventually, like down the line that can lead to chronic symptoms, sick leave, disability and then medical consumption,

179
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:44,180
meaning like use of medical medical resources here in an interesting this was an

180
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:49,219
epidemiologic evidence for that relationship between psychosocial factors and personal

181
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:56,900
characteristics where the the plus sign is a positive evidence of association negative

182
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:03,290
equals association is absent and then plus or minus equals conflicting data.

183
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:12,200
And then question mark is too little information. So if we look at BP as back pain and PSP as neck and shoulder pain,

184
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:21,230
NPY is just generally musculoskeletal symptoms and then that and then no specified location.

185
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:26,720
So if we take a look here at something like monotonous work, right?

186
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,879
So think about something super monotonous like Cheryl showed you in the video,

187
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,600
like the person who inspects park the spark plugs all day and then like.

188
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,910
Puts them in the box. That's considered, I would say, a pretty monotonous job.

189
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,699
And as epidemiological study, they found it associated across the board with back pain,

190
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:51,130
neck and shoulder pain, general musculoskeletal pain and then total pain in particular.

191
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,720
If we look at something like a knee.

192
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:02,820
Because my astigmatism and nystagmus in my eyes, I don't want to focus.

193
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:14,009
Okay, so if we look at something like poor work content, it is positively associated with back pain and also neck and shoulder pain,

194
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:18,390
but unsure what the general musculoskeletal symptoms are.

195
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:24,959
If we look at something like poor social support by colleagues,

196
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:34,090
it has found to have a association present with back pain and then general musculoskeletal pain.

197
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,430
Demand and support variables also neck and shoulder pain.

198
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:44,339
Back pain, total musculoskeletal pain. So that's kind of interesting there.

199
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:50,700
And if we get into individual characteristics now interestingly neuroticism,

200
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:56,580
there's conflicting data and question about too little information across the board.

201
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,960
But if we look at type A behavior, what is Type A behavior?

202
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:10,870
Like me first. Always like, selfish or just, uh.

203
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:17,960
I think that's a narcissist. That's the type A is very much like.

204
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:23,069
I have to do lists. You know, things are very organized.

205
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:31,580
Things are orderly. They are like, I have a schedule, whereas type B is very like laissez faire, like what are the vibes today?

206
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:42,750
Whatever happens, happens. So Type A behavior has been found to be positive evidence for association with back pain,

207
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:47,790
neck pain, shoulder pain, and then musculoskeletal pain in general and total body.

208
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,009
And I was like, I get this because I would say I'm definitely a Type A person and I feel like my

209
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:58,680
shoulders or is like scrunched up to my face because I don't know how to relax.

210
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:06,000
Interestingly, an extroverted personality has not enough information for any of these.

211
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:13,620
And then if we look at depression, interestingly, it doesn't not enough information as well.

212
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:18,000
And that if we look at attitudes towards your own health,

213
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:27,510
there is a positive association between what is your attitude towards your own health and your total musculoskeletal symptoms.

214
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:34,950
And then definitely worry, tension, anxiousness and nervousness, physical stress symptoms.

215
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:43,229
And then if we're getting into the physical and behavioral indicators at the bottom, for the most part,

216
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:51,930
poor physical health, coughs, stomach trouble, all that is found to be associated to back pain and then the total category.

217
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:58,230
But in terms of neck pain, shoulder pain and other musculoskeletal symptoms, there still isn't enough evidence.

218
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:11,280
And this was from 1993. And interestingly, you know, study since then because it's been like 20 years, 30 years, oh my gosh, 30 years.

219
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:21,600
They've looked at various facets of this, but none have ever tried to more or less like replicate this kind of useful table again,

220
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:28,049
where it's kind of like a meta analysis because they looked at multiple studies.

221
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:35,220
But I suspect now that if they try to go back and fill in the rest of the table or update the table, there would be more information.

222
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:44,050
So this was all you know. So what can we actually do about it? First is assessment.

223
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:49,860
Like, you know, Cheryl talked about there could either be like a physical assessment or you can do a survey.

224
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:55,389
So one tool people like to use and I don't recall if any, I'll use this on your scales,

225
00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:04,570
but it's the occupational stress inventory or the OCI, and it's specifically trying to link work related stress to physiological strain.

226
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:13,060
And they look at three dimensions, including occupational stress, psychologic strain, and then coping resources.

227
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:19,830
And if we wanted to implement an intervention, we could potentially do so at three levels.

228
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:24,950
So you can either prevention that aims to reduce work constraints.

229
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:29,800
So what can we change in the physical work environment or from the administrative standpoint,

230
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,910
prevention that aims to deal with an individual's ability to cope with stress and change?

231
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:41,679
This is, again, more of like a secondary tertiary employee assistance program kind of thing.

232
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:47,259
Resiliency. The last is rehabilitation.

233
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:52,420
And at this point, it may just be physical therapy. Okay.

234
00:25:54,550 --> 00:26:01,420
So Lavoy and Tremblay have a five step program for intervention and the workplace in particular.

235
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:10,380
First, you have to get the organization to commit, because if the worker wants to improve a specific thing, it's not going to happen.

236
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:13,630
If they're doing it in isolation, that's absolutely not going to work.

237
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:21,850
We're going to identify what the job constraint forms are, develop action plans, implement the action plans, and then evaluate.

238
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,210
So we'll talk more about evaluation after Thanksgiving break.

239
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:41,990
Before I move on to human factors, do y'all have any questions or comments regarding the lung cancer diagnosis and diagnosis?

240
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:46,750
How many of you have worked a very physically laborious job before?

241
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,680
I would fill in sometimes when I went to the grocery store if they needed like help,

242
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:58,379
when they got rid of overnight workers and then they put me in time and a half or so, I would, of course jump on it.

243
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,460
But I'm not super, super.

244
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:06,480
But I mean, there was constant body movement and lifting. So like stocking shelves and whatnot.

245
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,770
Yeah. Did you ever get injured or you're still so young, right?

246
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:14,910
Yeah. So I'm kind of sore, but that's because I don't work out much.

247
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:21,180
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Starbucks now kind of at a different restaurant.

248
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:26,040
I did like stocks, but otherwise, just like standing for a long time.

249
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:35,820
Yeah. Yeah. I would say in recent years, I haven't had a physically laborious job since.

250
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:43,960
Probably college. And after you're 25, your body's just like.

251
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:52,110
You just wait. If you haven't hit it yet, you'll just wake up one day and you'll be like, Oh, yes, I am.

252
00:27:53,940 --> 00:28:01,950
But definitely like now more susceptible to injury, like snow shoveling, which I absolutely hate.

253
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:10,020
I don't like it here between November March because I know more or less once a week, maybe even multiple times a day, I'll be outside.

254
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:17,520
I do snow blow, but because I am type A, it's not good enough to just blow the snow.

255
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:26,360
I need to see the sidewalk. So I have to as I go back again and clear like the entire entire thing out.

256
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:34,900
But I have to be very mindful all the time of how I'm lifting because one wrong move and I could be seemingly paralyzed.

257
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:41,459
I know I have degenerative discs because when I had an MRI at 23, they were like, wow, I have really degenerate this for someone who's 23.

258
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:48,840
And I was like, Oh, that's good. But you never know unless you actually like get an MRI or a CT scan.

259
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,080
So there would be no way of knowing unless you hurt your lower back a lot.

260
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:57,389
But a lot of my friends who are in their late later twenties or early thirties as well have been like, Yeah,

261
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:05,760
I was putting a fitted sheet on my bed and I threw out my back or like I was picking up a sock, I coughed too hard.

262
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:10,620
So just a things you can anticipate.

263
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:14,309
But again, if you're more stress, you're more susceptible to these kinds of things.

264
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:19,800
So like working full time while being in a doctoral program probably like didn't help the situation.

265
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:25,290
So next is human factors, ergonomics and human factors.

266
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:33,809
So what is it? This is essentially a systems discipline where it's essentially related to ergonomics,

267
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:43,470
where they take a top down life cycle approach at trying to essentially make products or items or like the things that we use.

268
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:53,750
And I will say that engineers in particular, like Sheryl, have a very different perspective on the world where I,

269
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:57,030
I think I've said this before, like here in public health,

270
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:04,310
we focus so much on interventions at the either individual or community or population level,

271
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,400
trying to get people to change their behaviors or whatever.

272
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:15,779
Whereas when I had a chance recently last year to work on a grant with engineers from MTSU who do like

273
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:21,720
specifically artificial intelligence and like smart building modeling and all that kind of stuff,

274
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:28,950
their approach is that we can't trust people to do anything right like the people are.

275
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:34,050
They're more or less what they're implicitly telling me was like, We can't trust people because they're too dumb.

276
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:40,240
We can't trust humans. So if something did not work the way it was intended to,

277
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:47,760
it's because it was built wrong or it was engineered wrong because if something is engineered right,

278
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:56,190
you don't need to put a lot of thought into how the user may be negatively affected by it, if that makes sense.

279
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,260
So that's essentially what the human factors is.

280
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:07,170
I will play this YouTube clip. This is more applicable to a health care setting.

281
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:19,380
How fast does he talk? Let's see. So it was all human factors.

282
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:23,800
Okay. What if I did it 1.25?

283
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:29,109
This would be too fast, huh? Maybe we're too fast.

284
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:33,969
Maybe too fast. Okay. I'll do. I'll do one. So this is how I live my life.

285
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:38,540
I also listen to podcasts. I don't. Yeah, time is money.

286
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:44,260
Okay. So. Okay. Here to buy store will provide you even.

287
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:48,160
That is why I'm relevant. Okay. I'm the thing.

288
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,540
I don't know if it does something wrong because that is only, for example,

289
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,970
how do you ever walk into the law from the English Law Center at the airport?

290
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:04,850
What about this is one of the laws in the wrong medication rather than the right medication design based on

291
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:12,880
because these are just a few samples of the huge size and he is doing this and this video seeks to define this.

292
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,950
You even have to let us describe their role in healthcare.

293
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:22,870
I hope people in the end will appreciate their input and more performance as an individual, as a team,

294
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:31,780
and as a system that will provide an understanding of what affects performance and behavior in the workplace.

295
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,780
It allows us to better understand how we work musically and how we live on our work environment.

296
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:42,150
The systems that maximize patient care, safety as well.

297
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:47,040
Being human beings are fantastic. Our brains are incredibly emotional.

298
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:53,320
Since combat situations are multi-faceted, we're constantly telling people in one task to idea,

299
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,729
to do an action to another, and even understand why you second.

300
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:07,030
At the end of the shift, many minds work a little tasks, but of course that also means someone needs something or we drop it.

301
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:13,660
What about when you read as well? We understand that our problems can be impaired and when we have patients,

302
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:20,050
we may need it to support their everyday decisions and tasks, but we will know we need to take that on.

303
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,090
And what about the world around us?

304
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:28,959
How to write to us, understanding our strengths and weaknesses as humans and how we receive the process information.

305
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,590
And I was just about to design equipment. Whose software?

306
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:36,910
A physical environment for us patients, for example.

307
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,159
Only we already make satiation meaning over the next year that we have made.

308
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,280
It allows us to quit because we like to eat it.

309
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:50,920
You can read this obviously easy, but what about these?

310
00:33:52,150 --> 00:34:05,050
How about the medication? I mean, is a great example of the impact on how to suppress the risk of being exposed to most here, if you use it,

311
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:12,400
is our understanding how you are affected by the tools of army working on the culture of teams and organization.

312
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:17,530
I mean, you make the situation right, so you know how this works.

313
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:24,310
On how complex healthcare is, how one part of healthcare change is an easy task.

314
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:32,250
We're going to look at three main components of impact just as individuals themes and then system.

315
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:40,720
Let's start with you. As human beings, we have meditations on when we reach our limits.

316
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:44,080
We had problems with far more light music.

317
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,190
More than 100.

318
00:34:49,560 --> 00:35:02,020
A great way to think about this is you have three buckets and the further north it's with of the more likely you are one of you about yourself.

319
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:12,460
His pocket fills up for depending on your expertise, how much sleep, what, how much money go into the context of it.

320
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:20,740
This goes up depending on the situation that we're working in, how to support people or critical using it, how the environment is designed.

321
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:28,240
I know you have little task for this relates to the task of doing tasks like this filled up

322
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,390
with padding all the time because you're playing how complex is how likely there is that,

323
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:40,840
how many steps to take and how you even think the only way to measure how full.

324
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,710
So all test involves buckets, the flow.

325
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,190
Now the more likely you are to one will not solve the problem.

326
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:55,900
This is the point where you should help as well, making them recognize limitations.

327
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:02,499
Know more about what makes an excellent and effective to the good seems clear.

328
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:11,580
Leadership is where the situation looks off and Steven is claiming leadership means making sure that

329
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,590
you're working towards a common goal of making sure that you focus as a huge example briefings,

330
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:23,800
huddles and debriefings. Okay, I'll stop there because the rest is mostly related to health care.

331
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:35,740
Thinking about something that you interact with, like on a daily basis, what do you think is designed to be very human factors friendly?

332
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:41,300
Your phone. You know, everything's like within your thumb reach.

333
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:45,440
So me, I have a bigger hand, so it's easier to think.

334
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,929
But it's so like where I am is really naturally hand.

335
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:57,270
Where it's my thumb is always so. I think.

336
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:07,639
I mean, I, I, I wasn't an iPad kid growing up, but I think iPads are very intuitive in terms of how they've decided.

337
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:12,080
I see people who are quite elderly using iPads.

338
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:22,280
I think now that my mom has a smartphone, it's easier for her to understand how to use it than when she had like the traditional,

339
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,959
like a flip phone or one with the buttons in particular thinking about something we use.

340
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,930
What do you what what have you encountered that you feel like isn't like the most humans?

341
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:46,510
User friendly. Self-Checkout machines.

342
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:57,070
Oh, that's a good one. I was actually yelling at one on Sunday and Kroger because, you know, it's always I don't know who makes these.

343
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:03,880
I feel like it's it's obviously more cost efficient than when we used to have cashiers.

344
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:09,610
Right. Because you have one person just watching over like six stations.

345
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:13,419
But like, how are we in the year 2022?

346
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:18,909
And I'm still getting yelled at for an unidentified object in the bagging area and

347
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:23,080
then they won't let you scan and then you have to wait and call the attendant.

348
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:28,510
And I just think that those things are very prone to human error.

349
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:35,020
And then when I was at Kroger, because I'm hosting a Friendsgiving this weekend, you know, if you buy something without a barcode,

350
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:44,140
you say like produce, for example, I put navel oranges on there and they asked me, are these small, medium or large navel oranges?

351
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,550
And I'm just like, I don't remember what the sign said.

352
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:53,260
They don't look large to me. So I'm just going to say medium, right?

353
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:58,420
But like these what had that many issues really?

354
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:04,540
I mean, I have like a couple issues, but normally it's like, I don't know, like I did myself like a little bit,

355
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:10,450
but I like did Target or do you use it at Kroger to, you know, my round Kroger the other day.

356
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,740
Oh, I bought one time out of Kroger, I forgot to hit the payment card button,

357
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:22,420
but I had my card in and I was just standing there for like 5 minutes and then the attendant was like, You got to hit pay with card.

358
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:28,630
Okay? I was like, That's super embarrassing. It happens in it happens.

359
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:35,280
I had to organize cause they always had the most expensive item for produce, for like organic or like specialty, whatever.

360
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:41,020
Know they're always first and like the one you use that might have last so that people just click like the first one thing.

361
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,620
That's right. It's usually the organic one. So they cost more. Yeah.

362
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,750
They, I mean they do that on purpose. Oh yeah. Absolutely.

363
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:52,059
The same thing with grocery stores like the main brand expensive items are within your eyeline,

364
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,120
whereas the generic ones are usually at the top or the bottom.

365
00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:00,220
I always have issues with self-checkout. They have self-checkout now at Costco.

366
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:08,470
I wait, I, I don't I don't want a deal. I wait in line just because I feel like there's so much error that can be introduced.

367
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:12,250
And so there's two ways human error can be viewed.

368
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:15,610
And this is according to Reason 2000.

369
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:19,270
This person's last name is Reason. Just to clear that up.

370
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:24,130
Yeah. What's a name to me in academia is. Do you think it's a good name.

371
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:30,100
I think is interesting. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You have say according to reason.

372
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:34,750
Yeah. And they're like people are like reasons and there's like no reason.

373
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:43,899
Reason, theories. So there is a personal approach where they believe human errors due to you cognitive processes,

374
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,620
forgetfulness, poor motivation, carelessness, negligence.

375
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:53,230
Or there's that engineer way the systems approach where errors are seen as consequences.

376
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:57,880
Sorry that you say rather than causes and these are due to upstream factors.

377
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:07,839
And so essentially they have this as a Swiss cheese model of accidents where if you look at things that are like active failures,

378
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,730
right, there's reasons for that, but it doesn't provide the whole picture.

379
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:16,990
And then same with like latent or underlying conditions, like a Swiss cheese,

380
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,920
you know, we have our reasons for that, but that doesn't provide the whole picture.

381
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:26,049
So when you stack your Swiss cheese models together looking at active failures and latent conditions,

382
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:30,040
that's generally when you can get a better view of human error.

383
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:36,670
But according to some safety models and theories that we look at in occupational health and safety,

384
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:47,410
they believe that over 80% of accidents in the workplace is attributed to the way the work is organized, not actually the worker themselves.

385
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:57,700
And the more organization is reliable, the more it is resilient to human error.

386
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,300
So if you think about something like a. Like a.

387
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:13,910
Like a small mom and pop shop, for example, where they might only be staffed by like a handful of people.

388
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:22,740
One person does a very specific thing. If another person, if they were out that day, there's kind of nobody to really cover their role, right?

389
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:29,670
So if something happens, they may not be as resilient in being able to maintain function that day.

390
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:35,340
Whereas if it's like Amazon, right, I wouldn't call them a good organization.

391
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:39,750
But in terms of high reliability, they have a lot of processes in place.

392
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:47,310
So if something happens to a worker and they get injured, there's just another worker in this place or now a robot actually.

393
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,670
So with that, that's the end of that conversation.

394
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:57,740
But does anyone have any questions or comments before we move on?

395
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:05,240
Okay. I don't like those screenshots, but it's like, on my face.

396
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:11,030
All right, so we're taking part of Tuesday's lecture.

397
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:15,799
What a bit of been Tuesday's lecture and cramming it into today which I have time and

398
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:21,770
that is train the trainer models and successful facets of adult education approaches.

399
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:28,670
How many of you heard of Triple T before? I heard it in conversation, but I can tell you about it.

400
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,940
Okay. I haven't really called up that I've heard of like.

401
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:37,950
Oh. No. Never mind. Are you thinking of just in time training?

402
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,540
No, I was thinking of, like, the evaluation class.

403
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:46,500
Like when you're doing evaluation training all year. Yeah, that's what I was thinking of.

404
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:51,120
Not this. Oh, I mean, it's probably a very similar principle.

405
00:43:51,930 --> 00:44:03,240
Train the trainer is used primarily in the context of, like, occupational safety and health, emergency preparedness, first responder organizations.

406
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:07,800
So this is where you have the ability to train and structure.

407
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:14,250
Instructors are subject matter experts so they can train other people in their workplace or organization.

408
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:20,250
So this is a focused training in particular that not only teaches you the content of the training,

409
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:24,660
but how to actually deliver that training to other people.

410
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:29,580
And it's generally somebody in-house to teach people.

411
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:35,849
And this was first applied by nonprofits and non-governmental organizations for

412
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:39,780
their learning and development programs because it's super cost effective.

413
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:43,860
Generally, when you bring in like a trainer from an external company.

414
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:54,090
Very expensive. Now, why I talk about this is since 2016, I've been part of the NIA Just Worker Training program,

415
00:44:54,390 --> 00:45:00,000
which is a training program for workers across this country that is free to organizations.

416
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:05,790
And it's sponsored by the federal government, a.k.a. People's Tax Dollars.

417
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:14,520
So when we offer these trainings, some people are even skeptical that it's like a real thing because they're like,

418
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:19,080
why would an external entity come in and give a training at no cost?

419
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:24,510
Like, what is the quality of this, actually? So it's a lot of like word of mouth referral.

420
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:30,570
But generally, what will happen in a train a train trainer model is somebody who's a subject matter expert.

421
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:37,140
I would like potentially I come in, maybe the training is on respiratory protection.

422
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:41,910
I meet with the supervisors of an organization.

423
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:49,980
I deliver the training to them and then they them and then I teach them how to deliver the training.

424
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:57,389
And then they themselves have to go through and one by one try to deliver the

425
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:02,190
training and then they get evaluated on it and get feedback on how to improve it.

426
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:11,880
Until the subject matter expert or what we call like the master trainer essentially certifies that they're ready to deliver this training.

427
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:20,100
So I've been to a trainer, train the trainer before on emotional resiliency among volunteers.

428
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:26,610
Just because people get a lot of like primary and secondary trauma when they respond to hurricanes and events,

429
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:29,520
and then we had to like deliver the training back.

430
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:38,669
So, you know, like if we use this model, what do you think are the benefits of it besides being cost effective,

431
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:43,200
which I just said, I think people listen more and if it's like something like a peer,

432
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:50,159
there is being trained to do the training later on, like they will respect that person more to be, you know, hopefully do what they say.

433
00:46:50,160 --> 00:47:02,450
But. Their thoughts and benefits and also institutional knowledge.

434
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:09,560
I guess I'm thinking like that. I like teaching someone in the organization with that knowledge.

435
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,249
Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Yeah. So someone like on the ground.

436
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:18,920
So like, you know, always at the engineering and then like how it's actually put in place in practice.

437
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:22,489
Like they're not always on line. So maybe this person has that work experience.

438
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:27,559
So like, well, this actually this is great, but this will never be a work here.

439
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,780
So let's try to find a solution that would be able to work here. So. Yeah.

440
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,740
Yeah, I think that's. Yeah.

441
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,340
These are all great. Basically, I think you hit them on the nail.

442
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:47,470
So basically it is more cost effective to have an internal trainer curriculum and the delivery of training has consistency.

443
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:49,390
With a caveat, though,

444
00:47:50,320 --> 00:48:01,570
assuming that the person doesn't dilute the information over time or change the content of the training a lot because it can kind of be like

445
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:10,450
the telephone game a little bit where this is an issue that we have with our nail salon workers where like if there's a new technique,

446
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:19,300
like a new dipping powder or gel or cure for nails, the owner will go to the supplier and the supplier will show the owner how to do it,

447
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:24,310
and the owner will go back and then teach the workers at their salon how to do it.

448
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:31,330
But in between that time, like, a lot of information gets not transmitted about like what are the hazards?

449
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:37,210
How do the workers protect themselves? And it's like flammable precautions are like things that they should know.

450
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,800
So generally, you know, before you release someone who is a trainer, trainer,

451
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:48,610
train the trainer to like go out into their organization, have to realize that there is it's going to stay consistent.

452
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:52,600
And when it is consistent, it's really good. Assuming it's the same person.

453
00:48:53,290 --> 00:49:02,169
There is more trust and acceptance of internal trainers like yours that like sometimes they bring me in as like the outside person,

454
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:08,530
but only in a once in a while. So Ypsilanti community utility authorities for example,

455
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:19,450
that treats all the water in Ypsi I work with they're on staff trainer and he's like super cool and cares a lot about

456
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:27,520
safety but he says they they get tired of him after a while because it's always like him harping on these kinds of things.

457
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:32,380
He does a good job at not playing the safety cop because nobody likes a safety cop.

458
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:38,530
But in particular, I was brought in to talk about COVID and vaccines as a subject matter expert,

459
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:44,740
and he felt that that information would have more weight coming from me than from him.

460
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,999
But generally, like because they have more acceptance.

461
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:58,300
So like we've been asked before as a consortium to look at organizations like standard operating procedures and like how they run things.

462
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,639
And we can make recommendations all day.

463
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:07,390
But like realistically, only the people who are working there know whether or not it's going to be successfully implemented.

464
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:11,590
Information is also distributed a lot quicker through the train, the trainer model,

465
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:18,730
and then learning is customized again because they know what the culture is, the environment is, and they can provide specific examples.

466
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:25,600
Like when I do a training for a place, I try to use photos and examples related to that specific industry.

467
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:32,800
Like very wise. I asked ahead of time, like, Can you send me some pictures of your workers for me to put in the PowerPoint?

468
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:39,010
Because nobody wants to know who works at a utilities company, wants to do a training and then like see stock photos of like nurses, right?

469
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:42,010
That's like does it feel very applicable to that?

470
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:48,250
And then through this model, you're also building a competent internal training team.

471
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:55,390
There's also, as evidence shows, better follow up of outcomes and then long term changes.

472
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:05,320
So it is proven to be effective, but mostly cost effective because you're leveraging existing social capital and resources and it

473
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:11,710
also builds community and then empowers employees and then fosters a sense of self-reliance.

474
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:19,870
But there's downsides, like I mentioned, like diluted information or potentially misinformation being perpetuated.

475
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:28,150
And then how well are trainers sticking to the curriculum and appropriate training protocols?

476
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:37,940
So this makes me think of. I spent probably more time on tick tock than one would like to admit,

477
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:44,200
but I am childless and penniless for the most part, so I guess that's what I'm using my free time on.

478
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:52,940
But I don't know if y'all saw this, like, video trend where it's kind of like the premise as somebody who's onboarding someone and they're like,

479
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:57,170
Now, this is how you're supposed to do it, but this is how I do it.

480
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:01,730
You know what I'm talking about, Sam? The rest of you, maybe you have no idea what I'm supposed to what I'm talking about.

481
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:08,690
But how many of you have been, like, onboarded by another employee that was not the manager of the past?

482
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:15,500
Okay. How'd that go? It was a lot of, like, this is what we're supposed to do.

483
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,190
Yes. Not do that. Okay. Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

484
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,840
So like what, for example, can you think of your very first job?

485
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:32,960
Is that these and you're supposed to throw out the fries every 15 minutes and like, if you summarize what you're supposed to dump on and do new batch,

486
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:39,410
and they're like, we only do that like earlier in the day, like, don't do it a lot of night.

487
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:44,510
And people just get old guys, but sometimes they get mad at you for like stuff like that or like Starbucks.

488
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:51,730
You're supposed to, like, brew a fresh batch of coffee, like every 15 minutes or something like that.

489
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:56,110
And it's like hit or miss if people do that. Okay, Sam?

490
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:05,230
Yeah. I was the one usually doing the trainings. Yeah, I would be the one around when I was in the in shop online shopper for our grocery store.

491
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,030
I think a little people I pick,

492
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:13,600
I'd train them and they will have pick out produce and stuff is always you had to put your cart in a very specific place

493
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:21,429
and like be considered a customer then like how busy we are and how many people are using the store just go like this.

494
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:25,479
It's I'm sorry, this like you need to get there as fast as possible and go through it.

495
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:31,870
So. Chucking tomatoes into the pickup was that was a terrible job but enjoy it.

496
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:35,310
But, um, yeah, that. And then, um, you know,

497
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:42,459
lifting techniques and stuff and just like how much stuff you can have on your cards when you have these cards and that tons of water,

498
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:48,790
dog food or whatnot. So it's just like you're not supposed to have or and, but the system always gives you the maximum out.

499
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,350
So it's just like try to make it fit, you know, if you can. Yeah.

500
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:57,790
Yeah. So that's kind of like, I mean, obviously, like if I was a trainer from the outside, like I would be like, no.

501
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:03,640
Right. But we know realistically those things don't happen. Was at this Super H-E-B by Kyle Field.

502
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:09,050
Um, no, that's a brand new one. I worked at the one at Southern University.

503
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:12,460
Oh yeah. Yeah. Is it do you still eat at Wendy's?

504
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:16,750
Well, they don't have a lot for me to eat. Oh. Oh.

505
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:22,360
Is it true that they take the old burger patties and make it into the chili academy?

506
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:26,950
The chili? But are you Wendy's fan?

507
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,160
No, I like burger patties. They're on the grill forever.

508
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:34,090
Like they just make a bunch of them, like, wait for people to order burgers.

509
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,239
Oh, yeah. And like what? They're fresh, but are they actually fresh or not?

510
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,450
Were frozen. They're not frozen. Okay.

511
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:43,510
Well, like, they're not like freshly cooked or. I mean, that's bad.

512
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:48,670
Yeah, they're warm. They're warm. I only go for the nuggets.

513
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:56,770
It's fine. But I was, you know, because sometimes when you work at a place, you know, you see how the sausage is made, so to speak.

514
00:54:56,770 --> 00:55:00,339
Like the smell of one is I was like 17, like it was my first job.

515
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:04,479
I went to work there for like two months. Like, the smell of Wendy's, like, gives me anxiety.

516
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,750
Trauma. Yeah. Okay. Olfactory trauma.

517
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:11,440
What about Starbucks? Starbucks is different.

518
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:21,670
Okay, that wasn't as stressful. I worked there, like, for part of I'm just like, you know, when I went through life, I was like, whatever, you know?

519
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:26,410
Oh, I would imagine Starbucks would be more stressful than Wendy's, but. I don't know.

520
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:34,970
I it was. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I've only worked at a dining hall is, I think, service.

521
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:39,770
I did not enjoy that. So who do you pick as a train?

522
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:44,200
A trainer, someone who's well-respected or a role model in the workplace?

523
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:50,200
You'd have to. You'd only figure this out by talking to a supervisor or serving other employees.

524
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:54,370
Someone with good communication skills open to constructive feedback.

525
00:55:54,380 --> 00:56:02,590
This one is challenging, especially if you're thinking about what the culture of a workplace is like if you work at an auto manufacturing plant.

526
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:07,030
Are particularly good trades in like construction, for example,

527
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:12,580
where there is honestly like a lot of toxic masculinity or like that machismo kind

528
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:18,590
of attitude where a lot of people get very cagey any time you give them feedback.

529
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:28,030
They have to have some experience and expertise. They also have to be flexible and they also have to be available to me dating myself with this.

530
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:35,259
I heard Ash Ketchum finally won the championship this like a few days ago.

531
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:40,270
Like when they finally, like, let him have it after, like, 20 years as an aside.

532
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:47,709
Okay, so common scenarios where train the trainer is used for this is most more commonly used in public health and other fields,

533
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:53,470
which is interesting to me all having encountered this yet, but it's mostly used in volunteer training and deployment.

534
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:57,729
Disaster. Emergency preparedness. Hazardous waste. Hazardous materials.

535
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:02,020
Nonprofits and NGOs. Large manufacturing organizations.

536
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:08,350
And then organizations within the workplaces with that's not enough big not enough budget to bring in external trainers.

537
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:12,580
So generally, how where does the budget come from? External trainers.

538
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:22,870
Most organizations allocate a certain portion of their budget to like a safety community or safety activities, and it comes out of that.

539
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:29,230
But generally, like public health, it's very counterproductive in that when things are going well,

540
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:37,960
they pull the funding back rather than like maintaining that level of funding or giving more funding for maintenance and preventative activities.

541
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:44,709
So generally it wasn't until COVID where we saw the shrinkage of safety committees and

542
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:50,290
safety budgets that safety personnel and like industrial hygiene have to work with.

543
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:56,230
And then once COVID happened, they recognized the importance of workplace safety again and try to bolster some of this.

544
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:09,940
Now, moving on to adult education, I have trained across the country nearly 3000 workers from all walks of life.

545
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:21,729
There's not a lot people can say to me that hurts my feelings because nobody's tougher than a crowd of utilities workers

546
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:29,500
who've been working all night and then have to come in and listen to me for an hour at 8 a.m. I've had people fall asleep.

547
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:37,030
I've had I did a bulk of my trainings in the Midwest talking about scientific things.

548
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:47,859
So I had a woman who told me she didn't understand my accent, you know, like so microaggressions and things like that.

549
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:51,040
So they're very different. They're very different.

550
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:57,160
And having taught both children and adults where I worked at a math learning center,

551
00:58:57,970 --> 00:59:08,080
a K through 12 for like a year and a half and teaching adults, adults are significantly more difficult, I would say.

552
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:12,280
How many of you all have taught or trained adults before?

553
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,910
Yeah. I think my last so did there's a few adults I came at at H-E-B.

554
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:24,100
I mean there may come a time in your career where you may have to.

555
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:31,350
So for the most part. When I worked with kids, it wasn't the kids that were bad.

556
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:35,800
Sometimes they were bad, but they were manageable. You just have to assert your dominance.

557
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:41,920
It was the parents that were very challenging. So children and adults for the most part.

558
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:47,409
The adults are largely self-directed and they per they prefer to draw on their

559
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:53,680
lifetime of experiences and they already have a very well-developed belief system.

560
00:59:53,680 --> 01:00:02,590
So they may reject new information that contradicts those beliefs, or as children are generally more like pliable, adaptable, open to new concepts.

561
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:07,810
And then adults also have various expectations about what they learn.

562
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:16,329
Because as an adult, if you think about the average adult, some people went to college, some people went to trade school.

563
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:25,780
We live in this like academia bubble where Ann Arbor is literally the most educated city in all of the United States,

564
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:30,099
where we have the most the highest prevalence of bachelors degrees.

565
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:38,200
But if you look at the data, I think it's like only one or 2% of this nation's population has a Ph.D. We're here.

566
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:42,000
If you just like throw a rock, you hit like five of them, right?

567
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:49,670
So if you think about it, most adults haven't been in a classroom in five, ten, 15, 20 years.

568
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:54,910
So sitting there even for an hour, very difficult for them.

569
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:59,740
And they want immediate goals and they have immediate needs.

570
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:05,560
So if the information you're giving them, they don't perceive them as learning immediately.

571
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:09,760
They're just going to like mentally shut down and like block you out.

572
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:13,900
And it's so important in the beginning, especially when I was doing it,

573
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:24,700
I used to co train with my mentor who was like a six feet tall and like looked like bald and he looked like a linebacker and he was like,

574
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:28,990
Oh, this hat, white male. So we would coach train sessions, right?

575
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:32,290
Where he would do some of the talking and I'd come in and do some of the talking.

576
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:41,410
But eventually, like after a while, like he would just like I would do them on my own and I looked like 22.

577
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:46,630
And so they were just like, Who the heck are you? And like, do you have any credibility?

578
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:50,230
So you have to establish essentially assert dominance upfront,

579
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:54,310
especially if you're training an older crowd and it tends to be like a more blue collar crowd,

580
01:01:54,730 --> 01:02:00,790
very important to essentially establish trust within like the first 5 minutes of you doing that training,

581
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:08,169
because if you don't have them, then they're gone. And then adults come from diverse ages, backgrounds and skills.

582
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:14,470
So I would say, you know, this is kind of just zooming in on what that other side is.

583
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:18,040
But learning in adulthood is very voluntary.

584
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,750
So how are you keeping them motivated?

585
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:27,459
If I'm there, for the most part, it's because their boss or their supervisor told them they have to be, but they are slower to learn.

586
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:31,660
So you need to have more of an applied lens to it immediately.

587
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:39,700
Like How are you going to do this? They also have higher expectations from you than students, even grad students.

588
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:54,610
They have higher expectations from you. So it's always good when you're training adult learners in particular to people don't like it,

589
01:02:55,450 --> 01:03:00,850
but you can do it to draw on their experience as an audience.

590
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:07,930
Now, this requires a fine balance because you can if you're, you know, intuitive enough,

591
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:13,569
you can clearly tell who's that, that employee that's very vocal and always negative about everything.

592
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:19,600
And like they might start saying some wild stuff and then like you can shut them down or be like, thank you so much for your comments.

593
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:24,430
Like, I'd be happy to chat more with you at the break or like we can discuss this after the training,

594
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:31,629
but people love nothing more than to talk about themselves and their own experiences.

595
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:36,970
So as you're doing the training, it's important for you to pause and essentially, like, I mean,

596
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:43,900
I do that with you all sometimes in class, but also because it's like there's so few of you, so it's like more like a seminar.

597
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:47,080
But to ask them like, hey, have you ever, you know.

598
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:52,960
So at a training I did with the Bloomington Utilities Authority, where we were talking about personal protective equipment,

599
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:59,320
I was asking them, what is your experience with using long gloves?

600
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,790
And one of the workers was like, We aren't provided long enough.

601
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:14,410
Gloves were provided only nitrile gloves, so we have to stick our hands up clogged pipes, which sometimes have needles in them.

602
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:19,840
These aren't cut proof gloves and pull it out to like unclog the clog.

603
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:23,820
And, you know, like this is information I wouldn't have known.

604
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:30,190
It's useful information for them to share with their peers, and I wouldn't have known that they weren't actually getting supplied any of the PPE.

605
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:36,970
So I feel like, you know, it's relevant to like pepper those things in or when I did the training for Indianapolis International Airport,

606
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:45,549
I started to realize that sharps accidental needle sticks were an issue on the side before

607
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:51,490
security because people who were like picking up that gas or like before they went into security,

608
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:59,949
we're using opioids then and injecting them in the restrooms right before security and then disposing of them improperly.

609
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:04,509
So through that now, like doing the trainings and talking to the folks,

610
01:05:04,510 --> 01:05:10,419
now they have sharps containers in every stall on the men and women's restrooms

611
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:14,200
before security of if you go through Indianapolis International Airport.

612
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:23,799
But it's it's really important to you to recognize what the classroom dynamics are

613
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:29,800
and then come in with the assumption that they're not going to give you any credit.

614
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,010
So you have to establish that credit very fast upfront.

615
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:39,970
How do you do that? Just like show your background or. Yeah, you know, I mean, they don't care about my degrees.

616
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,680
They care more about what my practical experience is. So I've talked to them about, you know,

617
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:53,169
like the time I did research at the Nebraska biocontainment unit when we like had the patients evacuate, you know, during Ebola.

618
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:58,209
And we came up with some of the training protocols. And I've been to like all these other places,

619
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:05,290
and I always throw a joke out there like I know I look like I'm 18, but I'm a lot older than that, right?

620
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:09,940
So that generally helps diffuse the situation upfront.

621
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:13,870
Generally with these trainings, you don't have time to do icebreakers,

622
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:22,750
so you just like introduce yourself, establish the credibility and like, yeah, yeah.

623
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:29,290
How many of you all been in a training? And it was bad.

624
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:39,340
I think it was like most people, but just all the video trainings I've done and where those are always bad.

625
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:44,240
Because they're like they seem like they're from the eighties. Yeah.

626
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:49,640
You said the graphics are okay, but it's just, you know, it's so easy to tune out.

627
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:54,270
It's just like this is in a play or. Yeah, I did this last year.

628
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:57,470
Here I am again. Doing it again. The same information. So.

629
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:07,160
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Some of them don't seem like very practical, and they seem like they're spoofs, right?

630
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:16,610
Like they're made up. I saw one on The Daily Show with Jon Oliver where they were making a training video against unionizing,

631
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:23,040
which was very funny, but it looked like a regular, regular training video or like the sexual harassment ones.

632
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:33,860
Even right now to do a training, we have to have a needs assessment so we can't like I've had organizations come to me and they're like,

633
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:37,219
Aurora, we can only give you an hour. Right?

634
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:43,970
Because anything that's not required by OSHA, people generally aren't going to ask you to spend your time on it.

635
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,620
Right. Unless they care about this topic or it's plaguing them in particular.

636
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:55,129
So a lot of organizations have asked me like, can you cover COVID, the history of vaccines,

637
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:59,540
respiratory protection and all types of different PPE in one hour.

638
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:08,060
And I was like, I can, but not well. So we need to really like narrow down what's important to you about what your goals are.

639
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:14,900
And then objectives are key. So if we think about the smart objectives, specific, measurable, achievable,

640
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:22,520
realistic, time bound, a bad objective is participants will learn how to use PPE,

641
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:33,110
not very smart, or by the end of the training session, participants will be able to correctly don and kn95 respirator within one minute.

642
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:40,820
That is a more clear objective and achievable at the end of the training session,

643
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:49,430
because if people see that your objectives don't match up with what you actually did, you lose trust the next time you come back as well.

644
01:08:51,430 --> 01:09:00,520
Now here are some logistics. If it ever comes up, if any of you ever plan to take the certified safety professional or CIA,

645
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:04,810
you know, that's a prank that these will come up on the exam.

646
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:09,280
So don't listen to as I say, not as I do.

647
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:16,540
Don't use text heavy powerpoints real life examples hands on skills practice for sure if you have time.

648
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:23,830
So like in my office upstairs, I have these little look like seasoning shaker bottles, but they're glo germ,

649
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:31,480
which is essentially like a bioluminescent powder where people like simulate washing their hands or whatever,

650
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:35,290
and then you use like a black light to see how much they self contaminate themselves.

651
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:39,999
Some people use like oatmeal to simulate, simulate bath, for example,

652
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:50,620
or like Hershey's Sirup for blood make it audience appropriate headings should always be at least size 24 or font size 16 font for text.

653
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:54,490
And then keep in mind, a good chunk of the population is actually colorblind.

654
01:09:55,420 --> 01:10:01,239
So try not to use like bright colors or contrast in colors and then white space in layout.

655
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:04,840
And if any of you ever have the pleasure of doing anything for the government,

656
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:10,420
which I do, you have to make everything 508 compliant, which is ADA friendly.

657
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:14,380
I don't do that for these slides because that takes a lot of work for me.

658
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,980
But all the slides that are given to the government,

659
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:23,799
essentially all the that means all the photos have to have all text so that

660
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:30,910
persons who may have a higher hard of hearing or they might have vision problems,

661
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:34,510
they can like at least read what the picture is showing.

662
01:10:35,290 --> 01:10:43,360
And then they also capture like whether there's inappropriate formatting or like this slide is missing like header or something like that.

663
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:52,840
Um, so with that, I mean, that's a very quick nitty gritty rundown of adult education.

664
01:10:53,320 --> 01:11:01,719
Do y'all have specific questions for me? Because I feel like I have so many stories, but I just like can't think of too many.

665
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:04,900
I'm prompted off of the top of my head.

666
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:12,340
I see like the Indiana airport, like that was pretty good success. Just like you have the training, though, to have those sharp disposal centers.

667
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:14,370
That was huge.

668
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:22,900
I also had a success with Bloomington, Indiana, Parks and Rec, which is very much what the show Parks and Rec is based off of, like Pawnee.

669
01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:36,010
So they had the same issue with the opioid epidemic in that people who are using heroin, mostly injecting it in the parks at the public toilets,

670
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:45,130
the toilet bowls would just be filled full of disposed needles so people couldn't even use the toilets.

671
01:11:45,130 --> 01:11:51,880
It's just full of needles. So they started putting sharps containers right outside of the bathroom.

672
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:58,780
Right. I had the recommendation to put it inside the bathroom because they said when people are high,

673
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:07,870
you really removing like the amount of barriers if they're going to dispose of that needle to do that in the first place,

674
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:12,069
because people would if they couldn't throw it in the toilet bowl, they would throw it in the bushes.

675
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:16,510
And like these are playgrounds where the kids dogs, you know, whatever.

676
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:21,040
So very dangerous parking garages, they would do that as well.

677
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:30,760
One thing they they dumped they demolished a parking garage that was four stories and more rebuilding it to be more structurally sound and for

678
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:39,280
whatever reason in the city blueprints they now we're going to have a public toilet in the parking garage which they had a lot of concerns about.

679
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:43,569
And I was like, yeah, get bathroom access equity.

680
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:47,590
But like this seems like a lot of work because they said now they have to put

681
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:53,200
cameras facing the toilet and then like a green red light indicator so they

682
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:56,829
can figure out if someone's been sleeping in there all night or like lock

683
01:12:56,830 --> 01:13:02,440
themselves in and then they put essentially all prison grade materials in there,

684
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:06,340
no mirrors, stainless steel sink, stainless steel toilets.

685
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:14,440
And so they were like, what do you think about if we put a mesh filter in the bowl to try to catch the needles?

686
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:14,950
And I was like,

687
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:23,140
That sounds like a frickin terrible idea because you're going to be unclogging that toilet every hour of the day in the parking garage.

688
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:30,940
So thankfully, you know, like these. But these are like conversations I have with like supervisors in particular.

689
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:37,299
Hand hygiene is a big one with the hand with the practices.

690
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:43,180
People don't realize how much they just. Touch and touch and stuff.

691
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:50,770
What else have I done that led to some action items?

692
01:13:55,340 --> 01:14:01,220
I have gotten complaints about my training before, one in particular.

693
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:05,870
I was back in San Diego doing a training for Sodexo, North America.

694
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:13,040
So Sodexo provides a lot of the custodial and environmental services in hospitals, but they also do their cafeteria food sometimes.

695
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:23,780
And so I was talking to them about PPE. And while I went to college in San Diego, I forgot that San Diego is still a very conservative area.

696
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:32,629
So I was talking about PPE, materials, integrity, comparing the level of testing they do for disposable gloves to condoms,

697
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:39,410
and saying that condoms actually get tested more for material integrity than nitrile gloves.

698
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:45,060
And I got a complaint. Yeah, I could see that. But that's the reality of life.

699
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:52,800
Too bad. So sad. But yeah, I mean, you know, and then we used to administer paper evaluations as well.

700
01:14:53,130 --> 01:15:00,030
So when we administered paper evaluations, one thing I realized is we used to have our scale from strongly disagree,

701
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:03,629
to strongly agree, and we'd always get positive feedback.

702
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:11,910
But when we went back to the office to like enter the data and everything would be marked strongly disagree because people didn't look at the

703
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:18,810
notation at the top and people naturally think like because you so you'd read a whole thing where they just like do essentially like the,

704
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:22,439
the satisficing and they do strongly disagree for everything.

705
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:25,799
And then you look at the bad comments and it's like wonderful training.

706
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:29,040
Thank you for coming. And I'm like, I think you meant to remark like strongly agree.

707
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:34,290
So then we had to like flip the scale after a while. So it's like making those adjustments as well.

708
01:15:34,290 --> 01:15:36,629
Or sometimes you get comments, you can't do anything about that.

709
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:43,530
So like this would be better if there was coffee and like donuts, but you can't use federal money for that.

710
01:15:45,150 --> 01:15:53,820
Just recognize, I think how I try to approach adult training is you can't make or even teaching, you can't make a 100% of people have.

711
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:57,990
Like that's never going to happen. There's always going to be like a couple of people who are unhappy.

712
01:15:58,350 --> 01:16:00,990
There's not necessarily anything you can do about that.

713
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:09,270
But so long as you feel like you've reached like one person or like you feel like you've actually made a difference in one person.

714
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:15,900
And even better, if it's like an organizational change, for example, I feel like that's kind of like what keeps you going?

715
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:22,980
Yeah, it can be hard not to take things personally, but that's just the nature of the game.

716
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:29,340
But I find it really fulfilling for me where I do my research here and I do sit

717
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:33,540
around in my office and I get bored and so periodically I do go out and do these

718
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:38,159
trainings in the community and I feel like that really invigorates me because with

719
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:44,280
my research most days I don't see what actually the outcomes are for like weeks,

720
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:51,330
months, years, maybe never even. Whereas with the training it's like you get immediate feedback on it feels really nice.

721
01:16:53,580 --> 01:17:02,970
So with that I will say, remember you have your last quiz do the Monday after Thanksgiving break.

722
01:17:03,690 --> 01:17:08,999
I will not see you all next week. I hope you have safe travels.

723
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,350
You're going back to Texas.
