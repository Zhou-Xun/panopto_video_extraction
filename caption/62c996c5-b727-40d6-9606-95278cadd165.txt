00:11:47,918 --> 00:11:52,938
aspect collaboration. we're having

118
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:58,138
some transport boundary. that's why we chose to start off

119
00:11:58,138 --> 00:12:03,938
by looking at some of these issues. in a very generic way.

120
00:12:03,938 --> 00:12:09,318
not realize not not receive

121
00:12:09,318 --> 00:12:15,378
an expertise. I was gonna need to understand some broad issues

122
00:12:15,378 --> 00:12:20,898

123
00:12:20,898 --> 00:12:28,538

127
00:12:46,888 --> 00:12:52,568
I will be talking about. but was unable to be here to

128
00:12:52,568 --> 00:12:57,588
no test in the plan. so

129
00:12:57,588 --> 00:13:03,428
just talking about vaccines and global prevention. because we forget

130
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:08,608
what we are doing. between Israel and

131
00:13:08,608 --> 00:13:15,208
United_States really hasn't brought Global

132
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:20,292
Israel as out reach programs two. the number

133
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:25,932
of countries. specially in Asia and Africa.

134
00:13:25,932 --> 00:13:31,332
as the United_States and there are areas of collaboration. as

135
00:13:31,332 --> 00:13:36,632
vaccines are introduced to these areas. but there's also

136
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:41,672
a history of work at least two or

137
00:13:41,672 --> 00:13:46,732
three vaccines such situations or is becoming more

138
00:13:46,732 --> 00:13:52,152
common. and we also re faxing

139
00:13:52,152 --> 00:13:57,552
that's the most cost effective public intervention.

140
00:13:57,552 --> 00:14:04,872
that's it. please use the same vaccines are using in various countries.

141
00:14:04,872 --> 00:14:12,612
often identical people talking about passing local come on.

142
00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:18,675
really cross borders the section about the vaccines

143
00:14:18,675 --> 00:14:23,915
that they chose make some recommendations on the use of.

144
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:29,255
but in fact these are very cross recommendations and major

145
00:14:29,255 --> 00:14:34,515
countries. just realized afterwards. hate to make

146
00:14:34,515 --> 00:14:39,995
their own recommendations on these. bye.

147
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:45,595
say Sam on the board. each year.

148
00:14:45,595 --> 00:14:54,075
in in in March.

149
00:14:54,075 --> 00:14:59,135
case is the go the recommendations of the vaccine composition class

150
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:05,075
of accent and normally goes through the approval process.

151
00:15:05,075 --> 00:15:12,935
J H is the strange and voting yes or no accepting the.

152
00:15:12,935 --> 00:15:18,505
show and I re questions about what we both know what what happened.

153
00:15:18,505 --> 00:15:25,225
yes the fact that most of the last eight years. you said

154
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:31,065
and there's no good. so we will do what he told you this was the manufacture's.

155
00:15:31,065 --> 00:15:36,585
when in fact they're gonna make decisions about whether. bye.

156
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:41,825
thanks. bye. we also

157
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:47,245
forget that nearly all of actually shoes and low income. they have made

158
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:53,325
the most major impact. we're about.

159
00:15:53,325 --> 00:15:58,645
we have very few backs. and when we have these vaccines

160
00:15:58,645 --> 00:16:04,765
often. so support. in order to bring them along with Mark.

161
00:16:04,765 --> 00:16:11,065
we are still driven by our insurance.

162
00:16:11,065 --> 00:16:16,583
we would not have a passing for the developing world measles. for all

163
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:21,763
and this is all easy to administer was state

164
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:26,923
technology. fire but they do require

165
00:16:26,923 --> 00:16:31,943
contact with the Health Care System with Financial waste. this does

166
00:16:31,943 --> 00:16:38,143
become a problem at this and.

167
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:43,843
I'm gonna use polio. this is an example example. you are gonna be hearing

168
00:16:43,843 --> 00:16:49,343
more about this from the rest of recess. it was all issues related to the quote.

169
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:54,803
they got us involved in an issue where Israel and

170
00:16:54,803 --> 00:17:00,063
GQ. because some of the ninth that I'll just have_to get the background.

171
00:17:00,063 --> 00:17:06,343
so probably because they paralyzed disease and younger individuals.

172
00:17:06,343 --> 00:17:11,443
paradise sickle disease. because you don't recognize their

173
00:17:11,443 --> 00:17:17,127
development is horrible. poor oral hygiene

174
00:17:17,127 --> 00:17:22,207
asset development procedures. you begin to see if you burdens

175
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:27,547
of this disease which moves up and age. so that's when

176
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:32,647
this is actually with Stacy was mainly in young

177
00:17:32,647 --> 00:17:37,667
school age children. we are as in Israel which at that time. it's amazing

178
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:42,867
how it's really has developed the last sixty seventy

179
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:47,947
years. hiking was not nearly up to the standard. it is

180
00:17:47,947 --> 00:17:53,507
now. you expected to develop. show she was leaving

181
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:58,787
or something like that. or visit Israel on the holidays. which is no

182
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:05,267
no longer the case. so there was a different level and the about

183
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:11,187
the classic which most people now is too

184
00:18:11,187 --> 00:18:16,999
high and some vaccines that are available for folio and activated vaccine

185
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:22,959
this offer actually. and the later about Satan vaccine

186
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:28,999
and both have been given several locations for different reasons.

187
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:34,979
one of my standard questions. Sam's and three five oh six why

188
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:40,179
yet. the two vaccines for their region. the reason

189
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:47,459
for the activated was the same. had a chance master Davis.

190
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:52,659
if you get interference between the three types and having different

191
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:58,359
types. becoming very core. the whole evolution

192
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:05,039
polio vaccine. go forward. certain types seem to be eleven.

193
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:11,119
whereas others continue the process. so

194
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:16,329
activate back to life I saw. started out here

195
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:21,649
test we're comfortable shoes at Casper. but

196
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:26,949
the trials came back to Michigan and Francis field

197
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:31,989
trial was announced here and on April twelve

198
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:37,049
nineteen fifty five. that's the rapid building for those who are new to

199
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:43,089
the Ann_Arbor. this is a very prestigious

200
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:48,329
art that covers the right side of our building

201
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:53,483
in the middle of the campus. where our graduates school and

202
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:58,963
alive. anyway it is actually came longer in the house. later and our political decision

203
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:04,903
in terms of the National Foundation supporting which they were gonna be around this

204
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:11,143
clinical trials large outside the United_States. everybody was already activated by

205
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:16,983
the United_States and some shenanigans by FCA

206
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:22,003
because there were other candidate fax stickers use. only one

207
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:28,783
set candidate life changing viruses

208
00:20:28,783 --> 00:20:33,923
and now if you go back. some people sir.

209
00:20:33,923 --> 00:20:38,943
call. claim HIV. because it was testing and monkeys in

210
00:20:38,943 --> 00:20:44,063
Africa. so he's actually my husband's friend

211
00:20:44,063 --> 00:20:49,583
and in Africa. through through the

212
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:54,836
testing. lot of the change with his actually if this thing is the e-mail that

213
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:59,856
you sent for last essence of the light and then somebody

214
00:20:59,856 --> 00:21:04,976
specimens are available and with PCR show that this is

215
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:09,976
just nonsense. it was HIV in the Saxy

216
00:21:09,976 --> 00:21:16,036
that we're being minister. there is places in there

217
00:21:16,036 --> 00:21:21,196
and there's Doctor Francis during the Francis steel trial

218
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:26,736
which was an enormous trial activated.

219
00:21:26,736 --> 00:21:31,916
once is actually conducted the times and all that at this point start

220
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:37,276
to work with hundreds of thousands of individuals. prices

221
00:21:37,276 --> 00:21:42,816
rock people from the Bureau of the Census here to Ann_Arbor

222
00:21:42,816 --> 00:21:48,256
and after the trial was over. this was in Genesis.

223
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:53,560
the concert you house. she had ready you send send the

224
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:58,680
chances work in house and start out at community study

225
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:04,780
on health and and the Francis field trial. I

226
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:09,800
showed Jose Barrios. this is I can't have the

227
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:15,940
time to go into the issue of the service controls versus

228
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:21,640
ratified control trials. results were possibly similar.

229
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:27,940
and then the evening of the trial. so made a great mistake

230
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:33,040
in having his own wrong crap press conference and saying that he he

231
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:39,460
had a better schedule for vaccination which produce better

232
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:45,140
that was seen in the field. so

233
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:51,124
both got started out with activated which

234
00:22:51,124 --> 00:22:56,264
was not likely to produce a

235
00:22:56,264 --> 00:23:02,224
test. polio is wired through

236
00:23:02,224 --> 00:23:07,684
the gastrointestinal tract. first Line Financial. about a recent gastrointestinal

237
00:23:07,684 --> 00:23:13,344
track. activated back in circulation.

238
00:23:13,344 --> 00:23:18,644
so the scenario was never a limited time only. we

239
00:23:18,644 --> 00:23:24,144
just activated. thanks. reality check and Scandinavian

240
00:23:24,144 --> 00:23:29,264
countries. and and no one's ever moved

241
00:23:29,264 --> 00:23:34,324
over to our our our old actually have pretty an agent call

242
00:23:34,324 --> 00:23:39,484
you and there are serious. this is patient out gets cold

243
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:45,264
in those areas. most of the transmission quote. there's some work

244
00:23:45,264 --> 00:23:51,084
stations. which is why some of some people of our ventures are my vintage

245
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:56,184
talking about how they will prevent it from going to the swimming pool there. to learn how

246
00:23:56,184 --> 00:24:01,844
to swim because polio breaks during the summer. we're home in the United_States.

247
00:24:01,844 --> 00:24:06,964
and and swimming pools got close and others

248
00:24:06,964 --> 00:24:12,484
got scared and people just did not go and

249
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:19,224
swim. so bandages. we talked about you man.

250
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:24,404
the vaccine. this is bandage. double eggs.

251
00:24:24,404 --> 00:24:30,044
it's Brett. it's a lie. anyway this Maxine. it's Brad. and

252
00:24:30,044 --> 00:24:35,204
a very very small portion. somewhere. bye. version

253
00:24:35,204 --> 00:24:41,804
outside of this slot. thanks actually great news. Charlie

254
00:24:41,804 --> 00:24:47,924
this is Pat with tonight. until's is that. bye Jonas.

255
00:24:47,924 --> 00:24:54,512
bye-bye. bye. Albert save it we had time to talk about this.

256
00:24:54,512 --> 00:24:59,632
meet your career as head of the Wiseman Institute. report

257
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:04,852
Group. I'm running late and

258
00:25:04,852 --> 00:25:09,972
he last there for two to three years. he

259
00:25:09,972 --> 00:25:16,172
was a strong personality. as you saw.

260
00:25:16,172 --> 00:25:22,812
so the light. even rare

261
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:27,972
side thanks. our lenders approach has been

262
00:25:27,972 --> 00:25:33,252
such as polio to use controls.

263
00:25:33,252 --> 00:25:39,972
moving back to you in active. thanks. this is no potential side_effects

264
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:44,992
and actually site from perhaps

265
00:25:44,992 --> 00:25:50,060
has. so and that's what's happening

266
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:55,140
in United_States and that's what's happening. you know a_lot. so we'll have_to be the action

267
00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:00,360
to slide it. thanks. bye. the place in Israel. the need

268
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:06,400
for the line vaccine and much much more. now some

269
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:12,000
nine six because they live vaccine. the vaccine

270
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,280
did not work as well. in the eyes. Israel as in United_States.

271
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:23,760
very young individuals because in the US. very young and

272
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,900
getting getting hold of you. that probably has_to do.

273
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:35,084
again it's at that time. so

274
00:26:35,084 --> 00:26:40,144
the question is that blessed by this

275
00:26:40,144 --> 00:26:46,904
disease has been marked as a second one after all

276
00:26:46,904 --> 00:26:52,984
the eleven was supposed to be a two. maybe and your two thousand or something like that.

277
00:26:52,984 --> 00:26:58,024
and we're not the question. why. I saw the

278
00:26:58,024 --> 00:27:04,304
experience. if you're gonna here. tells us

279
00:27:04,304 --> 00:27:10,424
answer your question. it's real. also having brought to you later. thanks.

280
00:27:10,424 --> 00:27:15,604
and continuing to see Greg. hey

281
00:27:15,604 --> 00:27:20,704
listen tomorrow. thanks. I'll leave actually. so

282
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:26,144
it goes very well backs and because of sewers.

283
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:33,720
so we're sampling. they have in a book today Tuesday. okay. while

284
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,859
I just read an editorial because even if

285
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:44,500
virus can't continue to transmit. they're talking about developing antivirus

286
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:50,200
to take care of the situation where somebody used patient.

287
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,800
please fire or something. so the story about

288
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:01,060
limitation ratification which means eight there and you don't

289
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:06,060
have_to cast. it's very very. bye.

290
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:11,580
this is simple.

291
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:16,780
so moving ahead. we don't work very much

292
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:23,840
here. give me a call back thanks. bye. since Sue Rocha Hospital

293
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,320
is one of the Hobbs of Global Knowledge. the new McCall call vaccine

294
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:34,911
I thought I'd at least Greenberg who is working with us

295
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:40,512
on influences. so I couldn't make it to the symposium

296
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:45,572
and the place in terms of development

297
00:28:45,572 --> 00:28:51,072
principal as well this is very important task. so if you're on

298
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:57,812
more about how this meeting and re air some beer. they for the development

299
00:28:57,812 --> 00:29:02,932
is. so I really wanna bring Maddy in Texas disease results

300

was they in compensation law. unfortunately had

634
01:00:09,442 --> 01:00:14,742
lots potential the finally sale because many people didn't wanted to even to go to the government

635
01:00:14,742 --> 01:00:19,742
and we produce again. they said the tendency. many people didn't even tell

636
01:00:19,742 --> 01:00:25,142
and the family. number is eight eighty Rock taken

637
01:00:25,142 --> 01:00:30,222
away with the procedure I'm talking about and sixty one. when the phones work

638
01:00:30,222 --> 01:00:36,162
and let's postpone. so just is see law potential co- immigration.

639
01:00:36,162 --> 01:00:41,162
it's David. by the way. thanks for the session wondering maybe have a

640
01:00:41,162 --> 01:00:46,213
conventional me already from the so maybe we're thinking about

641
01:00:46,213 --> 01:00:51,273
having a medical examination ready for collection. hoping that that's a_lot_of

642
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:56,453
interesting story. bye. ciao. I don't have time you can see here

643
01:00:56,453 --> 01:01:02,233
in fifteen. the immigration doesn't start many from you you're up

644
01:01:02,233 --> 01:01:07,753
about a change in the mission from our country. and these are Jewish Jewish

645
01:01:07,753 --> 01:01:13,233
people arriving from our country. maybe send to the permits ready and

646
01:01:13,233 --> 01:01:19,533
feel good today. very traumatic. in fact that that

647
01:01:19,533 --> 01:01:25,193
discussion from social Somerset and you have the time.

648
01:01:25,193 --> 01:01:33,073
your house and commission. this is my new year you.

649
01:01:33,073 --> 01:01:38,133
and also for Steve Monica. about you know the Jews arriving from the West. you know they

650
01:01:38,133 --> 01:01:43,561
don't have anything for that if you know anything on the piano and Catherine

651
01:01:43,561 --> 01:01:48,641
and in here can see our coffee table but they're eating

652
01:01:48,641 --> 01:01:53,721
on the floor and not the forty thousand

653
01:01:53,721 --> 01:01:58,861
bucks probably much much nicer and the rug in the

654
01:01:58,861 --> 01:02:06,401
office tomorrow. again it's amazing challenges. also possible.

655
01:02:06,401 --> 01:02:12,261
hopefully you know for what I'm looking for the warehouse in mail box and the symbol of unity

656
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:17,261
and looking relation additional

657
01:02:17,261 --> 01:02:22,361
deposition I'm doing. a question for you about upping and calling people

658
01:02:22,361 --> 01:02:28,121
Tucker. this is for Michael hooker. give me a call back. thank you.

659
01:02:28,121 --> 01:02:33,861
good friend. hey I'm sorry about the issues house.

660
01:02:33,861 --> 01:02:38,961
you can call me please where where it maybe fell out and I thought we need all again

661
01:02:38,961 --> 01:02:44,619
eight one eight eight research. and you can see if I don't mind. it's very

662
01:02:44,619 --> 01:02:50,579
hey complicated involved many completing.

663
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:55,859
he's on vacation we handle. he's very

664
01:02:55,859 --> 01:03:01,759
quickly and.

665
01:03:01,759 --> 01:03:07,759
hey niche and top off about potential direction for cross country. this

666
01:03:07,759 --> 01:03:12,899
tomorrow. we continue our discussion and hope we have time to do so. so again

667
01:03:12,899 --> 01:03:18,279
we're thinking about transponder you can think about trying space on both of which

668
01:03:18,279 --> 01:03:23,499
product species animals and in the question if you have a chance. this is Barry

669
01:03:23,499 --> 01:03:28,499
and the boat is between the different profession. and I things are finally on the

670
01:03:28,499 --> 01:03:33,499
event leading to the question a favor. and my phone here.

671
01:03:33,499 --> 01:03:38,499
probably gonna have you in our back yard. probably everywhere and

672
01:03:38,499 --> 01:03:44,101
I think it's thinking to trans boundary. as Missus Ken maybe meeting

673
01:03:44,101 --> 01:03:49,161
what is exactly. and I do think that it's wonderful potential for

674
01:03:49,161 --> 01:03:59,901
collaboration between Michigan and the room. thank you very much.

675
01:03:59,901 --> 01:04:05,001
one question I want I want

676
01:04:05,001 --> 01:04:18,741
you

677
01:04:18,741 --> 01:04:26,941
to say this hey we had that already. it's only machine.

678
01:04:26,941 --> 01:04:32,401
thank you.

679
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:56,315
bye

680
01:04:56,315 --> 01:05:02,435
okay well are set for supper. position

681
01:05:02,435 --> 01:05:07,695
number Q C N S N five five

682
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:12,795
eight. so I heard from the University of California Los_Angeles in two thousand nine.

683
01:05:12,795 --> 01:05:17,975
it's been three years. Doctor also said that medical biology mathematics

684
01:05:17,975 --> 01:05:34,795
life sciences and Ohio_State University.

685
01:05:34,795 --> 01:05:40,695
University of Michigan. Professor department.

686
01:05:40,695 --> 01:05:45,967
research is focused on developing in translating

687
01:05:45,967 --> 01:05:52,147
this mathematics.

688
01:05:52,147 --> 01:05:57,447
the allergies are used in transmission dynamics. your business strategies

689
01:05:57,447 --> 01:06:04,607
for testing in

690
01:06:04,607 --> 01:06:09,767
a little bit about some work that is a problem. so we

691
01:06:09,767 --> 01:06:14,787
will talk about what we're up to. quite

692
01:06:14,787 --> 01:06:20,055
a few projects that we're working on but I think it will be interesting

693
01:06:20,055 --> 01:06:25,095
hi I have an agent. I'm calling to a lesson that

694
01:06:25,095 --> 01:06:30,175
I don't know that I really need to do. I'll also there's a little bleach through the

695
01:06:30,175 --> 01:06:36,615
slider quickly. so you know polio Laurel transmissions.

696
01:06:36,615 --> 01:06:42,275
mostly in a very small actually case. you can call Brown.

697
01:06:42,275 --> 01:06:47,615
there are three and they're confusing me and I just wanted to Missus Aro. call

698
01:06:47,615 --> 01:06:53,295
me back. so I just wanted to just reminder we have you know basically a vaccine with

699
01:06:53,295 --> 01:06:58,375
permanent paralysis this is not bad transmission right. so that's what

700
01:06:58,375 --> 01:07:03,435
you need or a little while. bye. Ball Crouse this is

701
01:07:03,435 --> 01:07:08,735
General unity from open ten to ten.

702
01:07:08,735 --> 01:07:13,835
so it's also this is just miserable. can you know just read another e-mail back.

703
01:07:13,835 --> 01:07:18,975
we're actually getting back to you but of course but also comes with no cost

704
01:07:18,975 --> 01:07:24,142
for house so those of you guys there's some other issues and we'll be back

705
01:07:24,142 --> 01:07:30,762
but I was gonna say more but I think we covered most of the other.

706
01:07:30,762 --> 01:07:35,902
so I just wanted to say that issue. when it comes to a political survey. then as

707
01:07:35,902 --> 01:07:41,942
soon as you get for playing games. so if you're standing looking at a Q5 process

708
01:07:41,942 --> 01:07:47,682
looking at probably the case of the polio right and the problem now is that because most cases.

709
01:07:47,682 --> 01:07:52,822
most infections already symptomatic. but can't be transmitted. particularly

710
01:07:52,822 --> 01:07:58,062
if you have if you that talk to you later. bye. easy. then this is gonna be just

711
01:07:58,062 --> 01:08:03,502
the two of you guys birthday. and there's always other infections and so when you have a question.

712
01:08:03,502 --> 01:08:09,122
welcome to stop in transmitting. even if we don't see it right and so

713
01:08:09,122 --> 01:08:14,122
it was kind of.

714
01:08:14,122 --> 01:08:19,122
I think the first really be aware. you had a good day I need really track this

715
01:08:19,122 --> 01:08:24,236
whole thing and so there there are concerns about financing.

716
01:08:24,236 --> 01:08:29,416
please enter the new medication and to handle that. you really need

717
01:08:29,416 --> 01:08:35,836
some sort of environmental or sushi around the fence. so that's everything.

718
01:08:35,836 --> 01:08:41,836
and and so this is been

719
01:08:41,836 --> 01:08:46,996
transmission has really increased franchise. call people to ramp up

720
01:08:46,996 --> 01:08:53,016
and bounce around a little work. so it's well. there was an existing

721
01:08:53,016 --> 01:08:58,396
very comprehensive. excuse me Sharon. where they test

722
01:08:58,396 --> 01:09:04,396
from Pleasant Plains across the country. while back. thanks.

723
01:09:04,396 --> 01:09:10,176
have a [INAUDIBLE] evening with environment compared to something like that you're looking at

724
01:09:10,176 --> 01:09:15,316
get of the population right. everyone is screaming into the sewer system and

725
01:09:15,316 --> 01:09:20,796
then it's all coming together and then you're looking at that total and what have you.

726
01:09:20,796 --> 01:09:25,896
so it's very you can know if you see a certain level or concentration of

727
01:09:25,896 --> 01:09:32,060
polio you can't know whether that's Manny it's Peter Schwartz meeting on noon.

728
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:37,140
students are treating a_lot right. and so it's Thursday. see you then. when you're looking

729
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:42,180
at. you know exactly what are right. but you can just

730
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:47,900
text me. okay.

731
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:53,560
sounded interested. so there this early riser

732
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:59,140
that they started seeing double wall one.

733
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:04,180
this is actually part of a larger academic progress in the region. they

734
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:09,660
were with both phones earlier samples and then and then

735
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:14,940
there were there was the same type injury and Robin. so this is part of a larger

736
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:19,980
thing. but what is going on. so they there was an existing survey

737
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:26,022
up in Bartlesville. I got

738
01:10:26,022 --> 01:10:31,062
yeah Arlene mentioned earlier this is Rose Jackson coverage is quite

739
01:10:31,062 --> 01:10:36,262
high. there I was it was I really IPV for the kids

740
01:10:36,262 --> 01:10:41,502
under ten way and so that's the best part of wine

741
01:10:41,502 --> 01:10:46,582
then there was this is widespread spread. possibility of us in circulation. and so then

742
01:10:46,582 --> 01:10:51,722
this is that really provides unique opportunity to look at these questions

743
01:10:51,722 --> 01:10:56,842
about the goals and see what we can do in a situation where we have what is probably

744
01:10:56,842 --> 01:11:02,822
the best possible sewer data that one because before right because it's very common

745
01:11:02,822 --> 01:11:08,062
and another place and you will you be more looking at things like you know

746
01:11:08,062 --> 01:11:14,042
run off and more. what about Susan and more. go to the environment.

747
01:11:14,042 --> 01:11:19,442
okay. so we're in the North basically all set

748
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:25,122
in the center there were. there was a transmission it was. call me

749
01:11:25,122 --> 01:11:30,792
real early in the cell whether it's high and persistent levels of

750
01:11:30,792 --> 01:11:36,212
protection. calling on this message. one of the things that they said they

751
01:11:36,212 --> 01:11:41,472
connected us down to looking at the community because they their summer hot.

752
01:11:41,472 --> 01:11:46,792
the other one time or part of the answer.

753
01:11:46,792 --> 01:11:52,512
and then there was a_lot_of thought that there maybe a transmission happening in the bed on Saturday.

754
01:11:52,512 --> 01:11:58,412
in particularly because of the consultation situation. but

755
01:11:58,412 --> 01:12:03,652
where there are you on recognize which have. I don't have water

756
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:08,672
or sanitation. and so as a result the water. he's

757
01:12:08,672 --> 01:12:14,152
Heidi. Michael this is not. you know there's no there's no suit.

758
01:12:14,152 --> 01:12:19,372
there's no you know there's there's both a possible possibility for concessions.

759
01:12:19,372 --> 01:12:24,612
and also don't have data on those regions right because there is no organize system

760
01:12:24,612 --> 01:12:30,924
from which to take so this is this is interesting.

761
01:12:30,924 --> 01:12:36,204
we have this as a Center and this out but where there maybe higher transmission

762
01:12:36,204 --> 01:12:41,644
but we actually are getting data from the places where the transmission bye.

763
01:12:41,644 --> 01:12:46,764
this is just that phone from Lester someone who was the head of those

764
01:12:46,764 --> 01:12:51,836
around you have been collecting a_lot_of hey. and and so it's just showing

765
01:12:51,836 --> 01:12:57,943
in the North and the South region. where you have very little or no

766
01:12:57,943 --> 01:13:03,184
and then the stop over here. look at another map in a minute. I know you can't really read

767
01:13:03,184 --> 01:13:08,624
this morning. but where you have some consistent positive.

768
01:13:08,624 --> 01:13:13,624
now Sylvia. okay. alright. so

769
01:13:13,624 --> 01:13:19,224
take to win a package in addition to wrapping up around. there's also

770
01:13:19,224 --> 01:13:24,264
like barge intervention. so people supper. so

771
01:13:24,264 --> 01:13:29,604
I don't talk about this issue about or who the line flu vaccine. I'm

772
01:13:29,604 --> 01:13:34,624
possibly talking her houses right. so in order for Stephanie do this combine

773
01:13:34,624 --> 01:13:39,923
thing when you can bye. you need first and then you right. so. so there was a nationwide test

774
01:13:39,923 --> 01:13:45,423
up focus on the cell. I'm Cleveland in leaving the house even in the doll

775
01:13:45,423 --> 01:13:51,604
doing. I think like he does and then two rows. Okey.

776
01:13:51,604 --> 01:14:00,772
so so there was very large in the Russian to stockton. if.

777
01:14:00,772 --> 01:14:05,853
so here this is Luca. it's a low down in

778
01:14:05,853 --> 01:14:11,173
the hot sewage. and then the coverage. the first round. you can pay

779
01:14:11,173 --> 01:14:16,573
on the second round was not didn't happen. so you can see how it

780
01:14:16,573 --> 01:14:22,292
how it went. we're actually late

781
01:14:22,292 --> 01:14:27,953
my car here whether we have turned over on his own or it but it doesn't certainly

782
01:14:27,953 --> 01:14:33,013
match. highly wise with Linda. okay. bye.

783
01:14:33,013 --> 01:14:38,413
okay. so call me back. I forgot to look at the time for.

784
01:14:38,413 --> 01:14:43,593
I got a little. okay. alright. so I'm still

785
01:14:43,593 --> 01:14:48,733
work. we're doing a little bit about two projects one is on Friday

786
01:14:48,733 --> 01:14:54,513
and wanted to survey and mapping probably. so still the mall at Robinson.

787
01:14:54,513 --> 01:14:59,557
actually this is Marlene. and so weird. we're mumbling

788
01:14:59,557 --> 01:15:04,876
up alone. working with the switch to another time and understanding. social Howard

789
01:15:04,876 --> 01:15:10,276
is looking at transition house and contact problem with the balance on that community. we're basically

790
01:15:10,276 --> 01:15:15,756
trying to see you know what can we say about this matter.

791
01:15:15,756 --> 01:15:20,997
your transmission may have been going on and generally recover any information about

792
01:15:20,997 --> 01:15:26,796
those communities thanks. bye-bye. hello Joe. welcome to say about the pattern.

793
01:15:26,796 --> 01:15:31,937
the assets are in the thousand all. bye. I I'm gonna

794
01:15:31,937 --> 01:15:37,356
actually skip over. most of our model building because

795
01:15:37,356 --> 01:15:42,557
there'll be more things here. the face the model. but please

796
01:15:42,557 --> 01:15:47,917
the structure. involves track individuals is in reference to settle

797
01:15:47,917 --> 01:15:53,097
to being lately interested to this is shining the birds are being infected. and then this

798
01:15:53,097 --> 01:15:58,125
is Shannon Walder and I just hate engine the sewage and then eventually may stop

799
01:15:58,125 --> 01:16:03,544
sending and become a. okay. that's it. base on the line for the structure.

800
01:16:03,544 --> 01:16:08,704
but you can. this is for both Paul Harris and for the vaccine bonus in the world. happy

801
01:16:08,704 --> 01:16:14,544
birthday. and then you can track in both cases whether people will get another virus or whether.

802
01:16:14,544 --> 01:16:20,364
so for the vaccine whether they were given the vaccine or whether they were they were gonna be

803
01:16:20,364 --> 01:16:25,604
and you can track whether or not to while we're there. also given the vaccine

804
01:16:25,604 --> 01:16:30,604
because since the recent somatic. it's not like you would know today. you know how we're shedding

805
01:16:30,604 --> 01:16:35,884
or not. so it's a little long story but the idea this is your tracking. what what

806
01:16:35,884 --> 01:16:40,884
what status everyone has throughout the population. in terms of whether they're saying well

807
01:16:40,884 --> 01:16:45,964
in that environment and whether. okay. so this is your

808
01:16:45,964 --> 01:16:50,964
Standard Time. I our cell phones down here the

809
01:16:50,964 --> 01:16:56,064
mall. two one. for example area that we started working with

810
01:16:56,064 --> 01:17:01,111
with. just wanna be in the Southern so you

811
01:17:01,111 --> 01:17:06,531
can see that it's this. this is Stonewall Doris. you can see it's reasonably well.

812
01:17:06,531 --> 01:17:11,591
and then this is Ashley Morris wants the vaccine have

813
01:17:11,591 --> 01:17:16,831
been started. you can see that it's captured the wedding in

814
01:17:16,831 --> 01:17:22,051
Palm Bay Holden Road. so that that's okay.

815
01:17:22,051 --> 01:17:27,351
you can then run back down to look at within the population at any given moment. you know

816
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:32,371
telling people were given the vaccine versus time. people gotta be a transmission. you know something

817
01:17:32,371 --> 01:17:37,411
but I'm gonna actually skip most of this for now. just because I don't wanna get

818
01:17:37,411 --> 01:17:42,771
too much time. you can also look at what what have happened in terms of total number of wild

819
01:17:42,771 --> 01:17:47,851
infections and number of people that. call me back. if you

820
01:17:47,851 --> 01:17:54,891
[INAUDIBLE]. the start date to other day. if you try calling me back.

821
01:17:54,891 --> 01:18:00,132
you can use yeah so basically before I move on. okay.

822
01:18:00,132 --> 01:18:06,512
call me back. all ready for this person. just happen

823
01:18:06,512 --> 01:18:11,592
to look at all of Israel and where we break it down officially and I was in

824
01:18:11,592 --> 01:18:17,472
book a facial pattern. we can we'll get in contact break between different community. including

825
01:18:17,472 --> 01:18:22,532
all measured. I recognize whether this is a soon assistance. you can look and

826
01:18:22,532 --> 01:18:27,652
say okay so how much transmission would have_to come from here. in order to explain the overall

827
01:18:27,652 --> 01:18:32,652
the receipt. you know tell me say anything about what we might need because we couldn't

828
01:18:32,652 --> 01:18:37,652
sample questions like that. okay. thanks. okay.

829
01:18:37,652 --> 01:18:42,752
love you super quick just gonna talk about working progress but I'm only gonna be doing this far work

830
01:18:42,752 --> 01:18:47,892
last fall. on this. the survey

831
01:18:47,892 --> 01:18:53,092
questionnaire that we're at and happy project that we're doing in the bedroom community. and

832
01:18:53,092 --> 01:18:58,265
so so they're gonna break down this is Renee

833
01:18:58,265 --> 01:19:04,524
Bronstein. so there are any major plans which actually

834
01:19:04,524 --> 01:19:09,544
know much or anything about communities in their history and things

835
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:14,604
of that nature. okay. many of you

836
01:19:14,604 --> 01:19:23,484
know so I think I don't have time to really do that in the like.

837
01:19:23,484 --> 01:19:28,484
bye. Marianne and Ann and sad sometimes but interesting history and I

838
01:19:28,484 --> 01:19:33,665
heard you read up on this short version is that. give me a break down. so

839
01:19:33,665 --> 01:19:38,995
plan around Reading Community that we're not plans in Houston.

840
01:19:38,995 --> 01:19:44,314
and then I'll write my community. which are not recommended

841
01:19:44,314 --> 01:19:50,035
in a moment and some don't. they don't have water and sanitation.

842
01:19:50,035 --> 01:19:55,074
all those services and Susan. we we are present to

843
01:19:55,074 --> 01:20:00,634
characterize the water and citation. quality acids and this is such

844
01:20:00,634 --> 01:20:05,774
for these different types of veteran community. and so. so we been working

845
01:20:05,774 --> 01:20:10,935
on a questionnaire. where we will be looking at these kinds of different things

846
01:20:10,935 --> 01:20:17,734
as well as looking at travel patterns will help us with the modeling earlier.

847
01:20:17,734 --> 01:20:23,094
so we'll be collecting information about the number of different topics including

848
01:20:23,094 --> 01:20:28,895
demographics and things of that nature of course water and hygiene. hello access

849
01:20:28,895 --> 01:20:33,932
travel patterns and the number of other Alan so we all have been doing

850
01:20:33,932 --> 01:20:39,292
some happening as part of this project and trying to understand you know where are

851
01:20:39,292 --> 01:20:44,372
you know where are you know what what time would

852
01:20:44,372 --> 01:20:49,632
didn't waste disposal things will be in that's something that you wanted. you were

853
01:20:49,632 --> 01:20:54,972
over the phone. and so. so that the mapping is part of this project.

854
01:20:54,972 --> 01:21:00,192
trying to understand you know where exactly are things in there. okay.

855
01:21:00,192 --> 01:21:05,452
this is an initial aspect of me using the data from your view

856
01:21:05,452 --> 01:21:10,592
that shows just so you can kinda get a sense shows up not not I don't town

857
01:21:10,592 --> 01:21:15,592
as well as plans on are in town. and then renting builders are here in Orange. I

858
01:21:15,592 --> 01:21:21,112
got all done ready do the addition here. you can get to where things are.

859
01:21:21,112 --> 01:21:26,252
okay. so we're gonna actually gonna just wrap it up because I think I probably

860
01:21:26,252 --> 01:21:31,404
have time and then I have. thank this is Tanya supposed to work with us and work

861
01:21:31,404 --> 01:21:36,524
on this and are working on this and we'll be working on with the server. I start losing them and then

862
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:41,524
I don't think I finished so. my apologies for important. the number of people. but
