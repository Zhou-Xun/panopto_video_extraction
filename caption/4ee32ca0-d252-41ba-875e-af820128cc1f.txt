1
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:12,570
Everyone is welcome to this except to our data analysis course.

2
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,440
Great to see everybody after the break. Today is going to be an introduction to the class,

3
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:33,320
followed by a little bit of SAS review going over the syllabus and the candidates looking to something with questions and well,

4
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:41,280
yes, go ahead and get started. So we're going to start by talking a little bit about why this class exists and why it's

5
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,530
something that we think is important for you all to take as part of the program here.

6
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:54,600
And I like a simple to talk a little bit about the syllabus, do a tour of Kansas, have a little bit of a break.

7
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,950
I'm not quite sure how long it's gonna take us to get through this first part of the lecture,

8
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:07,110
but they have to break the back and do some SAS review and practice in advance of the labs,

9
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,830
which are either this afternoon for you or on Monday afternoon.

10
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,380
So why do we think that learning data analysis is important?

11
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:23,880
So ultimately, all of the questions that we are trying to answer in epidemiology are going to be answered through data analysis.

12
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:33,149
So we have to collect data and make the process that we have to interpret it through on all

13
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,010
of these pieces that we've learned through biostatistics and our other methods classes.

14
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:49,230
And the goal of the drive to give you some of that hands on practice, how many people recognize the math on your lap gets?

15
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,110
You are right about people. What is that?

16
00:01:53,890 --> 00:02:05,220
You know Jon Snow's color or not so 1865 song snow was epidemiologist in London and all these folks were getting cholera and the Soho district.

17
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:15,390
And you know at the time it was thought that there were infections like viral caused by beards, bad hair.

18
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:26,850
And Jon Snow went around and actually recorded all of the deaths of the cases and found that they were clustered around the Broad Street.

19
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:37,740
And so they were able to discover that a contamination of most of that was the cause of the cholera outbreak.

20
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:48,599
And so that's in many ways, we like to highlight that as one of the outcomes of epidemiology here all the way

21
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:55,110
to the right of the we have our genetic code with a much different scale of data,

22
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:02,790
kind of like big data analysis. And so although we're not necessarily going to do examples at every scale with this class,

23
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:10,950
I just really want to emphasize that epidemiology is about data analysis and data analysis of lots of different types of data.

24
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,880
And hopefully we're going to give you some experience with that in this course.

25
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:24,670
Our goal is to integrate what you've learned in your biases these classes, your happy methods classes, and this task class.

26
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:31,090
This class is going to be clients as we are starting to move as a program to SAS and R.

27
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:39,820
But this class is going to be taught in SAS, like I said, integration and application of the concepts in mind.

28
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,190
And this course is really more of a practical you'll be practicing skills,

29
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:52,150
analyzing data sets and interpreting them regular, both continuous and dichotomous variables,

30
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,210
both through the lectures that you're going to watch online, the practice that we're going to do here,

31
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,990
and in the hand on exercises you're going to do in the labs.

32
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,210
This course is about practice, so I'm not sure I'm expecting you to practice 2 hours every day.

33
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:21,240
But the way that you get good at doing this is by doing it on seven, six or two is not intended to be a hard class or difficult class,

34
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:28,830
but there is a fair amount of work in the sense that in order to get good at doing good analysis, you have to do data analysis,

35
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:35,160
and data analysis takes time and you need to see how that analysis is different on different data sets.

36
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,880
You need to make mistakes and rectify them and recognize that they're happening and so on and so forth.

37
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,080
And so many of you may end up doing data analysis for the rest of your careers.

38
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:52,110
Hopefully that is something that sounds great to you and not like a horrifying prospect,

39
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:58,500
but hopefully we're going to be doing some studies to set you up for that.

40
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:08,399
Our goal here is to try to get you kind of meet the bottom part of this curve here,

41
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,220
give you just enough information that you're not confused with too little or too much.

42
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,370
And it's a little bit of a pick your own adventure in this course.

43
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:29,460
So the requirements are relatively low from like, well, I'll go back to that becomes the syllabus,

44
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,420
but there's a lot of options in terms of additional work that you can do.

45
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,520
And before we think about this course, kind of like a flight simulator.

46
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:47,420
So ultimately, you're going to be on your own out in the real world doing data analysis and interpretation.

47
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:53,870
But for now, we have kind of the guardrails on you, and it's just kind of the practice of the flight simulation.

48
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,680
And so, you know, the theory now we're going to put it in practice.

49
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,990
Thank you for doing that survey about the Catskills.

50
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:14,670
Of course, there's a distribution of how comfortable people feel when says some people have not even taken the SAS course.

51
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:24,140
It's not a requirement of this course. And some people have been working with SAS for years and maybe even externally of academia.

52
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:36,700
So we recognize that there is a broad range of SAS skills and so hopefully we're going to provide resources to that.

53
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,910
People who are anxious about their skills have the resources that they need.

54
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:45,380
But there are also optional challenges for the people that are maybe feeling bored.

55
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:57,110
And so what is unavailable as we develop this course likes to say we want to keep you in flow here where the skills and the challenges are comparable.

56
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:07,600
And so that's actually going to require a little bit of thinking on your part and decisions because I can't there's 85 of you.

57
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,550
I can't tailor the course, each of you individually.

58
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:20,540
And so it's going to be up to you to say, where do I need to be to match the challenge of the course to the skills that I have?

59
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:26,839
And if you feel like you're crossing into either anxiety or boredom, please let me and the GSEs.

60
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,370
Now, we can kind of help to get you back on track.

61
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,919
This is, again, meant to be a fairly painless class.

62
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,510
But as I said, it's going to requires effort on your part.

63
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,870
Material is here. I can't make you do it. It's going to be a kind of a cell phone thing.

64
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:59,570
Of course, you're all here. Graduate students. I have confidence that you're able to do very well.

65
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,850
Very hungry. Caterpillar.

66
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:15,140
Okay, so let's switch over to the syllabus or maybe before we do that, questions about the general approach and our theory of the class.

67
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:29,160
There's not quite yet. Okay, Celeste.

68
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:38,020
So, hello, everyone. I'm Andrew Brower. I'm an assistant research scientist, which is a research faculty member of the Department of Epidemiology.

69
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:41,170
My background is in applied mathematics.

70
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:51,610
I do mathematical modeling and statistical modeling data analysis more generally for infectious disease, for cancer and for tobacco control.

71
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:58,150
So that's my background. This class is normally taught by on a violin who is on sabbatical.

72
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,670
I am in the interest of transparency. I'm actually an R user.

73
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:08,820
And so and though I do have a sense of how the site is actually my area of expertise.

74
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:20,710
This has become an expert in data analysis. So we may have to rely on the GSI as a little bit to prop my skills up and also audience feedback.

75
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:36,640
So that's just the questionnaire the GSI is, and I guess I'll introduce a little bit later in the course or more later today.

76
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:44,530
Has that our office hours based on the feedback we got from the post earlier in the week.

77
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:50,050
So my office hours will be on Wednesday and Thursday 21 and 10 to 11.

78
00:09:50,410 --> 00:10:01,300
Those are the Zoom links. You can also find them by directly going to the zoom in and that's where I set up all of the recurring office hours.

79
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:08,080
All those hours are going to be virtual by default. If you do want to meet with me on the GSI in person.

80
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,190
Feel free to send us an email and we can find a time to do that.

81
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,930
There will also probably be time after lecture.

82
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,140
I don't really anticipate this class going to a full 2 hours.

83
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:28,100
It is. Okay. So see my guys from here.

84
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,860
You are here. Okay, so maybe we will do instructions now. So we have two great instructors.

85
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:41,200
They'll be in charge of the labs, which are 3 to 5 today and 1 to 3 on Monday night.

86
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,320
If you want to stand out, then say hello. Hello.

87
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,200
I am a dual degree student in both Applied and the MHC program.

88
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:57,500
Really excited to work with you all. This is my second of three years, so I actually took this class last year.

89
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,780
So I think I know what you're going through and I hope that I can reassure you that you're going to be fine.

90
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:11,930
Hi, everyone. My name is Fong and I also do you would agree with public policy and computational epidemiology?

91
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:26,389
This is my second year and I took this class also last year so they know the ropes and will help you through that weekly homeworks in this class.

92
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:32,210
So you should all know which lab section you're in already.

93
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,709
I apologize. We were at a little bit of a mix up between the department and me.

94
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:41,900
So previously if you were looking at the syllabus like before a couple of days ago,

95
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:49,040
this had the wrong assignments of both this classroom and the GSI as this is now updated.

96
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,090
But make sure Wolverine access is the actual correct thing.

97
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:59,120
So be sure to check that since we can skip because you're all here.

98
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:10,280
We talked about course description. I think it's useful to just a little bit better to talk a little bit about the objectives again.

99
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:15,740
So again, we're applying epidemiologic theory and methods to do data analysis.

100
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:23,050
One of the things that we're going to need to do is select appropriate biases to tools for the epidemiological data analysis.

101
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,070
You have a slew of things that you learned about in bio stats,

102
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:35,350
but how do you know which ones are the ones you want to pick that are appropriate for the data that you have for a new SAS programing?

103
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,729
To do our data analysis and we're going to be doing some a little bit later in the

104
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:46,420
semester critical interpretation of EPI studies through the modeling that we're doing.

105
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,719
I will skip the competencies for now.

106
00:12:52,720 --> 00:13:01,000
But there, there. This is mostly just for the purposes of the degree.

107
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,570
Making sure that you're getting the things that we say that you're getting through the program.

108
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:10,350
Of course, materials. So this is actually a flipped class.

109
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:21,040
The lecture lecture portion is going to be available on canvas through prerecorded lectures on a Berlin day previously.

110
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:28,520
What we do in this portion of the class is mostly going to be a little bit of review of those videos plus practice.

111
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:34,730
The lecture portion here is not mandatory but is recommended.

112
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:40,760
Additionally, we have the lab sections. Those are mandatory and we will be taking attendance.

113
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:47,190
If you took up at 640, the SASS class recommend you had your notes handy.

114
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:55,530
Although the video's slides also be available in the format.

115
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,320
We are expecting you to watch the videos for that week in advance of the class.

116
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:08,160
Of course, I'm not expecting that for today. We're just meeting for the first time, but the videos from week one are available.

117
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:16,220
Please watch those and we choose videos which are not up yet but will be by the end of the day available.

118
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,620
Watch them by next Friday. How are we creating this class?

119
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:29,010
This class is, of course, as you know, there is a lab attendance portion.

120
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,050
Only 10% of the grade. Most of the grade is going to be as homework assignments.

121
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,370
So those are the labs associated each week.

122
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:44,970
It's so a little bit out of schedule at the end of the syllabus and we'll have a final take home exam.

123
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:56,460
Get your own dataset and analyze it and interpret it as you're interested.

124
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,930
Here's the grade conversions. That's mark the end of the semester kind of thing.

125
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,930
Three questions before I continue.

126
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,430
No expectations. So I said, watch the videos ahead of lecture, so please do that.

127
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,940
We kind of recommend you attempt the practice problems ahead of time. That's not record.

128
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,760
That's not required. But you do need to come to the lab.

129
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:35,990
Generally, this course and all courses are better if you are prepared to contribute to the engage,

130
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,830
responsive and have contribute to a collaborative atmosphere.

131
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,660
So I'm asking questions. It's like super awkward if it's just kind of like crickets.

132
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:52,880
It's awkward for you, it's awkward for me. So hopefully we can collaboratively do some of these practice problems.

133
00:15:54,260 --> 00:16:03,500
Okay. If you do have to miss a class, don't need to tell me about not coming to the lectures are being recorded on Panopto.

134
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:10,640
They'll be available. Please watch those before asking us what you missed because it's what you missed is literally accessible.

135
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:19,640
But if you have to miss lab, please let your GSI for that lab now.

136
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:25,400
So any questions feel free to ask me. Typically, excuse absences should be for health.

137
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:33,139
So you are sick. Please do not come to class because you know no one wants to get sick to religious observance.

138
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,130
Official. You want to travel? There may be other appropriate reasons.

139
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:50,160
We will excuse to unexcused, unexcused absences. But generally speaking, we expect you to come so loud if there are no other issues.

140
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:58,450
Regret it. So after you turn in a week assignment and that grade is returned to you.

141
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:06,750
If you have questions about the grading or I think things were created incorrectly here, here's the policy for how to go about doing that.

142
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:13,360
Not going to go through in detail. It's here available to you. Take a look at it if and when that comes up.

143
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:25,249
It's collaboration. The laboratory assignments are set up so that you will work with somebody else in a pair for the

144
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,840
first half of the semester and somebody else and a pair for the other half of the semester.

145
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:37,130
I know that this can be kind of awkward, but it does kind of mimic how, you know, real world.

146
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,880
We have to work with folks and teams to to do our analysis.

147
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:49,310
Even though you are working with other folks and are also welcome to collaborate with your friends outside of lab.

148
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:57,770
You do have to prepare and turn in your own homework assignments and as the answers and the words should reflect your own work.

149
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:05,390
And we'll talk a little bit about on our policy when we get back to the slides.

150
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:12,290
When you come to the final exam, that work is totally on your own and no collaboration with other folks.

151
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,990
Great policy homework from the labs is due at the start of the lecture.

152
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:29,569
So 1 p.m. on Fridays. 20% penalty for each day that the homework is not turned at and no more than

153
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:37,250
three days late with reasonable accommodations under extenuating circumstances.

154
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,450
Female policy. Generally speaking, both men, the GSI, is trying to be generally available.

155
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:52,690
But know I have a job outside of teaching this class, and so it may not immediately get back to you.

156
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,970
So please don't expect a response sooner than 24 hours.

157
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:03,940
We'll try to get to you as soon as we can. Questions about any of the.

158
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:13,670
Expectations and policies that are. Okay.

159
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,370
School policies, diversity, equity, inclusion.

160
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:31,900
So I take diversity equity inclusion very seriously and I want to make sure that this we have a positive, inclusive environment.

161
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:43,790
So please. Contribute to that and also help me if I'm making mistakes, do that by saying your name wrong.

162
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:52,099
Please correct me, for example. And so just what I do to make that point, academic integrity.

163
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:57,230
Again, I've already said that the work that you do in the homework should reflect your own work.

164
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,830
That's going to be the primary place. This where that shows up.

165
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,970
There will be an honor policy that you have to sign for each homework.

166
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:13,520
You know, I don't really feel like that is something that I need to expect from graduate students like yourselves.

167
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,340
However, it is a policy of the class more generally,

168
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:31,850
and so we're continuing that in school is hard and we recognize that there may be lots of challenges both academically and outside of your work.

169
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:39,469
And we want to make sure that you are having the resources that you need to do.

170
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:48,510
Well, excuse me. So if you have academic stressors, feel free to contact me or other folks in the department.

171
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,180
We also have a wellness advocate in epidemiology and I think some of the other departments,

172
00:20:54,200 --> 00:21:00,950
if you're officially in one of the other departments and they're really great for helping you access resources.

173
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,320
So we want to make sure that you're aware that these are available.

174
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:14,820
It's Michigan, it's cold, it's wet. And so it can be kind of hard to feel happy and engaged at this time of year.

175
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,479
The winter semester always tends to be a little bit harder on our mental health.

176
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,410
So if you're struggling, please let somebody know.

177
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:31,640
Student accommodations. I have received a couple of accommodation letters for us from the SSD office.

178
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:40,580
Please remind me that we are coming into a situation where that comes up and we make appropriate accommodations.

179
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,350
Looking through that and generally speaking, I don't expect that to be much of an issue.

180
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,180
With the possible exception of the final.

181
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:55,489
And so we'll just kind of have to address that, that if you feel like you have accommodations or you would like accommodations,

182
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:01,730
please speak with the student services for Students with Disabilities Office to arrange those.

183
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,110
That's.

184
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:14,700
Probably don't need too much contact with the writing lab in this task, but please be aware that that is a service that may be relevant for you.

185
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,950
Similar student support for food insecurity. For experiencing food insecurity.

186
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:28,710
There are resources for that on campus and civic engagement more relevant for the fall semester typically.

187
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:36,860
But we do support the right to engage in civic topics.

188
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,740
Okay. Other questions about policies.

189
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:48,920
And then we're just kind of like getting through the details here. Let's talk a little bit about the schedule.

190
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,530
One thing that's a little bit funny about having both a Friday and a monday lab is

191
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:58,730
that if classes are canceled on and we kind of also have to cancel them on the other.

192
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:04,670
So there are a couple of times that we're not having labs because of some problems.

193
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:13,700
So we have a lab today, but we do not have web next week, next week, meaning Friday slash Monday.

194
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:21,830
So I have to be a little bit careful. So I say this week, I mean, Friday and next Monday, both have labs.

195
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:27,980
Labs this week are going to be practice problems and do not have a homework associated with that.

196
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:33,930
After that week two because of Martin Luther King Day.

197
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,630
Friday and Monday are canceled Monday. There are no classes.

198
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:44,640
So we don't have a on Friday and we're going to come back week three.

199
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:49,690
That's going to be the 20th and the 23rd. We're going to start the actual homeworks.

200
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:55,530
That's going to be our second lab that the third week. You know, it's kind of a little mouthful, but hopefully that makes sense.

201
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:03,049
And you can take a look at the schedule more broadly, the due dates for the whole market.

202
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:09,260
Again, remember that those are the Friday before lecture and I think we're at GSI,

203
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:15,410
so planning on getting those back to you within a week and you can follow that also from that.

204
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,710
Okay. So we will have spring break at the beginning of March.

205
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:25,430
So no classes then, of course. And.

206
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,260
So on and so forth for the rest.

207
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:39,090
It's a pretty standard boring to do lecture videos for the topic coming into practice here and this section, and then do the homework in the labs.

208
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,520
There are recommended readings. They are not mandatory.

209
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,130
They, again, are meant to if you're if you're are either having trouble or are bored,

210
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:55,530
gives you a little bit more interaction with the material things that are available here.

211
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:03,260
They're also on the campus. Switch back here.

212
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,660
That's the syllabus. Campus tour.

213
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:12,640
So everything. Is going to be on canvas.

214
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:20,020
You have a little five matrix picture here. You had access to or should have access.

215
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,400
It's a little bit tricky for me because I have to kind of switch between student view and I'm like stealing stuff from last year.

216
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:30,340
So if any of the material is like not coming through with the links.

217
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:37,940
Generally I get an email saying that there's a broken link, but if you're having trouble accessing something you think you should be able to access.

218
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:45,970
Send me an email and I'll try to resolve it. So this course is set up through links to weekly pages.

219
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:58,300
So this we just have one available each week is going to have one of these little charts that I can look at too closely here.

220
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:08,390
Look, there's an unbelievable amount.

221
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:15,650
Okay. So this is week one. We had a number of different contents that come back here.

222
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:23,780
So they're color coded so that you have your party lecture, the optional readings,

223
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:32,930
the practice that is a combination of do on your own and a review and your optional challenge tasks.

224
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:40,610
Lots of preparations that comes into a little bit later in the semester where we're going

225
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:46,130
to do possible looking at the literature to find models that we're talking about in class.

226
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:53,120
So if we're going to do things like logistic regression, we'll find some papers that have logistic regression and then do a linear regression.

227
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,290
And we're going to find some papers with one intervention. And then the assignments here.

228
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:05,240
And this week there are all of these yellow lines are prerecorded videos.

229
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:09,260
So we'll kind of wait a few videos to watch.

230
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:14,990
It's mostly SAS review. Take a look at it and.

231
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,570
Hopefully that helps refresh your memory.

232
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,490
If you don't want to do it, then that's on you.

233
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:37,990
Practice problems here at Green. So it's just the one practice where we're going to start this in class today as we go through

234
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:44,820
and try to hear some of the actual practice with what is learned slash reviewed in the lectures.

235
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:49,469
So then there'll be some more practice in the lab this week again.

236
00:27:49,470 --> 00:28:00,440
So no assignments, just the lab. Okay.

237
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,080
So that's going to show up at the beginning, at the top of each page.

238
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:09,600
The recordings are all available here. So eight recordings kind of a lot this week.

239
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:16,800
But again, it's just review. And then if you just want to look through the slides, actually have them here.

240
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,810
Download them. It's not.

241
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:35,040
You had access to the slides that Dr. Baylin was talking through.

242
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:41,190
So you don't have to kind of like kind of scrub the video trying to find the specific pages you need.

243
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:50,430
It's nice to have these open as you do the practice. So if you're like, okay, I want to think like a proper univariate.

244
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:55,469
I don't quite remember what the syntax is. I need to go back and find it.

245
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:59,340
So maybe you have your 640 notes and those are handy and available.

246
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:02,820
Maybe you just want to be able to have these slides accessible.

247
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:08,610
So that's. So the recordings are here.

248
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,580
The reenactors will come back in a second to talk about accessing sass.

249
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:23,370
If you took 640, you hopefully familiar with this. This is a little bit different than a year ago.

250
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:28,530
Hopefully that's not going to confuse everyone. I think we've all learned the same thing.

251
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:32,480
Now, correct way confuse me because I was like, I'm used to doing that this other way.

252
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:37,160
So it's new now. We'll come back to that in a second. Any lecture slides?

253
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:45,210
So what I was showing Feeney in class, they're available here to make a sense for the practice as well as the lab are here.

254
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:56,610
The practice problems are here. I will post the solutions and the code after class, or at least by the end of the day as my intention,

255
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:01,530
so that you have them not going to give you an an ahead of class.

256
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:06,450
So if you want to look at them, you can come to class and kind of get the answers.

257
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:11,250
And then here the lab again. I'll give those.

258
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,540
I'll try to remember at the end of Monday, forget. So I'm going to play through my mind.

259
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:19,499
And then also any polls I've already done polls one a would be.

260
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,390
So thank you for doing that. Each week there's going to be a poll with open feedback.

261
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:35,440
So if there's anything that you want me or the GSEs to know, please enter it there and try to take that into account.

262
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:43,040
So it's my first time teaching this class, so I'm probably going to be a little bit of figuring things out how to do this the best way, right?

263
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:48,390
Any feedback is welcome. So that is canvas.

264
00:30:51,200 --> 00:31:04,130
Questions about campus. I am also a prolific person that makes announcements.

265
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:12,800
You've already got the three for me. I like to make lots of announcements just because it helps me make sure that there's no confusion.

266
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:19,880
Oftentimes, I'll get an email from one student saying, I'm confused about this. And I'm like, Oh, no, I have like, there's a typo on the syllabus.

267
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:25,730
Let everyone know about it. So you are getting lots of emails from me that at least you're informed.

268
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:33,709
Okay. So some of my Walmart's, I think, you know, I'm not really concerned about cheating in this class,

269
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:46,130
but it is a policy for everyone saying an honor code statement at the beginning of every homework as well as on the final exam and an honest word.

270
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:51,380
This is to remind you that you are an ethical person that does not want to cheat and does not need to cheat.

271
00:31:52,220 --> 00:32:02,270
I recognize that there can be stressful things going on, but let's work through those rather than taking the easy way out in the course.

272
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,810
It's okay if you have if there will definitely be typos.

273
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:13,570
There have already been plenty of typos, especially on the syllabus. If you find errors.

274
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:22,360
Just let us know and I'll do my best to fix those and probably send you lots of announcements about about them.

275
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,950
Okay. I tend to speak really fast.

276
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:33,130
I'm wearing a mic. Hopefully that helps us to hear, especially with the mask that's covered.

277
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:42,820
Everyone can wear a mask or not as they like, but to make sure that you can hear me when I wear a mask, use the mic as much as possible.

278
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:54,850
There's a lot of you in this Class 85. I will do my best with names, but help me to learn your name and help me correct me if I say it wrong.

279
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:03,699
There is this new like record your name feature in canvas and I think also over access, I find it really helpful.

280
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:11,170
So I recommend you take advantage of that so that I can always double check for myself.

281
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:22,090
You ask questions? So this is our welcome to the class.

282
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,440
We'll take this. It's still early on.

283
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,180
So let's just we'll take our ten minute break.

284
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:34,300
We'll come back and we'll do our SAS practice and we'll probably end up finishing a little bit early today.

285
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,230
But that should give you plenty of time to get through labs for those.

286
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:49,075
So I'll see you back at 144 at eight.

287
00:34:03,982 --> 00:34:14,512
If you have want to follow along and maybe work with small groups will kind of fill out the way to do this as I know that the laptops can be

288
00:34:14,932 --> 00:34:25,612
temptation and attractive and so and you recommend not giving in to temptation to check your email and other stuff and focus while you're here.

289
00:34:26,032 --> 00:34:33,242
So you're. Couple of quick reminders.

290
00:34:35,502 --> 00:34:48,462
Keep in mind, we have SAS files that SAS and SAS data sets which have the bizarre ending of SAS 750 that.

291
00:34:50,562 --> 00:34:58,242
Hopefully we can keep those separate access datasets cannot be opened without US proprietary format.

292
00:34:58,512 --> 00:35:02,141
One of the reasons I generally prefer our because you can kind of have things and see if yes,

293
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:09,072
but SAS is powerful and preferred by a lot of government programs.

294
00:35:09,072 --> 00:35:11,442
And so I think it's helpful for you to have both.

295
00:35:12,372 --> 00:35:20,742
You also need a library statement every time we open SAS so that SAS knows where to look for the stuff that we're working with.

296
00:35:20,772 --> 00:35:25,602
So that will have to be our our first thing. What's the flip statement?

297
00:35:28,062 --> 00:35:34,722
And be a little careful because we're also want to work with temporary data set so that we're not overwriting or permanent data sets,

298
00:35:35,082 --> 00:35:40,152
but we still need to pull those permanent data sets and add saved copies of them as temporary.

299
00:35:40,182 --> 00:35:44,042
So that's some things to kind of keep in mind as we take care.

300
00:35:45,552 --> 00:35:58,122
So you need SAS. How do we get SAS? SAS is available somewhere here through a couple of options.

301
00:35:58,812 --> 00:36:02,442
Here in our readings, you can access the virtual sites.

302
00:36:02,712 --> 00:36:08,472
That's what I'm going to lead us through. If you already know how to do SAS on demand, happy for you to use that as well.

303
00:36:10,232 --> 00:36:17,172
Here's some where this. So the access and virtual sites.

304
00:36:17,472 --> 00:36:21,672
So if any of you were here a year ago, virtual space is very different.

305
00:36:22,602 --> 00:36:29,382
But now we need to access it within this link, which will allow us to log in.

306
00:36:30,402 --> 00:36:38,982
I'm going to have to put in my. Username you're probably want single sign on.

307
00:36:57,952 --> 00:37:04,402
Okay. Cap stocks was among.

308
00:37:08,982 --> 00:37:13,602
So I do take our time to sign here.

309
00:37:19,672 --> 00:37:28,072
It's going to show me this virtual science page where now I have access to lots of different things,

310
00:37:28,552 --> 00:37:31,332
you know, outside, depending on your outside interests.

311
00:37:31,342 --> 00:37:42,802
Maybe you also want access to Adobe Illustrator or AutoCAD that the university is providing a lot of software for your access MATLAB.

312
00:37:44,632 --> 00:37:57,292
And so that's the way I'm going to allow it to access my local resources, which means that I can copy and paste,

313
00:37:58,102 --> 00:38:06,622
which is a convenient thing if I essentially have like a web name that I want to be able to just like not have to remember a long string of stuff

314
00:38:07,432 --> 00:38:16,072
that's helpful and then allow it sometimes takes a second deciding not to hit me and might not work now that you're all watching me do it.

315
00:38:18,712 --> 00:38:22,672
You know, that's my that.

316
00:38:35,102 --> 00:38:39,302
And so while we're waiting for it to connect, hopefully have it.

317
00:38:39,362 --> 00:38:40,532
It's written on your computer.

318
00:38:40,832 --> 00:38:47,912
I'm actually not going to use the virtual sites for our practice because SAS is natively on this computer as it will be on the computers in the labs.

319
00:38:48,602 --> 00:38:55,472
And so although I've asked you to bring your laptops today and maybe you find it more convenient to work on your laptop because everything's there.

320
00:38:55,682 --> 00:39:00,632
You are also welcome to use the labs, the computers in the classrooms.

321
00:39:00,902 --> 00:39:15,622
Why is this happening? This, of course, didn't work in my office earlier today.

322
00:39:15,772 --> 00:39:26,182
And. They have the same problem.

323
00:39:26,302 --> 00:39:30,932
There have been several similar.

324
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:40,582
If you go to the U.S. one Goldman Sachs like from the start menu that worked for me, that's just a remote desktop.

325
00:39:41,152 --> 00:39:59,892
So you're looking at two things. You're looking at 3 to 4.

326
00:40:00,582 --> 00:40:11,332
So actually because it had to be restructured for some reason,

327
00:40:11,722 --> 00:40:28,522
it would be the case that part of the reason for that is related to the interest of things not totally going off the rails.

328
00:40:30,202 --> 00:40:37,971
I'll go ahead and do the practice here on the desktop computer and we will one maybe next.

329
00:40:37,972 --> 00:40:42,492
We'll try SAS on demand and try to make that work. So at least we have multiple reasons.

330
00:40:44,002 --> 00:40:48,232
So you're not able to follow along for long?

331
00:40:48,532 --> 00:40:52,162
Well, at least you can help me not make too many mistakes.

332
00:40:53,092 --> 00:41:01,102
So the goal now is to look at the one practice.

333
00:41:02,032 --> 00:41:09,982
We're going to follow along. This is going to require us to use the SAS practice dataset, which is on canvas under week one.

334
00:41:10,882 --> 00:41:18,142
In this dataset we have each observation corresponding to a single participant, single respondent,

335
00:41:18,682 --> 00:41:26,721
and we're going to review some of the basic SAS functioning using this is the very first thing is

336
00:41:26,722 --> 00:41:32,002
that we need to make sure that we can create our own library and use the basics of the dataset.

337
00:41:32,632 --> 00:41:38,422
The first thing was the very first thing I need to do when I'm working and SAS, which I have for someone.

338
00:41:43,412 --> 00:41:44,912
Give me the name.

339
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:59,012
So I have downloaded this practice here into my downloads so I can distribute this because I struggle with this a little bit earlier and I was like,

340
00:41:59,012 --> 00:42:06,091
I am not sure what the names are, so we'll name here and run.

341
00:42:06,092 --> 00:42:16,022
It has this active library here that shows up as athletics matches and in my library at the 602 and it's just taken from my downloads folder,

342
00:42:16,262 --> 00:42:21,272
which is where I question the data set. Okay.

343
00:42:21,692 --> 00:42:28,171
So now we've opened SAS, we've set up it saved a new SAS program.

344
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:43,052
I have to say that I'm being bad here, so save it to say that it's download SAS practice 2020 316.

345
00:42:48,642 --> 00:42:52,032
We've set up our sets library and it's allowed us to work the data.

346
00:42:56,692 --> 00:42:59,962
Call it something else? I don't think so too, but that's what I called it here.

347
00:43:00,562 --> 00:43:08,272
And in general, we want to be working with a temporary data set rather than editing our permanent data instead.

348
00:43:08,992 --> 00:43:13,522
Because, you know, I don't know about you, but I make a lot of mistakes, especially when working with SAS.

349
00:43:14,302 --> 00:43:22,462
I was like doing the printers earlier today and I was just like, Wow, I'm so bad at this very good company if you're also right away.

350
00:43:23,452 --> 00:43:27,802
But that's part of the practice makes perfect, right? So SAS practice.

351
00:43:27,802 --> 00:43:36,562
So now we're going to create what are the conditions of them. So we're gonna create a temporary dataset using the permanent dataset SAS practice.

352
00:43:38,272 --> 00:43:47,582
So what does that look like? I need a data statement and I want to create this data set.

353
00:43:47,902 --> 00:43:51,472
Going to call it SAS practice because I not imagine it's here.

354
00:43:55,702 --> 00:44:02,781
Where do I need to look to get my satisfaction?

355
00:44:02,782 --> 00:44:06,742
So I set my data from set, permanent data set.

356
00:44:07,342 --> 00:44:19,882
Where is the library where the permanent dataset is and it takes issue exactly how would say search to go to set that.

357
00:44:27,992 --> 00:44:33,362
I'm like capitals kind of person facades, but you don't have to be lowercase.

358
00:44:34,022 --> 00:44:39,241
Okay, so now where is this practice?

359
00:44:39,242 --> 00:44:44,222
The temporary data set and work so I can see it here.

360
00:44:44,252 --> 00:44:48,452
I can open it if I want. And it's kind of good to like check your data.

361
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:56,912
Right? So all of these ID numbers represent different participants they have sorted by sex.

362
00:44:57,422 --> 00:45:02,762
Um, with the choice of serving men and women.

363
00:45:04,792 --> 00:45:14,162
They include non binary options in this dataset where there weren't any one age we have to wait in kilograms.

364
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:20,941
We had centimeters and daily physical activity and mets that are actually even though

365
00:45:20,942 --> 00:45:26,552
what matters is does anyone know about this metabolic equivalent something probably.

366
00:45:28,652 --> 00:45:31,702
There's some murmurs, but not. Yes.

367
00:45:31,712 --> 00:45:36,702
I think you might cut out. I don't know, because it's out of batteries.

368
00:45:36,722 --> 00:45:39,782
I'm just going to have to shower you all the rest of class.

369
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:44,432
Sorry about that. I'll try to get them to get the battery.

370
00:45:44,462 --> 00:45:56,522
So what does Matt stand for? Does anyone know about here?

371
00:45:56,942 --> 00:46:02,002
First lesson and I quit in 2000. Metabolic equivalent of task.

372
00:46:02,012 --> 00:46:07,472
I just googled it. Perfect. Yes, exactly. Because also what I was going to do everything.

373
00:46:08,462 --> 00:46:13,562
The problem was that it's just like Google the answer your phone with our Google the answer.

374
00:46:13,592 --> 00:46:20,612
This is what I do like and have a professional experience and that's right you just Google and the internet is amazing.

375
00:46:20,612 --> 00:46:26,542
Okay. Metabolic equivalent so that we now better understand what our data are even doing.

376
00:46:27,332 --> 00:46:31,772
Okay, so we have our data. It's in work here, it's temporary.

377
00:46:31,772 --> 00:46:38,552
So I can fiddle with it. I can mess it up as much as I want, and I can always rewrite it from the permanent dataset.

378
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:45,782
Great. Okay. So next we're going to use logic and numeric operators and statistical functions.

379
00:46:45,782 --> 00:46:50,822
Okay. So we want to create a new continuous variable BMI.

380
00:46:51,512 --> 00:47:11,312
BMI is a variable that takes into account weight for height and gives us a sense of typically fighting obesity under weight are based on BMI.

381
00:47:11,462 --> 00:47:15,552
It's not a perfect measure, but it is often used and epidemiological control.

382
00:47:16,322 --> 00:47:23,112
So we're going to create a new continuous variable. How do I start doing that?

383
00:47:25,072 --> 00:47:30,202
Instead. That's practice.

384
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:40,352
Set this as practice.

385
00:47:40,352 --> 00:47:50,372
So why are we setting sets practice against. And it's otherwise you're not telling it to be perfect.

386
00:47:50,442 --> 00:47:56,382
So we are getting data from this practice and writing it in this best practice of governance.

387
00:47:57,102 --> 00:48:04,602
Okay. And so we're going to create BMI and we want it to be what did I say?

388
00:48:04,842 --> 00:48:13,392
So that for a second it should be in the KG for per liter squared.

389
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:17,292
It's a little bit careful, though, because the time is measured in centimeters.

390
00:48:24,742 --> 00:48:36,422
So I wait. How am I going to convert centimeters to meters by 108 to square that one?

391
00:48:36,682 --> 00:48:42,742
How do I square something in says to 2x2 asterisks?

392
00:48:43,492 --> 00:48:47,632
Right. And then because I am scared of sast,

393
00:48:47,872 --> 00:48:54,652
I'm going to put a lot of parentheses and is doing things exactly correctly and I'm not going to like mess anything up.

394
00:48:56,032 --> 00:49:03,922
So he's made a run statement. How does this look? Does it look good by missing anything you need to close your data.

395
00:49:04,462 --> 00:49:09,172
To close my data just above.

396
00:49:09,652 --> 00:49:14,452
Yeah. There's the top 1000 things.

397
00:49:14,872 --> 00:49:20,772
I leave the data open. It's going to be crappy, right? Thank you. Okay.

398
00:49:20,812 --> 00:49:29,182
I always like to keep my log because, like I said, I make a lot of mistakes, and it makes, like, red read angry words at me.

399
00:49:29,182 --> 00:49:32,842
If I'm saying I don't see red angry words, it doesn't mean I did it right.

400
00:49:33,082 --> 00:49:37,942
But I didn't have any problems with it. So kind of good to just check.

401
00:49:38,512 --> 00:49:46,282
I had CMI. Great. When I did it earlier today, I forgot to divide by 100 and I was like, wow, this VMA is like .002.

402
00:49:46,912 --> 00:49:53,662
What's going on here? So good to check to make sure that it's just kind of our sanity.

403
00:49:54,172 --> 00:50:00,992
Sanity check here. Okay. So that was our new continuous variable BMI.

404
00:50:01,882 --> 00:50:08,002
Now we're going to create a categorical variable based on control.

405
00:50:09,472 --> 00:50:13,582
So again, in my data, I closed my data.

406
00:50:13,582 --> 00:50:17,442
So I'm not about to make that mistake again.

407
00:50:25,962 --> 00:50:29,992
We're going to call it whatever we want here. I'm just going to call it BMI tab.

408
00:50:32,692 --> 00:50:41,032
But I can't just set my cat because it has different values for different, different things.

409
00:50:41,032 --> 00:50:54,172
So I'm going to say if BMI is less than 20, then BMI, CAS is going to be one.

410
00:50:57,122 --> 00:50:58,952
So let's just go back there for a second.

411
00:50:59,252 --> 00:51:07,402
The calories have to be less than 20 points, between 20 and less than 25, 25, less than 30 and more than equal that there.

412
00:51:09,622 --> 00:51:14,632
Let's go ahead and coat all those in here. Nine.

413
00:51:25,542 --> 00:51:47,092
She's. It means an elevator music as I type here.

414
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:57,442
I want you to play it. Your mind's this large enough to see.

415
00:51:57,452 --> 00:52:01,042
Do I need to try to make it larger? One comes up for.

416
00:52:01,042 --> 00:52:04,242
Okay, we make it larger.

417
00:52:04,262 --> 00:52:17,202
Let's see if I can actually do something like that.

418
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:38,302
I think that's okay.

419
00:52:38,302 --> 00:52:41,302
So I'm going to have to help me make the thought larger.

420
00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:44,992
I thought I remembered how to do it, but I haven't done this recently.

421
00:52:47,932 --> 00:52:53,962
As for making the songwriter that it was under whose options.

422
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:58,071
Yes, it was. That enhanced added.

423
00:52:58,072 --> 00:53:03,502
Certainly. Interesting. Thank you.

424
00:53:04,972 --> 00:53:10,332
That seems better. Thank you for.

425
00:53:15,102 --> 00:53:18,132
If I forget to make it larger, just feel free to let me know.

426
00:53:20,512 --> 00:53:32,382
Yeah, I mean, I really don't, you know, what could I be missing if I just leave it?

427
00:53:32,412 --> 00:53:37,932
I know I need to run statement, but what am I missing? Class of witness against someone else.

428
00:53:37,932 --> 00:53:43,442
If you are the last one, that is an option.

429
00:53:43,452 --> 00:53:48,122
It's not strictly necessary because he has.

430
00:53:54,802 --> 00:53:58,002
This is just technically not needed, but like that is good.

431
00:53:59,172 --> 00:54:07,752
Yeah. When you don't cap your first statement at zero, you're capturing possible like negative infinities, which would be missing value.

432
00:54:07,902 --> 00:54:11,382
Okay, perfect. Yes. So we might have missing values in this dataset.

433
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:21,352
And in fact, there are some. So. And we use our experience as our missing values.

434
00:54:22,312 --> 00:54:30,592
So I'm just going to have to say that this is something you ought to be very careful about.

435
00:54:32,362 --> 00:54:42,742
My instincts are give me and a lot of trouble when I work with missing data and says that just like, oh, I just call it a missing value and it's fine.

436
00:54:42,982 --> 00:54:47,062
But then says it's like, No, no, no. Like, you have not done it correctly.

437
00:54:48,622 --> 00:54:52,311
So yeah, we're going to be fancy.

438
00:54:52,312 --> 00:55:08,862
I'm going to label on it. You think I'm okay?

439
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:17,102
Questions you have to answer that type of. But I think you say it is hopeful.

440
00:55:17,702 --> 00:55:26,162
Otherwise, I think we look good. Let's try running it. They didn't yell at me.

441
00:55:27,422 --> 00:55:37,652
Let's double check here. Oh, well, anyway, all of my things are now missing, so I did something wrong.

442
00:55:38,612 --> 00:55:44,452
I'm not sure I know what it is like for this period, but now it's complete.

443
00:55:48,362 --> 00:55:52,162
I think you could do an F on every statement, you know?

444
00:55:53,082 --> 00:56:02,192
Yeah, yeah. It's my last year.

445
00:56:03,842 --> 00:56:09,742
So I was just saying that right now everything's for.

446
00:56:09,752 --> 00:56:15,901
So yeah, I think it impacts every line that overrides what you had previously.

447
00:56:15,902 --> 00:56:24,442
So I do you know, you have all of those the lines are over 3614 and so they would be for instance,

448
00:56:24,682 --> 00:56:35,722
I mean, I think that is also my instinct, but it is not much to ask the GP to.

449
00:56:39,412 --> 00:56:45,842
Yeah. I mean I wouldn't say the source and who else is.

450
00:56:46,082 --> 00:57:00,342
Yeah, that's correct. I think that all my health is because it's doing the wrong thing to say.

451
00:57:01,382 --> 00:57:12,932
I'm going to do a lot of mistakes at this point that I'm like, I should maybe just like rerun my data from the beginning.

452
00:57:16,552 --> 00:57:25,122
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes.

453
00:57:25,812 --> 00:57:29,502
Thank you, everybody, for contributing to making this work.

454
00:57:30,542 --> 00:57:38,352
So you guys chose to show that like this does take practice to like get a feel for what the problems are.

455
00:57:39,312 --> 00:57:45,092
Okay. So that was creating our categorical BMI table.

456
00:57:45,492 --> 00:57:48,672
Not all that we've only done, like, data manipulation.

457
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,562
Yeah, right. You know, we're already coming up.

458
00:57:52,032 --> 00:57:58,792
So now we're going to see what the dataset looks like moving across the continent so as to get information from today.

459
00:58:03,392 --> 00:58:12,462
And can you help me?

460
00:58:14,682 --> 00:58:17,832
So I think all you have to do is this. Let's find out.

461
00:58:18,202 --> 00:58:25,022
Right. So, um, I run my prop contents.

462
00:58:25,272 --> 00:58:28,392
I set the data to be my temporary data set.

463
00:58:29,142 --> 00:58:34,782
One of the questions I had here. So the first question is how many observations are in the dataset?

464
00:58:35,802 --> 00:58:39,452
What does it say here? It's 500.

465
00:58:39,462 --> 00:58:45,612
So we can see that right here. And I have eight variables, so I've done this correctly.

466
00:58:46,152 --> 00:58:51,032
I was trying earlier, I only had seven, and I was like, What's going on? So it's making sense.

467
00:58:51,342 --> 00:59:01,001
So here we have our seven variables. We have our the variable ID names and the labels associated with them.

468
00:59:01,002 --> 00:59:11,862
So we now have our cat in addition to the native and B and we also have.

469
00:59:13,482 --> 00:59:26,412
So that's all that. Now we're going to do our basic procedures here, starting a crop treatment, which sounds like it should be like a dance.

470
00:59:26,412 --> 00:59:35,742
I don't care what. So the Greek data is practice.

471
00:59:37,902 --> 00:59:46,782
Okay. I'm trying to get some tables out of there. So I think that I have to say tables and I need to put my variables.

472
00:59:46,782 --> 00:59:56,292
What's the first variable that I wanted? And let's say here I'm going to do sex versus the new categorical variable.

473
00:59:57,762 --> 01:00:02,442
So let me just check. Sex is just called sex and BMI cards.

474
01:00:02,472 --> 01:00:12,222
So sex cross the my card from the brain room.

475
01:00:12,222 --> 01:00:16,452
For some reason it's very like Nordic.

476
01:00:18,492 --> 01:00:21,792
You're like, check to make sure that it's correct here.

477
01:00:23,232 --> 01:00:28,122
I did it right. Good. So property here we have our two by two table.

478
01:00:29,532 --> 01:00:33,762
So it's not two by two. It's two by four. Like, you know, the right idea.

479
01:00:34,602 --> 01:00:37,832
So we're gonna try to interpret this as outputs.

480
01:00:38,922 --> 01:00:45,822
So the first question, how many respondents with non missing values are male and what percent?

481
01:00:47,832 --> 01:00:49,852
So how do I look for that?

482
01:00:49,872 --> 01:01:00,612
Well, I know that the data person who wrote the dataset hopefully let me know that they've coded zero as male and one is female.

483
01:01:03,072 --> 01:01:13,332
And I have. So if I look across that margin with zero, I see that I have 344 men compared to 146 women.

484
01:01:15,012 --> 01:01:19,202
I like that. Makes me wonder, you know, about this dataset.

485
01:01:19,212 --> 01:01:23,981
Was it convenient sample? You know, it doesn't sound like it's balanced very well.

486
01:01:23,982 --> 01:01:29,412
So I want to be a little bit careful that it's probably not representative in some way.

487
01:01:30,252 --> 01:01:39,491
So I'm seeing that that imbalance there and looks like 70% of the respondents wrote, well, of course,

488
01:01:39,492 --> 01:01:44,561
this could be just like an old dataset when they were just like, Oh, only men count anyway for health.

489
01:01:44,562 --> 01:01:48,492
Like, that's all care about, you know, obviously very wrong.

490
01:01:51,042 --> 01:01:56,802
So, okay, so what percent are in category four of our BMI?

491
01:01:57,012 --> 01:02:01,962
So we might. So Category four was greater than or equal to a BMI of 30.

492
01:02:03,882 --> 01:02:16,482
And so if I look at my one, two, three, four category here and see that I have 80 folks and the BMI for category or about 16% for non missing values.

493
01:02:19,392 --> 01:02:23,622
So what percent of the total respondents are women in Category three?

494
01:02:24,972 --> 01:02:28,062
So now we need to look at why cross is that looking at women.

495
01:02:28,092 --> 01:02:36,942
So that's the one, category three. And she's not even sure what is going on here.

496
01:02:43,702 --> 01:02:48,022
I see. Okay. So percentage run percentage and column percentage.

497
01:02:48,292 --> 01:02:54,052
So of course, this is one of the things that you get used to as you do SAS more frequently.

498
01:02:54,052 --> 01:03:00,231
But as some, as you know, we're just coming out of today, I have to be like what you've been seeing here as these three numbers.

499
01:03:00,232 --> 01:03:10,372
So if I go back and I Google it or I check my answer key, it lets us know that the first one there's 11%.

500
01:03:10,672 --> 01:03:15,292
That's the cell percentage. So if we take all the cells, add up to 100.

501
01:03:16,012 --> 01:03:25,732
The next one is the row percentage. So if I look at these numbers for this number, 529, 37, 28, does that add up to 100?

502
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:31,822
And finally, the column percentage that so the 73 and this 27 at 100.

503
01:03:32,782 --> 01:03:37,042
But it's not obvious, right? It's not obvious just by looking at the.

504
01:03:38,152 --> 01:03:41,422
So that gives us so 11% as the answer to our practice.

505
01:03:43,412 --> 01:03:47,612
So what percent of female responders are in Category three?

506
01:03:49,732 --> 01:03:58,672
That's our ROE percentage. So of the women in the sample, 37% of them are in Category three.

507
01:03:59,992 --> 01:04:03,352
And finally, what percentage of respondents Category three are women?

508
01:04:04,192 --> 01:04:07,342
Now, that's our call in percentage of the threes.

509
01:04:07,732 --> 01:04:16,362
27% are women. And so we might just say and try to get a sense of why is there an association?

510
01:04:16,372 --> 01:04:24,742
We're not going to test it, but is there an association between BMI and sex in this obviously unrepresentative dataset?

511
01:04:25,222 --> 01:04:27,892
And we can kind of glancing through see that?

512
01:04:28,312 --> 01:04:41,962
You know, we are our percentages aren't that the gender distribution excuse me, sex distribution is not constant over the category.

513
01:04:41,982 --> 01:04:48,982
So we see 73% male and 27% female threes, but about 5050 in the fours.

514
01:04:49,372 --> 01:04:54,382
So that's telling us that there's something going on in terms of an interaction.

515
01:04:57,002 --> 01:05:05,581
Okay. So that was proc freak. Now we're gonna do proc means to get the summary statistics for the continuous BMI.

516
01:05:05,582 --> 01:05:30,302
Very similar. I was just about to like run programs on the whole data set that were probably not ended well for me.

517
01:05:30,752 --> 01:05:35,252
So what do I need to add here? I need to tell it what variable I care about.

518
01:05:43,642 --> 01:05:49,162
I know, read angry letters. And here we have our output.

519
01:05:50,092 --> 01:06:05,692
499 missing stamp values, the mean 26 deviation of 4.2 and the range is 14 to 44.

520
01:06:06,622 --> 01:06:10,182
So that just gives us a sense of looking at that one variable.

521
01:06:10,702 --> 01:06:15,502
We could also be interested in like median or mode, but for an average is going to do means.

522
01:06:17,912 --> 01:06:26,282
Okay. So we're getting a little bit more information out of univariate and we're going to look at the distribution information of the

523
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:37,832
weights variable and we're gonna include the plots option just to give us a little a way to graphically visualize what's going on.

524
01:06:57,302 --> 01:07:02,972
So what I've written here, I forgotten to do one of the things that I said that I wanted to do.

525
01:07:03,332 --> 01:07:10,802
And what is that? You need to have plots as an option.

526
01:07:15,762 --> 01:07:21,162
So here is getting lots of information about the univariate.

527
01:07:21,582 --> 01:07:30,072
The weight variable was I looking for deviation and variance that we can find right here?

528
01:07:30,582 --> 01:07:41,292
Is there deviation of 13 variance of 176 variance should be what's the relationship between standard deviation and variance squared squared?

529
01:07:41,412 --> 01:07:46,902
The variance is always the standard deviation squared and so.

530
01:07:48,072 --> 01:07:52,302
Depending if you're talking about sample or population standardization.

531
01:07:56,052 --> 01:08:01,152
And then we wanted to look at let's get the testing.

532
01:08:01,902 --> 01:08:11,322
We want to look at the plot. So here's here's our distribution and box plot and looks just looking at this like bell shaped.

533
01:08:11,532 --> 01:08:16,752
And if we turn it on its side and what's this plot telling us about.

534
01:08:20,392 --> 01:08:30,352
Nowadays. It's trying to say that, like, if I were to compare to the quantile of the normal distribution to the quintiles of weight kind of match up,

535
01:08:30,742 --> 01:08:38,842
and for the most part it looks fairly straight. So I'm not immediately seeing like, oh, this is definitely not normally distributed.

536
01:08:39,082 --> 01:08:43,852
Of course we want to do some testing on it, but for today we're going to not write on it.

537
01:08:47,552 --> 01:08:52,052
Next we're going to do correlations and ask clustering.

538
01:08:52,592 --> 01:08:57,722
So proc core. So we're trying to find a correlation between waist and height.

539
01:09:17,462 --> 01:09:23,312
So let's do a little exercise and what do we expect to find?

540
01:09:23,612 --> 01:09:31,352
So I think one danger of doing data analysis is that we're just like the code is just telling me what to do and I take a write out what comes out.

541
01:09:31,622 --> 01:09:39,962
But it's really important that you do some thinking about what you expect to see so that when you don't see what you expect,

542
01:09:40,202 --> 01:09:46,442
you have a healthy amount of skepticism that alerts you to a either you made a mistake,

543
01:09:46,772 --> 01:09:52,081
which is often what happens when I'm doing it or that like there's something interesting going on that needs

544
01:09:52,082 --> 01:09:58,832
to be figured out and whether that is in something wrong in the data or it's an actual interesting thing.

545
01:09:59,102 --> 01:10:07,292
So what do we think the correlation between weight and height is going to be as a positive or negative positive?

546
01:10:07,292 --> 01:10:11,222
So probably greater height and greater weight.

547
01:10:11,552 --> 01:10:19,422
How strong is that? A weak, moderate or strong correlation is hearing a lot of strong?

548
01:10:20,042 --> 01:10:25,542
Let's take a look. Okay.

549
01:10:25,542 --> 01:10:32,202
So here is the output for press corps telling me some simple statistics about them.

550
01:10:32,592 --> 01:10:36,312
Here's the correlation coefficient. This is the Pearson correlation coefficient.

551
01:10:37,242 --> 01:10:43,932
So based on the values, not their ranks, the correlation is about 0.56.

552
01:10:44,412 --> 01:10:48,552
It's actually only a moderate correlation.

553
01:10:48,942 --> 01:10:57,522
And so I might say, okay, that's that didn't match with my expectation that it was a strong correlation or what might I do about that?

554
01:11:04,612 --> 01:11:07,342
I mean, I'm not going to do anything in the data because probably it is what it is.

555
01:11:07,612 --> 01:11:12,742
But I might say, oh, I had this assumption that there was a strong correlation between weight and age.

556
01:11:12,982 --> 01:11:19,311
Let me Google what correlations are and I did not do this ahead of time,

557
01:11:19,312 --> 01:11:28,012
so apologies if anything weird comes up, but there's no way in [INAUDIBLE] that's not.

558
01:11:33,572 --> 01:11:36,832
Okay. Um, so. Yeah.

559
01:11:36,842 --> 01:11:42,842
They also say increased. Um, it's not going to kind of go through these here.

560
01:11:43,082 --> 01:11:49,382
Oh, but here's one in and women female students only .3.3 to.

561
01:11:49,952 --> 01:11:55,021
Okay that's actually on the lower end of moderate or high end.

562
01:11:55,022 --> 01:12:03,832
And we kind of condense so I can say, okay, maybe maybe it's not not as strong as they initially guessed.

563
01:12:03,842 --> 01:12:07,322
So good to kind of go back and to think about it.

564
01:12:09,802 --> 01:12:19,312
SJ. APPLAUSE. So I want to do proc uh s g plot to make a plot of total.

565
01:12:19,662 --> 01:12:23,862
So again, that's we said was metabolic level and the task.

566
01:12:24,982 --> 01:12:28,392
Probably we should do a little bit better job understanding what that means.

567
01:12:28,402 --> 01:12:32,752
But for now we're just going to try to understand what it looks like.

568
01:12:32,762 --> 01:12:39,302
So go. The plot.

569
01:12:50,342 --> 01:12:57,092
Double check the name of my variable here, so intimately familiar, but it is just called total math.

570
01:12:57,092 --> 01:13:05,012
So I think my initial guess here was correct and they said I wanted a title total.

571
01:13:05,012 --> 01:13:16,442
That's. Seems like it might be too easy for getting anything done.

572
01:13:16,742 --> 01:13:21,212
Yeah. I'm not sure if he's an equal sign. That's right.

573
01:13:21,242 --> 01:13:26,212
So that's this is this is my art training coming through. I want to, like, set and, like, variable equals.

574
01:13:26,372 --> 01:13:30,452
But no, it's just it's telling me that that's what the bar should be.

575
01:13:30,962 --> 01:13:35,732
But now it's angry at me because I we're not sure.

576
01:13:36,152 --> 01:13:41,702
So this is where I would like to say I'm like, okay, it's giving me some weird vibes.

577
01:13:42,062 --> 01:13:51,812
So but I think that we should go back and like, look what it's supposed to be.

578
01:13:52,652 --> 01:14:02,402
So it's not bar actually, it's supposed to be the box, which, you know, I did this like 2 hours ago and I completely forgot.

579
01:14:05,042 --> 01:14:09,751
So not var, but V box. And what did I want?

580
01:14:09,752 --> 01:14:14,752
I want total net biceps. So I need to add this like a category here.

581
01:14:15,752 --> 01:14:22,262
So I'm checking and it's just so v box not equal, but then category is equal.

582
01:14:22,262 --> 01:14:33,252
So, you know, go figure that. Let's see if this works, if you have to take the equal out of the title.

583
01:14:33,272 --> 01:14:36,902
Okay. Yes. Right. So we have some angry red things.

584
01:14:37,232 --> 01:14:42,272
Again, title is not equal, it's just title. I should have known that it didn't turn blue.

585
01:14:42,362 --> 01:14:45,442
So that's a good indicator. There.

586
01:14:46,352 --> 01:14:51,462
Here. Now we have total. Let's buy sex here.

587
01:14:51,602 --> 01:15:03,122
So, you know, hopefully you have, you know, you know, if this is your dataset that you're working with, you have a sense of like what this you know,

588
01:15:03,122 --> 01:15:12,352
what this looks like, you know, is it makes sense that like there are all these outliers permits for men, but not necessarily women.

589
01:15:12,362 --> 01:15:17,192
What does that mean? So these are all questions that I immediately ask myself as I go on.

590
01:15:17,942 --> 01:15:24,792
So. So that is the end of the practice today.

591
01:15:25,512 --> 01:15:30,552
Thank you all for contributing and making this public, that fun.

592
01:15:30,642 --> 01:15:36,672
You know, we're just like doing data practice. We'll stop here today.

593
01:15:36,702 --> 01:15:39,941
I'll stick around for a couple minutes if there are questions or did not.

594
01:15:39,942 --> 01:15:43,512
Enjoy the lab today for tomorrow.

595
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:44,952
And I'll see you next week.
