1
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:28,560
I don't work for you. Wow.

2
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:50,910
Sometimes I do this. Hmm.

3
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,950
Okay. So the mouse should go for and that for you.

4
00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:04,970
And that's the best that I can do to get you. All right.

5
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,219
Hi, everyone. My name is Lindy. And so they're going to be talking to you guys about a paper we read called Influenza

6
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,890
A Virus Inhibits RSV infection via a two wave expression of private proteins.

7
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,350
So just a little background. I made this comparative chart so we can look at the differences between RSV and influenza viruses.

8
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,270
Namely, they're part of two different families. You'll notice that Influenza A is a segmented virus.

9
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:34,030
It has eight segments. What we learned about RSV is a non segment of virus and they're both envelope viruses,

10
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,970
they're both negative since RNA viruses that makes them part of the class five of our Baltimore classifications.

11
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:46,120
And then right here on this I think this is the fifth row is just the receptors that they use to mediate cell entry.

12
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:51,670
So there's been a lot more research done on RSV and the tropism it has towards a bunch of different receptors.

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,110
So it has the chemokine receptor three heparin sulfate, pretty glycans and nuclei and insulin like growth factor one where as we learned,

14
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,400
influenza A can target Alpha two six linked sialic acids on cells.

15
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,559
RSV is typically referred to as a lower respiratory tract infection, whereas influenza is a upper respiratory tract infection.

16
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,290
However, influenza can spread to the lower respiratory tract and have a really efficient virus there as well.

17
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,589
So RSV and influenza typically circulate during the autumn and winter months with RSV circulating prior to influenza.

18
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:34,490
And as RSV dies out, you'll see influenza kind of ramp up and that's really kind of seen here and there studied.

19
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:41,870
So they did this with hospitalization and hospitalizations and you'll see that typically this black line here is the occurrence of the influenza,

20
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:51,170
however, and Israel is where is Europe. There's an overlap in circulation around the 2016 2017 year.

21
00:02:52,820 --> 00:03:01,940
You'll notice that these lines start to kind of overlap. So the seasons of coastal are lining up and you'll also notice that the RSV percentages

22
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,740
being present in the population have drastically decreased as they go in ZARCO circulation.

23
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,850
So interested to see if there is like an immune response that is specific for this.

24
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:18,170
And thankfully our prior research has already characterized both the innate and adaptive immune responses for both viruses pretty well.

25
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,260
We know this is going to activate the interferon signaling pathway,

26
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,940
which is going to introduce interferon and these proteins, mainly this high fat protein.

27
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,819
So there are four proteins here. I think one is responsible for recognition of viral RNA.

28
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:40,490
And then if it two is going to bind, I think three is this kind of cofactor and this is going to inhibit translation of the viral RNA,

29
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,530
whereas I bit 44, we're not really too sure what's going on there,

30
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,460
but we do know that has a lot to do with immune control and is mainly prevalent

31
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,640
in preventing an overreactive immune response because typically with influenza,

32
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,300
linear response can be so strong that it induces secondary bacterial infections.

33
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,160
So we want to try and control this and we know that I have I-44 is kind of our main route for doing this.

34
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:11,420
So the question of our study posed came down to does influenza a inhibit RSV infection and how is it being done?

35
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:22,170
So we started off with viral surveillance. And like I said, we did this in both non-hospitalized and hospitalized patients.

36
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,210
And once we saw that there was kind of this co-infection going on, we wanted to see what this looked like in cells.

37
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:35,520
Therefore, we started off with the vitro, co-infection and hep two cells, which are an immortalized cell line derived from human larynx carcinoma.

38
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:41,160
And we did this with either an RSV infection and then influenza or influenza, and then RSV.

39
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:48,690
Then we did a quantitative PCR of the SUPERNATANTS at certain time points to determine how much RSV viral RNA was present.

40
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:56,400
Confirmation of decreased RSV viral loads prompted us to move into our in vitro model.

41
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,280
So we did this through biopsy mice,

42
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:07,920
which are typically used in infectious disease gene expression studies because they have a really good immune response, specifically ath2 arm.

43
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,700
So it can help determine like what gene are responsible for this infection.

44
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:19,320
So we did this in this mouse model, very similar to how we did it in the in vitro model.

45
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:25,350
And we saw that when mice were infected, they had this two wave kind of sequence to them.

46
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,900
So our time points for infection were 12 days, ten days, eight, six, three and two, one days.

47
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,200
And then we infected with an RSV virus. After four days,

48
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:42,420
we killed the mice to see RSV presents where you move the lungs and we homogenize this to get all that gross viral stuff out of there.

49
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:48,900
And that's how we quantified it. Once we observed this two protein kind of like presence there,

50
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:55,410
we want to know what proteins were being upregulated to better characterize as to whether that hence we did mass spec

51
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:03,360
to find out which proteins were going to be upregulated between infected mice with influenza versus healthy mice.

52
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:10,050
We narrowed down to four proteins and then we were interested to see the specific MRA expression during influenza infection.

53
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,470
So we did Arti PCR to get the RNA transcripts,

54
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,160
and then we wanted to double check to make sure that these proteins were the ones that

55
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,500
are responsible for this protection being observed with a decrease in RSV replication.

56
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,580
So we wanted to knockdown in our in vitro model and fact help to cells.

57
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:35,220
And then once we saw that, once you knock down these proteins, increased RSV transcripts, we said, okay, well let's overexpress these proteins.

58
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,210
If we overexpress the proteins that we should have better control of this virus. And we did that.

59
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,090
So here are our results kind of going through that just again.

60
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,820
So here we see that when we have this coinfection going on,

61
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:57,840
there is a decreased amount of RSV compared to just RSV transcripts alone in our cell model.

62
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:06,120
And then when we do this infection in mice. So here it's kind of like that layout.

63
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:12,120
So we had mice that we impacted on day 12 might be infected on day ten, eight, six, three, two, one.

64
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:19,320
And we let the replicate for those holidays. Then we kind of just like estimated the time what zero and that may affect them all with RSV.

65
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:24,780
So could the amount of potentially influenza from day 12 still inhibit just our used RSV infection?

66
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:33,330
You'll see that we did influenza recruit answers on those, but there has been increased influenza, but there's really no RSV transcripts.

67
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:38,160
So we're like, okay, well something interesting is going on here. So this counted as wave one.

68
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,050
You'll notice here there's also a dip in RSV transcripts again,

69
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,500
but there's no presence of influenza, so maybe there just wasn't detectable enough influenza.

70
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:54,540
So we thought, okay, well as you going on here, this one right here is our second wave.

71
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,549
So from that, here is our mass data. So you can't see it right down here.

72
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:06,480
It's just like the healthy persons is like the juxtaposition and to see what proteins are being upregulated during this influenza infection,

73
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:14,010
and that's potentially guard protection. All right.

74
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,940
Here are the transcripts for the individual proteins.

75
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:24,459
So you'll see that each member of the offset and the order of I for for family follow

76
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,090
kind of like this dual modality that was observed in the influenza infection.

77
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:36,750
So we see there's an increase in their transcripts days 1 to 3 a decrease and then

78
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,569
increased again signifying the second wave and that was present in all of them.

79
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,380
So we were pretty happy to see that because it kind of matches up with the literature what we see previously.

80
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,810
So this brings me to our overexpression and kind of knockdowns.

81
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,500
So we did this through a winter viral vector.

82
00:08:54,370 --> 00:09:00,790
So basically we're just able to carry a single hairpin RNA with prior sequences for the specific proteins.

83
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,620
It was transduced into the cells.

84
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:08,740
What they would provide since are basically all the cells that were unable to transduced this event were selected against.

85
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:19,329
And when we knock down, we notice that after a given infection and the normal person, obviously RSV is going to increase drastically.

86
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:24,370
So we knocked out all lines with the knocked out of that protein.

87
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:31,150
We're susceptible to infection when we do overexpression, which we confirmed with.

88
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:40,080
PCR, but now we can find a blockbuster in box two because then we give over expression here again.

89
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,600
And just like a normal RSV infection, when we overexpress these proteins, we see that is decreases of the ability.

90
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:53,100
So if we over use these, they're really more effective in delaying RSV replication.

91
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:02,170
So limitations. So the population selected for the study included NASOPHARYNGEAL samples from influenza

92
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,570
positive cases and RSV positive cases among hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients.

93
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:16,300
So if a patient isn't hospitalized for a mild case, they're likely not counted in this if they had no access to any kind of testing.

94
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,310
And this is really based off of like influenza, like illness symptoms.

95
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,800
So I think that's a really broad characterization for how we were picking people to be in the study.

96
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:34,299
So maybe it's not 100% accurate since maybe some cases aren't influenza and they

97
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:39,210
could be something else that were accounting for additional population is in Israel,

98
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,750
not here in the U.S. So it's not really generalizable to our U.S. population.

99
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,690
I'm actually not too sure what our influenza and RSV situation is,

100
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:51,759
but maybe we can use this information for us a little more and kind of figure out how we can

101
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,110
protect those with immune responses who are weakened or more susceptible to RSV or influenza.

102
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:06,250
I find it strange that during that second wave we couldn't find anything in the transcripts, but we still observed a decrease in RSV copies,

103
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:12,760
so more work needs to be done regarding timing, influenza infection and effects in the ICU pathway and what controls that system.

104
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:16,450
Additionally, every time we use cell lines, I'm really weary.

105
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,399
I remember a class that I took an undergrad always said to be very using cell

106
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,770
lines because about 20 to 36% of cell lines are contaminated or misidentified.

107
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:34,690
Sorry. And most of the time they're terminated with the HeLa cell line because they're like really known for mass production proliferation.

108
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:40,960
So oftentimes, two cell lines, as well as I.A. for seven cell lines are actually contaminated.

109
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:46,750
And then additionally, we only used Influenza A in this experiment for our mouse models.

110
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,260
Now, we were looking at the preliminary viral surveillance data.

111
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:55,509
It's not one subtype influenza that circulating around Israel for all of these seasons.

112
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,770
It's multiple different subtypes circulating, including influenza A and involuntary.

113
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:04,960
So we just chose Influenza A because we weren't seeing much of a difference in terms of RSV cases.

114
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:11,260
However, I still think it'd be good to kind of pick either like a specific subtype and see if that has any impact.

115
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:19,030
It kind of brought me back to our talk on like influenza printing and stuff like that, and I want to see if that has some kind of incorporation here.

116
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,750
And then lastly, the conclusions.

117
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:33,400
So we found that RSV and influenza overlap during 2016 and 2020 and that infection with influenza provides resistance of subsequent RSV infections.

118
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,830
In terms of severity, it doesn't prevent infection.

119
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:41,980
Influenza does this through upregulation of the antiviral interferon stimulating pathway through a two wave modality.

120
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:47,080
The two waves are denoted as days one through three and wave two or days 310.

121
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,890
And we know that it does this through upregulation of the growth IT protein families.

122
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,680
One thing that I think I'm really interested in for our future direction is infection order.

123
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:04,840
So on my first figure, we saw that we had RSV and then influenza and then we didn't want to.

124
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,130
And then RSV balloons were the exact same. So there is kind of a difference and one that I've actually seen occur.

125
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:16,030
So I'm interested to see does it matter which infection occurs first for recurrent

126
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:23,560
infections and then does the timing of that infection in that order impact future outcomes?

127
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,490
So yeah, that's where we're headed next. Thank you.

128
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:37,110
Any questions? Questions from the audience.

129
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:49,600
Question. I was just interested in your comment about being wary about using cell lines.

130
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,050
Mm hmm. And what do you think would have been a better model?

131
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,520
I know you didn't like the obviously lines. Yeah.

132
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:01,330
Yeah. I think it's really hard to kind of consider what's going to be a good in vivo model

133
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:06,490
because cell lines are kind of like our gold standard for in vitro infections.

134
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:18,940
I'm trying to think would be good. I don't think there's any other way to do it, just to, like, kind of see how the infection renders.

135
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:24,160
Do you have any ideas on like other kind of human respiratory epithelial cells,

136
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:29,950
systems like airway systems that potentially could be used for something like that?

137
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:35,590
Yeah, I just know that like this guy, this is really kind of like what we do.

138
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,710
And also cells are just so finicky. They're so hard to keep alive.

139
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,430
Have you ever had to work in a cell lab?

140
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,459
Just like the amount of time you have to feed them or like, make sure you don't, like, kill them by taking all their airway there.

141
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:52,720
So dramatic. So, yeah, I mean, if we could find an alternative system for cells, I'd be sickening, but they're really necessary.

142
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:59,470
Well, you answered my question is, has this extend to other combinations of viruses?

143
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,780
And, um. Perfect.

144
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,950
Do you think you can do it yourself? Sure.

145
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:15,819
So everybody stick around. Thank you. No, this is actually a okay.

146
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,970
So I'm going to like I warned you that this is one of my favorite. Oh, you're good.

147
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,850
So this is actually it's causing a lot of controversy right now because.

148
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:37,399
Let's see. Okay. So, you know, here we we actually have, you know, some years we have a lot of years for influence in our sphere circulating.

149
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,740
Some years we have years where they don't.

150
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:49,709
So this theory of viral interference began with some early observations that there was never about influenza in a better sphere,

151
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:55,670
that you had to kind of course, like we do with all virology, we like disprove that in a few years after that theory was created.

152
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:06,350
But, you know, we have not yet had a bad SARS-CoV-2 year at the same time as a bad other respiratory virus here.

153
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,390
And so this is coming up all the time.

154
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:17,450
Is this question is are we seeing is it that in some communities, SARS-CoV-2 rates are so high that it prevents the other viruses from taking hold?

155
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,950
And it's both a cellular question, right.

156
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:28,610
You know, is there innate immunity that's happening that's presenting issue blocking for the second set of viruses?

157
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,100
But it's also a host issue, right. If you're hearing that, oh, there's so much SARS-CoV-2 in the community,

158
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:40,159
are you going to change your your host behavior or your masking behavior or your distancing behavior?

159
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,660
And so it's interesting. There's there's definitely two camps.

160
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:53,600
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, just a couple of days back they said that the RSV case students then you know guard increasing.

161
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:58,580
Mm. There's a lot of higher numbers as compared to and earlier.

162
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:08,930
Yeah. Do you think that you would be you know this season that the surge so interestingly so it's increasing here too.

163
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:18,680
Yeah and and it's increasing here out of season like this is way early but it's the same as last year.

164
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:26,150
So last year at this time we had an increase also. So it matches last year which is really interesting like maybe a new seasonality has developed.

165
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,660
So there's it's it's hypothesized the RSV seasonality is partially driven by RSV.

166
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,700
Immunity wanes really fast. And so when it wanes off, then all the kids become susceptible.

167
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,120
Then you have all these new babies coming into the population and infecting people.

168
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:53,690
And so perhaps we've like shifted the dynamics. Ah, but influenza was later, it was like a spring summer virus, which is really happen now after 2009.

169
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:58,879
Influenza also did that weird shift the year after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

170
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:07,550
There was a bunch of weird patterns, but then in a year or two, influenza reset on the regular pattern with the southern hemisphere,

171
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,780
you know, followed by the Northern Hemisphere and having that kind of circular pattern.

172
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,520
So it's it's the Wild West, but nobody knows. It's complete question.

173
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,630
But I have, you know,

174
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:25,970
I don't know how many people like think that it's think that it's possible that one viral wave can push out the other viral rave.

175
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:34,760
Like how many people think. I am not sold yet, but I am still watching.

176
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,640
It seems like a lot. I mean, you need a lot of people.

177
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:45,350
Exposed to both to have this immune blocking effect, to actually shift the curve in a whole population.

178
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:59,360
But it's isn't I mean, but it is true that, you know, it's not these we are for sure not having the kind of circulation we tend to see.

179
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,600
Right. HIV.

180
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,590
All right. So I want you to just start before we talk about the papers.

181
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:24,720
Just a few lecture points about you won't take very long.

182
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:30,930
So first important some important terminology.

183
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:35,190
HIV is the virus that causes immunodeficiency.

184
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:42,630
AIDS is the advanced syndrome in someone living with HIV and AIDS.

185
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,420
It is a syndrome that includes a multitude of conditions, and it doesn't look the same for every person.

186
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:55,709
And so we try not to refer to AIDS as a thing or as a disease, because it's actually a syndromic definition.

187
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:59,790
That cover encompasses a variety of experiences, other things.

188
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,570
Terminology wise. I wanted to present, as you know, the Auerbach paper,

189
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:11,190
because it is really the first paper that sort of talks about evidence about

190
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:17,370
whether or not there was an infectious etiology to AIDS defining conditions.

191
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:22,140
It uses terminology that we don't use anymore. Like, for instance, AIDS patients,

192
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:30,220
we tend to refer to people as people living with a disease rather than characterizing their identity by the having of that disease.

193
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,100
So I'm trying to be mindful of that as we discuss later today.

194
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:44,340
So AIDS was first recognized through a rise in operative optimistic infections.

195
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:50,370
So it's important to remember that the conditions were noted before the virus was discovered.

196
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,730
This was namely recognition of increasing rates of Kaposi sarcoma, SARS.

197
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,580
Kaposi sarcoma was a very, very rare type of cancer.

198
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,480
And as that started being recognized in more people, it was particularly among men who have sex with men.

199
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:12,330
It was started starting to kind of emerge as a potential question.

200
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:20,190
So there was this race to identify the whatever whatever this infectious etiology was.

201
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:26,130
There were actually three independent discoveries of HIV.

202
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:31,110
These three here, one Institut Pasteur, one H, one in San Francisco.

203
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:34,410
They were actually named three different things.

204
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,640
So for a while, they had to figure out what it was going to be called,

205
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:47,730
called because three different people claimed to having discovered a larvae was discovered at the Pasteur Institute.

206
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:55,950
Once it was discovered there, they had actually contamination events in the cells where they had been isolating

207
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:02,280
HIV and had a virulent strain of that had leaked into other cells into as well.

208
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,940
I mean, here's the example that led you to think about how difficult cell lines are to work with.

209
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:11,430
So they actually had a cell cross cell line content contamination with some virulent strains of HIV.

210
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:20,820
After their initial isolation of larvae. Those cell lines were actually sent to the NIH to support the NIH as viral work.

211
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:27,420
So this HDL b three that the NIH discovered is actually just the lab that Institut Pasteur emailed them.

212
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,690
So two is really two independent discoveries.

213
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:41,700
But it was at the time that to be three independent discoveries RV The RV isolation in San Francisco was truly independent of the lab and HCV three.

214
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,760
So at the time that this is announced,

215
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:52,500
the Health and Human Services Secretary in the United States says this vaccine is going to be available in two years.

216
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:56,910
So it is now currently 2023.

217
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:04,410
Throughout my entire career, I've always heard that the AIDS vaccine is five, maybe ten years away.

218
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:11,760
And I've heard that after 25 years. So yeah, we're still working on it.

219
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:24,010
So, all right, I'm going to, you know, so we're going to talk about a little just a little bit of basics about HIV, the virus itself.

220
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:31,469
Today, we're going to get more into antivirals and prep prophylactic therapy later in the semester

221
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,670
when we talk more about antivirals as a whole and the antiretrovirals in this case.

222
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:40,229
But one thing I wanted to point out, and this is all about all of a graph,

223
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:48,240
it's 2015, but these are color coded by adult HIV prevalence around the world.

224
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:51,490
Now, the color coding is not a linear scale.

225
00:23:51,510 --> 00:24:01,230
If you see, you know, Europe in Orange is 0.4, Americas in like that, burnt orange color is 0.5 and Africa is 4.4.

226
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:10,260
It doesn't kind of quite, I think, communicate the stark disparities in prevalence by region.

227
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:18,299
But I also want to kind of emphasize the fact that there's there are also very stark

228
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:24,510
disparity disparities in who is infected versus who is dying from AIDS related syndromes.

229
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:35,610
So. Death, adult and child death by W.H.O. region can see very, very clearly here that the patterning doesn't reflect the patterning of infection.

230
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:41,730
So who is where AIDS mortality is happening and where HIV infection is happening?

231
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:47,970
Those two things don't correlate. So keep that in mind, especially when we get into treatment and prevention later in this semester.

232
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:56,690
So an incredible, incredible amount is known about HIV because of that, the search for a vaccine.

233
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:04,190
You know, it's one of the viruses that we know really the most about. It's a lentivirus.

234
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:09,110
It's very closely related to HIV, which is a related virus in the animal kingdom.

235
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:14,090
There are two types, one and two. There's a lot of different subtypes.

236
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,720
Most HIV is HIV subtype.

237
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:25,220
And then underneath there, there are some subtypes that vary by vary across the world.

238
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:33,860
Here in North America, we tend to have a lot of subtype B, but that's not the subtype that we tend to see in sub-Saharan Africa.

239
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:40,010
And so, as you know, you watch different news about vaccines move forward.

240
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:49,040
We have to pay attention to are the vaccine targets and are the viruses they are intended to target set up in a way that's equitable?

241
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:56,600
So HIV uses an RNA dependent DNA polymerase.

242
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:03,230
So going back to what we talked about, how we sort of talk about viruses in their lifecycle, single stranded RNA,

243
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:10,100
that becomes single strand of DNA that then becomes the double stranded DNA in the process

244
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:17,960
and then produces positive sense RNA transcripts that then go on and go into new variants.

245
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,580
So in doing this, it sort of has the benefit of both worlds.

246
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:32,290
You've got the you've got a high error rate because of the DNA dependency and RNA dependent DNA flourishes.

247
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,040
You've got this RNA precursor.

248
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:40,670
You've got a very high error rate of the rise, which means the virus has a lot of evolutionary space that it's able to cover.

249
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,660
It has a very fast molecular clock ticking, undergoes a lot of change.

250
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:53,810
However, the downside for RNA viruses is typically that RNA has this lower level of stability and they're very easy to destroy.

251
00:26:54,170 --> 00:27:01,340
But because there's a DNA intermediate and that DNA the intermediate can integrate into the cell and have a very

252
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:09,980
strong latency construct and actually has the stability of a DNA virus with the changeability of an RNA virus.

253
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,990
So one of the reasons it's such a such a difficult virus to to keep on top of.

254
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:27,170
So here's a picture of the the virion here and the gene expression here.

255
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,780
Gab, pull and under the envelope you'll see kind of coded in here.

256
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:41,900
Those are major functional, functional proteins in the virion.

257
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:48,980
And a lot of the function of the virion is sort of made by you have to have a lot of splicing events to make the proteins that are needed.

258
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:58,790
The lifecycle of HIV includes there's a binding or attachment based attachment entry.

259
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,630
You have a reverse transcriptase phase that occurs in the cytoplasm.

260
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:08,840
The DNA, once produced through reverse transcriptase, is then then going to enter into the nucleus.

261
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:17,030
And then there's an integration step where it goes into the the cell's nucleus right there.

262
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:27,979
Just as you can see it integrating right there for phase two.

263
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:35,000
Then you've basically got the cell creating new virus through that.

264
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:43,610
So they create a pro virus. That pro virus is then going to create new genomes for new variants that get released.

265
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,470
We're going to come back to this figure when we do antivirals, because you see, it's marked here,

266
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:53,360
you know, all of the different ways that we try to block replication through antiretrovirals.

267
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:07,220
Now, understanding attachment is a major part of trying to understand why we do or do not have a vaccine for HIV, for attachment.

268
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:18,350
Notice that there's both the attachment to the main receptor, but HIV also requires a CO receptor.

269
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:24,710
And so it's both the the viruses attached here, but there also needs to be this CO receptor here.

270
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:38,120
It's a chemokine chorus after it's often CCR five, CCR four, and that's required to initiate the virus also infection or fusion event.

271
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,840
That's going to happen.

272
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:50,360
Interestingly, the only quote cured case so far has been a guy with leukemia who had a bone marrow transplant with a CCR five mutation.

273
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,200
So there have been there have also been additional cases of people who are

274
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:00,560
exposed but not fully effect infected because they have a CCR five mutation.

275
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:18,660
And so this CO receptor process cannot continue. So one of the big challenges for treating HIV is a kind of come down to the next four years.

276
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:25,610
Well, first, just sort of the life cycle of once infection happens.

277
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:35,459
So if you've got viral load because CD4 says, I got an acute infection right here and you've got HIV, RNA right here.

278
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,900
So the initial viral load,

279
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:46,080
so the initial primary infection and then you've got kind of the cycling over many years and then you have the advanced stages,

280
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,950
rapid increase in viral. From there, there's a steady decline of CD4 T cells throughout time.

281
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:01,020
CD8 T cells tend to remain fairly consistent during the persistent stay, but then decline in the advanced stages.

282
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:10,250
So one of the challenges when you're delivering therapy is that it's a two stage process.

283
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:18,059
You've got this initial initial infection that you can clear fits in the blood compartment here.

284
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:24,180
So here you can see the time towards generation and infection, kind of the infectious cycle occurring in the blood department.

285
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:32,040
But then in other compartments, the half life of the virus, the virus infected cells in these compartments are much, much longer.

286
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,340
The half life is 145 days for those.

287
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:43,170
So the challenge of clearing virus out of these latently infected compartments is a big challenge.

288
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:54,450
One of the things that HIV does when it infects people is the infected macrophages and c4t cells express cytokines,

289
00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:02,040
and then these cytokines enhance the proliferation and upregulation of creation of new cells.

290
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,310
The cell proliferation can happen b cells can have the endothelial cells or epithelial cells,

291
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:14,640
then leads to the cancers that we often see as age defining conditions.

292
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:21,630
So you can see these cells here leading to lymphoma and Ophelia's cell upregulation

293
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:27,390
leading to Kaposi sarcoma and then general carcinomas here from epithelial cells.

294
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:32,790
And oftentimes there's a viral cofactor that is up regulating it as well.

295
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:40,950
So Epstein-Barr virus, some of the human herpes viruses, HIV AIDS and human papillomavirus as well.

296
00:32:43,060 --> 00:33:01,180
So here in the first paper that you're going to discuss from today's I throw out the questions is a the Auerbach paper I think as be used to just talk

297
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:11,350
through that that stuff with in the Nikkei article about the history the history of patient zero how many people have ever read in the band played on.

298
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:19,470
So interesting. So, like, there are certain questions I ask the class to sort of watch how patterns change over time.

299
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,510
Well, I usually ask this later on. Think about how I have had chickenpox.

300
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:31,559
You actually don't have to talk about how I have to disclose health insurance.

301
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:36,900
It's interesting to see the number of people who've had taken back sort of it seems as though over time as well.

302
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:48,150
So in the being played out at the time, in the in the late nineties, early 2000, it was it was a very formative book.

303
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:53,129
I mean, it was the it was the story of the beginning of AIDS.

304
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,310
The United States actually, when I started at U of M as a freshman,

305
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:01,290
that was the freshman that was the recommended reading for the freshman class that year.

306
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:07,590
And it for me, it was a very influential book. I mean, it really got me interested in studying virology.

307
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:17,760
Now, looking back on it, so problematic and so it's interesting to see.

308
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,680
I mean, that story had incredible power. There's a movie I had the VHS tape of the movie somewhere.

309
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:30,239
There's a movie that goes with the book. You just and yes, I had it.

310
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:40,319
I had a VHS player in my dorm room. We would watch a terribly destructive movie and the band played on it and we taped a lot of X-Files episodes.

311
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:48,510
We had them all, but I so so maybe it was it was incredibly powerful.

312
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:53,309
And then you take that book and you lay it out and we'll talk about this more when you talk about retroviruses as well.

313
00:34:53,310 --> 00:35:02,760
But you layered on a political system that was not I mean, Reagan didn't even say the word HIV or AIDS until something like 50,000 people had died.

314
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,650
I mean, this was a system that was very much dedicated to avoiding the topic.

315
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:14,250
So very, very it's really fascinating how this all kind of evolved.

316
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:21,569
I think that, you know, so I used to sort of included as sort of an interesting side note to the history of HIV.

317
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:30,240
But I actually think that it's incredibly impactful to understand what happens as we kind of go forward with more virus emergencies,

318
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:35,520
like we're in a kind of a climate, in a population situation where we only have new viruses keep coming.

319
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,810
And so we kind of see the history of the mistakes we've made in the past.

320
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:49,230
We can think about this as we go forward in terms of how we what we do in terms of like this kind of shiny away from patient zero.

321
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:53,100
I noticed in the the paper,

322
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:59,850
the McKay narrative I actually have is his dissertation got published into a book to have a copy that I was going to bring out.

323
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:05,129
And I totally forgot maybe everything I said, but that William Darrow was talking about.

324
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:08,820
He never so remember that the zero.

325
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:14,280
So this is the origin story of the term patient zero that we hear all over epidemiology.

326
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:20,580
Now, is this stat right here? And William Darrow maintains that he met this man outside of California.

327
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,240
Oh, instead of zero. I have to say,

328
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,640
I have stared at this paper for years and I am convinced that this is typeset a

329
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:36,690
zero in novel that like patient oh is patient typed as patient zero in this paper.

330
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:40,620
But they CDC maintain CDC staff maintains that that was not their intent.

331
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,830
This was one patient four outside of California.

332
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:51,720
But it really like they took on the term took on the cachet in the shininess of patient zero because of Randy Schultz's work,

333
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:56,280
because of the band played on. And we're working from that.

334
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:09,720
So with that, you know, and that sort of led to this paper right here by Worby Hall in 2016 that reevaluated in a fascinating way.

335
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:19,469
I am fascinated by the way that Mike incorporated both the medical history literature by working with Mike,

336
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,880
but then also molecular virology and doing the second piece.

337
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:34,470
So with that, I'm going to stop talking and throw up the workshop questions and have you have a discussion of these two papers.

338
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:42,350
These are thoughts or comments, I promise that. The stuff that.
