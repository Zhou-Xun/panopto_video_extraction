1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,000
Okay. So I'll go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,100
How's everybody doing today? She's awake.

3
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:27,090
Here is good. Um, I know some people have been coming down with colds and things and are watching the lectures at home, which is totally fine.

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:37,030
But it's great to have people here, too. I have not heard any issues in terms of people taking the exam or any mechanism.

5
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,320
I think any mechanistic issues in terms of the campus side or taking the exams.

6
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:50,120
It seems like that's going well. Um, so just a reminder, you probably don't need the reminder, but it's going to close on Monday.

7
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:56,890
So you have the rest of this week and then over the weekend and then again it's open.

8
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,000
Once it's open, it's open for 24 hours. And.

9
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,960
Yeah. So any questions as far as that goes?

10
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,210
Cool. And the problem said solutions are posted.

11
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:19,090
Now, if anyone wants to look into those and kind of just see, you know, the explanations for the problems, hopefully all of it made sense.

12
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,380
If there's anything you have questions about. Door is always open.

13
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,219
Figuratively in terms of office hours.

14
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,070
Or setting up an alternate meeting time. So. Okay.

15
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:42,300
Cool. Um, so so far in the class, we've talked about things like dose response, toxic kinetics.

16
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,879
We've dived in a little bit into carcinogenesis.

17
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,010
So like toxic effects from chemical exposures.

18
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,389
Dr. Goodrich gave us this nice lecture on occupational toxicology.

19
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,879
So that was like a good example of how we can apply the science of toxicology and what we

20
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,960
know about mechanisms of toxicity in a situation like occupational health studies and like,

21
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,290
you know, with the goal of protecting the health of workers.

22
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:20,610
Right. So I think now is a good time to kind of take a minute or take a lecture to talk about the mechanisms of toxicity.

23
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,499
And we've talked a little bit about some of this,

24
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:29,250
but I want to kind of formalize the way we're thinking about how a chemical really does the damage that it can do,

25
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:38,760
how a toxic thing can do damage to a cell, to a tissue, and ultimately to like of someone's, you know, overall health or to to the body.

26
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,140
Right. So I think this is a good time.

27
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,970
You might have noticed I move this lecture up a little bit in the schedule because I think it makes sense to talk about it now.

28
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,510
So we've gotten we've talked about some of these really important aspects like dose response and toxic kinetics.

29
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:02,100
But now we can talk about like what's actually happening, happening at the level of a molecule or the level of a cell for this, you know,

30
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:10,410
we're not going to able to cover every last mechanism, but we can really hit some of the main mechanisms by which chemicals can cause damage to cells.

31
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,150
So that's what we'll be talking about today.

32
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:23,160
So when we think about how a toxicant can cause damage, there's a few things that we need to sort of consider.

33
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:32,010
And a lot of what we've talked about so far in the class is kind of talk about how intoxicated can be delivered to various parts of the body.

34
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,530
And this is a key component, right?

35
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:40,229
So toxic it if it's going to cause damage to the liver, it needs to be delivered to the liver to cause damage to liver cells.

36
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:49,980
Right. It's fairly intuitive. So and if but you've seen that like there's a lot to consider in terms of the absorption of the chemical,

37
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,819
uh, the metabolism of the chemical, the excretion of the chemical.

38
00:03:53,820 --> 00:04:02,400
All of these play a role in terms of allowing us to understand how a chemical is ultimately delivered to the site of toxic damage.

39
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:10,419
So after it's delivered, though, to the cell, it's you know, we're going to think about it.

40
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:17,930
Toxicant needs to interact with a target molecule. And so that could be in a number of different ways that a number of different

41
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:24,379
types of molecules in Carcinogenesis we talked about DNA damage damaging the DNA,

42
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,990
right? So that's a chemical interacting with the DNA in the nucleus, causing some kind of change to the DNA,

43
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:35,000
which can ultimately lead to the development of a tumor in Carcinogenesis.

44
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:41,420
Another thing that we can think about is how a chemical, certain types of chemicals we talk about education, disrupters.

45
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:49,640
A lot of those will interact with the the hormone receptor that is expressed in a cell, either in the cytoplasm or on the surface of a cell.

46
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:59,209
So that's a protein that the cell expresses. The chemical either can bind to that receptor and activate these hormone signaling pathways,

47
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:05,090
sort of apparently when they're essentially like not supposed to be activated or we have cases where

48
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:11,150
chemicals can bind to a receptor and essentially turn the receptor off or block it up so that they act.

49
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,890
So the endogenous signaling that's supposed to be taking place is not able to happen.

50
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:22,040
So that's called antagonism. And agonism is when a chemical binds to receptor and activates it.

51
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,950
So those are two pretty good examples of how a chemical can interact with a target molecule.

52
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:36,650
There's lots of others as well. Chemicals can interact with, say, proteins that are expressed in the cell, other types of proteins, not receptors.

53
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:44,360
They could interact with lipids in the cell. So there's different ways that chemicals can interact with the ultimate target molecule.

54
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:51,409
And something that's a little bit challenging is there's not always one target molecule that a chemical seems to interact with.

55
00:05:51,410 --> 00:06:03,670
There could be multiple molecular targets. Another thing to think about is a toxicant can alter the biological environment or what we sometimes call

56
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:09,700
the microenvironment that a cell is existing in or that the tissue that the tissue microenvironment.

57
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:21,730
And so we might think of something like in the case of endocrine disruption, a chemical suppressing the ability of the testes to make testosterone.

58
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,819
And so what you have there in that case is the cells within the testes that

59
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,930
normally are used to seeing a certain amount of testosterone in their environment,

60
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,399
are kind of not experiencing the same levels of testosterone.

61
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:43,809
And so are going to potentially divide or differentiate in a different way that could lead to our development of the testings.

62
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:47,590
For example, you can think of other examples as well.

63
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:58,569
But so this is another way that a toxicant can impact the sort of the micro environment that a cell or a tissue, the color of the tissues.

64
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:07,440
Microenvironment Right. And so ultimately, when we consider something to be like a toxic effect,

65
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:12,600
this is going to produce some kind of cellular dysfunction or some kind of injury in the organism.

66
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:24,240
And what we can also see in these cases is inappropriate repair and adaptation as part of the response to the toxicant as well.

67
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,649
So for example,

68
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:36,000
if a chemical is inducing some kind of damage in the liver and an individual is exposed to this chemical chronically over and over again,

69
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:44,309
you may start to see kind of repair processes start to essentially like break

70
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,330
down or disrupt the function of the liver or look at inappropriate repair.

71
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,970
Sometimes this happens with DNA where we're not able to repair our DNA with the same fidelity,

72
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:02,490
you know, so we'll get interruptions in terms of the code of the order of the base pairs in the DNA.

73
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:09,840
Right. So we can have these and these adaptive or repair mechanisms, but those don't always work with 100% sort of efficiency.

74
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:18,870
So that can be part of the toxic response as well. So both of these steps of three and four are what we would consider the toxicity, you know,

75
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:24,780
getting some kind of cellular dysfunction injury or this inappropriate repair or adaptation.

76
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:34,560
That makes sense. So let's kind of march through this and we'll have some examples here of each of these.

77
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:41,599
So when we think about the step one of toxicant delivery,

78
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:49,220
we've already talked about this like a good amount in terms of this absorption toxic kinetic stuff that we've covered so far in the class.

79
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:55,880
So but it probably bears, you know, kind of just kind of putting it all together a little bit.

80
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:04,340
So the toxicant, you know, we're going to be exposed to a toxicant at some place on the body that we've talked about so far.

81
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:11,920
So like either skin absorption GI tract, absorption respiratory tract, this could actually even come with an injection or a bite.

82
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:19,430
In the case of a toxin delivered by an antibiotic like a poisonous animal, um, chemicals can be delivered to the placenta.

83
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:27,350
So there's a lot of different ways that we can, you know, a lot of the, a lot of exposure sites that we can think about in terms of toxicant delivery.

84
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:32,990
And so what has to happen is the toxicant needs to be delivered to the target molecule.

85
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:40,550
And you'll see up here we're talking about the toxicant. And down here, we call it we're using the term ultimate toxicant.

86
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:49,490
And what that's capturing is the fact that the chemical that we're initially exposed to isn't always what we consider the ultimate toxicant.

87
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,169
Oftentimes, we're metabolizing the toxicant that we're exposed to,

88
00:09:54,170 --> 00:10:00,350
to some other toxic metabolite that's actually the ultimate toxicant that's that's causing the damage of the cell.

89
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:09,590
And so there's it. We'll talk a little bit about examples of both of those, both the toxicant itself being the ultimate toxicant.

90
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:15,230
And also cases where we have the metabolite for the toxicant is what's doing damage, right?

91
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,720
So whatever the ultimate toxicant is is going to be interacting with some type of target molecule,

92
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:26,750
protein, lipid, nucleic, acid, DNA, what have you in the target site.

93
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:36,140
And we have several things that are going to facilitate the delivery of the toxicant to the target site and to this target molecule.

94
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,590
So we've talked a good amount about absorption.

95
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:47,090
So the chemical needs to be absorbed through the body one way or the other in order to be delivered to where this toxic effect is going to take place.

96
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,079
And we have to think about, you know, this is where toxicant kinetics comes in.

97
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:59,750
We need to think about distribution. Is the chemical being distributed to that part of the body where it's causing these effects?

98
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:06,559
We can also think about things like reabsorption. So we talked about a couple examples like of this intrahepatic cycling where

99
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,600
chemicals can essentially they can be metabolized and tagged for excretion.

100
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:19,720
But then microbes in the gut can actually undo that reaction and the chemical gets reabsorbed into the GI tract and sent through again.

101
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,310
So we talked about that a little bit in the second part of the lecture.

102
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,500
There's some reabsorption that can occur in the kidneys. So these are things that are going to.

103
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,330
Um, affect how, you know, how efficiently this chemical is delivered to a site of toxic effect.

104
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:48,440
And then last lecture we talked about intoxication where we have what we call phase one metabolism and phase two metabolism.

105
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:57,330
And sometimes what we see with phase one metabolism is a chemical being metabolized to a toxic intermediate before this phase,

106
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,060
this phase two metabolism takes over. And so whether that chemical is toxic,

107
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,410
fired or not is another important thing to bear in mind in terms of understanding

108
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:11,210
how the ultimate toxicant is delivered to and interacts with the target molecule.

109
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,910
And we also have several factors that are working against these processes.

110
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,989
So we talked about working against absorption.

111
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:27,620
We can have pre systemic elimination, right? We talked about how the GI tract is technically like external to the body.

112
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:34,400
And so if a chemical makes its way through the entire GI tract and is excreted in the feces, for example,

113
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:40,729
it's not going to be absorbed by the body, not going to really do any toxic damage because it's not encountering any part of the body.

114
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:47,030
It's not going to be interacting with the liver or anything else. It just kind of was eliminated before it was absorbed into the system.

115
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,409
We have factors that might facilitate distribution away from the target.

116
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:56,420
So is the chemical even going to be in the liver long enough to be causing an effect?

117
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:05,000
Or is it kind of rapidly distributed away from the liver due to its physicochemical properties or the overall kinetics with the chemical?

118
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:14,420
We also have this excretion. Obviously, if a chemical is excreted, we're not going to be absorbing it and that will be working against us.

119
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,270
This idea of like reabsorption and things.

120
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:25,640
And then we also have detoxing tox ification or detoxification mechanisms, right, where a chemical is metabolized to a less toxic metabolite.

121
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:33,650
That's the ideal situation. Obviously we would prefer things to not be toxic five, but that is what happens.

122
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:39,200
But we also have these, you know, metabolism metabolic pathways that will detoxify chemicals.

123
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,180
And so yeah.

124
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:53,540
So we have this ideal situation here like you're exposed to a toxic it the body metabolizes it to a non toxic metabolite and then we eliminate it.

125
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:57,320
It'd be great if it were that simple all the time, but it's not.

126
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:03,499
Oftentimes what we see is the toxicant will be metabolized to a reactive metabolite that

127
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,210
is causing damage in the body before it's done and metabolized to a nontoxic metabolite.

128
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:17,150
This reactive metabolite can interact with, again, these various target molecules talking about things like DNA,

129
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:24,799
RNA, protein, lipids, etc. in the body can you know, we have pretty good repair mechanisms in the body.

130
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,010
So oftentimes we can repair and adapt to these exposures or, you know, to see these chemicals.

131
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:35,090
But sometimes if we're not able to overcome that, we have the case of toxicity.

132
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:45,850
And so here you have this detoxification pathway and this is what we would call intoxication pathway or tox application pathway.

133
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:55,370
Any questions there? Megan said, So far, we've kind of hit on all of this in one way or another in various lectures,

134
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:01,400
but it's worthwhile to just circle back and make sure make sure we talk about this.

135
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:08,440
Yeah. Okay. So let's see.

136
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:15,279
So again, we have examples of chemicals that where the parent compound and when we say parent compound,

137
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:25,900
we mean the actual chemical that we're exposed to. Like, um, in this case we have things like lead or dioxin compounds, cyanide, carbon monoxide.

138
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:33,460
These in and of themselves will cause toxic effects and damage in the body so that the that's the parent compound.

139
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:43,570
Right. But again, we have examples where the metabolites so the parent compound is metabolized to a toxic metabolite.

140
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,360
And so you have some examples here, like arsenic being metabolized, arsenic,

141
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:57,309
which is actually the ultimate toxicant ethylene glycol, is metabolized to oxalic acid and then benzo appearing.

142
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:05,620
We've talked about that before. This is actually metabolized to a reactive epoxy compound that is actually the one

143
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:10,599
that is doing a lot of the damage and causing cancer in the case of Pennsylvania,

144
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,680
high exposure.

145
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:21,010
So, yeah, so you have both the both these cases of the parent compound being toxic and then the metabolite of the parent compound being toxic.

146
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:30,470
So we have the ultimate toxicant, you know, again, is somehow interacting with the target molecule.

147
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:37,400
And there's a couple of things we need to think about in terms of attributes of the target molecule.

148
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:44,570
So it's hard to molecule, of course, must react with the toxicant in some way as be some kind of like interaction there.

149
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,640
The target molecule needs to be accessible by the toxicant.

150
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:58,940
And so a good example of that is if a chemical is like a GMO toxicant and causing damage to the DNA, the DNA is contained in the nucleus of the cell.

151
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:04,879
So if the toxicant is not able to make it to the nucleus, if it's like hanging out in the cytosol or, you know,

152
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:11,300
not efficiently absorbed by the cell and not ultimately making it to the DNA, it's not going to be able to cause DNA damage generally.

153
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:19,700
And so the accessibility of or if a chemical is mostly if its mechanism is mostly via impacts on the mitochondria

154
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,560
and for whatever reason the chemical is not absorbed by the mitochondria or not interacting with the mitochondria.

155
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,350
It's you're not going to see that toxic effect.

156
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:35,660
And then in addition, the molecules, you know, in generally, you know, should have some type of critical function.

157
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:41,240
You know, there's a reason why we care that this target molecule is being affected by the toxicant.

158
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,920
You know, that could be like we, like I mentioned with endocrine disruption.

159
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:53,719
It could be a receptor that is involved in mediating hormone signaling, which is an important part of development.

160
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,020
And, you know, basically overall homeostasis.

161
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:04,250
Or it could be, again, like DNA. I don't need to overstate how important DNA is to the function of a cell.

162
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:10,730
Right. So if it's a molecule, it's not very important to the cells like little maybe we don't really, you know, why do we care?

163
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,000
So there's different types of reaction reactions that can occur.

164
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:22,700
It could be like non covalent or covalent binding hydrogen abstraction,

165
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:32,480
transferring electrons between between the toxicant and the molecule, the toxicant producing some type of enzymatic reaction.

166
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:43,970
Typically, you know, if a chemical is interfering with the structure of, say, a lipid or a protein, taking a taking a electron off or donating,

167
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:52,010
donating an electron that's like pretty high potential for that that molecule to be disrupted in terms of its function,

168
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:56,809
because a lot of the function follows from the actual structure of the molecule.

169
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:04,200
Right. And so different types of outcomes we can see include dysfunction.

170
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:10,160
So whatever function that cell has, if it's, say, in a leading cell in the testes and it's making testosterone,

171
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,010
you disrupt the ability of that cell to make testosterone.

172
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:18,290
And that can, you know, have health effects often tied to like male reproductive development.

173
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,300
You can also get just destruction of the cell. Like you're basically just you're killing this.

174
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:27,260
The cell dies. Right. We'll talk about different types of cell death pathways.

175
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:35,480
There's also this interesting thing that can happen called neoantigen formation, where if the toxicant binds to a molecule,

176
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:44,329
it can actually form like a new molecule that the body sees as foreign and kind of responds by,

177
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:47,840
you know, ramping up like immune processes, like inflammatory pathways.

178
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,610
So you get this like neoantigen formation phenomenon that can happen as well.

179
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,790
Um. Yeah. So this is kind of just what they said. So. Um.

180
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:08,610
Attributes of target molecules, they must, you know, somehow have a structure or reactivity that allows it to interact with the ultimate toxicant.

181
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,270
It's some kind of covalent or non covalent interaction.

182
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:23,709
And again, this is probably intuitive, but, you know, endogenous molecules that are close to the reactive chemicals are more likely to be the target.

183
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:30,010
So, you know, where the chemical ends up in the cell or in the body is going to kind of allow us to predict what's going to,

184
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,360
you know, what kind of effects or what type of molecules are going to be impacted by that chemical.

185
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:42,219
And what we can see is like if a chemical doesn't find something to react with, if something else doesn't happen,

186
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:47,140
it may just kind of hang out and diffuse until it encounters something that it can interact with.

187
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:53,290
So, for example, a toxicant can be produced in the cytoplasm of the cell, and eventually,

188
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:57,400
if it's not reacting with anything else, it might diffuse into the nucleus and interact with the DNA.

189
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,860
Right. So these are just things to think about in terms of how molecules are interacting with chemicals.

190
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:14,920
So we have some examples of toxicants interacting with the function of different types of, say, receptors.

191
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:22,210
So we can have a chemical again, activating a receptor like a chemical like morphine can activate opioid receptors.

192
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:32,470
Right. With pesticides, we have a case where often pesticides are designed to block neurotransmitter pathways in one type organism or another.

193
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:44,200
But they can also do it in people. And so so we have a cartoon here that shows an example of blocking acetylcholine neurotransmission.

194
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:54,130
Right. So when our nerves want to talk to each other. One way they do it is by one nerve will the transmitting neuron will secrete acetylcholine that

195
00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:00,340
binds to choline receptors on the receiving neuron and cause some kind of activity in that neuron.

196
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:05,080
And we have an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase that will break down this little choline

197
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,670
into its constituent parts and essentially recycle it for uptake into that neuron.

198
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:16,960
And so you get this nice dynamic where you're able to, like, turn on this communication and turn it off.

199
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:21,110
Essentially. Let's see.

200
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:28,970
Yeah. And so this prevents over this ability and this like dynamism allows it to not overstimulate these neuron neurotransmitter pathways.

201
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:37,480
However, in the case of neonicotinoid pesticides and these are the pesticides that have been

202
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,350
have caused a little bit of concern due to their impacts on wildlife like these.

203
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:49,129
So there's still a lot of research going on in terms of the eco toxicological impacts of neonics.

204
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:59,540
It's like it's annoyed pesticides. But the way these work is these pesticides, this pesticide molecule will bind to the acetylcholine receptor.

205
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:10,300
And basically block it up. And so you're blocking these acetylcholine receptors and acetylcholinesterase is not able to break this down.

206
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:18,100
And so you're essentially turning on your SRT, not turning on you're blocking this pathway, this neurotransmitter pathway.

207
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,210
And this can lead to something like paralysis or difficulty breathing, these types of things.

208
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:27,990
So kind of an insidious mechanism to impact like neuron neuron biology.

209
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:38,469
We also have cases where chemicals can modify proteins or alter their structure and affect their function.

210
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:44,920
And we'll talk about a little bit about that later in the lecture. So these are the different ways that toxicants can target molecules.

211
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:53,310
We'll take a quick break there just because anyone has a to see if anyone has any questions so far.

212
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:59,260
Thoughts, comments. Okay.

213
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:08,050
Toxicants can also generate free radicals. And we talked about this a little bit, I think, in the carcinogenic Genesis lecture.

214
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:16,240
So Free Radical is a chemical that contains one or more unpaired electrons in its outer shell.

215
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:26,620
Right. So chemicals such as the pesticide paraquat can accept electrons from reductase cells and this generates a

216
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:34,540
radical molecule which can be transferred to oxygen and this generates a molecule called superoxide anion.

217
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,670
So we have the paraquat molecule here,

218
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:48,820
it can accept a electron from this reductase enzyme and you'll see that denoted by this dot here denoting an unpaired electron.

219
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:55,810
And this radical, this paraquat radical can donate an electron to an oxygen molecule which causes the

220
00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:00,820
formation of the superoxide anion molecule and that has an unpaired electron as well.

221
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:09,700
So free radicals are highly reactive, you know, they're always looking for that other pair, just causing a lot of like chemical reactions.

222
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:14,410
And this can cause oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, DNA.

223
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:20,710
It's just a, you know, a very highly reactive molecule that can cause a lot of damage of the cell.

224
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:31,800
Yeah. So anyway, the superoxide in iron is like a really powerful, free radical and can cause like, it can cause a lot of damage in a cell.

225
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:45,239
So toxicants can alter the structure of molecules through a process called cross-linking,

226
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:51,570
where essentially two molecules that are not usually bound together are attached together.

227
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:57,900
And one example of a type of chemical that will cause, like cross-linking reactions is like formaldehyde.

228
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:05,399
It's like a preservative. It's a really good preservative because it just causes like organic tissues to start forming,

229
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,270
cross-linked and binding to each other in ways that are normally not happening.

230
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:13,560
So that's what helps it sort of preserve tissues.

231
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:22,740
In the case of formaldehyde. But you don't want that type of reaction to be happening in like a living cell or a living body.

232
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:27,210
Right. And what I think we'll talk about a couple examples of that later on in the lecture to.

233
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:38,620
We also have chemicals can be essentially degraded through like a tap from reactive oxygen species or these free radicals.

234
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:48,790
Right. So this like you have a cartoon here showing this fatty acid being brought down by a series of reactions catalyzed by reactive oxygen species.

235
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,760
Double check. There's nothing else there. Yeah.

236
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:01,989
And so, yeah, this degradation, you know, you can see things like DNA fragmentation.

237
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,819
We talked about the common assay where you can pick up like small chunks of DNA that are damaged.

238
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,900
You can sort of like measure that using a common assay.

239
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:19,680
So when we talk about the step three, cellular dysfunction.

240
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:29,780
One thing to bear in mind is like each soul, the body has some kind of defined program set out for itself, like cells have functions within the body.

241
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:39,180
So these are programs that can control how a cell develops or matures like differentiates, whether it divides or whether it dies.

242
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,530
We have these really important signaling events and pathways that sort of regulate what a cell is going to do.

243
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:55,070
In the case of my dissertation was in the was in testicular biology or testicular toxicology.

244
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,799
So I go back to that as an example a lot.

245
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:05,180
But you know, the germ cells in the testes, they are, you know, programed to divide and or differentiate into spermatozoa.

246
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:16,220
Right. So that's their that's their program. It's other programs that control things like secretion of various factors.

247
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,420
Again, in the testes you have late excels which are producing testosterone.

248
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,000
And so they're programed to produce testosterone and chemicals can interfere with that process.

249
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,470
So we have lots of examples of that.

250
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:37,100
In the case of something like muscle cells, we have like contraction or heart cells like contraction and relaxation types of events,

251
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:48,320
metabolism, nutrient transport, what have you. There's all these functions that cells are sort of programed by their DNA to do.

252
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,370
And so these like complex signaling networks can be.

253
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:02,840
Again, as I mentioned earlier, activated or inactivated by a exhaustion of chemicals or zero biotic chemicals.

254
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,030
So we have some examples of that and we can walk through these examples.

255
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:18,810
So if we're talking about so that so we have a target molecule here, we can talk about cell regulation in terms of signaling, right?

256
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:25,500
So one thing we can see is dysregulation of gene expression interfering with what genes are expressed by a particular cell.

257
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,350
And so this is a very simplified version of how transcription factors work.

258
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:41,260
So essentially you have this would be the cell membrane containing the cytosol and this would be like external to the cell.

259
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:48,090
There's a receptor sitting on the surface of the cell. This would be the nucleus that contains the DNA, right?

260
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:59,380
A chemical could bind to a receptor, and that will typically trigger a series of like downstream protein changes to proteins.

261
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,810
Oftentimes what we'll see is there'll be like a complex,

262
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:11,010
a protein protein complex where one of this receptors activated that complex, essentially like detaches.

263
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:18,329
And so one of the molecules that is detached from the other one that's usually bound to in the cytosol and that detached

264
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:27,630
molecule will then be freed to go into the nucleus and basically through a series of like interactions with the DNA,

265
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:31,740
activate the transcription of Marrone.

266
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:37,550
This market is untranslated into proteins within the cell.

267
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:41,930
And so what's your what's your translating all these different proteins?

268
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:46,639
Many different changes can happen to the cell related to whether it divides,

269
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,440
whether it undergoes step up, tells ptosis, whether it differentiates into a different type of cell.

270
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,010
Um, yeah. There's just a lot that can happen there, right?

271
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:03,740
Yeah. So this is anything from growth, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, otherwise known as programed cell death.

272
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:12,330
And so we have lots of examples of and this is where a lot of the hormone disrupting chemicals come in.

273
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,779
Chemicals can bind to these receptors and trigger these types of changes that could be detrimental to

274
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:26,490
the health of an individual or of like a lab animal or whatever kind of organism we're talking about.

275
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:37,380
So, for example, kind of the one of the most well-studied cases of endocrine disruption is estrogen disruption of estrogen signaling.

276
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:44,809
So we have the estrogen receptor and the endogenous ligand or the chemical that's like within our bodies or

277
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:51,020
within the endogenous chemical that binds to the receptor is our estrogen like Ester Diol Ester Dial's,

278
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,570
the main estrogen that binds to this receptor.

279
00:31:54,230 --> 00:32:02,000
But we've identified many chemicals that are xeno biotics exogenous that will also bind to the estrogen receptor.

280
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,649
There's a really sad case of A that we'll talk about more in the repro lecture of

281
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:11,630
Dietl Sylvestre all this drug that that women that pregnant women were taking.

282
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,550
DDT is a pesticide, bisphenol A, they've heard of bisphenol A.

283
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:21,410
We talked about that. We talked about this a few times in this class so far.

284
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:28,190
And then parabens is a type of chemical that's found in it can be found in perfumes and personal care products as a preservative.

285
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:34,400
These can also bind to the estrogen receptor. And if you activate this receptor in a way.

286
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:41,409
You know, in this exotic, you know, bodies in the sort of inappropriate, if you will,

287
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:50,830
way we can see things like effects related to like carcinogenesis, like mammary carcinogenesis, hepatic carcinogenesis, cervical cancer.

288
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:56,110
These types of things can arise from aberrant estrogen receptor signaling.

289
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:05,670
And then similarly glucocorticoid glucocorticoid receptor is involved in the stress response.

290
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:09,990
And so the endogenous ligand that binds to that receptor is called cortisol.

291
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,839
Cortisol is what gets us up in the morning.

292
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:18,420
Like we typically have a spike of cortisol in the morning and then over the course of the day when it's time to go to bed,

293
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:27,060
levels of cortisol in the blood tend to decrease. But we also have exogenous chemicals that can activate the this receptor as well.

294
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,380
And again,

295
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:38,730
there's a number of health effects that are related to aberrant activation of and binding to the golden cortical receptor another receptor that.

296
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:47,230
Is typically thought of as not having an endogenous ligand, the oral hydrocarbon receptor.

297
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:54,129
For a while it was considered sort of a way for the body to sense exaggerates chemicals and respond

298
00:33:54,130 --> 00:34:00,610
to these exposures of exogenous chemicals in the environment of a little bit more recently,

299
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:08,829
I've seen some papers that have identified some endogenous ligands for the hydrocarbon receptor, and I haven't read those papers super closely.

300
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,810
So science is ever evolving.

301
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:20,079
But for a while, the URL hydrocarbon receptor was kind of considered this way of the bot for the body to respond to these exogenous chemicals.

302
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:28,959
And it wasn't it was unknown whether there was an endogenous ligand for the H ah receptor and this receptor will

303
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:35,560
upregulate a lot of metabolic enzymes that will help to metabolize chemicals that we encounter in the environment.

304
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,920
And we there's a number of exogenous ligands.

305
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:47,740
Such as PCBs, dioxin, chemicals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that can stimulate this this receptor.

306
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:55,690
And we also have some health effects that we've seen with average activation of this of this guy.

307
00:34:56,290 --> 00:35:02,260
And then we also have a big one is peppers or perhaps on proliferator activated receptor.

308
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:09,460
These are stimulated by fatty acids in the body, but exogenous stimulators include sally esters or parabens.

309
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:16,780
And these we've seen effects related to activation of these receptors such as the paddock carcinoma in animal

310
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:23,860
models and some enzyme induction of enzymes involved with like fatty acid metabolism and hormonal metabolism.

311
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,260
So that's just an example of some of the flavors of receptors that can be activated

312
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:33,850
that are part of the normal biology that are activated by endogenous ligands,

313
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:40,030
but are also can be activated by chemicals that we encounter often like often in day to day life.

314
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:49,570
So, um, and that's why we're interested in, you know, understanding how these exposures affect people's health.

315
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:59,930
So one thing to bear in mind in terms of activation of these receptors is that different chemicals

316
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:07,040
can have different degrees of potency in terms of how strongly they activate these responses.

317
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:13,070
So this is a table here showing the estrogenic potency of tested compounds, right.

318
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:23,420
So the estrogenic like the endogenous estrogens which are represented here, activate the C,

319
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:29,959
c, c 50 here, which is we've talked up these 50 markers a few times in this class.

320
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:39,770
So this s 50 is the effective concentration, 50 or the concentration at which a chemical will activate the ER receptor like 50% of the maximum.

321
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:51,290
Right. And so you see these estrogens are activating the absorption receptor and PICO molar concentrations.

322
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:59,569
Now, if we compare it to something like, say, bisphenol A that's activating the receptor at much higher concentrations,

323
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:04,460
you know, the potency is much less with bisphenol A compared to the endogenous estrogen.

324
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:12,950
Right. So that's just something to bear in mind that although bisphenol A does tend to bind and activate the estrogen receptor,

325
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:20,389
it's not as potent as the endogenous estrogen. Well, something like Diavel Sylvestre, although it actually goes the other way,

326
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:28,850
it's actually more potent and activating and binding to receptors that the endogenous ligands are, which is not what we typically see in general.

327
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:35,420
We see that Zino Biotics are much have a much lower potency in terms of stimulating

328
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:41,180
these receptors than the endogenous ligand which you could kind of infer.

329
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:48,890
Right. Or you know, that's a fairly intuitive thing. You know, these chemicals weren't for the most part designed to be activating these receptors.

330
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,399
It's just sort of due to their general structure.

331
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:59,000
They happen to interact with these receptors, whereas the endogenous ligands, we've evolved for that interaction to take place.

332
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:03,870
So let me ask a question. And so you see a bunch of chemicals here.

333
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:12,720
And this is just a a term describing the relative activation potency with like the aster dials, for example,

334
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,270
being like really potent and then these chemicals being like pretty weakly potent with the lower numbers here.

335
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:25,080
Does that make sense? Okay.

336
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:31,850
Let me ask a question. Do you think that the potency of the activation of the.

337
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:41,829
Like bisphenol A for example has a pretty compared to the endogenous chemicals has a

338
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:47,409
pretty is not very potent it's like kind of a weak activator of the estrogen receptor.

339
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:58,500
Do you think that. That means that there's like no effects associated with bisphenol A exposure in terms of estrogen signaling or what do you think?

340
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,759
I know. I mean, particularly for endocrine disruptors like BPA,

341
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:11,400
that there's a weird response or sometimes even actually low amounts can cause more response than like a medium or higher dose in some cases.

342
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:15,069
So I think. Yes. Right. You're saying?

343
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:23,979
Yeah, there still can be. Yeah. So just activating the receptor doesn't necessarily tell you what it's going to what that activation, you know,

344
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:30,880
even if it's a low sort of a weak interaction, that doesn't necessarily tell you what the cell is going to do in response to that.

345
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:36,580
Um, it's in response to that stimulation of the pathway, you know,

346
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:47,350
so that's really only telling you about one sort of part of the overall response, which is the binding and activation of the receptor.

347
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:54,370
You really need to understand like the rest of the pathway and really assess, you know,

348
00:39:54,430 --> 00:40:01,930
what's happening with that cell to really understand whether you're seeing some type of effect related to the exposure.

349
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,710
Right. So just want to just sort of mention that.

350
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:16,260
Okay. So we have dysregulation of gene expression. And again, if we have inappropriate like dysregulation of gene expression, right.

351
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:22,499
This can have all kinds of effects such as impacts on cell division and that's related to things like cancer.

352
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:30,030
We could have neoplasia the formation of like but new tumors or we can have had a genesis like birth defects.

353
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:39,960
If the if exposure is occurring during fetal development, apoptosis, again, activating apoptosis pathways can lead to like birth defects.

354
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,840
And um, yeah, so just, you know, there's, in terms of just regulating gene expression,

355
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:53,610
there's multiple, multiple ways that this could lead to an adverse cellular or tissue response.

356
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:00,090
So then we also have the case of dysregulation of cell function.

357
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:08,459
And so this is again, we're going back to this acetylcholine pathway here.

358
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:12,270
And I don't I don't want you to memorize every aspect of this pathway.

359
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:18,760
I just want to this is just a good way to sort of show how a chemicals might interfere with the cellular activity.

360
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:28,680
So, again, the way these cells do, the way these neurons work is by releasing down here this acetylcholine which binds to the a steel choline receptor

361
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:36,389
acetylcholinesterase will then break down the acetylcholine and then it's re uptake for re uptake into the neuron.

362
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:39,150
And the cycle sort of regulates itself that way.

363
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:48,060
There are certain types of chemicals that like pesticides or organophosphate pesticides as opposed to binding to it,

364
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,780
blocking the a acetylcholine receptor.

365
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:59,940
They inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity. And so you essentially have the opposite problem where you're not breaking down these acetylcholine,

366
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:08,400
stimulating events and you're basically turning on the neuron, like without this regulation of stopping the signal.

367
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:13,350
And so that's interfering with the normal function of those neurons.

368
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:19,890
Right. You also have other ways that chemicals impact like uptake in components that are used to like bio synthesize acetylcholine.

369
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:28,069
And so this is an example with like these organophosphate pesticides of interfering with the normal function,

370
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:34,010
like the normal function of these two neurons. Shown in this cartoon is to like essentially talk to each other in this dynamic

371
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,640
way where you can turn on the signal and turn off the signal as a needed.

372
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:46,860
If you disrupt these types of functions in like neural in terms of like, say,

373
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:53,220
neuromuscular activity, you can see things like tremor, convulsions, spasm, impacts on the heart,

374
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:59,370
um, paralysis, you know, all types of things that are related to, you know,

375
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:05,010
normal neuronal function needs to happen for these things to not be taking place.

376
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:14,400
So disrupting this neuromuscular activity is an important way that a lot of pesticides can impact human and or animal health.

377
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,880
I'll just take a quick break again there and just make sure everything making sense so far.

378
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:31,960
Questions. Comments. Thoughts. Cool.

379
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:37,080
Okay. We'll keep marching along. So maintenance.

380
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,180
So cells have their own form of, like, say, homeostasis.

381
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:48,880
They they maintain certain things in their body. You know, they have their own, like, sort of internal metabolism.

382
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:57,379
And so there are like major cellular systems that could be vulnerable to toxicant impacts that are related to the cells,

383
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,220
essentially like maintaining their activity, whatever that activity is.

384
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:11,180
So one really big one that if you mess this up, it's going to be really bad for the cell is you need your cellular membrane to be intact.

385
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:15,650
Right. We don't want big towers or like breaks in the cellular membrane.

386
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:21,880
You mean leaking all the stuff that's, like, inside the cellular membrane or inside the cell out into the micro?

387
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:27,709
That's not good, right? So we need to maintain the integrity of the cellular membrane.

388
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:31,040
And if there are chemicals that can, like, break that down.

389
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:41,729
Cells have respiration. So we have this process of oxidative phosphorylation and production of ATP, which is like the energy molecule in the cell.

390
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,470
It's the currency of energy in the cell.

391
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:52,170
Chemicals that we've worked with in our lab, we've seen in placental cells could disrupt the production of ATP and placental cells.

392
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:58,190
So there's multiple chemicals that can disrupt this process.

393
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:07,830
We could have disruption of protein synthesis. So chemical cells need to synthesize proteins to do various jobs within the cell.

394
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:15,840
If you're impacting the ability for the cell to do that, obviously it's going to have an adverse impact on cellular maintenance.

395
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:25,230
And then again, we've talked a number of times about how we need to preserve the integrity of the DNA and the genetic material within the cell.

396
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:32,790
As you might guess. These processes are interdependent.

397
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:41,850
So if we disrupt one to a large enough, you know, a severe enough degree, we will probably see impacts on the others at some point.

398
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:48,230
So. Yeah, so let's just you know, there's something to note there.

399
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:59,100
So like I said, toxicants can induce DNA damage. And we see this with chemicals or radiation.

400
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:05,010
Um, we see it and there are different types of DNA damage that can take place.

401
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:09,030
And so some of those are shown here in this cartoon.

402
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,769
So these include like just breaks. So the DNA is are made of these two strands of DNA, right.

403
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:17,520
With the anti and CNG, the two strands match up.

404
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,490
You can get a break either on one strand or what's called a double strand break.

405
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,890
You can get breaks on both strands of DNA.

406
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:34,550
You can get formation of DNA attacks such as the attacks of like a bulky molecule that shouldn't be there, basically binding to the DNA.

407
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:39,139
You can get DNA and protein cross links attacked with that cross link.

408
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:42,530
Things of proteins can bind into the DNA that shouldn't be there.

409
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:48,760
These things will all affect the ability of the DNA to be transcribed and basically, you know,

410
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:56,360
do its job of like, you know, providing this template for RNA and ultimately like protein synthesis.

411
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:03,860
You could get just like lots of bases, you know, just like an AT&T base could be just lost out of the day.

412
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:10,380
And, you know, that's going to interfere with the reading of the genetic program.

413
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:18,550
And we have mechanisms for detecting this DNA damage, luckily, and repairing this DNA damage.

414
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:24,580
So but again, this doesn't always happen with fidelity and it doesn't happen with like 100% efficiency.

415
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:30,270
But we do have these repair mechanisms in place, which is which is good.

416
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:45,120
This is. So cells have what we can think of as a decision tree when they encounter damage or when some kind of adverse event takes place.

417
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:55,240
Um, and there's a number of different options that they can take if they're faced with some sort of like adverse or stressful event.

418
00:47:56,350 --> 00:48:02,409
So for example, things like mitochondrial injury, so impacts on these organelles,

419
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:08,620
like the mitochondria or DNA damage or aberrant signaling of death pathways.

420
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:15,940
There are pathways within the cell that basically tell the cell, okay, I need to die now and undergo this process of apoptosis.

421
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:22,000
So if one of these like, you know, sort of stressful situations, it starts to impact the cell.

422
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:30,310
You get release of a certain set of molecules that sort of help to regulate or help set the cell on a specific

423
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:37,600
sort of decision process in terms of its various options that it could take in response to the stressful event.

424
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:47,710
And so if we take the example of, say, mitochondrial injury or mitochondrial insult, if this were to happen in just a few mitochondria,

425
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:52,840
what we might see is what we call auto autophagy of mitochondria,

426
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:59,620
where the cell itself actually breaks down this organelle within itself and recycles the parts that make up the mitochondria.

427
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:09,550
And it keeps kind of chugging along. It got rid of the damaged organelle and it can keep just doing, you know, keep surviving and keep chugging along.

428
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:16,210
If the damage is a little bit more severe, like you're getting damage in a lot more mitochondria,

429
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:25,000
you might get activation of what we call CAS based pathways, and that's a signal for the cell to undergo apoptosis or die in a fairly organized way.

430
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:28,240
The cell is saying, I can't basically adapt to this.

431
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:33,430
I need to just break stuff down and call it quits.

432
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:39,040
Right. If damage is like more severe, this is the worst case.

433
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:47,470
If damage is more severe, like let's say you're have damage to all the mitochondria in the cell, you're going to see things like just like one.

434
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:52,750
One of many things they're going to see is like ATP depletion is going to is going to be ATP is just going to plummet.

435
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:57,250
It's not going to be able like basically do the maintenance function it normally does.

436
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:03,100
And this will set the cell on the course for necrosis, which is also the cell dying.

437
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,280
But it's one it just happens in an unorganized way.

438
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:13,450
And it wasn't sort of stimulated via this like orderly pathway that is in place with apoptosis.

439
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:22,710
This is much worse than this. Let's see here.

440
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:29,850
Yeah. So we can see like so. Oh yeah. From the last slide in.

441
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:36,660
Then what happens to the crosses is, for example, high exposure of radiation.

442
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:43,060
Oh. So what what are the high, high exposure of radiation?

443
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:46,860
It happens. Double crosses, for example. Yeah.

444
00:50:46,860 --> 00:51:00,960
At high enough levels. Yeah, it's in the crosses. Okay.

445
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:10,180
So yeah, so the slides, just to say that we can pick these things up in a microscope,

446
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:15,040
like if you've ever worked with cells in a lab, you can know when the cells are not doing well.

447
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,510
You'll see these like morphological alterations within the cell.

448
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:25,270
And this is typically, after some really critical biochemical mechanism within the cell has been disrupted.

449
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,230
Often it doesn't happen like right away, if you like.

450
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:37,520
Sometimes what we'll do is include a chemical that we know is cytotoxic to the cells and causes apoptosis or,

451
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:42,790
you know, basically destroys the cell membranes just as a positive control to compare to other chemicals.

452
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:48,079
Right. And. You know, typically that's not going to happen right off the bat.

453
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:54,110
It'll take a couple hours. But, you know, over and over, over time, you'll you'll get a generation of, say,

454
00:51:54,380 --> 00:52:01,550
a lot of reactive oxygen species or a lot of free radicals that accumulate and cause like a high degree of damage to the cell.

455
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,360
And it's fairly obvious to look at a cell that's pretty damaged.

456
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:15,499
You'll see cells popping up and you know, this like this dysregulated membrane of type of morphology popping off the dish.

457
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,530
So there are a lot of cells, well, actually attached to a tissue culture dish.

458
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:25,280
You'll see them die in the like floating in the media. Not good in terms of cell health.

459
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,900
Um. Yeah. So.

460
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:38,740
So these like changes that like the in the originals are going to proceed these changes that we can pick up with like our typical microscope.

461
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:43,149
But, you know, depending on what type of microscope you have,

462
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:47,860
we're getting better at like visualizing the organelles in a cell and visualizing some of these

463
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:54,130
really small level changes that eventually lead to really dramatic effects like the cell dying.

464
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:00,829
Um. Let's see here. So, yeah, so impaired internal maintenance.

465
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:01,909
This can take, you know,

466
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:11,060
we can see chemicals that impair ATP synthesis regulation of important things like calcium within the cell, protein synthesis.

467
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:15,850
Microtubules are kind of like the skeleton of the cell, like kind of these, like,

468
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:23,330
protein structures that things can move on and kind of help make up the shape, the overall shape of a cell or membrane function.

469
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:30,260
Again, membrane integrity is important to cellular health, so impairing any of these can lead to cell injury or cell death.

470
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:42,730
And then we could also have impaired external maintenance or impaired ability to deal with some kind of external event.

471
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:48,060
So, for example, some chemicals can interfere with the ability of the blood to clot.

472
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:54,430
If you're like if you encounter some kind of injury, you know, typically you want your blood to be clotting as part of the response to the injury.

473
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:57,550
And we can some chemicals can interfere with those types of processes.

474
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:09,670
I as part of my research to study how chemicals can impact the ability of cells to respond to pathogens like pathogenic bacteria, for example.

475
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:17,350
And we're seeing some evidence that certain chemicals in the environment can impact the ability of macrophages to respond

476
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:25,060
to a pathogen and do its normal work of like phagocytosis and like basically swallowing up and destroying the pathogen.

477
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:37,390
See. So we have these repair mechanisms at a molecular cellular and tissue level.

478
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:44,530
Um, and if the toxicants are going to cause damage, it's, you know, it's what we're going to see is the toxic,

479
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:53,830
the effects of the toxicant are going to basically outpace the ability of the cell to conduct these repair activities,

480
00:54:54,730 --> 00:55:00,610
ultimately leading to this toxic effect. So the thing I want to point out here.

481
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,590
Oftentimes we'll see extracellular matrix. So these are the cells.

482
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:10,750
These are the proteins that make up this overall structure outside of the cell.

483
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:21,580
The cells are like sitting in and under conditions of, say, repeated liver injury or like a severe sort of like court or something.

484
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:27,700
We'll see like ECM, like overproduction. And you'll get like scarring in the liver, for example, or a scar will form.

485
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:32,800
And that's one of the things that leads to that, is this like overproduction of extracellular matrix.

486
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:40,180
So we'll see like these repair processes can lead to harmful effects in some cases as well,

487
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:46,210
that everything gets repaired and tidied up in the most efficient way every time.

488
00:55:50,260 --> 00:56:02,680
So in terms of oxidative, so what example of like a molecular repair repair mechanism are proteins can be.

489
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:10,890
How do I want to describe this? So let's say we have two proteins here with these file groups.

490
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,420
So this is sulfur with a hydrogen atom attached.

491
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:22,059
And what could happen in an oxidized environment is they can form these disulfide bridges where these sulfur atoms are bound to each other.

492
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:26,020
You're basically getting two proteins bound together that shouldn't be.

493
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,170
This could interfere with their ability to do their jobs.

494
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:37,360
So the formation of these disulfide bridges is not good a lot of the times and can inhibit normal protein function.

495
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:46,049
But we have enzyme pathways that are able to work against this oxidation oxidative damage.

496
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:50,550
Right. So we have what's called the final reduction pathway or a gluten reduction pathway.

497
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:59,010
And so what you have here is an example of like a protein with this disulfide bridge and this file

498
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:09,060
reduction enzyme can essentially reduce this oxidized disulfide bridge into back into the natural form,

499
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:13,260
so to speak, of the protein and glued over dioxin does the same thing.

500
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:21,960
So you go back, you know, basically repairing the damage, going back to the reduced free file version of the protein.

501
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:30,780
And these other reactions are just part of the overall reaction. There's a lot of like donating electrons and things from molecule to molecule.

502
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:40,589
So I don't want you to get too hung up on these parts, but just know that like these enzyme pathways are able to like repair these oxidized disulfide

503
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:46,620
bridges that can form and essentially cause damage within the cell by disrupting protein function.

504
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:58,670
Does that make sense? And glue the glue to redox and uses one of the cofactors we talked about in earlier earlier lecture a glue to file.

505
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:07,430
So when you see that glue to a prefix or whatever, that's a good indication that might be playing a role in a reaction.

506
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:16,280
This is a way of basically pushing back against like oxidative stress within the cell.

507
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:24,500
And we talked we've talked a little bit already about DNA repair pathways.

508
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:31,480
So we have ways of sensing and repairing DNA damage. And these include like different types of mechanisms.

509
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:40,640
We have what's called base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair mismatch repair, homologous recombination, etc.

510
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:49,580
We don't really want you to memorize all of these, but just understand that there's different types of DNA repair mechanisms.

511
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:54,100
And a lot of times we'll see this again with like oxidative stress.

512
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:59,930
We can see oxidative DNA damage, and we have these way, these like pathways of repairing the DNA.

513
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:08,670
I talked earlier about autophagy of damaged organelles.

514
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:16,130
So this is basically a way of removing and degrading damaged organelles within the cell.

515
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:20,240
So we get things like protein aggregates or like damaged organelles.

516
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:30,650
And so the cell can form what's called this autophagosome that essentially surrounds these damaged organelles.

517
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,680
And then in conjunction with a lysosome,

518
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:39,469
you're basically digesting these organelles to their constituent parts and they can

519
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:45,410
actually be recycled and used for like metabolic processes or energy types of processes.

520
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:47,750
Um, yeah,

521
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:57,620
so this is just basically kind of a repair system or like a repair and recycling system that is at play within cells as a way of dealing with damaged,

522
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:06,050
uh, parts of the cell. Anything else there I want to touch on?

523
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:13,820
I think that about covers it's. Talks about a ptosis versus necrosis.

524
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:18,800
So apoptosis is a type of cell death.

525
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:26,750
It's an organized version of cell death. And this is a picture of a cell undergoing apoptosis.

526
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:31,040
You'll see the formation of a lot of these structures called apoptotic bodies.

527
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:37,490
The cell basically starts to break down and package these structures called apoptotic bodies,

528
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:43,970
where it's basically moving all this stuff into these bodies as the cell starts to break down.

529
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:54,920
So. So every post this is a response to like specific again what we could call suicide signals or.

530
01:00:55,990 --> 01:01:03,280
You know, specific pathways where the cell has basically decided that it cannot adapt to this whatever

531
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:08,090
stressful environment it's in and that it would be better for it to apoptosis and die.

532
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:14,320
Right. So we see a number of hallmarks related to this process.

533
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:20,020
So like the nuclear material, like the chromatin condenses migrates to the nuclear membrane.

534
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:28,030
We see basically the DNA is like chopped up in a sort of orderly fashion of about 200 base pairs.

535
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:33,820
So we see this like pretty regular slicing up, if you will, of the DNA.

536
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:42,430
We see the cytoplasm starts to shrink. The membrane is not ruptured, so it's not losing all of the stuff that's leaking out of the cell.

537
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:52,690
We get the contents of the cell packaged into these high tech bodies, which contains like in some cases, like still functioning organelles.

538
01:01:53,950 --> 01:02:00,849
And also we'll see that these like on the plasma membrane, it'll like the cell will sort of mark itself,

539
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:04,149
will start to express proteins that say I'm undergoing apoptosis.

540
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:11,380
So like if a macrophage wants to come by and like engulf me and like digest me, like, go ahead kind of thing.

541
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:16,600
And so we're getting no leakage, no spilling of stuff out of the cell membrane.

542
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:22,240
And this is not causing inflammation. So you're not causing, like, the subdued response in the body.

543
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:27,850
This is a nice, orderly way for itself to die. That's part of the normal turnover of our cells in the body.

544
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:35,740
The process is basically the exact opposite. This is a pathological response to cell injury.

545
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:42,220
We see these like disordered clumps of the jet, of the chromatin, like the DNA with the attached chromosomes.

546
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:50,740
We see like mitochondria swelling and like breaking, like the organelles are just again, just there's just a lot of damage going on.

547
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:55,030
In this case, we're seeing the membrane is laced and like leaking stuff out.

548
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:02,620
And in this case, we're triggering some kind of inflammatory or immune response with this necrosis.

549
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:09,520
So overall, a much worse case compared to this orderly process of apoptosis.

550
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,520
And chemicals can activate either one of these, depending typically with the necrosis you're talking about.

551
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:25,750
You're you're like that would be like a pretty high exposure that we typically thankfully do not see very often in like a normal exposure scenario.

552
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:30,640
But there are chemicals like arsenic, for example, can activate apoptosis pathways.

553
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:38,110
And you don't want apoptosis pathways, although they're not as dramatically bad as like a necrosis situation.

554
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:41,920
You don't want to turn on apoptosis pathways when they're not, you know,

555
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:47,590
part of the normal sort of turnover and trajectory of the cells within that tissue.

556
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:48,070
Right.

557
01:03:53,020 --> 01:04:03,099
And so we can see some examples here of like cell injury and kind of what it looks like under a microscope when we see some of these like changes.

558
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:11,920
Right. So this is a slide of the liver and this pink stuff here is like dyed protein, right?

559
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:16,780
So these are like proteins. And then the nuclei are the purple, the more darker purple colored.

560
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:23,200
Right. On the left hand side is kind of what we typically more want to see.

561
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:29,570
We see this like. Relatively ordered spacing of cells from each other.

562
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:33,089
They're kind of just, you know, just hanging out.

563
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:37,100
And you see these like, you know, these nuclei all just kind of orderly.

564
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:43,639
And it's sort of like we're really positioned over here. You have what's kind of like damaged liver.

565
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:51,860
Essentially, it's a lot more disordered. There's a lot of like protein, maybe a lot of like scar like extracellular matrix deposition here.

566
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:59,600
And it's like sort of this like much more disordered environment that that typically is something that happens with like liver injury.

567
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:05,299
Um, so that's just an example of how things can change like at the morphological level that we can like sort of

568
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:12,770
see like a trained pathologist to be able to see this and like identify some kind of injury here in a tissue.

569
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:17,240
Let's see if there's anything.

570
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:25,110
So these are just some more of the highlights of different types of changes that can take place in a cell under like normal.

571
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:30,540
And then like some changes, you know, the cell can bounce back from, as we mentioned, and some changes.

572
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:35,970
The cell's not going to like bounce back or survive. It's either going to apoptosis or undergo necrosis.

573
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:41,790
Right. So as I mentioned,

574
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:50,009
tissues are comprised of cells embedded in what's called extracellular matrix proteins that exist outside of the cell that give the tissue,

575
01:05:50,010 --> 01:06:03,450
like its structure that the cells are sitting in. So when we are injured, we typically get this a set of.

576
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,719
Repair mechanisms like at the tissue level.

577
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:14,730
So if we imagine like a an injury here with and the body's response, this would be like in the skin get like a cot or something,

578
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:23,880
you'll get the blood clot forming, you'll get like invasion or like, yeah, these, these different types of cells like fibroblasts or macrophages.

579
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:29,400
We'll start to like migrate to the site of injury and start doing like repair processes.

580
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:36,840
Might get the formation of a scab, you'll get there like re proliferation of certain cells to like kind of build that tissue back up.

581
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:46,800
Um. And yeah, so you might see like this remodeling of this injury with like freshly healed epidermis and yeah,

582
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:53,320
so basically this is how things would normally go. Some chemicals can disrupt one or more of these processes.

583
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:59,920
Or if you get sort of injuries that occur over and over again, you might see disrupted, you know,

584
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:06,220
one or more of these sort of hallmarks of this repair and healing mechanism might be disrupted.

585
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:10,780
Right. So. Yeah, let's see.

586
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:17,820
We can also see in terms of adaptation a.

587
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:24,510
Decreased absorption of intoxicant or like sequestration of intoxicant.

588
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:32,100
So ion is something that's like really critical to a lot of different functions within our bodies, but too much iron is going to be bad.

589
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:35,760
You know, it is a metal. And so we'll see.

590
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:40,620
Like if we're exposed to like a high level of iron,

591
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:46,470
we might see a repression of this iron absorption into cells through downregulation of a transporter.

592
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:51,839
This is called developed metal ion transporter one that will be downregulated.

593
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:55,290
And so the cells are going to be taking up as much as they normally would.

594
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:03,610
We can also see some proteins that we have in our body help to sequester, like free iron, things like ferritin.

595
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:10,000
There's also a protein called metal thiamin which sequesters heavy metals such as cadmium.

596
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:18,909
So they can look they're not just that these metals aren't just like free in the cell that's sequestered in one, you know, altogether within the cell.

597
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:27,040
Not doing a lot of this like causing like reactive oxidative type of damage or these types of things.

598
01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:29,480
Yeah.

599
01:08:29,490 --> 01:08:38,550
And they'll be also see again with receptors, things like um, with opioid receptors, individuals can develop like tolerance to opioids after a lot of,

600
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:47,970
you know, chronic exposures, for example, they'll start to express fewer like hopefully opioid receptors, which can lead to tolerance to the opioids.

601
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:54,569
Right. And then, you know, we've talked a good amount about, you know,

602
01:08:54,570 --> 01:09:04,620
we can induce detox detoxification enzymes as well as inducing like repair machinery, like, you know, things involved in DNA damage responses.

603
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:15,530
So an example of an adaptive mechanism that's really important in toxicology is called nerf to.

604
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:23,200
Forgetting the nuclear response factor.

605
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:27,910
I think there's another word in there that I'm forgetting, but you could just call it Nerf, too.

606
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:33,970
So Nerf, too, is the important transcription factor, as we talked about earlier in the lecture,

607
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:37,720
that helps to regulate the response to environmental stress.

608
01:09:38,110 --> 01:09:47,920
And so nerf, too, is under like normal conditions or standard conditions, if you will, is bound to these proteins called keep one.

609
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:53,159
However, when we have conditions of like, say,

610
01:09:53,160 --> 01:10:01,709
accidents or like a lot of reactive oxygen species nerf to like these keep one proteins will basically jump off and

611
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:12,150
you'll have nerf to kind of activated on its own and will eventually and will again as we mentioned in the earlier slide,

612
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:17,850
bind to the the DNA and start regulating transcription of a lot of different genes that

613
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:24,240
are involved in the response to environmental stressors or environmental toxicants.

614
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:27,360
So it translates it moves into the nucleus.

615
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:35,790
We're already called translocate from the cytosol into the nucleus when it's activated by some kind of oxidative stress type of situation.

616
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:45,690
And the types of pathways. It mediates a lot of different types of pathways, including, you know,

617
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:56,370
up regulating like zero abiotic toxic intoxication enzymes of detoxification enzymes and proteins, iron sequestration, glucose, iron.

618
01:10:56,460 --> 01:11:04,470
You know, just there's a host of genes that are regulated by nerve two in response to environmental exposures.

619
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:19,620
Interesting example of Nerf too in a human study was done with a clinical trial of what's called so sulfuric vein,

620
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:21,540
which is a chemical found in broccoli.

621
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:32,310
And this is a way of seeing whether through dietary interventions we could essentially improve like metabolism of environmental toxicants.

622
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:37,020
So so sulforaphane induces nerve to right.

623
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:45,540
And what they what they did in the study was said a group, a group of people,

624
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:52,560
a like a really highly concentrated drink of like derived from broccoli, which contained a lot of sulforaphane.

625
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:58,350
And then in addition, as a control group, a placebo beverage.

626
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:00,540
So that containing the sulforaphane.

627
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:06,930
And so what they saw and so this is an in a region of China that had a lot of air pollution, one of them being benzene.

628
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:12,520
And so what you see here, this y axis is the the level of.

629
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:17,110
A metabolite of benzene,

630
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:26,380
the benzene metabolic pathway in the urine of individuals either drinking this broccoli beverage or the individuals that drank the placebo.

631
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:34,690
And so what can you see? What's the main difference you see between individuals that were drinking the broccoli beverage and those that did not?

632
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:44,200
Anyone. In terms of the amount of the metabolite found in the urine.

633
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:52,780
Was there more in the individuals that drank broccoli or less?

634
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:03,290
Laura. Right. So this is the placebo, remember?

635
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:11,660
And these are the individuals that drank the broccoli beverage. So the level of this benzene metabolite is much higher.

636
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:21,490
So the idea here is that, hey, maybe we can, you know, through a dietary or some kind of intervention lead to, you know,

637
01:13:21,490 --> 01:13:28,780
cause increased and induce this like metabolic response that clears that benzene out of the system

638
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:36,580
at a higher rate or more efficiently than in those that are not sort of eating enough broccoli or,

639
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:45,910
you know. So this is just sort of a mechanistic way that we can understand how we might modify the response to environmental exposures.

640
01:13:47,120 --> 01:14:02,049
Any questions there? I have been told that the broccoli beverage tasted really bad and they had to re add something else to it,

641
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:06,340
like pineapple juice or something to make it a little bit more palatable.

642
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:10,460
So. That's a fun little side note.

643
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:19,390
Okay. So we can even see this stuff in terms of evolutionary responses.

644
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:27,580
What we typically consider in terms of like these changes that are due to evolution, right?

645
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:37,870
We see that in fish. There have been studies that show that fish that live in highly contaminated areas have differences

646
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:44,680
in things like a H receptor expression and the expression of drug metabolizing enzymes like CYP 181.

647
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:50,920
So and these tend to make them more resistant to the effects of these chemicals and.

648
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:58,309
It's not that, you know, this isn't just, you know, that part of this may be due to like evolution and actual,

649
01:14:58,310 --> 01:15:06,080
like evolutionary adaptation that we've seen like a very relatively short timeframe compared to what we usually think about in terms of evolution.

650
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:09,830
We're talking about like decades as opposed to like millions of years.

651
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:15,080
But we just see these changes across generations in wildlife sometimes, which is pretty fascinating.

652
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:22,129
And we even see it. You know, again, this is like ongoing research, so sometimes it's hard to draw super strong conclusions.

653
01:15:22,130 --> 01:15:28,730
But we do see some indications that, like in human environments, even like humans that have been living in arsenic rich environments.

654
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:37,700
So arsenic does occur in nature, right? That people and this is a study that compared people in the Argentinean Andes,

655
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:45,109
they had a higher what is a genetic differences in like arsenic metabolism,

656
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:51,620
genes or genes that are involved in arsenic metabolism relative relative to those that lived in the Peruvian Andes,

657
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:56,780
where I believe the answer is not as arsenic rich environment.

658
01:15:57,530 --> 01:16:03,560
And so we're seeing some of these even, you know, in some human studies as well, which again, is pretty fascinating.

659
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:10,850
Um, if that's, if you're interested in like the process of evolution and adaptation in different environments.

660
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:20,969
Yeah. So again, we can have an appropriate repair and adaptation, right?

661
01:16:20,970 --> 01:16:24,990
So we're talking about, you know, adaptations that allow these fish or, you know,

662
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:30,960
presumably these humans to like, you know, to like appropriately adapt to their environment.

663
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:40,290
We we can have inappropriate repair and annotation where, you know, if we have like irreversible cell damage, we can see things like necrosis.

664
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:45,489
If we see necrosis, um, you know, becoming widespread, you know,

665
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:51,209
it's basically we're seeing like the damage cells are outstripping the ability of the cells to be replaced.

666
01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:54,120
And so that's going to in terms of like proliferation.

667
01:16:54,810 --> 01:17:05,790
So that's going to obviously lead to just impacts on the function of the tissue and yeah, could lead to some health adverse health effects.

668
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:13,440
We can have fibrosis, which is excessive deposition of the extracellular matrix that kind of alluded to that already.

669
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:22,020
Like we see this with chronically injured tissues like we're damage might be occurring repeatedly over time and we get this like

670
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:30,480
high degree of deposition and like scarring with this extracellular matrix deposition which can inhibit like tissue function.

671
01:17:30,510 --> 01:17:37,020
Like if you see a lot of scarring in the liver, that could potentially impact the ability of the liver to perform its normal functions.

672
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:45,610
And again, like with cancer, I think we talked about this back in the Carcinogenesis lecture,

673
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:52,090
but if we cause DNA damage, this could be repaired successfully or not.

674
01:17:52,100 --> 01:18:01,930
So whether, you know, we may have a repair that occurs and we lose the fidelity of the sequencing of the base pairs in a particular region of the DNA.

675
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:08,320
And this can lead to like mutations which if depending on which genes are affected,

676
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:12,280
you could get uncontrolled cell growth, the formation of tumors, etc.

677
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:17,740
So that would be another case of an inappropriate repair or adaptation situation.

678
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:25,500
So that is the last slide. So thank you. And if there's any questions, please let me know.

679
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:38,820
Um, thanks for coming today. I think for the developmental tox lecture, Dr. PEREIRA is going to come in on a schedule like in a week or two.

680
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:45,150
She's going to she was able to give it earlier. So she's going to give it out in a few class periods.
