1
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:19,050
Many of you will be lucky enough to become either appointed public health officials or elected politician.

2
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:26,610
But most of you will serve in a position where what you're doing is analyzing policy.

3
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,150
What I want to cover right now is the basics of policy analysis.

4
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,970
What is it? How does it function? Why is it important for you to begin?

5
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:46,080
We have to define what policy analysis is, and there are several different definitions,

6
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,240
and I think three of them in particular are worth talking about.

7
00:00:51,480 --> 00:01:00,390
One Walker definition. The policy analysis is a systematic approach to assist policymakers in choosing

8
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,870
a course of action from among complex alternatives under uncertain conditions.

9
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:16,110
Wimer and Vining define it as client oriented and why it's relevant to public persuasion and informed by social values.

10
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,200
Aaron will not ski, simply speaking truth to power.

11
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:32,670
We're going to spend most of our time really unpacking Walker's definition because most public health practitioners are forced to make

12
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:42,120
tradeoffs among various alternatives that operate under conditions of uncertainty when they're not necessarily any clear answers.

13
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:48,690
To be sure why we're inviting. Note that you will be informed by social values.

14
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:57,930
It is important to keep in mind and inevitably will not write that you are speaking truth to power,

15
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:05,010
even though you may not be doing so in an aggressive or direct confrontational manner.

16
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:18,430
Policy analysis in both art and science and art, because there are techniques you can use and develop and practice to become better at it.

17
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:28,360
But science is uncertain. You're rarely going to have clear answers and actions that would be tobacco control.

18
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:38,410
We know that tobacco causes cancer and other serious diseases, regulatory heart,

19
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:44,380
etc. but for the most part it won't have that clear causal connection.

20
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,680
You'll be dealing with ambiguity and uncertainty.

21
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:55,040
Hence policy analysis rely on many analytical methods and data sources.

22
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:04,310
What you really face is the problem of not having enough data and not having the resources to collect the data.

23
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,530
As we just alluded to.

24
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:16,610
There are certain values that underlie policy analysis, and you should try to think of all of these when you're conducting an analysis.

25
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,860
The first is maximizing or assessing economy.

26
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,300
So you satisficing economic efficiency by simply means.

27
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:35,360
You're often forced to take the second best option that the primary option isn't available for whatever reason.

28
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:42,430
You need to take a comprehensive view of what the consequences are given the values having a community

29
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:50,930
are you meaning those in your policy analysis of the particular policy you'd like to build?

30
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:59,840
What are the alternatives? Whenever you're thinking about policy analysis, you need to think about the options and alternatives.

31
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:08,750
Every policy maker wants to know what my options are and what the rationale would be for selecting the one that you're recommending.

32
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:12,890
And finally, what are the costs and benefits of each option?

33
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:22,370
At one time, public health could operate on a moral high ground without worrying about determining the costs and benefit option.

34
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:30,920
I'm afraid those days are gone and politicians are now demanding that you provide them with costs and benefits from each option.

35
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,090
And really, that's what policy analysis is designed to do.

36
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:44,570
So what are the key objectives? And if you think back to our discussion of the policy process, that's really where we start.

37
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,440
You have to define and redefine the problem and that's how you end up.

38
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,450
The problem is too many can't start smoking.

39
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:00,540
Okay, that's fine. But then what are some of the top questions you have to ask?

40
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:15,280
What the Ryan age if we want to say 21 how do you justify sending can't have to fight more at 18 but not being able to smoke tobacco

41
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:26,020
if you want to legalize marijuana in you can say the problem is that we put too many people in jail for nonviolent offenses.

42
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:36,100
But then you have to ask what are the implications for high school students or even younger if we legalize marijuana?

43
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:43,120
So defining and redefining the problem is much more complicated than it seems at first.

44
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,110
Second, you have to look for alternatives.

45
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:54,390
An interactive process to help strengthen decision making.

46
00:05:54,650 --> 00:06:00,980
In particular, you have to think about the alternatives and the tradeoffs.

47
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:12,890
For example, if you have limited resources, how do you choose between investing in high maternal and child health care or HIV prevention,

48
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:19,910
or for the long term obesity versus the short term opioid addiction?

49
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,290
Third, define what you don't know and need to know.

50
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,080
Basically, this is about data.

51
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:37,640
What can lindani you already have tell you and what do you need to know to address the particular problem that you want?

52
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,340
Again, take the opioid an example.

53
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:52,130
We have to know whether this driven problem, our pharmaceutical manufacture driven problem, a pain medication problem.

54
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,780
What's the source? What do we know? What additional data do you need to know?

55
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:09,079
Fourth, what barriers can you anticipate when you try to build the policy and then implemented memory in the policy process that can?

56
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,460
We talked about the need to think about implementation upfront.

57
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:22,520
To do that, you need to consider the relationship between the solution you're proposing and the potential barrier.

58
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,670
Finally, you must evaluate your policy assessment process.

59
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,480
Once the policy has gone into effect.

60
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,770
What went right? What went wrong? What didn't work?

61
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,590
Why was policy not implemented or developed in the way that you thought it would?

62
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:51,380
Can you not anticipate the right barriers? Were the resources you thought might be available not available in the end,

63
00:07:51,830 --> 00:08:00,980
that evaluation essential to how you think about the next policy or even making changes to the policy?

64
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:08,720
You just developed. So we might also think about what the policy analyst role is.

65
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:15,860
Well, for one thing, you want to use policy analysis to get your issue on the policy agenda.

66
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:26,660
You can use analysis to raise the important, most salient and potential resonance of the problem that you think needs to be addressed.

67
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:32,420
Second, it helps advocate, facilitate better decision making.

68
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:43,610
If you provide good analytical results, both the advocates and the decision makers will be in a better position to implement these ideas.

69
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:48,230
Third, policy analysts are entrepreneurs for ideas.

70
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:56,840
If you've got a good idea how public health policymaker that maybe people haven't thought about before, floating the idea is great.

71
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,280
But providing a detailed analysis of it is even better.

72
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:10,430
And finally, you can use that analysis to educate either the client or, more importantly, if you're in a health department,

73
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:18,380
the public the public will understand it better if you've done a thorough, comprehensive analysis.

74
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:24,470
Then take the community through why there is a problem, how you define it,

75
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:32,180
how you are going to address it, why the benefits outweigh the costs that the role in the policy and what.
