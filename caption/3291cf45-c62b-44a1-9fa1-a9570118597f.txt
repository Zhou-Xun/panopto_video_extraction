5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,860
work on our core exercises during Bruce's talks. my name is Rihanna Mesick

6
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,160
and I'm a social professor here in the department of genealogy. along with Belinda needham I'm the co- director

8
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,960
and it's my pleasure to introduce Doctor Bruce Lee. Doctor Link is a distinct

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,260
professor of sociology and public policy of University of California Riverside. previously

10
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,360
was professor in the department of genealogy. Columbia University School of Public Health for over thirty

11
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,461
years he earned his bachelors from College. and his

12
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:12,901
Roger training was all completed at Columbia University. members of scholarship

13
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:18,021
interest are centered on topics of psychiatric and social genealogy and I learned.

14
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:23,361
I was learning this after going over Bruce's TV to do the introduction today that this weekend with his dissertation

15
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:28,921
research. which was entitled mental patient status and social disability and examination

16
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:35,081
of the effects of a psychiatric label. so this is a field in which Bruce has

17
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:40,321
entered as a Junior. junior scientist and has become an absolute leader

18
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:45,421
in the field. he's record numerous research project focus on understanding publishing House

19
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:50,741
from the perspective of sociology. including projects directly related to social sigma towards Memphis order

20
00:01:50,741 --> 00:01:55,781
is what stake Myer is and how it might be reduced. he's made major

21
00:01:55,781 --> 00:02:01,809
contributions or theoretical orientation of Public Health he has worked on fundamental calls this. is he

22
00:02:01,809 --> 00:02:06,949
this is a long standing commitment to June to mentoring Junior investigators. and for over a decade he was a.

23
00:02:06,949 --> 00:02:12,369
he was the program director the Columbia side of the Robert Wood Johnson Health and Society scholars program.

24
00:02:12,369 --> 00:02:17,489
a post doctoral fellowship which as you maybe familiar with our talk today

25
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:22,549
sponsored by CCS. I'm bringing Bruce out here was made possible by the Gilbert

26
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:27,749
Whitaker funds to improve teaching and learning at the University of Michigan. it was awarded by the

27
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:33,129
University Michigan Center for research on learning and teaching. so without further due.

28
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:42,209
please join me in welcoming Doctor Lee.

29
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:47,489
thank you very much for that nice introduction. so I'm really happy to be here. she'll be your

30
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:52,929
is I'm sorry. mean I you have to stand. I'm gonna try to plan my shoes geological

31
00:02:52,929 --> 00:03:00,247
and public Health background and. see how it work.

32
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:05,507
that you never know how big your screens are gonna be. but anyway I'm gonna talk about

33
00:03:05,507 --> 00:03:10,727
the sigma concept and some ideas about you know what is sticking. then I'm gonna

34
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:15,827
propose that we can think about sticking the social determine as well and whether we

35
00:03:15,827 --> 00:03:21,427
might wanna think about. but I called up fundamental cost of Health and quality.

36
00:03:21,427 --> 00:03:26,467
but I'm gonna turn more to mental illness and to talk about mental treatment and

37
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:31,787
it's operating at multiple levels. and then I'm gonna turn to.

38
00:03:31,787 --> 00:03:36,807
you know what can we do about this next week things recently received in terms of interventions

39
00:03:36,807 --> 00:03:42,047
focused on the person who has mental illness. and ask

40
00:03:42,047 --> 00:03:47,067
how successful those dimensions would be then and then interventions to try to change how

41
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:52,287
the public thinks about his mental illness and sticking around on

42
00:03:52,287 --> 00:03:57,487
this and then talk about some implications for future efforts to address

43
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:03,273
stream of mental loan so that's that's what I'm up to. here goes.

44
00:04:03,273 --> 00:04:08,793
so what is dead. so we go back to God man who really gotta start

45
00:04:08,793 --> 00:04:13,893
thinking deeply about this issue and there's notes on the management of spoiled identity and

46
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:19,093
Kaufman. picture they're sending us. Payne University office

47
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:24,293
and his book next time. he didn't find it as an actual view that is deeply discouraging and

48
00:04:24,293 --> 00:04:29,573
reduces the barrel from a hole in usual person today and you tend to discount it

49
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:34,953
and then another. your own mind. I mean our golf arena. these pictures

50
00:04:34,953 --> 00:04:40,733
there work with Jonathan came up with the following this definition

51
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:47,013
signal. Marcus such a person to park and links to more person to a deserving characteristics.

52
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:52,753
pretty straight forward. do you think those definitions wouldn't why somebody. how do

53
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:58,033
you think that there is any basis for why they would be. well it turns

54
00:04:58,033 --> 00:05:03,773
out. I mean you know it might have even work right that it should be re testing.

55
00:05:03,773 --> 00:05:08,813
so there was a challenge to him about people who are ready sing the time status

56
00:05:08,813 --> 00:05:15,353
and along long many lines going on with these two in particular segment space

57
00:05:15,353 --> 00:05:20,653
conception license as an attribute or remark something that the person have

58
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:25,753
rather than something that is confirmed on or selected for social sales.

59
00:05:25,753 --> 00:05:30,873
talk say more about this. they didn't like the fact that you got the statements and you know

60
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:36,453
it's not about this. as social relationship between you something. you have

61
00:05:36,453 --> 00:05:42,153
new process. and the second thing that they criticize with texting research tends

62
00:05:42,153 --> 00:05:47,333
to focus on the processes category stations and the linking of the categories in

63
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:52,373
addition to stereo types and not on the broad discrimination

64
00:05:52,373 --> 00:05:57,933
and social exclusion. so that Mister Curtis is there in the field and I love

65
00:05:57,933 --> 00:06:03,081
listing the research so could I reach come up with. thinking about us

66
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:08,181
sticking responded to those stupid cheeks existing Con.

67
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:13,261
so we came up with this definition. I'm staying my set of tanks taken

68
00:06:13,261 --> 00:06:18,301
as one thing we thought of it as existing when multiple components

69
00:06:18,301 --> 00:06:23,501
that's doing the conversion they all happen at the same time. so we had six things

70
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:28,521
that we I got five and I got three days in a little bit more so I'll go through them quickly first

71
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:33,661
step people distinguish and label human differences. as part of the one

72
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:39,833
that's been labeled persons are linked to an desirable characteristics to unwanted stereo types

73
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:45,653
select label person to set up. it's there them rather than

74
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:50,913
and there's an emotional looks people experience with emotional reactions. label people

75
00:06:50,913 --> 00:06:56,753
like you. for your potion to discuss and label purses made feel shame embarrassment

76
00:06:56,753 --> 00:07:01,873
or humiliated and then label persons experience status lost

77
00:07:01,873 --> 00:07:06,893
of discrimination and the final component which I'll say more about the moment. is that

78
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:12,013
stinking is dependent on power. so here these six components

79
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:17,073
coming up separately. so distinguishing the labeling human differences. there

80
00:07:17,073 --> 00:07:22,113
a massive number of human differences think about my next human differences exist in

81
00:07:22,113 --> 00:07:27,333
this room. which one do we pluck out for social social sale which ones

82
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:32,913
do we have ideas about that if you possess that thing then there something about you.

83
00:07:32,913 --> 00:07:38,013
well carriers. some people are yours. other people are very yours. it's very

84
00:07:38,013 --> 00:07:43,784
it's all over the place I still don't hear when usually ignore that

85
00:07:43,784 --> 00:07:49,124
and there's all sorts about you abuse that we generally ignore but others will pluck out. such a minority

86
00:07:49,124 --> 00:07:54,224
status you raced your gender. I clocked out for social Celine Celine this is something

87
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:59,324
we accomplished. this is something that we do and sometimes some

88
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:04,404
of the things that are still taking for granted. we don't realize that we're plugging them

89
00:08:04,404 --> 00:08:09,504
out. so she's like one like instead of two. it's just there. it's

90
00:08:09,504 --> 00:08:14,644
kind of what goes on in our heads about pulling out of something family and the person

91
00:08:14,644 --> 00:08:19,724
who has only one like would rather be viewed as a whole person not there. one leg and this to be

92
00:08:19,724 --> 00:08:25,144
the focus about that. so that's the idea about plugging out selecting

93
00:08:25,144 --> 00:08:30,504
for social sales. the step one. then once

94
00:08:30,504 --> 00:08:35,724
you split that out. given the designation given in the label.

95
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:40,884
then the idea of stereo types. if you know you are a had blank. then I also think

96
00:08:40,884 --> 00:08:46,074
you are black. so a person with mental illness. dangerous person for psoriasis

97
00:08:46,074 --> 00:08:51,154
is thirty euros. the. Roma just slightly criminal.

98
00:08:51,154 --> 00:08:56,214
young black male violence. live in a trailer big it slow with. those are examples of

99
00:08:56,214 --> 00:09:01,754
stereo types link to labels and then there's this separation.

100
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:06,994
I said now the Sigma Group along separate category we talk about them.

101
00:09:06,994 --> 00:09:12,274
it is in a different category and they different than us. sometimes so fundamentally so

102
00:09:12,274 --> 00:09:20,054
that we no longer see that them missed you. you can imagine that. in the kind of thinking went on

103
00:09:20,054 --> 00:09:25,114
being Jewish and not German. and then there's emotional reactions to

104
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:30,154
a person who's doing the tires and if you change Billy Ocean Harrison. and I say may because

105
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:35,454
it doesn't happen everybody happens on average and people who are insisting that I screwed

106
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:42,138
me if you have discussed the year. hang

107
00:09:42,138 --> 00:09:47,518
and then the idea that the next step is status loss and discrimination

108
00:09:47,518 --> 00:09:52,598
statement. involves it a lost the status. I don't placement in

109
00:09:52,598 --> 00:09:58,318
a social High degree. sort of a distance for an achievement practice and franchising.

110
00:09:58,318 --> 00:10:03,558
as a valued person someone work and then discrimination

111
00:10:03,558 --> 00:10:08,998
and housing schooling. friendships and intimate relationships. general exclusion

112
00:10:08,998 --> 00:10:14,378
from Judy mind social experience. so once those things

113
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:19,478
crew together for Penelope from labeling to status loss and

114
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:24,978
discrimination is included. we call. we point out that statement

115
00:10:24,978 --> 00:10:29,998
requires power. social power who gets to decide which idea

116
00:10:29,998 --> 00:10:35,738
which designations to make sale. somebody is deciding that we're kinda

117
00:10:35,738 --> 00:10:41,074
collectively deciding what to pluck out and make silly about human being we don't have

118
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:46,114
carriers as a big category. that's the decision this me. and

119
00:10:46,114 --> 00:10:51,114
then who makes the stereo types of power to construct the stereo types that

120
00:10:51,114 --> 00:10:56,234
exist to a given. time and then the power to Broadway separate groups to

121
00:10:56,234 --> 00:11:01,234
dawson them and then who holds access to the desirable job

122
00:11:01,234 --> 00:11:06,334
housing education. that's another element of power.

123
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:13,494
that's involved in an interesting statement. must have power in order to be achieved.

124
00:11:13,494 --> 00:11:18,854
so now that was thinking about what staying is.

125
00:11:18,854 --> 00:11:24,034
how was important thing for Health and can it be considered

126
00:11:24,034 --> 00:11:29,754
the social determine house.

127
00:11:29,754 --> 00:11:35,274
so the handbook of medical sociology. this doesn't include chapter on stake.

128
00:11:35,274 --> 00:11:40,848
this is wanted to pray for Greg Rogers. just a reflection that

129
00:11:40,848 --> 00:11:45,988
that doesn't include a stamped reference to Agnes so. that's one indication

130
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:52,628
that might be a place we'd expect a chapter on Spring Mountain Health social at the genealogy

131
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:57,788
Berkley Cole Karachi and Lee Moore. you know no no chapter on

132
00:11:57,788 --> 00:12:02,908
state. why not. you know what give and I made back to them that next

133
00:12:02,908 --> 00:12:08,248
time you do let me put a chapter Eastern. well it could be stricken

134
00:12:08,248 --> 00:12:13,788
the researchers fall and share whatever the rate is at the top.

135
00:12:13,788 --> 00:12:19,088
things that might be affected by the signal. so your housing your income your

136
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:24,088
education and your social relationships your self esteem and filing your house.

137
00:12:24,088 --> 00:12:31,068
might be some of the social determination Health across the top and on the left side are

138
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:36,088
things that could be stagnant as by others. mental wellness or sexual orientation will

139
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:41,468
be City HIV. so what are we doing treatment researchers well. I would portray

140
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:47,748
but we've gone just to go one by one sexual orientation and housing.

141
00:12:47,748 --> 00:12:52,868
mental wellness and social relationships and we do this study and

142
00:12:52,868 --> 00:12:57,928
we find it. yeah I'm not mistaken that is associated with

143
00:12:57,928 --> 00:13:02,968
some problems in social relationships and all sorts of things in

144
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:08,048
Florence social relationships not just ignore around mental wellness. you

145
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:13,188
know there's all sorts of your personality where you live. you know how friendly the people

146
00:13:13,188 --> 00:13:18,618
are around you all certain things so it's just a taking mental wellness just a small

147
00:13:18,618 --> 00:13:23,658
part of social relationships. so always day segment. I got

148
00:13:23,658 --> 00:13:28,918
a for sale. Andy is a possible connection to social relationships. but it's just

149
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:36,038
one of monks men and we do this all run over one by one.

150
00:13:36,038 --> 00:13:41,358
but the idea that you're gonna get the idea pretty soon. is that if we think

151
00:13:41,358 --> 00:13:46,398
about checking over all these different students. high

152
00:13:46,398 --> 00:13:51,398
status is. and this is just a short list and all the social determine if

153
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:56,498
you put them all together. it deserves. it's. it's not a little.

154
00:13:56,498 --> 00:14:01,738
it's not just it's a big one put all together. so

155
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:06,798
now I just told you that they might be related

156
00:14:06,798 --> 00:14:11,978
through multiple mechanisms and we'll do some social terms of help to multiple

157
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:17,087
disease .com. so that sounds like something else you might have heard if you studied

158
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:24,107
one of our cars. the remote. Steve is related to multiple comes through multiple Americans.

159
00:14:24,107 --> 00:14:29,607
there gonna share some features of the phone amount because myself and Joe Phelan.

160
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:34,647
to find it and considering such economic status. as a possible phone and I'll call.

161
00:14:34,647 --> 00:14:40,607
when you call. so quotes did not be a particularly permissions type of cars

162
00:14:40,607 --> 00:14:46,407
that maintains in association with all over time. there's a whole replacement mechanism.

163
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:51,787
so that is one mechanism is blocked. another one arrives.

164
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:57,127
so what we need for this to be true. well they're ready to be a motivation

165
00:14:57,127 --> 00:15:02,127
to read and ask. we would need to identify what desired

166
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:07,187
and people achieve bicycle time. there's something that they wanna work. so they can keep

167
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:12,647
getting. if such motors success and are strongly are sufficiently

168
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:18,007
strong and we might expect people to push to effectively say hey.

169
00:15:18,007 --> 00:15:23,387
if we cannot and I texting this way. then we'll find another sub to make the fundamental

170
00:15:23,387 --> 00:15:28,827
calls process work and this way we might expect people with the requisite power

171
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:34,067
to review next segment two different new mechanisms it's. they were the ones are just

172
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:39,447
large. so what the are motivation. what do people get

173
00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:44,747
out of this digitizing others. now I'm we usually think about this technician take off take the

174
00:15:44,747 --> 00:15:49,747
space to and encourage people just don't understand. we need to teach and we gotta get the

175
00:15:49,747 --> 00:15:54,887
message about Mister Will Mister. miss about this or that statement and contract

176
00:15:54,887 --> 00:16:00,347
ring. but what about people actually getting stop wasting ties and colors.

177
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:05,487
we identified three three motivation to statement. I put my

178
00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:10,487
wife to failing color and myself and Jack to video black and white.

179
00:16:10,487 --> 00:16:16,231
because these are basically her ideas that she deserves a colored picture. anyway

180
00:16:16,231 --> 00:16:21,431
this is Renee reasons. expectations our mission statement as other people can exploit

181
00:16:21,431 --> 00:16:26,651
them or dominate them. you can keep people in you can enforce norms with statement.

182
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:31,851
or you can keep people away. avoiding disease disease. also a little bit more about

183
00:16:31,851 --> 00:16:37,111
each one. so expectations domination keeping people down. racism

184
00:16:37,111 --> 00:16:42,131
in this degree position of African Americans. to justify slavery. you got to exploit

185
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:47,131
them if you put them down and consider them a lower order of human being. you deserve.

186
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:52,231
by the synchronization American Indians. if this is so. take the irrigation

187
00:16:52,231 --> 00:16:57,491
of their laps. so we can dominate them and get their lances. so thoroughly student to.

188
00:16:57,491 --> 00:17:02,651
so you get something you want or normal course a and second one here

189
00:17:02,651 --> 00:17:07,811
the iconic example might be the Scarlet letter. this call

190
00:17:07,811 --> 00:17:12,931
letter. stating must deployed to punish people who violate social rooms and a certain

191
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:17,937
example to all others that they should not do so scarlet letter. don't

192
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:23,177
let those sexual feelings. later. to talk you we're gonna make an example of this woman. we're gonna put the Scarlet

193
00:17:23,177 --> 00:17:29,357
letter on her doctors and you're getting something you want a social or that you want

194
00:17:29,357 --> 00:17:34,377
and we might think of this and the current time is time to keep this appoint keep

195
00:17:34,377 --> 00:17:39,697
people in an example might be structure being gay marriage.

196
00:17:39,697 --> 00:17:44,757
we're not gonna let you. we're gonna keep you in the morning. marriage is

197
00:17:44,757 --> 00:17:49,897
between a man and woman. we've got these lost and you're gonna stay. so you got

198
00:17:49,897 --> 00:17:55,137
to get something for testing testing people that you want or disease avoidance or keeping people

199
00:17:55,137 --> 00:18:00,177
away here. can I example might be. so you Sigman is

200
00:18:00,177 --> 00:18:05,397
used to cheat people away. Brad and have Revolutionary develop conversion to

201
00:18:05,397 --> 00:18:10,857
dangerous disease. as indicated by skin lesions but also had eradicate behavior

202
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:16,471
strange gate in park probably in any case. during time circumstances

203
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:21,611
these things blowing together. keeping people down in the way. we kinda

204
00:18:21,611 --> 00:18:26,931
are manifest but it's interesting to think about them and set up a conference. possibly separate

205
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:31,991
origins and some some interest. so there's a motivation to get something busted

206
00:18:31,991 --> 00:18:37,351
with talking other people. so it was motivation like that is in place

207
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:42,571
we may expect people to try to reproduce the desire to wanna keep people down

208
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:47,731
in your way. in the event that one approach no longer works then

209
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:52,751
another maybe needed. so that we have that part

210
00:18:52,751 --> 00:18:57,811
of it. what else with it. there's only one mechanism that could achieve your end and I got

211
00:18:57,811 --> 00:19:03,211
block to be done. so I can't can achieve it any more. there has to be multiple multiple

212
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:08,951
ways that you can keep people down your way. multiple replace in America

213
00:19:08,951 --> 00:19:13,975
what stag his mechanism have we have so many way this is

214
00:19:13,975 --> 00:19:19,575
keep telling people that they belong down and that they're not as good as the rest of us.

215
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:25,475
also two places in the case. there's tons of mechanism we do it of the policy global and so

216
00:19:25,475 --> 00:19:30,855
and a drink then our grass to be somebody powerful group. to

217
00:19:30,855 --> 00:19:35,915
active. there has to be a difference. in order for them to be able to achieve it. well we got gonna

218
00:19:35,915 --> 00:19:41,155
calling up our differences to go over. so that the characteristics were necessary.

219
00:19:41,155 --> 00:19:46,335
first name is Yvonne and cost the are kind of there. if we if this condition is already

220
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:52,235
expected to report production of any quality through student and motivated Americans.

221
00:19:52,235 --> 00:19:57,269
so yeah expect testing to show the features of the monumental call you

222
00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:02,409
just give a one example here by the way this is just me talking you haven't confirmed. is this

223
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:07,609
just a thought. but here's an example where I think

224
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:12,649
it is pretty Evan. have your three star periods in the top

225
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:17,889
light lips there is an enduring motivation. people are getting things by there

226
00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:22,889
makes braces motivation to exploit and dominate. that's constant across

227
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:27,909
the street historical period. but then a different period is there a different mechanism.

228
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:33,569
so in the first period. just slavery information

229
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:39,069
on how that is done in that area and we might have some Jim crawl.

230
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:44,689
when slavery was in existence and he's glued to domination discrimination

231
00:20:44,689 --> 00:20:50,069
segregation. restricted freedom stretched our classy ass placement and therefore

232
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:56,514
help in equality for minority groups in a second period we get rid of the slavery

233
00:20:56,514 --> 00:21:01,694
Jim Craig. and reproduce the association. the idea. someone's blocked.

234
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:06,914
the motivation is still there so we do a it different way. through Jim Cross. and then we have Michelle

235
00:21:06,914 --> 00:21:11,914
and Alexander's ID about the third period while we block

236
00:21:11,914 --> 00:21:17,774
slavery. you know to some extent we'd like improve pro.

237
00:21:17,774 --> 00:21:23,274
we have mass incarceration. this producing and any quality. some different mechanisms

238
00:21:23,274 --> 00:21:28,274
at different times. with a constant motivation to achieve these things. you may not wanna go

239
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:35,554
there. but are what we doing this right now. political context.

240
00:21:35,554 --> 00:21:40,694
making America great again. I'm

241
00:21:40,694 --> 00:21:46,214
saying like that in two cases of that. the first thing in the garage.

242
00:21:46,214 --> 00:21:51,474
that kinda thing. last time I met Rose. those the are logical thinking I'm gonna began it

243
00:21:51,474 --> 00:21:56,918
again tonight. more perky. Public Health implications and I'm minute.

244
00:21:56,918 --> 00:22:02,538
but if we think that's why won't my. what we need to do this is set a goal for what we have to do to address.

245
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:07,638
we we might. first of all we might worry that interventions we do short term

246
00:22:07,638 --> 00:22:12,998
positive. we got RP value publishing. feel excited. but then you know what time

247
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:17,998
do you expect to get a roller you completely go away and goes away because

248
00:22:17,998 --> 00:22:24,938
of this constant motivation that hasn't been addressed. so to address

249
00:22:24,938 --> 00:22:30,518
the cost of motivation. we either have to change the fundamental motivation

250
00:22:30,518 --> 00:22:35,738
or we have to change to it our power differences between those who have those migrations and those

251
00:22:35,738 --> 00:22:42,218
are the hardest things.

252
00:22:42,218 --> 00:22:47,658
so that's that's. I'm gonna come back to visit further implications for intervening.

253
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:52,958
as as we go forward. that signal operates at multiple levels and now I'm gonna turn

254
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:58,594
more to mental on this big Mac as just been most part of what I was asked to talk about.

255
00:22:58,594 --> 00:23:04,634
and so there's three ways in which you might think. and this might apply to other student circumstance.

256
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:10,394
I which meant on the statement faxed people's like chance. first would be discriminatory

257
00:23:10,394 --> 00:23:15,434
behavior by other people. this is what we often think about. me think about discrimination. person

258
00:23:15,434 --> 00:23:22,874
had to something the person be be because person has an animal sports person be needed.

259
00:23:22,874 --> 00:23:28,334
we think about it. existing advertising attitude and then they

260
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:33,354
discriminate against that individual. so that's one very important

261
00:23:33,354 --> 00:23:38,374
way in which it can occur. the other is structural discrimination.

262
00:23:38,374 --> 00:23:43,614
the structure of our policies and contacts to latitude and a journalist

263
00:23:43,614 --> 00:23:48,654
of discrimination that operates through the statement as personal states. a little bit more about

264
00:23:48,654 --> 00:23:54,014
your twenty days. there's evidence about direct discrimination against people with mental

265
00:23:54,014 --> 00:23:59,290
illness that comes from a homeless different kinds of studies.

266
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:04,530
wanted to experiment is like audit studies that are often done. have to I show biased

267
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:09,630
against blacks but other been studies with people with mental illness there's where call

268
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:14,750
backs regarding job openings and people with had a history of mental illness and

269
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:20,510
indicate that. much less likely to call backs and experience.

270
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:26,730
not experimental studies. this guy. his name is dresses and he's really gorgeous.

271
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:31,830
studies were identified people to look just exactly the same with respect to their

272
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:37,170
medical condition but one of them happens to have schizophrenia together or not and what kind of Mark

273
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:42,730
Cario for treatment the for Mark Carrion fortune that. did they

274
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:48,070
and the people schizophrenic. less desirable time.

275
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:53,810
I'm in and you can ask people who have mental illness. whether they've experienced discrimination

276
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:59,462
and tell you. yes they have. so cross and in multiple ways.

277
00:24:59,462 --> 00:25:04,462
so please just examples about discrimination contract. happy person to

278
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:10,602
person. what about structural discrimination of construction near the

279
00:25:10,602 --> 00:25:16,002
coal fields developed around this especially around sexual minority status. someone

280
00:25:16,002 --> 00:25:21,142
must think a little bit about mental illness. so examples. these are some examples

281
00:25:21,142 --> 00:25:26,542
of structural discrimination about real severe type of mental and schizophrenia.

282
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:31,662
if we think about schizophrenia statement as soon as

283
00:25:31,662 --> 00:25:36,862
there might be less funding for research from there. and for other illnesses. so we know less about

284
00:25:36,862 --> 00:25:42,862
how to prevent it retrieve it. then we would have known if it weren't a statement that

285
00:25:42,862 --> 00:25:48,182
there's less money to provide care and treatment. given the knowledge we currently have. so the ideas

286
00:25:48,182 --> 00:25:53,382
that you develop schizophrenia and you get one set of circumstances but you develop a different

287
00:25:53,382 --> 00:25:58,620
disease heart disease you might get it much different one much better. we talk more

288
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:03,860
we know more about how to deal with this perhaps and extreme

289
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:09,120
structural thing that could have contributed to that situation. nobody in the situation

290
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,560
is doing anything discriminatory and the printer personal situation.

291
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:20,200
it exists in the structure. another way to receive this with mental illnesses.

292
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,920
is often the treatment facilities the boarding care homes and the lights are either isolated

293
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:32,180
or combined areas that don't have the clock to exclude the screw. I know Gary's it don't have to call.

294
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:37,420
called to exclude the group this not in my backyard and India's

295
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:43,280
data rates and crime final exclusions noise and infectious disease or hiring needs are.

296
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:49,060
so someone with mental wellness get fixed. get this exposure. it comes along. because

297
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:54,100
of the type of illness they happen to develop and then it or

298
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:59,200
on a college campus and I thought I'd mention a example of structural statement that

299
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,720
was mentioned by the New York Times recently report on university policies concerning

300
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:11,780
mental health leave. and this is a very complicated and difficult

301
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:16,960
thing to deal with. but the complaint was that some universities

302
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,720
had an active policies. since kids off. when the kids themselves.

303
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,020
okay for a more moderate kind of response on that.

304
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:33,120
once they came in acknowledge that they had suicidal ideation or something like that. this

305
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,288
system took over and there they were excluded they were prefer to have something

306
00:27:38,288 --> 00:27:43,348
more modern models in between. in terms of response this is concern with

307
00:27:43,348 --> 00:27:49,508
decreased people's willingness to come talk to one of the policies that governance.

308
00:27:49,508 --> 00:27:56,028
there's a policy regime student at Eisenman Street and many people who come to college and problems.

309
00:27:56,028 --> 00:28:02,427
so those are some examples of structures time. this signal that operates through the individual

310
00:28:02,427 --> 00:28:07,688
folks or psychological process. this is something that I mention that

311
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:13,148
started working on right in the beginning of my career called and modified

312
00:28:13,148 --> 00:28:18,307
labeling theory. it is necessary to try to account for disadvantage constantly

313
00:28:18,307 --> 00:28:24,028
absent. I the great person to person discrimination. so we got it

314
00:28:24,028 --> 00:28:29,228
working absence from one person doing something to another. the idea wasn't

315
00:28:29,228 --> 00:28:34,388
there and he believes about whether most people will do value discriminate against

316
00:28:34,388 --> 00:28:40,499
people with mental wellness and that this is become personally relevant with mental this develops on

317
00:28:40,499 --> 00:28:45,719
and labeling official labeling say by psychiatric hospitalization occurs.

318
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:50,899
so well like to explain this is but you can imagine. to Bruce likes Bruce like one

319
00:28:50,899 --> 00:28:55,959
and Bruce to Bruce like one wrestling to both grew up in the context of

320
00:28:55,959 --> 00:29:01,179
our society. in Brewster we both got this idea about well if I developed a mental

321
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:07,319
illness. run into a psychiatric hospital and you know I was gonna ask for Jay.

322
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:12,759
the person was I it. maybe a little reluctant. if they knew about my sister.

323
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:17,799
would most women be a little reluctant to date Bruce like one would

324
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:22,819
most employers be hesitant about hiring Bruce like that

325
00:29:22,819 --> 00:29:28,039
that occurred. so we had this idea about my existing in the current

326
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:33,259
society. Bruce like one never develops about the loan. worst personally

327
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:38,345
to test and then becomes personally wrote to me.

328
00:29:38,345 --> 00:29:43,526
it's not just about what how most people might treat someone illness. that's how most

329
00:29:43,526 --> 00:29:48,766
people might treat me and I make them become unhappy that I've

330
00:29:48,766 --> 00:29:53,825
developed this condition and others. I look down on on now Tuesday. I

331
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:58,965
wanna hire. I wanna allow them to their neighborhood. this kind of thing. I'm

332
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:04,266
I feel depressed. your father machine at least

333
00:30:04,266 --> 00:30:09,485
some of the person like to see what we feel that way and I call. bye. withdrawing.

334
00:30:09,485 --> 00:30:14,545
bye. not asking for the day being afraid to go for the job interview. sort of hell

335
00:30:14,545 --> 00:30:19,665
holding back because I'm fearful. perhaps rightfully that I might ask

336
00:30:19,665 --> 00:30:24,845
experience discrimination and then if you have the feeling that maybe

337
00:30:24,845 --> 00:30:30,026
others you can look down on you. then your confidence might be running you might actually not

338
00:30:30,026 --> 00:30:35,237
be perform as well as a job this a beautiful social psych

339
00:30:35,237 --> 00:30:40,797
experiments. that is just damaged demonstrated. just that going on.

340
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:45,917
so that's a waste take look get her too. even if there's no

341
00:30:45,917 --> 00:30:51,417
person to person direct discrimination from others. I know it's been

342
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:57,337
pretty strongly related to a lot of how come. someone did in that analysis

343
00:30:57,337 --> 00:31:02,617
and the quote was in covered in striking in regards to a negative relationship between

344
00:31:02,617 --> 00:31:07,897
internal eyes doing and arrange a cycle social variables. hope self esteem

345
00:31:07,897 --> 00:31:13,117
and the nineteen study the average correlation self-esteem with negative. four six

346
00:31:13,117 --> 00:31:18,137
and it's fairly strong Association. so the

347
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:23,297
main application of I just told you that Madeline was doing. operates I it

348
00:31:23,297 --> 00:31:28,437
multiple level person personal discrimination structural level and

349
00:31:28,437 --> 00:31:33,504
at this within the person. I love

350
00:31:33,504 --> 00:31:38,563
so response that we might have to miss an exam should be mounted. if this

351
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:44,143
multiple well because especially with final cost thinking in your head.

352
00:31:44,143 --> 00:31:49,563
if you don't address them all the other one will become stronger.

353
00:31:49,563 --> 00:31:54,884
so what's happening in. with respect to interventions people with mental

354
00:31:54,884 --> 00:32:01,423
to try to address their on feeling a signature patient room.

355
00:32:01,423 --> 00:32:06,884
self esteem when that does occur.

356
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:12,543
I tried to have such an intervention when I first had the opportunity

357
00:32:12,543 --> 00:32:17,624
to do so. I have no idea what to do to try to help people

358
00:32:17,624 --> 00:32:23,423
with. so I tried everything. I guess I call the it kitchen sink

359
00:32:23,423 --> 00:32:28,943
and we did it in a club house setting which is setting up rehabilitation

360
00:32:28,943 --> 00:32:34,177
for people with mental illness. and we included

361
00:32:34,177 --> 00:32:39,537
in the intervention. identifying students are helping people with severe mental illness. identifies

362
00:32:39,537 --> 00:32:44,617
that string marrow we just waiting in the office in Manhattan. the dentist may happen up

363
00:32:44,617 --> 00:32:49,957
and call you when I called other people in before you

364
00:32:49,957 --> 00:32:55,117
you know it is was what your experiencing pre- costing.

365
00:32:55,117 --> 00:33:00,557
I would try to answer social support remarks that the patients themselves about

366
00:33:00,557 --> 00:33:05,557
helping each other cope with testing scripts to address this thing. well if

367
00:33:05,557 --> 00:33:10,777
you go when you think you're gonna do for a job interview or job

368
00:33:10,777 --> 00:33:15,847
application figure out what you're gonna say are you gonna not tell about your history mental

369
00:33:15,847 --> 00:33:21,527
illness. and if you are get comfortable and if you are gonna tell figure out a story

370
00:33:21,527 --> 00:33:26,747
to tell this yes happens to me sometimes I get up this is mental illness.

371
00:33:26,747 --> 00:33:31,927
but I'm a good worker. and if you gimme a chance. I'll

372
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:36,967
really work hard and so I have that story ready for the employer

373
00:33:36,967 --> 00:33:42,267
and storage all this and it's only sale. we randomly assigned

374
00:33:42,267 --> 00:33:47,487
to intervention or a wait list and it could have been low power. but this is all that I have money

375
00:33:47,487 --> 00:33:52,627
for another about forty per group and we look at everything. I didn't

376
00:33:52,627 --> 00:33:58,007
even get type on Eric to work for me. I just the twenty things you know none of them came

377
00:33:58,007 --> 00:34:03,087
out significant nothing and I showed this to the people who helped me put on the intervention

378
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:08,587
there were several screws I didn't believe the results. they were sure the intervention was working

379
00:34:08,587 --> 00:34:13,643
and people in the context want to keep doing it in the fact they did

380
00:34:13,643 --> 00:34:18,683
they said well we gotta wait longer. do laundry to do a follow up then the City of Jackson.

381
00:34:18,683 --> 00:34:23,763
we did that and still still no fax. so I was completely humbled on that

382
00:34:23,763 --> 00:34:28,943
and I decided to never try to do an intervention that I design intervention

383
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:34,703
myself again. so it was humbling but others are going on to try to

384
00:34:34,703 --> 00:34:40,003
use principal the and people were better at doing event to see

385
00:34:40,003 --> 00:34:46,383
if they could help you with the self testing about how people with mental and some.

386
00:34:46,383 --> 00:34:52,022
my responses is testing in a way that would help.

387
00:34:52,022 --> 00:34:57,643
this Mitch guy child be review these studies for fourteen studies. it shows significant

388
00:34:57,643 --> 00:35:03,282
post intervention reductions in the cell signal. you know

389
00:35:03,282 --> 00:35:08,763
not as bad effect on self esteem a while and. but the FX sizes were kinda small

390
00:35:08,763 --> 00:35:14,574
from point two two medium point five so something there but it was making the

391
00:35:14,574 --> 00:35:19,574
sauce to go away. only two of the seven studies directed towards people with

392
00:35:19,574 --> 00:35:24,994
psychosis students. it's also wasn't crossed off people's

393
00:35:24,994 --> 00:35:30,474
mental illnesses. and then there was a little evidence in the study is about a long lasting

394
00:35:30,474 --> 00:35:35,635
benefits. so we're making progress. yes

395
00:35:35,635 --> 00:35:41,655
but certainly no major breakthrough. as as a time of two thousand twelve in this review.

396
00:35:41,655 --> 00:35:46,794
later. one of the creative guys is trying to address this is regarding

397
00:35:46,794 --> 00:35:52,415
for so. did a review himself and responded to the two thousand twelve.

398
00:35:52,415 --> 00:35:57,534
med analysis. what I left in the last two years we've got these really clever

399
00:35:57,534 --> 00:36:02,854
ways to try to address. I saw statement people smells

400
00:36:02,854 --> 00:36:07,915
and they add these programs that have been developed that were you know that we did

401
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:13,969
a bunch better job than I had done for example. they had manuals about how to use the therapy

402
00:36:13,969 --> 00:36:19,049
and so on and so he is more optimistic he says these things are gonna happen and

403
00:36:19,049 --> 00:36:25,229
they're gonna happen through two kinds of principals that are being implemented took they from psychology

404
00:36:25,229 --> 00:36:30,588
cycle agent and educational and cognitive restructuring through Cardinal Cardinal

405
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:35,688
behavioral techniques to help people with mental illness. get rid of the bad thoughts

406
00:36:35,688 --> 00:36:40,928
and think more positive thoughts and then narrative story and had a optimism

407
00:36:40,928 --> 00:36:46,029
for these new approaches. then the most recent review I was found the first

408
00:36:46,029 --> 00:36:51,368
one. it but came out more customers day after. including the results of some of the studies

409
00:36:51,368 --> 00:36:56,388
that used to use positive things that you and I should have been

410
00:36:56,388 --> 00:37:02,148
optimistic about. you came out a little bit more negative thankfully

411
00:37:02,148 --> 00:37:07,309
grandma's controlled studies that involved individuals with identified DSM

412
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:12,469
disorders. if ask for small or non- existent and they excluded

413
00:37:12,469 --> 00:37:17,710
their review this is somatic review found insufficient evidence on the effectiveness

414
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:23,051
of interventions. to reduce else taking people with mental loans.

415
00:37:23,051 --> 00:37:28,250
so there's how that is kind of gone in years.

416
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:33,311
my summary of it. there been groceries approaches to try to address listing and

417
00:37:33,311 --> 00:37:38,910
people serious are now. they've been based on principles of change.

418
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:44,271
that should have worked their reviews so far mixed on how optimistic Mister passing this

419
00:37:44,271 --> 00:37:49,851
should be about the results so far. I have my own criticism

420
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:54,890
of what's happening although I sort of don't deserve it having to my own account. address

421
00:37:54,890 --> 00:38:02,071
the issue but that there's been too much emphasis on the internal position.

422
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:07,190
that they're all these other processes you don't have to take in the stereo types and believes in to

423
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:13,138
be true about you that you are a dangerous person. you are incompetent

424
00:38:13,138 --> 00:38:18,178
even if you don't except those jury types is true about yourself. you still have to deal with

425
00:38:18,178 --> 00:38:23,178
the anticipation that others mine. so you might have to worry that others are thinking these

426
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:28,178
things about you and deal and not ongoing. constant stress

427
00:38:28,178 --> 00:38:33,178
and that should also be part of your and then I thought there should be

428
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:38,178
more organic involvement in people with mental this is themselves

429
00:38:38,178 --> 00:38:43,698
and more in there. what they try to do themselves to resist and you know there's

430
00:38:43,698 --> 00:38:48,778
Peggy towards some of you may know has done some really superb work on conceptual

431
00:38:48,778 --> 00:38:54,418
lies. how do people organic we tried but no that's not me.

432
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:59,658
are. I'm not excepting this definition of me and

433
00:38:59,658 --> 00:39:04,938
I managed to me that way. what about changing public to public

434
00:39:04,938 --> 00:39:10,198
stake. and what about changing lease the with the individual level. and then

435
00:39:10,198 --> 00:39:15,746
at the population. and then what can and we'll talk about contact

436
00:39:15,746 --> 00:39:20,866
with people who have experienced a mental. so what about changing

437
00:39:20,866 --> 00:39:26,026
public conception. can we do this. major effort is being made

438
00:39:26,026 --> 00:39:31,086
over the past six decades or so. just to move mental health conditions away

439
00:39:31,086 --> 00:39:36,086
from being viewed in a social DV it's framework to an illness.

440
00:39:36,086 --> 00:39:41,126
so they're not just bad people. there are people with an illness. and we should

441
00:39:41,126 --> 00:39:46,326
see it that way and that's gonna reduce the signal. so that people

442
00:39:46,326 --> 00:39:51,489
could just please tell is this like other illnesses. not individual feelings but this is

443
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:56,948
biological and genetic bases and that they are amenable to treatment by professionally

444
00:39:56,948 --> 00:40:01,948
trained person. then this thing is gonna be reduced it will go away.

445
00:40:01,948 --> 00:40:07,308
and one of the bases of this production. is our tradition series from psychology.

446
00:40:07,308 --> 00:40:12,708
so I should be reaching serious as a person watching for over the cost of his or her spring

447
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:17,888
coverage has her signal type characteristics. others are gonna respond by reducing the line.

448
00:40:17,888 --> 00:40:24,408
it's not their fault they didn't make this happen. reduce anger and and increase thirty.

449
00:40:24,408 --> 00:40:29,729
I'm not sure like to be petty but that's for the serious as reduce punishment and increased helping.

450
00:40:29,729 --> 00:40:34,848
so that if we can move it to something that the person didn't control that maybe you can reduce

451
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:39,928
this spring. so Jeanette I got to be straight back to the Russians should lead to these

452
00:40:39,928 --> 00:40:45,749
positive jobs. it's just has a genetic basis. it's not your

453
00:40:45,749 --> 00:40:50,749
jeans that were telling you. does that reduce statement associated with

454
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:55,779
mental we so reviewed the studies that looked at genetic the because

455
00:40:55,779 --> 00:41:00,779
and latch things and stick them out and

456
00:41:00,779 --> 00:41:05,879
we looked at Stegman ties. this is Mike Tice director of tax to recording

457
00:41:05,879 --> 00:41:11,619
and review. mainly metals but also stuttering obesity homosexuality

458
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:16,740
blindness is in cancer and we found a twenty five studies.

459
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:21,839
you see there searching which terminal twelve non- experimental. but what

460
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:28,099
we found was the two students are testing the problem with the individual level and lease.

461
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:33,559
just the seem study to be a wash on social distance would you want you know rack with the person

462
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:39,039
who has the estimate I status seven. I had to hire social assistance

463
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:44,199
for is students the lower social distance and seven. no significant

464
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:49,459
expected all of their randomly varying whether a person was described

465
00:41:49,459 --> 00:41:55,337
as a cause of their problem. being genetics and

466
00:41:55,337 --> 00:42:00,397
same thing a mix that comes with respect to stereo. if you're interested in

467
00:42:00,397 --> 00:42:05,938
predictability. so I do individual level. not much impact in this

468
00:42:05,938 --> 00:42:11,357
effort. just say that these are genetically illness based

469
00:42:11,357 --> 00:42:16,537
on disease. what about the population trends overtime.

470
00:42:16,537 --> 00:42:21,917
so this is been happening. this is effort an to convince the public

471
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:26,917
mental law smells like others you gotta go for treatment. I we compared.

472
00:42:26,917 --> 00:42:32,497
we did to cross sectional surveys in nineteen ninety six and two thousand and six.

473
00:42:32,497 --> 00:42:37,657
using the general social service. they're nationally representative samples of about fourteen

474
00:42:37,657 --> 00:42:42,857
hundred people. one in nineteen ninety six. and another in two thousand six and our method

475
00:42:42,857 --> 00:42:48,037
was to give people descriptions of mental disorders. been yet.

476
00:42:48,037 --> 00:42:53,094
and one the of forms randomly assigned to each responder and then

477
00:42:53,094 --> 00:42:58,333
we wanna what did we find about changes between nineteen ninety six and

478
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:03,333
two thousand six we found out that public was more much more likely to

479
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:08,973
identify genetics as a cost of mental illness. seeing just mental illnesses

480
00:43:08,973 --> 00:43:14,333
and biological terms. I was referred to me as a chemical imbalance in the brain.

481
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:19,354
I went up over time. public was more likely to suggest medical and psychiatric

482
00:43:19,354 --> 00:43:24,633
treatment for the people we described as having mental illnesses and

483
00:43:24,633 --> 00:43:30,114
more likely to suggest medications to treat them. so the medical model is being taught

484
00:43:30,114 --> 00:43:35,133
to the public. we found. so then the idea had been that one might

485
00:43:35,133 --> 00:43:40,293
of thought that student would have decreased final reductions and storage racks. but we found

486
00:43:40,293 --> 00:43:45,374
no drugs reductions in stereo types of dangerous this is in confidence.

487
00:43:45,374 --> 00:43:50,893
no change in the desire to wanna keep away from people with me don't as soon as

488
00:43:50,893 --> 00:43:56,562
you know in our finding wasn't hey just us. got other Nations around

489
00:43:56,562 --> 00:44:02,941
the world. these two guys. sure missing.

490
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:08,062
but he is anger Myer. looked at. want to do studies and since check settings in Europe

491
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:13,361
and United States. and what you see is they read about

492
00:44:13,361 --> 00:44:18,861
this time. what is the proportion saying

493
00:44:18,861 --> 00:44:24,102
that it's likely inherited or genetic problem. so for schizophrenia. we're

494
00:44:24,102 --> 00:44:29,421
in a black on black top in each country has a characterization there.

495
00:44:29,421 --> 00:44:34,481
but pretty consistently in every country over time. do you believe

496
00:44:34,481 --> 00:44:39,781
that. it's gets running a genetically inherited. when I went up in the US.

497
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:45,082
and then the other countries as well. and significantly so. also for depression

498
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:50,201
when we described pressure and in terms of when there was a brain disease

499
00:44:50,201 --> 00:44:55,296
went up for both of those disorders across these different countries

500
00:44:55,296 --> 00:45:01,736
and treatment surgery. should you see a psychiatrist when propose conditions.

501
00:45:01,736 --> 00:45:06,896
all these country study and should you use drug treatment went up. for all

502
00:45:06,896 --> 00:45:11,916
these all these countries. you see that for using drugs

503
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:17,056
not I'm it's sure worth pop. interesting finding. what about it to do

504
00:45:17,056 --> 00:45:22,336
anything for the people's willingness to interact with someone who has a. mental

505
00:45:22,336 --> 00:45:27,536
you well would expect with the medical invention idea that it would have improve. but

506
00:45:27,536 --> 00:45:32,596
if anything was found across to Eastern countries. was it just the opposite for

507
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:38,635
schizophrenia. they actually less likely to except the person as a coworker

508
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:43,796
less likely to except the person is as a neighbor. sort of lack depression. didn't

509
00:45:43,796 --> 00:45:49,216
do any good. didn't seem to do any harm. so what the big population level. this message

510
00:45:49,216 --> 00:45:54,676
isn't working so what are we we what say about proposing

511
00:45:54,676 --> 00:46:00,135
mental mail just like any other. we have been enormously successful in changing public

512
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:05,135
knowledge at least about nine almost. but only in front of me. what how

513
00:46:05,135 --> 00:46:10,396
their cost course area types of dangerous this incompetence may remain strong

514
00:46:10,396 --> 00:46:15,396
and perhaps even stronger than they were decades ago. so each. our conclusion is

515
00:46:15,396 --> 00:46:20,716
we can address these problems for the message. we've already delivered mental sister

516
00:46:20,716 --> 00:46:25,795
illnesses with biological and genetic causes. they can be treated. those are important

517
00:46:25,795 --> 00:46:30,803
messages in themselves. but they do not solve the problems. your what do you

518
00:46:30,803 --> 00:46:36,224
want. bye. oh I should shut up pretty quick.

519
00:46:36,224 --> 00:46:41,464
I'm. I'll talk fast over this. so

520
00:46:41,464 --> 00:46:47,224
we did a study in Texas I wish had I more more time for this but we did a study in Texas.

521
00:46:47,224 --> 00:46:52,424
we school kids. and we found that if we focus not just one illness

522
00:46:52,424 --> 00:46:57,464
mental illnesses illness. and that's the message that needs treatment. we also

523
00:46:57,464 --> 00:47:02,864
included ideas about the kids being more be tired. but I understanding

524
00:47:02,864 --> 00:47:08,023
of kids to have these problems. then we were able to show the kids over

525
00:47:08,023 --> 00:47:13,184
time and it lasted for two years. the topic of our intervention group. and the others

526
00:47:13,184 --> 00:47:18,344
are compared or interventions or no intervention at all. and we were we were able to

527
00:47:18,344 --> 00:47:23,904
improve their knowledge and attitude over two years and reduce their

528
00:47:23,904 --> 00:47:29,273
their their Ross groups and reduce their social social this

529
00:47:29,273 --> 00:47:34,413
hey and we got kids you had mental health problems. to be more likely going to get help for this

530
00:47:34,413 --> 00:47:39,473
problem.

531
00:47:39,473 --> 00:47:44,653
so the conclusion from that study we focus on directly addressing something that appropriate

532
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:49,653
my stage. we maybe able to produce moderate lasting change.

533
00:47:49,653 --> 00:47:54,793
what about contact. contact is been. this is the one

534
00:47:54,793 --> 00:47:59,993
this work the best especially with older. there's a long history of this

535
00:47:59,993 --> 00:48:06,053
the role of contacting prejudice and discrimination race relations relations

536
00:48:06,053 --> 00:48:11,193
challenges. search rates helps to break down this stand cattle position. it's

537
00:48:11,193 --> 00:48:16,373
easy person to person just like you. there's a robust effect of contact in respect

538
00:48:16,373 --> 00:48:21,493
of mental illness as well. this is as a result of a matter of Nelson for somebody very

539
00:48:21,493 --> 00:48:27,185
famous Patrick Corgan and the bottom line here

540
00:48:27,185 --> 00:48:32,585
this is your number and my studies contact at the bigger point.

541
00:48:32,585 --> 00:48:38,125
three one three three versus trying to educate people

542
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:43,645
point one five. South contacts seems to work and Pat Corrigan

543
00:48:43,645 --> 00:48:48,865
has the idea this is really the solution to this. it's to create press two. mendel

544
00:48:48,865 --> 00:48:54,605
and sticks is to create a solution move. please contact us powerful

545
00:48:54,605 --> 00:48:59,765
concern but string believe people not to disclose. so sitting right next to us

546
00:48:59,765 --> 00:49:04,865
might be a person who's had a mental mess but they got they don't disclose it. so the contract doesn't

547
00:49:04,865 --> 00:49:10,245
affect us. so his idea is to create a solution with support. any

548
00:49:10,245 --> 00:49:15,905
titles are coming out crap. I backed up with.

549
00:49:15,905 --> 00:49:20,945
and I like the social movement idea because it says we're not gonna solve this once well. it's

550
00:49:20,945 --> 00:49:26,591
probably gonna take time and his lover. making you work this contact

551
00:49:26,591 --> 00:49:31,711
between people who have animals and people who does. sort of assuming swimming

552
00:49:31,711 --> 00:49:36,851
upstream as far reaching consequences influence in multiple outcomes.

553
00:49:36,851 --> 00:49:42,431
through multiple American motivation is students to tries cheat people down in a way.

554
00:49:42,431 --> 00:49:47,551
may lead to the replacement of mechanisms and the fundamental cost relationships. this is James

555
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:52,731
Digman Ford. just been a job. string operates on multiple levels

556
00:49:52,731 --> 00:49:57,891
approach to addressing metals. Sigman and it's efforts to reduce

557
00:49:57,891 --> 00:50:03,251
substance coverage change public exceptions and efforts to use contact

558
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:08,531
to reduce public students. we conclude it's hard but there's some progress

559
00:50:08,531 --> 00:50:15,571
has been made. and I wanted to conclude by reading this

560
00:50:15,571 --> 00:50:20,931
quote and you're supposed to guess where the call conference came from. how

561
00:50:20,931 --> 00:50:26,171
long ago it occurred. I think that we must also really recognize that when we talk

562
00:50:26,171 --> 00:50:31,337
about the long run names of mental health education. we're talking about offering

563
00:50:31,337 --> 00:50:37,357
about a variable resolutions and people's ideas about some very fundamental questions.

564
00:50:37,357 --> 00:50:42,537
this change kinda change can occur and I'm certainly not here today to offer

565
00:50:42,537 --> 00:50:47,577
counseling. just spare tire. I would only suggest that fundamental

566
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:52,657
changes are slowly and painfully. she's usually far too slowly to satisfy the

567
00:50:52,657 --> 00:50:58,397
people are who laboring to bring them about. bye-bye. press five facing squarely.

568
00:50:58,397 --> 00:51:04,177
you normally did the test. we will all be more proud of her at the very least last appointed.

569
00:51:04,177 --> 00:51:09,777
disappointed in this illusion by the relatively small changes that can be achieved.

570
00:51:09,777 --> 00:51:14,957
in any one year or even five. so

571
00:51:14,957 --> 00:51:20,337
what I guess I could've written this yesterday.

572
00:51:20,337 --> 00:51:26,377
it's a person name Shirley starting to do the first nationwide study knowledge of attitudes and beliefs

573
00:51:26,377 --> 00:51:31,543
in the United States ninety fifth Richie Road that. is nineteen fifty five than more

574
00:51:31,543 --> 00:51:36,563
sixty years ago and as I said I could. yes yesterday. so what she

575
00:51:36,563 --> 00:51:43,623
said that is we have to be in this for the long. she advised us that way right back.

576
00:51:43,623 --> 00:51:49,063
that said if I step in the Shirley Star shoes my shoes. you know pick your own

577
00:51:49,063 --> 00:51:55,083
deal. so I'm in my yet. I use my studies came from her.

578
00:51:55,083 --> 00:52:00,483
if I step in to her shoes. I think she would. she been here.

579
00:52:00,483 --> 00:52:05,543
been very depressed. we've accomplished over these years. the lost

580
00:52:05,543 --> 00:52:10,763
because of her vision would have allowed her to see the progress. it's a little hard for us.

581
00:52:10,763 --> 00:52:16,783
just to see answer some suggestions I had

582
00:52:16,783 --> 00:52:23,863
is to recognize that the effective thing we can send out the multiple options. Kyle comes

583
00:52:23,863 --> 00:52:29,223
from the fundamental college trip. be attentive to the new various processes that might respond

584
00:52:29,223 --> 00:52:34,467
to your progress anyways Regina this is Doctor sire. ask what makes the effects

585
00:52:34,467 --> 00:52:39,547
dissipate with time. keep in touch with those from the multiple levels discussion fashion

586
00:52:39,547 --> 00:52:45,147
your and intervention at multiple levels and try to facilitate their working in concert.

587
00:52:45,147 --> 00:52:50,387
you know I forgot the structural level. ask our mental health leave policies of schools

588
00:52:50,387 --> 00:52:55,467
for example. to make sure that you're the right purposes. the from

589
00:52:55,467 --> 00:53:00,867
self-esteem intervention program. adopt some of the principals of the cognitive behavioral American

590
00:53:00,867 --> 00:53:06,187
from. and also consider our nursing student assistance

591
00:53:06,187 --> 00:53:12,012
and identity approaches work people it's this Madeline is Natalie's support

592
00:53:12,012 --> 00:53:17,392
and friend of public string approach. changing constructions about it because

593
00:53:17,392 --> 00:53:22,692
causes too genetic and by logic ones and trying to emphasize the mental losses now. this like know you

594
00:53:22,692 --> 00:53:27,912
any other unlikely to pre- productive in reducing statement. if you wanna

595
00:53:27,912 --> 00:53:33,532
changing the prices focus on this statement as processes themselves. understanding

596
00:53:33,532 --> 00:53:39,472
tolerance and discouraging bowling. I what can do our taxes and then use contact.

597
00:53:39,472 --> 00:53:45,272
it seems to work in concert ways that I contact might naturally occur more frequently

598
00:53:45,272 --> 00:53:50,472
as in Tom Corgan is coming out from and from the conclusion

599
00:53:50,472 --> 00:53:55,532
about it's hard to change statement Shirley Starks. considered framing your first and social

600
00:53:55,532 --> 00:54:00,712
movement turns modeling. when if and possible on lessons from like the cigarettes

601
00:54:00,712 --> 00:54:05,952
movement. the major movement and lesbian Gay bisexual trans gender

602
00:54:05,952 --> 00:54:11,162
rights movement remember stores and results today. be being patient

603
00:54:11,162 --> 00:54:24,082
persistent and. thank you.

604
00:54:24,082 --> 00:54:29,102
I left you a couple of minutes to tell me. I

605
00:54:29,102 --> 00:54:34,802
hope it wasn't too much on new phone. Mission Bay brought her back.

606
00:54:34,802 --> 00:54:42,462
anyway I thought. okay.

607
00:54:42,462 --> 00:55:28,383
okay. bye

608
00:55:28,383 --> 00:55:33,383
yeah yeah yeah exactly. that's why I

609
00:55:33,383 --> 00:55:38,583
ended up with the social movements because if you think about how to respond

610
00:55:38,583 --> 00:55:43,723
to North Carolina I think it was lost about gays and lesbians

611
00:55:43,723 --> 00:55:48,844
and how business is that we're not going there. so that's power not

612
00:55:48,844 --> 00:55:54,983
resulted from Student the oriented movement. and you know. so

613
00:55:54,983 --> 00:56:00,083
bringing up our part in. it is really important that you're right

614
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:05,103
in terms of the kinds of interventions are doing with mental illness. they're having been with

615
00:56:05,103 --> 00:56:11,916
the folks on our direct.

616
00:56:11,916 --> 00:56:17,356
there used to be in social psychiatry. just was trying to make wars more democratic

617
00:56:17,356 --> 00:56:23,916
and things like that. which gave power to people on the board. but that hasn't been

618
00:56:23,916 --> 00:56:29,056
too too prominently at least in blue jewelry. but that would've been

619
00:56:29,056 --> 00:56:34,496
so much trying to change power. they do those interventions and then the infection go away Susan.

620
00:56:34,496 --> 00:57:05,836
social psychologist believe. but yeah.

621
00:57:05,836 --> 00:57:12,144
yeah. yeah well some of the matter now since over we're fairly short period.

622
00:57:12,144 --> 00:57:17,624
you know like ten years. what but you're saying is that there maybe should be more attention

623
00:57:17,624 --> 00:57:22,664
and those matter allergies and to the temporal and folding things that what

624
00:57:22,664 --> 00:57:33,024
you're saying.

625
00:57:33,024 --> 00:57:38,864
yeah. yeah yeah yeah.

626
00:57:38,864 --> 00:57:44,384
no actually know that doesn't happen. it is it you know this is intervention.

627
00:57:44,384 --> 00:57:49,384
you might have a little one year follow up and that's point on that and then

628
00:57:49,384 --> 00:57:54,644
I don't know. so yeah I think

629
00:57:54,644 --> 00:57:59,884
that I'm seeing these things over to Broad Street.

630
00:57:59,884 --> 00:58:05,284
you if have any you know Connie needs this is Brooke

631
00:58:05,284 --> 00:58:10,734
Public Health Public Health change his social movement.

632
00:58:10,734 --> 00:58:15,734
that's your current account. it's my choice. seeing if youse looking

633
00:58:15,734 --> 00:58:22,034
at things much when I think you're asking. looked at and. anyway

634
00:58:22,034 --> 00:59:37,614
good news

635
00:59:37,614 --> 01:00:37,972
yeah right right.

636
01:00:37,972 --> 01:00:44,943
yeah

637
01:00:44,943 --> 01:00:50,043
yeah well just this is just to say this is the first part is you know just had

638
01:00:50,043 --> 01:00:55,663
a signal manager. address is sufficiently about

639
01:00:55,663 --> 01:01:01,543
and the answers now especially somebody needs to be address.

640
01:01:01,543 --> 01:01:06,803
how to think about it there's some ideas about Larry and some ideas about

641
01:01:06,803 --> 01:01:12,483
you know you only work on taxes. each one of those

642
01:01:12,483 --> 01:01:19,723
select for sale in house and how do people

643
01:01:19,723 --> 01:01:24,943
address. so I think that needs a lot of work. and if

644
01:01:24,943 --> 01:01:29,983
one of the things is especially from quantitative one of the rooms because you don't

645
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:36,363
have enough people. so there's that about this message.

646
01:01:36,363 --> 01:01:41,423
that's interesting too. I mean maybe one of you

647
01:01:41,423 --> 01:01:48,675
as soon as you know that should be more broad hey.

648
01:01:48,675 --> 01:01:54,315
maybe you know something like that.

649
01:01:54,315 --> 01:01:59,795
I'll peace. maybe you're talking

650
01:01:59,795 --> 01:02:06,115
about. people in low characters. she just told me.

651
01:02:06,115 --> 01:02:11,375
I don't know I mean maybe that person coming. thanks. you can maybe

652
01:02:11,375 --> 01:02:16,515
just one of things these. here I am. this listen maybe me to you know that.

653
01:02:16,515 --> 01:02:23,135
I don't know. I just thought that maybe true. but just know that that could be useful.

654
01:02:23,135 --> 01:02:28,195
how you might. so I maybe was kinda just this movie. this is

655
01:02:28,195 --> 01:02:33,335
reminder a room with that situation. this message will be a little bit

656
01:02:33,335 --> 01:02:55,661
more sense

657
01:02:55,661 --> 01:02:59,764
hey
