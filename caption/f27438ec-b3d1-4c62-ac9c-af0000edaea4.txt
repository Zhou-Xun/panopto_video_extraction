1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,270
Start to think it's easier to do this here.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:19,710
But my mother, who when she was working, my dad used to go with your father.

3
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:37,050
And then there's like a square dumpling and it's just like, oh, yeah.

4
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,110
Okay. Good morning, everybody. Good morning. So nice.

5
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,760
Quiet storm after the storm.

6
00:00:50,790 --> 00:01:00,290
Yeah. Just enjoy it while it lasts. So Amanda then was going to have an announcement for a few months about the whole.

7
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:06,149
I am here to tell you, I am one of the co-chairs for the nutrition and Spinach Group,

8
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:12,210
and a lot of you have expressed interest in learning Spanish and practicing your conversation skills.

9
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:22,170
So we are having a conversation our next Monday at Speech 1g8 40, which is Public Health Practice Office.

10
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,629
Below our department, we're going to meet at the SBA courtyard at 1132.

11
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,980
All go from there. You can bring your lunch. It will be super casual.

12
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:37,320
You can stay as long as you want. You can learn how to make your plate in Spanish or whatever you want to learn.

13
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,720
It's super show and we'll be there. Thank you very much.

14
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:52,050
So I am still learning everybody's name. So you raise your hand, just say I'm so and so and so I can remember.

15
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,700
Learn the names.

16
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:03,860
So today we're going to be talking about genetics of obesity in animal models, on how many how much do you remember from a little bit of this time?

17
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:09,030
630. A lot. A little. It's about lunch.

18
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:16,530
Okay. Some of this may be some review, but I go into a bit more detail than I've got the richest present.

19
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:25,980
Okay. So today for this, the learning objective is to understand the heritability of obesity based on the adoption and twin studies.

20
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,420
These were the studies done in Sweden. I've done.

21
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:42,700
Part was if you've seen these already identify different types of syndromic and non syndromic monogenic obesity types.

22
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:50,850
And then to understand the use of genome wide association studies or gwas,

23
00:02:51,540 --> 00:03:01,710
identify genetic variation associated with and obesity is much more common syndromic or non syndromic monogenic obesity.

24
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:15,080
And then we'll have a slide on environment interactions that might be on some of how many of you have seen the video on the and their issues.

25
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:21,400
Just maybe I should post it again. I always assumed that when Dave showed something that you all remember it.

26
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:28,120
Oh yeah, we had that document because don't worry about that. We know. We know like that. So I will post that once I felt the note.

27
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:41,890
Okay, to explain James environment interactions and to describe the importance the types of animal models used to study.

28
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,410
Okay.

29
00:03:44,590 --> 00:04:00,100
So as we've talked about, it's a complex phenotype in the population and it's explained by genetics, environment and environment interactions here.

30
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:08,380
And all of these have different influences on the on the phenotype of an individual's BMI.

31
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:17,590
These are complex interactions. And from the population level and from the individual level and molecular level,

32
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:22,330
there's a lot of work being done to understand this complex phenotype.

33
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:30,640
So I'm going to start really simple here in terms of explaining that this is a highly hetero heritable condition

34
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:40,000
and here is a really simple family tree where you have two patients of two parents who have a BMI 30.

35
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,500
So that would correspond to them being both white here.

36
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:55,580
And they have four offspring. And three of the four offspring have obesity when they become adults, whereas only one of the offspring does not.

37
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:06,450
So we know from 20 family studies where we can isolate the influence of genes and environment that we think is a highly heritable condition.

38
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:21,600
It's about 77% heritable. That means that you can predict the risk of having obesity in subsequent generations with an accuracy of about 77%.

39
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:34,230
So knowledge of the family history can be used in order to predict the risk of obesity in subsequent generations.

40
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:43,050
So this information comes from the studies that were published a while ago in 1986.

41
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:51,900
The data came from a work examined in Denmark between 1924 and 1947.

42
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:58,800
So this is a bit dated, but this is the classic study that everybody talks about when they talk about genetics of obesity.

43
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,040
So let me give you a little bit of background in this particular study.

44
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:16,230
You had a lot of records, all detailed records about the adoptees and the parents who adopted them and their biological parents.

45
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:27,150
And in those days, when parents adopted the children, if there were no parents, they would separate them and put them in different households.

46
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:34,470
But this is just going to focus on the adoptive parents and the biological parents on the studies next.

47
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,090
But anyhow, it came from the same databases that twin studies and the families studies.

48
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:49,440
So here you have on the y axis body mass index of the parents going from 21 to 27.

49
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,410
And here you have the adoptee weight class. And they broke this up in kind of nontraditional cutoffs.

50
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:01,560
So here in the beam eyes, and they labeled them in median overweight and obese.

51
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:13,260
One, two, three and four. And here you see the points which represent the, um, the biological females, biological males.

52
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:21,840
And you see that those adoptees who had a thin that were thin, their BMI is shown here.

53
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:34,570
Okay. And as you go up the adoptee weight class, you notice that the biological parents have some kind of grunts.

54
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:41,850
In other words, if the child had the adoptee weight class was in the higher BMI category.

55
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:53,490
So was the BMI class of the parents when they looked at whether or not environment had a strong influence.

56
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,500
They found something very different.

57
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:05,320
So in this particular case, they're looking at the adoptive parents BMI now in relation to the adoptee weight class.

58
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:16,750
And as you can see, we don't see this linear association between the adoptive parents, adoptive females and the adoptive males.

59
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:30,550
So you don't see this relationship with an immediate overweight or obese category indicating that the biological influence of the parents,

60
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:36,970
their genetic background, was a much stronger predictive predictor of the BMI of these children.

61
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:51,130
Another way to test this was now to look at minor psychotic antipsychotics from parents.

62
00:08:51,880 --> 00:09:01,570
And as I mentioned, so when the twins were placed in different homes, they were either reared together or reared apart.

63
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,800
And so here in the table, you have.

64
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:10,300
So this is let me just start all over body mass index and enter pair correlations

65
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,520
and follow psychotic and dicing pairs of twins reared apart work together.

66
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,800
Classic Study 1990 New England Journal of Medicine.

67
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:27,790
So in table one that gives you the body mass index of center pair correlations in modern psychotic adviser John Kerry's twin studied hard together.

68
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,630
And here's a picture of the mother of psychotic twins and psychotic twins.

69
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:44,530
So the modern psychotic twins share 100% of their genetic background, where the psychotic twins share 50% of their genetic background.

70
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:52,210
And in this particular study, they're looking at intermediate correlations of body mass index.

71
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:00,580
So looking at modern psychotic twins, whether they were reared together or reared apart,

72
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:11,829
there was a very strong correlation also indicating here for both men and women, less so for women indicating.

73
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:25,240
And here's a picture of. The correlation was high and so showing that the strong influence of genetics as opposed to environment.

74
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:33,510
And then they looked at the psychotic twin and they found in terms of interplay of correlation and apparent

75
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:39,850
correlation values were much lower non-significant for both and women whether they are reared apart together.

76
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,840
And here is a picture of these psychotic twins.

77
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,410
Obviously differences in their stature, their height and perhaps their body shapes,

78
00:10:52,840 --> 00:11:01,480
indicating that having just this genetic background in the form of psychotic twins is a very strong predictor of BMI later in life.

79
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,150
Yeah, I don't know if I missed it, but what is like reared together, reared apart like loops?

80
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:12,820
Yes. Okay. So they were kids. They were both of the kids were in the home where they were in separate homes.

81
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,750
Don't do that anymore. Yeah. Sure.

82
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:24,720
Yeah. Shirley here and on slide four, you go back to slides.

83
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:31,080
Can you tell me what's a circle?

84
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,700
This is a female and a male. No one.

85
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,640
So you'll only know this would represent. So if both parents.

86
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,440
If both parents had obesity, three of the four children had obesity.

87
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,250
One did not. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Sorry.

88
00:11:54,010 --> 00:12:00,510
You. So here we go.

89
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,560
So there are other important influence influences.

90
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:15,060
Genes can affect that nutrient intake. It can affect food preferences, can affect the size and frequency of meals,

91
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,330
affect your mass arresting of metabolic rate and the energy cost of moderate exercise.

92
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:27,909
And it can also affect whether or not you exercise for all of these things.

93
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:41,940
One of your astrology exercises. Okay, so let's now talk about monogenic versus polyphonic obesity.

94
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:48,780
And this particular graph shows you the influence of genes.

95
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,800
Some are highly penetrant, meaning that they have a very robust effect.

96
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:57,720
And that would be the case for Monogenic obesity.

97
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,279
You have a single gene or a group of genes that are highly penetrant.

98
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:14,160
They have a very strong effect and that the likelihood of them resulting in someone who has obesity is very high.

99
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,580
And there are two types of effect types of genotypes or backgrounds.

100
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,980
One is syndromic and one is non syndromic.

101
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:33,180
After much about some examples, however, when you look at the variant frequency, the frequency in which this occurs, it's very rare.

102
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:42,810
We're talking about one or two in a population of a thousand births, maybe they're 1 to 20 1 to 2 in 22,

103
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:54,660
10 to 20000 births with these types of genetic backgrounds that produce obesity are rare in regard to what common form

104
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:05,580
this is would be would be more common that there are many genes working together that can produce the phenotype.

105
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:16,340
In this case, it's obesity. And these types of interactions are have been predicted, evaluated, analyzed using genome wide association studies.

106
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,190
And let's show you some examples of how that's done here and then.

107
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,430
So let's first look at some examples.

108
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,800
Here's a table showing you non syndromic monogenic chronic disease.

109
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:42,250
So for the non syndromic forms, we have a leptin deficiency, leptin receptor deficiency and some other things here that I've talked about.

110
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:49,719
See deficiency approach converts online of CORDONE for receptor.

111
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,880
And then there are some others that are listed here. And then there are the syndromic forms.

112
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:04,690
It's kind of a really syndrome, artist's vital syndrome syndrome, Wagner syndrome, and this other one.

113
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:09,820
So these are rare, extremely rare.

114
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,770
The non syndromic obesity types are even rarer.

115
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,990
There are only a few of these that have been documented,

116
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:29,140
but we've learned an awful lot from these conditions in terms of what genes do to affect things like food intake and energy expenditure.

117
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:36,380
So. So with the non syndromic forms you have an early onset.

118
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:43,470
So this would be the example of the left intellect in deficiency or policy deficiency.

119
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,089
And even in the pro converting deficiency,

120
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:58,799
you also have this childhood onset and you have different types of influences in the case of left and or less and receptor deficiency,

121
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,590
it's hyper fascia that affects a phenotype. And then some of these are more complex.

122
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:15,840
In the case of the pro deficiency, the Milan of Korten for deficiency is is a result of an early happens during early development.

123
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:24,470
And then you have some other phenotypes that are mentioned here, and I'll go through some of these one step at a time.

124
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:34,389
So let's first talk about the very most common form of syndromic observation.

125
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:39,880
That would be Prader-Willi syndrome. It's fairly rare.

126
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:53,200
One in 10 to 20000 births would have this syndrome, and it's due to a loss of parental chromosome 15 segment.

127
00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:05,260
So many genes are affected here, and it includes an inactivation of a gene that's known to affect energy homeostasis.

128
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:13,330
Michael, too. And the consequence of having this syndrome are numerous.

129
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:21,790
So, yes, you have obesity, but you also have intellectual disability, hypogonadism, short stature and a lot of other things.

130
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:29,320
And in this case, the obesity is due to hyperplasia.

131
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:36,480
So here are some examples of children who have this condition.

132
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:44,820
Here's a girl and a boy. And here's some descriptions of the facial characteristics of these individuals.

133
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:51,990
And she dies on a narrow temple, a thin upper lip turned down mouth.

134
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:59,580
And there are various degrees of being overweight, depending on how well they're cutting their food intake.

135
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:07,530
So this is some of the physical characteristics of this particular syndrome.

136
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,900
So why is there hypoplasia in these individuals? Well, it's complicated.

137
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:20,140
As you can see in this diagram. These individuals are always, always hungry.

138
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:30,940
There is some lag in the hunger response after they've eaten a lot due to that stretch of the McKenna receptors in the gut.

139
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:36,340
But that doesn't last very long. They're very they're hungry all the time, even after a very large meal.

140
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:47,200
So here's what happens. So normally you would have signals coming from the adipose tissue of leptin being one of the most important here.

141
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:56,230
In this case, the the signal now that would tell the brain to stop beating through the leptin mechanism, which we'll talk a bit more later.

142
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:04,190
Is it is it received? Um, there's a delayed sense of satiety as a consequence of this.

143
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,970
Um, and there's hyper fascia and a great amount of food intake.

144
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:15,919
So the signals that would normally activate the nuclei and the para ventricular nuclei in the brain,

145
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,640
the centers that control eating behavior, aren't getting the signal.

146
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:28,700
And there's this constant sense of hunger. There are other things that affect that affect the hunger response to.

147
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,970
So there are other things that are affected.

148
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:39,750
So under signals, there's there's hypogonadism because there's a reduction in thyroid stimulating hormone.

149
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:51,030
There's a reduction in growth hormone. And as a consequence of all of these effects, you have a with basal basal metabolic rate,

150
00:19:52,050 --> 00:20:00,090
low energy expenditure, mostly mass and loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue.

151
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,210
So there's an intense hunger,

152
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:17,760
there's an abnormality in some of the endocrine signals and energy expenditure is reduced and there's an increase in subcutaneous adipose tissue.

153
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:26,700
And then there's the lack of peripheral signals coming from the gut to suppress the hunger response.

154
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,710
So you have probably peptide Y and pancreatic peptide.

155
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:40,290
Those signals produce satiety normally in an individual with either really syndrome, they're not receiving that signal.

156
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,530
What they are receiving now is an elevation and grilling.

157
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,030
The problem is the hunger hormone that is produced by your stomach.

158
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:59,400
And some studies have shown that the ghrelin levels in these individuals are 4 to 5 times above normal.

159
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:09,900
So all of these responses are driving the calorie excess and eventual obesity in these individuals.

160
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:28,740
Yes, a lot of these people are higher metabolism or lower lower, but metabolic rate is reduced.

161
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:35,459
I see. Even though they are always usually the high people, the higher they want,

162
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:45,060
feeding the signaling issue is not because the higher metabolism therefore they want it is that this is a rare genetic condition which this occurs.

163
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:52,679
So the lower thyroid stimulating hormone, a growth hormone, can affect this metabolic rate which is reduced.

164
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:59,390
So there's less energy expenditure in total. Yeah, it's the clarifying question.

165
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,170
So with the left in PE,

166
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:11,310
why is it that the body is making like a normal amount and the brain is just not able to receive that signal or is less being produced?

167
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,300
It's more of a it's more about they're not able to receive the signal.

168
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:29,470
So this if you're a parent, if you're a clinician trying to help somebody with this condition,

169
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:38,379
a lot of these children will develop diabetes, cardiovascular disease, fatty liver disease and so on.

170
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:44,470
As a consequence of having this syndrome, they literally can't stop eating and they will become very, very sick.

171
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:57,129
And to help clinicians, to help parents treat a child with this condition, I recommend this website lead for obesity.

172
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:02,950
Listen, Empower, Advocate and drive change for rare genetic disorders of obesity.

173
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,410
There are some very good information here.

174
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:16,780
Some of you may go into dietetics where your practices are working with the pediatric population and you may see some of these treatments.

175
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,520
This will help guide your practice.

176
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:32,450
There are some videos out here as well. Do you remember a video that Dave Richards had of a child with Prader-Willi syndrome?

177
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:37,850
I'm 630. Anybody remember the video? I can post that as well.

178
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:53,500
So that's syndromic, obviously. And that was an example of one where it is this is syndromic obesity.

179
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,560
Here's human monogenic obesity syndromes.

180
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:04,930
In this particular case, it's one gene that's affected. And the examples that I'm going to give you here is congenital deficiency.

181
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:14,710
And in this case, it's the inability of the person to produce a functional leptin hormone.

182
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:25,880
There's quantitation and truncation of the leptin, and the protein actually is nonfunctional.

183
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,829
The fat produces leptin, but it's a nonfunctional leptin.

184
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:35,770
And as a consequence, brain never received that signal. Extremely rare.

185
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:50,409
It was first identified in the Pakistani and Turkish population and the characteristics were extreme hyper aphasia and interestingly,

186
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:53,860
the inability to discriminate between appetizing and bland foods.

187
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:05,200
So didn't matter with these individuals whether there was highly palatable food or any kind of food available, there still had a drive to consume it.

188
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:15,910
And as a consequence of of this leptin deficiency, they had hot very high levels of insulin.

189
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:20,290
There is also associated with this condition of hypogonadism.

190
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,180
There's a failure for development for children who have this condition.

191
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,150
And other things like advanced bone age and immune abnormalities.

192
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:41,550
Before there was a treatment for this condition, a lot of these individuals who had this kind of a respiratory tract infections.

193
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:51,059
So this was the case before the hormone leptin was discovered and treatment

194
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:57,600
was provided with giving these individual doses of leptin on a daily basis.

195
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:06,810
Yeah, I. Can you clarify, you're saying that you're not able to distinguish the palatable ability.

196
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,840
Speaks. Oh, yes.

197
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:16,320
Yes. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thanks for pointing that out.

198
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,280
Great. Okay. So what is left to do?

199
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:27,510
It's. It's correlated with adipose tissue. The more adipose tissue you have, more leptin you have.

200
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:36,870
We'll talk about this in more detail when we talk about the central nervous system in control of appetite satiety.

201
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,710
But just for now, I have this simple illustration.

202
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:47,110
So your adipose tissue produces left, and it signals the brain.

203
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:56,970
And as a consequence of receiving that signal, your brain is assessing how much peripheral energy stores that you have.

204
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:05,220
And what it should do or what it does under most circumstances is that it shuts down that behavior,

205
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,860
it reduces food intake, and it increases energy expenditure.

206
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:25,020
The individual who has this congenital leptin efficiency and it's not functional leptin is not being produced, so they're not receiving the signal.

207
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:33,960
So as a consequence, there's no break in the system. Food intake is always high and energy expenditure is low.

208
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:45,180
It's reduced in this case. So what might someone look like if they have this condition growth look like on their children?

209
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:58,050
So here's a way curve for the program or the individual with a genetic disorder compared with normal percentiles for girls.

210
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:07,310
Here's age in years and here's waiting KG And here's these growth trajectories because the

211
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:15,030
90th percentile and that individual now who has this lesson deficiency is off the charts.

212
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:24,020
By the age of four and a half, she has a weight of almost 65 kilograms.

213
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:33,440
Now this reduction here represents what happened after she was given injections.

214
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:44,480
In the corner here you see another graph and in this graph you see total fat mass in kilograms and then months of leptin therapy.

215
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:52,520
And after she is given these injections, selected the fat mass declines dramatically.

216
00:28:53,540 --> 00:29:01,370
So after 10 to 15 months now, this level of adiposity levels out.

217
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,140
I have a picture to show you about this child.

218
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:10,960
Here's the child in is five and here's the child.

219
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:14,750
And after 48 months of leptin, 30 at nine years old.

220
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:21,860
So you have certainly less adiposity with leptin treatment.

221
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:35,240
Now. This. It's actually a drug called Metro Left and that they're given it's a modified form of human leptin and

222
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:42,230
it's modified such that it stays in circulation a bit longer than the real leptin protein would be.

223
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:51,290
And it's very effective in treating this condition and normalizes a lot of things in regards to their metabolism.

224
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,810
You know, but there are issues with just any other any kind of drugs, and it's given chronically.

225
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:03,799
I mean, you have to question anything given for someone with obesity to lose weight, even if they don't have that kept in deficiency.

226
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,810
Is there any studies? That's a really good question. So it's a late nineties.

227
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:19,510
A drug company thought the same thing. They thought, okay, we've got a magic bullet, someone what would like to be treated and lose weight.

228
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:28,459
We can just give them injections selected for people who were lean, leaner.

229
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:35,690
I shouldn't say lying. I should say you had a a BMI that was perhaps in the overweight range, 25 to 29.

230
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:42,170
They were somewhat responsive to that therapy for people who had a BMI of 30 and over,

231
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:46,550
they were not responsive, not very responsive or not responsive at all.

232
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:50,660
And it was thought to be due to a concept called leptin resistance.

233
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:58,730
Leptin resistance is a defect, and it's thought to be a defect in a couple of things.

234
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,530
One is the expression of the receptor in hypothalamus.

235
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:07,460
It would go down if you have higher levels of circulating leptin.

236
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:20,420
That's one theory. The other theory is that the signaling of leptin which signals through the JAK stat pathway, that pathway turns off.

237
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:25,890
And become desensitized.

238
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:33,170
And as a consequence, the signal that would normally shut down your appetite is no longer sensitive to select.

239
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:40,140
You would have to supplement with very high levels of leptin to get this get a response where you're actually shutting down that appetite.

240
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:50,490
And this is also what might happen with drinking with this just a few people getting that leptin resistance happen here.

241
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,469
I don't think it does because they can't make it.

242
00:31:55,470 --> 00:32:00,530
And if they cleared it, clear it pretty good, they cleared within hours.

243
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:04,590
In other words. So it's not there after they after a certain period of time.

244
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:10,410
Whereas somebody who has functional leptin, it's always there. Yeah, but that's a good question.

245
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:20,700
There's a physician belief around who developed the therapy for people with congenital dystrophy,

246
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,450
and that's another condition that's treated with leptin injections.

247
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:29,970
And in that case, people have very little or no adipose tissue.

248
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:37,190
So they're kind of leptin deficient. Right. And they have issues with metabolic syndrome.

249
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:45,900
The lipids, instead of going into the adipose tissue, go into the liver and muscle and they develop severe diabetes as a consequence.

250
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:51,390
And when they're treated with leptin, it helps normalize those conditions.

251
00:32:51,870 --> 00:33:06,100
I'll show you lots of information about that later. So now there are also documentation of partial leptin deficiency.

252
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:12,340
So family members, maybe they don't have a 100% nonfunctional leptin.

253
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:20,610
They might have a partial leptin deficiency where they have share the copy, one copy of the little that's functional, one that's not.

254
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:26,770
So they produce less functional leptin and they have a tendency to have a higher BMI.

255
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:35,680
So that would be the heterozygous gene mutation, which is the relatives of the people who have the complete deficiency.

256
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:42,520
And so the other thing,

257
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:49,090
the way you would determine this is if you would measure somebodys body composition and you looked at the leptin levels in their blood,

258
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:54,129
and if you see this discordance between circulating leptin and adipose tissue,

259
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:58,600
it might tell you something about the efficacy of the leptin circulating in your body.

260
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:09,580
So if they have this if they're heterozygous for this, they might have very high levels or they might have disproportionate leptin levels,

261
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,330
too, compared to their amount of adipose tissue that they have.

262
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:26,380
So leptin binds to a receptor and the receptor can also be deficient in some individuals.

263
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:32,410
And this condition is actually more common than an absolute leptin deficiency.

264
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:42,040
So up to 3% of the people with obesity harbored mutations in the leptin receptor.

265
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,750
And perhaps this explains increased appetite in some individuals.

266
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:52,900
And this is that this either is a lack or a loss of function.

267
00:34:53,500 --> 00:35:04,360
So you can be homozygous or heterozygous for the gene, for the left receptor, and this can affect your sensing levels of lt in your in your blood.

268
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:16,930
The way you would determine whether you had a leopard deficiency or a leptin receptor deficiency is that you would observe an early onset of obesity,

269
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:23,050
hypogonadism greater frequency of infections, early childhood.

270
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:29,530
All of these things would be more common in individuals with these genetic abnormalities.

271
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:38,440
So the way leptin was discovered was actually from chance.

272
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:46,900
So here's a wild type. Black six mouse and an adult mouse had about 8 to 12 weeks of age.

273
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:54,010
It's about 20 grams. And here's a mouse, a litter mate of this wild type mouse.

274
00:35:54,820 --> 00:36:04,120
And this mouse has about 50 grams or 60 grams of body mass, and it has a lot more adipose tissue.

275
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,510
And that's because it has not produced leptin.

276
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:20,740
This phenotype was actually discovered by chance in the thirties, where a laboratory that had a large population of mice was breeding the mice,

277
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:29,820
and in one of the cages they found this phenotype and you get this mouse from heterozygous breeding.

278
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:39,400
You can't breathe life in deficient mice. They won't reproduce because you need leptin to produce gonadotropin releasing hormone deficiency.

279
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:46,780
That response isn't there. And as a consequence, they can't reproduce.

280
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:58,660
So you have to breed heterozygous mice. And then the same phenotype in terms of severe obesity is observed with a leptin receptor deficiency.

281
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:04,360
So they're hyper FH if they want to eat all the time, that's the old mouse.

282
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:13,540
But in this case, just like humans, that the leptin is not functional in the mouse, it's a shorter peptide.

283
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:19,870
And the mutation came from it's a spontaneous mutation that was observed in animals.

284
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:34,000
The DVD. The Mouse has similar characteristics and for both types of mice, the type the appearance of the obesity happens very early.

285
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:42,070
4 to 5 weeks, you'll notice a difference in the mice that have this.

286
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:47,020
And this is just regular mouse chow. This is not induced by high fat diet.

287
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:54,309
So 45 to 60 grams of weight by age eight weeks.

288
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:59,590
And these animals I used to have all these animals.

289
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:12,610
They're very expensive. When I had studied them, they were $120 per ounce or something like that, or probably well over 200.

290
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:16,179
So this is a huge investment. If you're big,

291
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:26,650
you're studying leptin deficiency and using this particular model and again with a DB mouse and you'll be able to really get the spontaneous mutation.

292
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:40,090
So there are here's another example of monogenic obesity arising from the disruption of one particular gene.

293
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:47,170
In this case, the gene is within the protein procopio ml and according to work on the C.

294
00:38:50,050 --> 00:39:01,750
So this is a heterozygous mutation of the gene encoding Pompe C present early early onset of obesity due to hyper aphasia.

295
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:06,760
Explain why here in a minute. So here's an impairment in Mylanta.

296
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:23,140
Courtney signaling in the brain. So Pump C is broken down to subsequent molecules that suppress appetite and then the palm C molecule.

297
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:34,120
You also have, um, another hormone that is produced that stimulates the adrenal gland and the adrenal gland.

298
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:41,169
It's important for cortisol production. So individuals who have this deficiency, not only do they have hyper fascia,

299
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:49,570
but they have adrenal insufficiency and they can develop an adrenal crisis if they're not doing even daily tablets of cortisol.

300
00:39:51,910 --> 00:40:05,559
These individuals, because of policy, is being broken down into the stimulating hormone which produce satiety as well as pigment color of your skin.

301
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:11,200
And within your hair, even they lack they're very pale and they'll have red hair and I'll have a picture of that.

302
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:14,860
And it. So what happens?

303
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:23,590
So here's a simplified diagram of looking at less than a gas and how it affects food intake and energy expenditure.

304
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:33,150
So focus on this pathway here. So we'll talk about this inhibitory effect of of leptin on a hunger response.

305
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:37,620
So leptin is transported across the blood brain barrier.

306
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:43,830
It stimulates nerve cells within the hypothalamus.

307
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:47,710
And these nerve cells produce probably online.

308
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:54,510
And these are the same neurons that produce another form of contact here.

309
00:40:54,510 --> 00:41:01,050
And I'll describe that much detail later. But let's just focus on pulses and that can't see now.

310
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:13,140
It's broken down to form alpha MSH and the alpha MSH goes these neural projections project to higher centers in the brain and

311
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:20,700
that alpha MSH stimulates the line of thought for receptors and that suppresses appetite and increases energy expenditure.

312
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:29,100
So leptin still involved. But it's it's the in this case, it's the message that is increased with leptin.

313
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,320
So if somebody can't make policy.

314
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:44,970
Message was left in there and that the neurons within the output nucleus of the hypothalamus are stimulated, but there's no pulse produced.

315
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:49,940
And as a consequence, energy intake, it's still high there.

316
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:53,970
Their appetite is very high and their energy expenditure is low.

317
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:10,580
So what might that look like? And so it's that early onset for children,

318
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:23,590
here's a girl and here's a boy and shares their growth trajectories with their higher than 97th percentile, much higher.

319
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,810
They're off their growth is off the charts, off the chart, I should say.

320
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,219
So this is a growth trajectory of this child.

321
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:41,070
And this chapter, this child, you can see that they have a reddish hair, very pale skin, as a consequence of having this positive.

322
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:50,730
And when this gene is manipulated in mice, you get a similar phenotype.

323
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,200
Here's another mouse model.

324
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:57,630
In this case, it's not in the black six model background.

325
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:03,900
It's in a different background. These are brown mice that have a different color coat.

326
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:10,559
And here's the policy deficient mouse had orange hair on their bellies and they're much

327
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:15,750
bigger than the wild type version or the ones that have normal policy production.

328
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:25,460
Yes. Few of those people who had red hair and very pale skin do.

329
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:29,140
They're all less of a message. They can't.

330
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:36,530
Yeah, the alpha message can't be produced because they lack the gene that has that produces the parent molecule.

331
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:42,790
Yes. When you see the people who they seemed to be not happy.

332
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:48,520
Yeah. So not everybody who has red hair and pale skin will have this deficiency.

333
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:00,809
So what do you do for individuals? Well, we had leptin deficiency.

334
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:09,960
We could give them leptin. I'm not certain what the condition what it's used to treat people with leptin receptor deficiency,

335
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,170
but with people who have poncy deficiency, there's actually a treatment now.

336
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:23,680
So this is a review that was published by Malcolm Lowe.

337
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:30,810
Not a lot of know if he's retired or is still active. He worked up in the diabetes center on North Campus.

338
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,330
And here's a here's a diagram that he provided.

339
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,610
So here's a normal instance. So you have a hunger score.

340
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:46,019
You have the adrenal gland,

341
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:54,690
and you have a scale here and here you have the nucleus of the hypothalamus being

342
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:05,670
activated and producing policy and it's binding to the line of and red for receptor.

343
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:09,650
And that suppresses appetite.

344
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:20,870
And then another molecule that comes off of the Palm Sea molecule, which stimulates the renal gland, which produces cortisol.

345
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:25,550
This is the normal circumstance. A hunger score being three here.

346
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,000
And here's the way from kilogram 60.

347
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:40,910
For somebody who has a Palm Sea deficiency, you have an inability now to produce pump feed and an inability for Alpha MSH,

348
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:48,290
which is a product of Palm State to stimulate the receptor so that the hunger score here is nine.

349
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,190
There's always hunger. There's a consequence of this is hyper patient.

350
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:58,910
And so there's there's also no HGH being produced.

351
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:11,320
And you have very high weight, 150 kilograms and adrenal insufficiency and no cortisol in these individuals.

352
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:17,410
But you can give people hydrocortisone and address that adrenal insufficiency.

353
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:24,070
So recently there was this drug that was produced to address this condition.

354
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:33,250
And as far as I know, it's only used for people who have a policy deficiency, and it's called sentinel at a time.

355
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:38,320
So it's given through an injection, subcutaneous injection.

356
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:51,800
And what it does is that it stimulates the market for receptor, so it suppresses the hunger associated with that possibly deficiency.

357
00:46:54,410 --> 00:47:01,760
So we can give these individual segments at a time and you can give them hydrocortisone so they can get cortisol.

358
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:05,780
And this helps normalize their physiology.

359
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:16,290
You shouldn't give them both the treatment and sympathy.

360
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:19,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

361
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:29,000
It's set up here. That. This is like the cocaine academy.

362
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:34,700
Yes. The card pathway. If we were to give people this life class addiction.

363
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:39,320
Yeah, you wouldn't really want to give people cocaine to suppress their appetite.

364
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:46,490
Yeah, exactly. But the same neurons that respond to that produce pumps see produce to cart.

365
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:57,660
Okay. So that was policy deficiency.

366
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:02,460
And then you have this mutation in the fourth sector.

367
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:09,990
And here's an individual who is deficient that appears to control essentially his brother.

368
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:16,190
So the mutations in the online receptor are fairly more common.

369
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:20,460
5% of patients with severe early onset of obesity in the United Kingdom.

370
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:29,190
So one in a thousand in the population in the United Kingdom. It's it's one gene that's affected here for the middle and, of course, for receptors.

371
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:41,310
And again, if you can't perceive signals through the left hand pathway, in this case, the receptors deficient, you're always hungry in turn.

372
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:46,920
The interesting distinctions between this and other types of phenotypes are these people have a hyper.

373
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:51,520
They have increased lean body mass and bone mineral density.

374
00:48:51,540 --> 00:49:02,820
So suggesting that the empathy for our receptors has a role in these types of physiological outcomes other than increased linear growth,

375
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:07,140
and they also produce an awful lot of insulin.

376
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,709
So these individuals would likely develop at a young age of type two diabetes

377
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:23,180
as a consequence of this receptor deficiency and increase adipose tissue.

378
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:31,790
That's. So protein hormones are complex.

379
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:35,770
They need to be metabolized to produce the active molecule.

380
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:44,809
And there's an enzyme that converts these longer chain peptides like coffee to the active

381
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:52,610
molecules and hormone converts is an enzyme that does this and you can have a condition.

382
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:57,920
And these are very rare of a prior hormone, a pro hormone convert taste deficiency.

383
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:06,920
So this enzyme, again, is essential for creating active hormones.

384
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:14,060
And if somebody had this particular condition, you might observe if you have an early childhood.

385
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:26,090
And one thing that's interesting about this contingent condition is that their level levels of insulin are actually very low.

386
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:35,380
And it turns out that in order to have insulin, it needs to be processed by the same enzyme that Lockhart converts.

387
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:45,590
So the insulin levels would be really high in these individuals, but the levels of active insulin would be very low.

388
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:56,570
So other things that happen, they hypogonadism hypo cholesterol, cortisol, lamia, they have severe diabetes,

389
00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:04,850
they have elevated levels of policy and it's likely because there's a failure to clear policy.

390
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:10,670
So the mechanism here in terms of the hyperplasia is you've got lots of policy,

391
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:17,570
but you don't have any alpha MSH as a consequence of not having this particular converts being active.

392
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:24,890
Yeah. Is but isn't insulin anabolic but also shouldn't increase adipose tissues.

393
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:29,360
Why do we have here obesity? I mean, like we have low insulin levels.

394
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:35,120
So you have very little insulin? No, you have very little you have lots of pro insulin.

395
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:43,490
The obesity here is caused by this this failure to break down into the reactive form.

396
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:51,440
And this actually suppresses the appetite through the energy for our receptor insulin principle.

397
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,450
Guess what? Can you say that again? A slow insulin considered anabolic one has one.

398
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:01,550
It's an inactive it's an inactive form of insulin. Doesn't do.

399
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,890
As far as I know, it doesn't do very much. She?

400
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:17,450
So in regard to the different types of hormones that require processing,

401
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:24,710
the pro home hormone converts not only insulin but and palm C but other neuropeptides

402
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,570
and glucagon like peptide also requires activity from the enzymes as well.

403
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,910
So there are a lot of,

404
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:42,530
of protein hormones that whose action is affected by the lack of of this particular growth hormone could convert taste efficiency.

405
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:57,050
So if you were to compare all of these monogenic rare monogenic forms of obesity and you would look at, um, how they would compare to one another.

406
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:13,710
So here's the body weight of an individual who has this mutation, the pro convertase one three mutation leading to a deficiency in the amount taste.

407
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:25,650
And this young six year old child is off the charts in terms of her weight comparison to the control population.

408
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:29,710
So here are the comparison.

409
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:40,870
So if you had a left and deficient child and you would look at their kilojoules per kilogram of lean mass and this had little energy intake,

410
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:44,410
it would be much, much higher in the case of leptin deficiency.

411
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:50,650
For somebody who has the M.S. for our deficiency, their food intake would be a bit less.

412
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:57,340
The one person in this study who has a pro vertex deficiency, their food intake would be down here.

413
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:08,140
And then here are the controls. So the leptin deficiency is a much more has a much more potent effect on Hyper-V.

414
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:19,630
Yes, no question about that. Previous slide in the last, like Mark says, leaves other neuropathies in group and GLP one.

415
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:28,480
So that's what pro hormone converters does. So if they have a deficiency, they wouldn't you get an inactive form, a healthy one as well.

416
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:34,659
Okay. Sorry, it was just a little confusing because like the prior things describe like things

417
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:38,709
about the individual and then this says something about the enzyme itself.

418
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:51,860
So it's okay. But what actually happens in the. All right.

419
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:54,940
So and there's that there's a mouse model for this.

420
00:54:55,090 --> 00:55:07,840
So carboxylic peptidase e is an enzyme in mice that if they had both copies of this gene or lack of of a carboxylic acid,

421
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:16,240
I should say, they get to be a bit bigger. And in this particular model, it's a late onset of obesity in the mice anyhow.

422
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:26,980
And they get very big and you see the same types of things, very little insulin, a very high level of pro insulin.

423
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:32,800
The neuropeptides and the peptide hormones are in their pro form.

424
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:45,370
So they're not metabolized or not cleaved. They have extreme high levels of insulin and severe diabetes and there are a bunch

425
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:51,819
of peptides are affected in these mice like of course is kind of Amylin as well.

426
00:55:51,820 --> 00:56:03,370
So the signals now that would normally suppress appetite that are coming from these metabolized pro hormones are they're not produced.

427
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:12,339
So that's those are some examples of. So we talk about syndromic obesity and monogenic.

428
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:16,390
Obesity is a rare, high penetrance, very rare.

429
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,490
Now let's talk about poly genic obesity, which is more common.

430
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:31,450
It's a result of many different genes, very modest effect size in terms of what influence each individual genes has on a phenotype.

431
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:35,950
And they interact with the environment with one another.

432
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:50,740
And there are techniques used to discover these genes, and that's the genome linkage analysis, candidate gene studies and genome wide associations.

433
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:55,240
So you have a large group of people with different lives.

434
00:56:55,690 --> 00:57:07,390
You collect a sample from them and you analyze their DNA and you look for associations between BMI and their genotype and.

435
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,390
Samples have been collected from hundreds of thousands of people.

436
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:18,340
So you have people working in this area, hundreds of people.

437
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:22,620
If you look at some of these papers, you'll notice that the bylines are huge.

438
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:31,800
The bylines can be like 100 different investigators. So each one of these investigators might have a dataset with thousands of patients in it,

439
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:37,050
and they combined all of their data in this particular publication.

440
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:46,560
And so you have over 300,000 individuals and they're looking here for genetic variants.

441
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,080
What determines genetic variations?

442
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:58,680
What are the genetic variants and how do they correlate with know having a BMI of 30 or over and or other signs of metabolic disease?

443
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:09,090
So from this study, which was published in 2015, they came up with 97 different loci.

444
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:12,360
And this is associated with increased BMI.

445
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:18,389
And unlike the studies, we're looking at heritability where you know, what your parent's BMI is,

446
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:31,770
are looking at the BMI that all children look at these individual loci, the loci that accounted for the variation of BMI, it's very low, about 2.7%.

447
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:37,230
And when you did calculations to predict, okay,

448
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:49,950
there's these things loci and we see a 2.7% variation and we we come up with a calculation of how they might interact that

449
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:57,450
the amount of variation in BMI that can be accounted for these by these common genetic variations is still very low,

450
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:03,060
about 20, 21%. So how do we do this?

451
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:08,700
First of all, I'm going to go through this very slowly and define some of these things.

452
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:14,399
They identified 97 genome wide, significant loci.

453
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:20,790
So loci is a fixed position on a chromosome and each loci has two alleles.

454
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:27,540
One from each parent and an illegal is a variant of a form of a gene.

455
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:35,969
So 97 loci were associated with BMI and two times 97.

456
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:39,780
That means there's 194 Orioles that were associated with the BMI.

457
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:48,090
And easily those were variants or single nucleotide polymorphisms that were associated with BMI.

458
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:54,220
So graphical form. This is what this looks like.

459
00:59:55,300 --> 01:00:01,070
So how do the 97 different loci explain 2%, 2.7% of the variance?

460
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:06,760
All right. So here's the formula for BMI variance.

461
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:14,340
You squared people say by X minus four, you squared divided by the sum.

462
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:31,330
You represents the mean BMI. And is the total number of individuals over 300,000 and BMI total the total variance 197 loci squared 0.27 or 2.7%.

463
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:36,880
So the genome wide association studies show very little effect.

464
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:48,660
So if we were to look at independent additive effect size of these individual change, it doesn't add up to very much.

465
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:54,660
So these are the different chains here and how the number of loci, can we add them up?

466
01:00:54,690 --> 01:01:01,440
Yes, we get an increase in the cumulative variance explained, but it doesn't explain very much and one gets a 2.7%.

467
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:06,540
And in theory, okay, those are the individual genes, right?

468
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:11,460
Let's make the calculation and see how they interact with one another.

469
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:18,390
Well, that doesn't explain very much either. Maybe 20% of the variation.

470
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:25,500
So the potential gene gene interactions of common gene variants are included in the cost calculation.

471
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:37,350
It doesn't explain very much. So recently there had been network data added to this data set and you've got 200 different loci.

472
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:41,470
But in this circumstance, it still doesn't explain very much.

473
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:50,550
You could get up to 30% of the variation being explained by these variations in changing interactions.

474
01:01:52,380 --> 01:02:04,830
So as I said earlier, the heritability of obesity is about 77% versus calculations from two U.S. studies is about 30%.

475
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:15,120
So why is there a difference? Well. It's difficult to predict the biological impact of each of these loci on BMI.

476
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:25,410
So it was thought that if we can explain the variance of BMI by just looking at these different snacks for genes associated with BMI,

477
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:29,400
we could explain 100% of the variation BMI across the population.

478
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:40,410
Well, that's really hard to do. And so using this approach to explain polygenic obesity is very good as a tool to explain this.

479
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:49,080
So. Okay. What would the experience do?

480
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:54,090
In other words, we looked at the tissues and we looked at these genes.

481
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,560
Where were they enriched? In which tissues did you see these impacts?

482
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:09,390
And you find that when you look at these different genes, you find that most of them are expressed in the nervous system.

483
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:16,680
There's some other tissues now that have high expression of these, but mostly in the nervous system.

484
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:24,090
So these genes are affecting things and your brain.

485
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:29,070
So the perception of hunger is the energy expenditure.

486
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:35,910
All of these are things that are controlled by the nerves are affected by these polymorphisms.

487
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:44,390
So within this paper, they took a subset of individuals.

488
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:53,030
And they tried to come up with this risk score and they produced this particular figure.

489
01:03:53,480 --> 01:04:00,060
So this is a histogram of the cumulative effect of female at risk Williams work,

490
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:05,570
whereas the labels you have the greater perhaps the higher BMI you right.

491
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:12,950
So here are the number of individuals on the up y axis.

492
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:18,330
And on the x axis you have a number of BMI risk clients.

493
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:27,060
So within this population, if you're looking for the mean, here's your the other y axis.

494
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:33,840
If you go up this scale for looking at the mean BMI risk goals as you increase.

495
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:42,210
The risk is you have this linear relationship between that and having a higher BMI.

496
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:53,730
But if you look at the population of the number of people who have these risk A-levels, it goes down as you get across this threshold, 1992.

497
01:04:55,620 --> 01:05:00,570
So these individuals who have a high number of risk athletes have a higher BMI.

498
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:05,640
Yes, that's true. But it represents a smaller percentage of the overall population.

499
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:13,770
So the risk labels are additive, but not many people have have a lot of them.

500
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:18,720
And most people here at 90, 92.

501
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:22,980
And their bodies in the in the ovary.

502
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:36,140
So let's look at one of these chains, one more than one that might be more penetrant than others.

503
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:41,480
It's stodgy. And if you have to risk alleles for the AFL-CIO gene.

504
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:52,850
So let's say the risk players, these two capital A's, that would mean that you would have a 1.7 times greater risk of obesity in those who don't have.

505
01:05:56,180 --> 01:06:00,110
That's just one of the most the gene with the most potent effect.

506
01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:04,720
The risk of with the most potent. Seven times greater.

507
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:13,500
What's that Tio do anyway? Well, it was discovered fairly recently in 2007.

508
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:24,510
It's a common variant unequivocally associated with a BMI and increased risk of obesity is widely expressed in the brain.

509
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:32,130
Exactly what it does in the brain is an area of intense investigation which present

510
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:39,480
in the hypothalamic nuclei that affect the playing a role in satiety and appetite.

511
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:47,970
And in particular in responsiveness to grill grilling again is the hunger.

512
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:55,500
So perhaps people with this risk appeal, they're more sensitive to grilling, making it clear.

513
01:06:55,860 --> 01:07:00,569
Okay. And it does other things.

514
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:10,770
So it's widely expressed. So the risk label is also associated with decreased level lytic activity in adipocytes and fat cells.

515
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:18,630
So perhaps people with this risk will look at their adipocytes, hold on to the lipids a bit stronger,

516
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:24,580
making it difficult for these individuals to regulate adiposity.

517
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:40,200
However, it's been shown that energy expenditure in the form of exercise can modify the risk size of the Steptoe.

518
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:49,200
So that's that's Gene Simmons. This is really complicated stuff.

519
01:07:50,610 --> 01:07:57,659
But genes don't operate in and apart from everything else, there's gene environment interactions.

520
01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:01,910
Right. So the gene environment interaction is really important.

521
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:07,110
Our genes haven't changed very much yet. We have this increase in the prevalence of obesity.

522
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:18,990
What's going on? Well, there are gene environment interactions, so the prevalence of obesity has increased over the past 30 years or longer.

523
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:28,680
Yeah, there's more highly palatable food available and our occupations require less physical activity.

524
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:36,480
But not everybody has assumed a higher BMI or not.

525
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:42,600
Or people haven't. Haven't. Some are resistant to this increase in body mass.

526
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:49,080
Why? There are some other things going on too that highlight this,

527
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:56,940
the importance of this gene environment interaction, and that's the introduction of the Western diet.

528
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:01,930
So if you have an Indigenous population and they're there,

529
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:10,560
they're consuming their native diet and all of a sudden there's this the appearance of the Western diet,

530
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:16,020
the availability of the beverage is highly flavored foods,

531
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:24,570
and they adopt this new form of food onto notice that there's an increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity in these populations.

532
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:34,080
People who are recent immigrants to the United States who switch from a diet of more indigenous food to Western style diet,

533
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:41,640
they have a tendency to attain and create this gene environment interaction that's occurring as well.

534
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:44,490
And it's probably very, very important what we're seeing.

535
01:09:45,990 --> 01:09:52,680
So this is a diagram that kind of describes this relationship between the gene environment interaction.

536
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:57,420
It's not produced from empirical data. It's the hypothesis.

537
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:05,550
So this is this explains the influence of an obesogenic environment and genes.

538
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:09,450
So here in the Y axis, you have BMI.

539
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,800
And here on the excess, if you have a predisposition to obesity.

540
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:22,590
We have a resistant population and a prone population. And an environment that is restrictive in terms of energy balance.

541
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:33,120
There is indigenous foods available perhaps that are lower in calories and higher in fiber and you have lots of physical activity.

542
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:47,250
You would observe less variation in pigment, but when you introduce highly palatable food, less physical activity, the BMI curve shifts.

543
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:52,320
Yeah, there are people who are resistant, but there are also people who are prone.

544
01:10:53,130 --> 01:11:02,130
So because of this interaction of the environment and genotype, we see this increase in the prevalence of higher BMI.

545
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:09,090
So there are real internal data that demonstrates this relationship.

546
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:17,300
There is. And it comes from a paper published a long time ago in 1994,

547
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:24,860
and it describes a gene environment interaction between the Indians living in Mexico, in Arizona.

548
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:32,930
So you have two different populations, one at the harbor Mexico and one in Arizona.

549
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:40,140
And the average BMI of these individuals living in Mexico is about 25.

550
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:45,180
These individuals have a high level of physical activity.

551
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:50,400
They are consuming a diet that is more than the traditional diet.

552
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:58,290
Then you have a population of individuals living on a reservation in Arizona.

553
01:11:59,290 --> 01:12:08,160
And this is a terrible situation in which this nation of Indians and Native Americans,

554
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:19,480
I should say this this population of Native Americans were removed from their traditional diet, and it was done by limiting their access to water.

555
01:12:20,890 --> 01:12:29,320
So you hear all about drought in the southwest, and there were dams put into place in Arizona.

556
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:41,890
And as a consequence, the ability of this human nation to to get water and to grow their own crops and to be dependent on their traditional diet.

557
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:51,940
This was severely suppressed, so they became dependent on Westernized diets.

558
01:12:52,960 --> 01:13:08,830
So within this population, they were given Western puddings, cheese, flour, lots of simple carbohydrates, lots of highly, highly processed foods.

559
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:18,670
They adopted a different diet, and a lot of these individuals developed high BMI, obesity, diabetes and so on.

560
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:24,340
So do you do you remember this film clip that they've had?

561
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:26,350
In fact, some of you were shaking your heads. Yes.

562
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:35,470
So this is yes, it's a gene environment interaction, but it's also an example of how racism affected this population of individuals.

563
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:42,880
And I can only imagine now with the severe droughts that are occurring in the Southwest, the situation may be even getting worse.

564
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:53,560
Yeah, that's your last lecture. Remember, you talk about Kenya and the Papua New Guinea.

565
01:13:56,100 --> 01:14:01,220
So again, people. Women in Kenya and people.

566
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:06,490
Oh, yes, yes, yes. So church ministry is Kenya, another church?

567
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:15,570
His ministry is Papua New Guinea. And they went there to help them with hundreds of tribal members, like 88 of them came to the Bible.

568
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:26,000
So they hear all this stuff, this strange, like Jesus skin brush, all the kind of stuff started when the missionary brought them flowers, tissue.

569
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:30,230
So they noticed a change in their health when they brought the Westernized diet.

570
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:35,090
Yeah. And the missionaries took our own food there. This happens.

571
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:43,230
So there's there is now a recognition of the importance of traditional diets in all cultures.

572
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:51,510
So some of you are becoming dietitians, you know, recognize the importance of traditional diets, traditional food, staple foods are really important.

573
01:14:52,400 --> 01:15:00,450
When you make recommendations in terms of dietary change or whatever the case might be.

574
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:07,900
So this is some detail that you have on your slide in front of you that I haven't put up here yet.

575
01:15:08,090 --> 01:15:13,540
The difference in the indigenous diet. 60 to 80% carbohydrate.

576
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:17,980
8 to 12%, which is fairly low. Fair amount of protein. 12 to 18%.

577
01:15:18,850 --> 01:15:23,530
And here's the the Westernized diet that was introduced.

578
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:29,380
The government support mechanisms are very different in terms of its macronutrient content.

579
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:40,540
The prevalence of diabetes that I mentioned here, people living in a similar region, the same region as the Pima Health and Women.

580
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:44,770
Here is the prevalence or percent of individuals with diabetes.

581
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:52,960
Here's the prevalence of diabetes in this population, which is much higher because of the transition to the Western diet.

582
01:15:56,260 --> 01:16:00,610
So here's a summary I go over today. I don't the watch died on me.

583
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:06,040
Yes, I'm about to be done. So in summary, obesity is a highly heritable trait.

584
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:15,040
They've identified a number of of genes involved in monogenic syndromic allergenic as common obesity.

585
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:20,800
And this has greatly increased their knowledge in mechanisms that underlie the development of obesity.

586
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:25,240
However, there's this gene environment interaction. It's very important.

587
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:28,810
Our genes haven't changed much in the last 30 to 50 years,

588
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:36,490
but our environment has and this has had a significant impact on the average BMI in the United States and other developed countries.

589
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:50,290
And so that there are susceptible and non susceptible populations based on their genotype to these types of environmental factors.

590
01:16:50,950 --> 01:16:56,620
And then finally, I talked a little bit about the animal models that were used to explain these genetic differences.

591
01:16:57,310 --> 01:17:06,400
And as we progress in the semester, I'll introduce some other animal models that are used for studying appetite satiety and.

592
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:15,270
Diabetes, obesity. So does anybody have any questions at this point in the comments?

593
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:22,060
Okay. All right. So I will be posting videos.

594
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:28,900
I will correct quiz three because I told you I'll give you those if you missed.

595
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:42,850
Question one I'm going to give you that point back, post the reading for next week or two, and then I'll put you on Anderson.

596
01:17:43,660 --> 01:18:00,210
All right, I I'll see you on this one. Yes, I it is.

597
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:18,090
I was laughing at my vote, so I can't do that right now because I switched positions.

598
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:30,640
But I think we're actually like, I don't know if you like.

599
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:52,120
I'm like, yeah, I don't I'm not sure in the queue.

600
01:18:53,080 --> 01:19:03,530
Yes. I'm not going to do the whole thing. But, you know, when I say people I have don't know, it's just a half hour.

601
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:12,460
I can do a show. I think we should just get the most common juju.

602
01:19:14,890 --> 01:19:25,280
I'm going to show you like. You see what I mean?

603
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:30,290
Oh, I see.

604
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:35,020
Oh, my God.

605
01:19:35,950 --> 01:19:39,900
Everything's all right. I'm. I'm fine. Oh, really?

606
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:49,200
I'm sorry. Obviously mean you just send me your last two point.

607
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:52,790
Oh, my God. Oh, you might go day.

608
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:55,990
But it was.
