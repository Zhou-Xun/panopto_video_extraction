1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,050
The first one. I can't tell you anything.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:12,510
It seems like this morning I was surprised to find out how it was like.

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:24,850
So it was actually like somebody else's story about how they got their first plane.

4
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:48,540
I got done with my parents. I mean, I was actually pretty honest with the class between serving learned about behavior.

5
00:00:49,230 --> 00:01:15,090
So usually kids get something like this before like I actually got sick, but I was like, I don't know.

6
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:27,270
I guess when she graduated, that was kind of like.

7
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:32,520
Yeah. I mean,

8
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:49,200
this is definitely one of the reasons we are even saying is it's not until we're

9
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,080
going to talk about today and some logistics for the coming week and next week.

10
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,700
So you don't have a theory assessment. You just Friday, you haven't asked me.

11
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:07,400
I do that again next week, but on Monday, we're not going to have a class.

12
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:14,400
This is an opportunity for you to work and meet with your groups and feel free to utilize this classroom.

13
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,399
You also have to bring up clients to meet with your groups or your friends to

14
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,310
meet with your group members in another location that's more convenient for you.

15
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:35,130
I don't really be here to wait around and people have questions and choose to utilize this group.

16
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:44,610
Again, Monday, I want to give you some space to meet with your group members and get a little momentum on elements of your practice.

17
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:56,250
It's a good lot of normal class again on Wednesday, so I'll send out a reminder on Sunday or Monday morning.

18
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:03,780
Just so if you're on autopilot coming to class, you're reminded that you're going to be with your group members.

19
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:13,830
So I'm good. Okay. So today I want to spend a brief time talking about opera, be your change.

20
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:22,470
And these techniques are used in conjunction with other behavior change techniques and interventions quite often.

21
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:31,800
But I think it's and it's important to understand the fundamentals of that opera of behavior change was first articulated by Edward Thorndyke,

22
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,620
who's a famous psychologist, famous behaviorist.

23
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,330
And operant conditioning is typically operant behavior change.

24
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:53,910
This sort of school of behavior change start really falls under behavior modification,

25
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,430
which mainly focuses on the assessment, evaluation and alteration of behavior.

26
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:06,300
Its focus is really on the overt behavior, meaning behavior that we can actually observe.

27
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,759
And so it's the focus of behavior.

28
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,920
Behavior modification is really directly observable.

29
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:24,910
We. So cognitions and emotions are not much of an emphasis when we think about behavior modification.

30
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,990
We're not not interested in how people think and we're not that interested in how people feel.

31
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,619
So this is really individual level behavior,

32
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:43,260
very much focused on the actual behavior itself and the things directly preceding it and directly following.

33
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:50,790
So apparent behavior change suggests that changing what people do can also lead into how they feel or things.

34
00:04:52,950 --> 00:05:01,590
So we change the way people do things. They might change the way they think or feel about that potential behavior.

35
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:08,370
So we're not too focused on discriminating broader level influences in behavior modification.

36
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:14,759
So when we go back to the social ecological approach and think about community level influences,

37
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:21,209
structural level influences and even interpersonal influences, we're not interested in that.

38
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:28,260
And occasionally we recognize those things as very influential and other frameworks

39
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,509
when we're looking at behavior and public health issues that confront us.

40
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,339
But we're also here.

41
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:44,340
We're really focused on current factors that shape behavior, and that's really the focus of our conditioning.

42
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,150
So a lot of research has shown that past experiences can shape our current behaviors and cognitions.

43
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:59,670
So whatever we do in the past might shape what we do in the future or how we think or feel about certain things.

44
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:08,860
This is not an emphasis on behavior modification, so our past behavior is just not relevant when we're talking about behavior modification principles.

45
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,900
So opera behavior change. It's not a set of interventions.

46
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:24,050
I want to make that very clear, but it's just one scientific approach to understanding and changing human behavior.

47
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:32,520
And you may find some overlap in many of these approaches with some of the things we've already learned or will plan to learn in the next few weeks.

48
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,710
So there is a little bit of overlap.

49
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:43,290
Again, I want to emphasize it's not a set of interventions, but it is one scientific approach to understanding and changing human behavior.

50
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,340
So number one, conditioning, we're really concerned with three things. We're concerned with the antecedents.

51
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,180
We're concerned with behaviors and then the consequences of the behavior.

52
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:03,340
And this is a little bit like the most barebones conceptual model that you are developing.

53
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:11,950
And what I want to do is just unpack each one of these elements in the context of behavior modification.

54
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:19,599
So remember, like we talked about on Monday, antecedents are things that occur before the behavior.

55
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:28,600
They include things like stimuli. They include things like settings and context that really occur before and influence our behavior.

56
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:34,090
And they're really critical to controlling our behavior and can change how we respond to things.

57
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:44,040
In operant conditioning. Antecedents encompass things that occur before the behavior in reference to things that are more immediate.

58
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:53,140
So like we don't think about things so far removed from the behavior, like in the social ecological model in terms of things like policy.

59
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:59,110
So in antecedents are really things that are closer to the behavior that's being observed.

60
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:03,460
It's not something abstract or too far away from.

61
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:10,100
So then we have behavior and what individuals do and don't do.

62
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,389
That's in the middle. And then we have consequences that happen.

63
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:20,400
Events that follow the behaviors, antecedents and consequences become important in the context of program development,

64
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:24,250
because these are things we can try to change that influence behavior.

65
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:32,110
So thinking about consequences and antecedents are typically intervention targets.

66
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:40,940
We're. So we also have things called prompts.

67
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:49,520
These are things that when we think about antecedents and they directly facilitate and guide performance of their behavior.

68
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:58,730
These can be things like verbal instructions, written or physical cues, gestures, modeling.

69
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:08,330
These are used to generate a response, and it can really help in training certain types of behaviors and training new behaviors.

70
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:17,690
And these sorts of things can be gradually withdrawn and faded as training progresses and eventually eliminated.

71
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:23,180
And in behavior modification, the word fading means gradual.

72
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:35,270
That's what we mean by when they say training. So prompts can be really helpful in helping to train new behaviors,

73
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:42,230
and they can be slowly phased out as months of training of a particular behavior really progresses.

74
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:49,520
And then we have setting events. These are contextual factors or conditions that influence the behavior.

75
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:55,310
Most influential or strategic? Strategically useful then prom.

76
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:06,590
So if you're thinking about using setting events as an intervention target, they tend to be less useful than the use of prompts to change behavior.

77
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:14,060
And it can include things like features of a situation, features of a task, or demands that are presented to an individual.

78
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:20,630
And then you have discriminative stimuli, and this is associated with reinforcement,

79
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:30,800
or it becomes discriminative stimuli really varies from person to person, but there are likely some commonalities in a given culture.

80
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:38,630
When stimuli are called discriminative, it means it's reinforcing to a very specific behavior and a set of conditions.

81
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:45,380
So often the classic example is money.

82
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:51,680
Money can be typically used as a discriminative stimuli.

83
00:10:52,440 --> 00:11:02,180
It's it could be it's very reinforcing and it can actually be reinforcing across a lot of different types of behaviors that conditions.

84
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,560
So there are several concepts to consider when we think about a very, very specific behavior and modifying it.

85
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,580
That includes reinforced practice shaping and training.

86
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,170
Within reinforced practice, we have the ideas of shaping and shape.

87
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:29,130
So when we're trying to train a particular behavior, reinforced practice is really critical to operant conditioning.

88
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,209
This is and this essentially refers to we're pretreated trials or performance of a behavior

89
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:42,240
followed by reinforcing consequences and we'll sort of impact different variations of that.

90
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,579
So we can do reinforced practice in a number of ways, and that includes shaping.

91
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:55,110
And so shaping typically involves reinforcing successive approximations of a final response.

92
00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:02,910
And shaping begins by reinforcing behaviors that are already in one's repertoire of

93
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:07,830
that of a particular individual and that resemble or approximate the final goal.

94
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,979
So you may not be reinforcing the exact behavior,

95
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:16,830
but it may be sort of in that your house of that behavior and you want to

96
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:26,610
reinforce some of those ancillary behaviors to lead up to that behavioral focus.

97
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,880
And the goal is to attain a final behavior in the behaviors along the way,

98
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:36,330
sort of drop out or are replaced by behaviors that are really closer to that goal.

99
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,139
And responses that are similar to the final goal are really reinforced and responsive,

100
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:49,380
that are really not similar in that wheelhouse of behaviors tend to not get reinforced.

101
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,910
So you really shaping is really shaping a behavior along the continuum.

102
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,490
So one example here that's on the slide.

103
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:19,720
A person with diabetes may be profusely praised for sort of making minor inconsistent changes to their diet or making these smaller portions or,

104
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:29,500
you know, throwing some supplies in place of more processed foods here and there.

105
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:37,540
But later on, as you're shaping a behavior, especially around dietary changes,

106
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:47,530
you only want to really praise behaviors that are really more consistent with that larger behavioral focus.

107
00:13:50,590 --> 00:14:04,990
And. So Cheney on the other hand, if a task at hand requires training multiple behaviors in a sequence, chaining becomes a really valuable method.

108
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,440
So we're really talking about multiple behaviors.

109
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:14,460
So shaping is focused on one behavior, and chaining is the training of multiple behaviors in a sequence.

110
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,390
And reinforcement occurs only at the end of response.

111
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:27,210
So forward chaining means training all steps in that order in which they're performed and really makes intuitive sense to do so.

112
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:35,580
But there are merits to backward chaining where you start with the last behavior in the sequence and reinforce that.

113
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,860
So by establishing reinforcement with stimuli in the last behavior.

114
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,550
This can serve as reinforcement for prior behaviors in the chain.

115
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:52,440
So training can become a little easier because reinforcement of that behavior is already established and strong.

116
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,720
So if you have like a sequence of behaviors,

117
00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:03,000
it makes intuitive sense to train along the way until you lead up to the sort of target behavior you're focused on.

118
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:08,879
But you could also start backwards and really create that strong connection with the

119
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:16,110
end behavior and work your way towards those other behaviors and that in that way.

120
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,950
Let's talk about the idea of consequences and apparent behavior change in this country.

121
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:32,520
The idea of reinforcement, punishment and extension of behaviors becomes really relevant.

122
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:39,030
So I want to start with reinforcement. What's really key to reinforcement is that all of its results,

123
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,100
all of work results from reinforcement is an increase in a particular behavior of interest.

124
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:52,740
So the key differences are really in the connections to stimuli and positive reinforcement.

125
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,040
You add something and it results in strengthening a behavior.

126
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,220
And positive reinforcement is typically fairly straightforward.

127
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,450
You add something and it strengthens that behavior.

128
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,300
Negative reinforcement, on the other hand, is very confusing.

129
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:21,360
This also increases the behavioral frequency or the likelihood of a behavior.

130
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:30,590
But negative reinforcement is around removing something aversive or noxious in order to increase the beat.

131
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:40,850
So remember, it's the removal of a stimulus in order to increase a behavior that's different from positive reinforcement,

132
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,150
not something that increases negative reinforcement.

133
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,030
You take away something in order to increase something.

134
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:55,110
Sounds like punishment, right? Not negative reinforcement is different.

135
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:04,680
I want to draw an example that is probably very relatable to most of us.

136
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:12,480
So when we get into the car and start driving, you might hear a beeping sound that won't stop until you put your seatbelt on.

137
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:18,830
Right. Have we all heard that sound? So that beeping sound is a noxious stimulus.

138
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:27,000
It's really annoying. And the stimulus wants you to put your seatbelt on and it won't go away until you do so.

139
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:35,910
So you're going to put your seatbelt on more quickly so that you don't have to keep hearing that beeping sound while you drive.

140
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,640
This is negative reinforcement and putting your seatbelt on and engaging in a behavior

141
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:47,609
you want to increase the frequency of your decreasing the intensity of that stimulus,

142
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:55,020
that beeping sound. In this case, again, the beeping sound, the noxious stimulus, you're trying to decrease it.

143
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,350
So as soon as you get in the car, you're putting on your seatbelt and.

144
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:14,510
So I want to go through a couple other ones just to sort of get that connection pretty solid.

145
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:23,120
So. So one aversive stimulus might be the loud noise from your alarm clock when you wake up in the morning.

146
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:31,820
Super loud, sound noxious. And so one behavior that you might perform is throwing the clock across the room.

147
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:39,740
And what the immediate effect of that is, the noise from that alarm clock ends,

148
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:45,020
but it increases the likelihood of you borrowing that bar and potentially getting out of

149
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:55,190
bed and having periods of the behavior that might that might be that aversive stimulus,

150
00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:07,520
the nagging turns and the behavior that might be performed is leaving the house or the room because your parent is gagging.

151
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:16,670
So the me effect is the nagging is no longer occurring and it increases the likelihood of leaving or escaping in the future.

152
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:27,440
So as soon as you hear your nagging parent, any sort of nagging behavior that we want to increase is leaving that situation.

153
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,450
So you no longer hear that noxious stimulus.

154
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:41,750
Now, I mean, parents, if their addiction is maintained by negative reinforcement.

155
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,000
So when we think about addiction, addictive behaviors, that's maintained by negative reinforcement.

156
00:19:49,580 --> 00:20:02,300
Negative reinforcement is not used a lot in programs to change behavior, and thus it works with seatbelts, safety, car safety.

157
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:14,750
It seems to work in that context. And there may be very nuanced circumstances like this seatbelt example where it is very effective,

158
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:23,870
but it's not used like that commonly across a lot of public health interventions because you

159
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:29,390
really need to present something aversive that what an immediate response of increasing something.

160
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:37,310
So when you think about a lot of behaviors that you're trying to change, this approach is just not often relevant to that.

161
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:43,490
But you really have to think about the context and what you're what you're trying to do a negative reinforcement.

162
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:50,899
RB My management is different and it's about decreasing the behavior so that this can be

163
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:58,590
done with giving something bad or taking something away in order to decrease happiness.

164
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:11,450
So this is a nice matrix that helps us keep track of positive, negative reinforcement and punishment.

165
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:19,430
So in thinking about how behavior increases and decreases and whether you're giving something or taking something away,

166
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:25,010
what that means in terms of punishment, negative reinforcement or positive.

167
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,660
Yeah. So would we ever call it, like, positive and negative punishment or really?

168
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:51,910
Not really. I think it's helpful to read if you're like being very specific and trying to understand whether that's like a punishment situation,

169
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:58,450
understanding, giving something or whether it's being taken away.

170
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:10,270
But we don't. I think in practice it's not always distinguished that way, but what I like about it is it helps us get very specific.

171
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:16,660
So we're very clear whether something is punishment or reinforcement.

172
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:31,089
So again, negative reinforcement and punishment can typically be very confusing.

173
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:36,040
So here are two examples in terms of ways to distinguish them.

174
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,650
So let's say you're driving in your car, not wearing your seatbelt, and you receive a ticket.

175
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:52,450
What is this? As punishment or negative reinforcement, negative discrimination.

176
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:05,630
So this is punishment. The reason why it's punishment is your behavior decreases because you're given an aversive stimulus, you're given a ticket.

177
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:12,200
We don't like tickets. I think for most we can all agree that's an aversive stimulus that we don't mind tickets.

178
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,359
Um, so you're given a ticket,

179
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:24,170
so your behavior is going to decrease and you'll probably not do it again because now because you've received an expensive ticket.

180
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:31,310
So it's going to really disincentivize you for not wearing your seatbelt.

181
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:41,240
So what about this one? Do you remember the ticket incident with the police officer from the day before?

182
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:53,300
So you put on your seatbelt before you leave the house. So why isn't negative reinforcement?

183
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:15,950
It's like a natural stimulus. You're trying to move it. Behavior so you don't have to deal with the possible consequences of that behavior.

184
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:21,040
So you put on your seatbelt, you're doing a behavior that will not result in a ticket.

185
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:29,460
So. So what's key here is you remember the memory of the ticket?

186
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:35,280
Yeah, because it says you're trying to reduce or take away the anxiety of potentially getting another ticket.

187
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:42,810
Very close. Very close. So, yeah, it's like getting the ticket was like a negative experience.

188
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:52,169
Yeah. So it's, it's really the memory of the ticket. You remember that ticket was awful, maybe elicited feelings of anxiety.

189
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:59,280
It makes you uncomfortable. You don't want to remember that awful memory of being pulled over and getting that expensive ticket.

190
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:07,590
So you put your seatbelt on before leaving your driveway to avoid thinking about that and hopefully that incident will happen again.

191
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:12,360
This. Yes. Why wouldn't that be an antecedent?

192
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:17,250
Because it's a prompt. You remembering is a prompt to make you do a behavior.

193
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,210
Is it both? Yeah, it could be both. Okay.

194
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:27,150
So if you're thinking about it in terms of antecedent behavior, one that could be the antecedent,

195
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:35,790
if you're thinking about it in terms of, you know, what what is the stimulus situation here?

196
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,240
Negative in this memory is potentially a stimulus and reinforcing.

197
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:47,760
It's that memory of that chicken so awful, so expensive and embarrassing.

198
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:51,659
You don't want to have that experience again.

199
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:57,030
So you're going to put on your seatbelt before you make you do something.

200
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:08,280
So this is negative reinforcement. You know, there's no memory of it.

201
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,549
The first one in front of me,

202
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:19,500
we line to the examples of being seatbelt because I took that as a positive reinforcement that if you're going to increase the baby,

203
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:25,100
you're more likely to put on your seatbelt. Adding a sound.

204
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:40,280
So positive reinforcement is giving something good. So if I gave you money to put on your seatbelt, you'd be like money.

205
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:45,080
If it's a good stimulus, then it's positive reinforcement.

206
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:49,760
And I'm giving you something that says that annoying beeping sound.

207
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:56,560
You want it to go away, so you're going to your behaviors increase.

208
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:05,860
So the thing that I need to be honest with the can be punished.

209
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:17,410
Yeah. No, because it's not making you not put your seatbelts on, hopefully.

210
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:21,000
I mean, it could do that. I think for most of us it doesn't do that.

211
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:31,920
We put on our seatbelt. So in terms of the carmakers were brilliant with the idea of helping us with that lives.

212
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:38,010
So it's. Negative reinforcement causes.

213
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:45,080
Your behavior is increasing because you took away the bad name of the world.

214
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:55,749
Okay, so. So again, I love this matrix because of that exact thing.

215
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,440
Right? What are we. We're talking about this. What is this stimulus?

216
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,129
Is it like good or bad?

217
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:08,980
If it's like a noxious stimulus, we're sort of in if our behavior is increasing or decreasing,

218
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:15,940
what what is this following talking about punishment, negative reinforcement, positive force.

219
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,660
It's like somebody taking a punishment negative, taking away like this.

220
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:34,430
You can travel school for 13 years and punish me.

221
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:48,269
So they they take away. So we think TVs are good and our iPads and iPhones are good things.

222
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:56,610
And if our parents punish us and take it away, it's just a negative reinforcement if taking it away from us.

223
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,930
No, because the behavior you're trying to decrease is the bad behavior.

224
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:06,290
Right. That's why it's constant. Your behavior decreases like your bad behavior decreases.

225
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:12,060
So if it's a bad behavior situation, but if it's a good behavior situation, we want them to be doing their homework.

226
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,810
No, no, that definitely makes sense. I was just following the chart since it says taking away is a negative reinforcement.

227
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:26,750
So that's what I was following. But I go, Yeah.

228
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:36,130
And in terms of like the order. Does this tell us which comes first?

229
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:41,940
Like this table. Like Is the behavior always coming first and then something is happening or.

230
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:51,560
So when when we're talking about something is given and something is taken away, we're talking about the stimulus.

231
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:56,550
So we really have to understand what that stimulus is and what that means.

232
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:02,960
Did something about it or is it something good? What does it mean in this context?

233
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:06,180
Is it being taken away? Are we trying to get more of it?

234
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,479
So it's sort of really context specific when you're looking at this,

235
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:21,210
but you really want to start with the stimulus and then also think about the behavior in the context of that stimulus.

236
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:38,680
Okay. So what's really important about reinforcement and useful in our own lives is the schedule of reinforcement.

237
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:43,210
So initially, when you're training somebody and really trying to shape their behavior,

238
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:48,880
you do want to reinforce each time because we really want to get that pattern down.

239
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:56,650
So. So in the long run, intermittent is.

240
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:04,780
So you might do some sort of continuous reinforcement in that way when you're training.

241
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:11,650
Like, you know, a lot of this is actually used quite a bit in dog training.

242
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:18,250
So you're training your dog to see you might keep giving them a treat every time they say,

243
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:24,100
but in the long run, intermittent reinforcement is much more important than continuous.

244
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:36,110
So. Like, Do you want to reinforce the behavior every three days on a fixed schedule or every time the dog sits?

245
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:44,660
Or do you want to do it intermittently? And it turns out in a lot of different behaviors, variable is far more effective.

246
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:52,940
So being on an intermittent variable schedule for reinforcement turns out to be much more effective in shaping behavior over the long run.

247
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:03,659
So in terms of immediacy, do you want to give it a reward immediately after the behavior,

248
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:09,440
or should you do like you typically want to reward the behavior as soon as it occurs?

249
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,249
Otherwise, like five other things can happen.

250
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:18,860
And if you're really trying to train a behavior that can become very confusing when perhaps

251
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:23,929
three other behaviors occurred in that context and it was delayed confusing to the person,

252
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:31,850
what what are you reinforcing? And so when we think about rewards, do you want to reward our small.

253
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:38,689
So it turns out in terms of shaping like really complex behavior is probably not a good idea to

254
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:45,440
give very large rewards because it may not motivate an individual to perform the behavior again.

255
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,180
So say you're training with chocolate.

256
00:32:51,440 --> 00:33:02,450
It's much more effective to, you know, train with single Eminem versus the whole top of Eminem because.

257
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:11,000
Again, the smallest you really want to use the smallest you can get away with what's shaping the behavior of interest.

258
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:15,320
Using really big rewards is not typically sustainable.

259
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,240
And when we talk about behavioral economics later in the term,

260
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:27,820
we'll talk a little bit more about the practicality of rewards, especially financial incentives.

261
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:35,770
That's where it becomes very relevant. And I'll show you some data around where that works and where the.

262
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:45,979
So in terms of reinforcers, there are two types of reinforcers to consider.

263
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:52,250
So unconditioned reinforcer, these are things that just kind of work the first time they are presented.

264
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,190
Somehow, physiologically, these things are reinforcing.

265
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:05,690
They can be things like food, sometimes of medications or they're they're considered reinforcing because they work immediately.

266
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:14,450
When you take that nicotine from a cigaret and heroin for some people is immediately

267
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:19,740
reinforcing so unconditioned reinforcers are immediately stimulating to.

268
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:26,850
So when I give my dog a treat that is immediately stimulating,

269
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:34,200
not really thinking about whether he wants no air conditioned reinforcer we don't always get.

270
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:39,060
They become very important because we don't always get unconditioned reinforcers.

271
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:48,149
So we often have to rely on conditioned. And these are reinforcers that were once neutral but become reinforcing because they're

272
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:54,450
paired with an unconditioned reinforcer or an already established conditioned reinforcer.

273
00:34:54,450 --> 00:35:01,710
So this becomes really useful when we can't always give an unconditioned reinforcer to everybody when we want them to do something.

274
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:08,330
So we really need to think about what is reinforcing for a particular individual.

275
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:17,600
And our critical test is whether the consequence, when presented contingently, increases the likelihood of that behavior in the future.

276
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:29,530
So again, unconditioned reinforcers are naturally stimulating to a person we don't always have.

277
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:37,629
We don't have an endless amount of treats to give to the dog to get them to stay.

278
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:46,150
So they need to. So when I say since that is a conditioned reinforcer here is that if you sit.

279
00:35:52,660 --> 00:36:01,060
So let's talk about punishment. In your readings, punishment was described as not being an effective method for behavior change.

280
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:12,850
So the best use of punishment is as an ancillary technique to really accompany positive reinforcement.

281
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:21,910
It can help suppress undesirable responses, but it doesn't necessarily necessarily train desirable responses.

282
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:32,950
So if we want to take away undesirable behaviors, it can be a helpful adjunct to incorporate punishment techniques.

283
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,200
But it doesn't help us train behaviors that we want people to do.

284
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:44,169
So the place of punishment in applied interventions is really as a supplement to

285
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:51,060
reinforcement programs designed to develop other sort of behaviors we want people to.

286
00:36:51,310 --> 00:37:06,370
So it's often used as a sort of adjunct or a complement and often not used in, in interventions by themselves so often.

287
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:15,850
So I want to do an activity around applying some of the concepts that we learned today.

288
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:20,020
And I'm going to have you work in small groups and it's about incarceration.

289
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:32,390
So one of just very briefly the health impact of incarceration, there are profound health impacts and thinking about access to public assistance.

290
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:43,600
Disadvantages with employment can lead to broken families, and it can also impact the social development of youth and children, just to name a few.

291
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:49,190
This is an exhaustive list, but these are some of the health impacts we know around anniversaries.

292
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:54,070
So what I want us to do is look at Project Bright.

293
00:37:54,090 --> 00:38:04,620
This was the kind of intervention done in incarcerated settings using some of the techniques that we talked about today.

294
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:08,129
Let's ignore instruction three here.

295
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:15,660
You don't have to turn it in at the end, of course, but I'm going to Dominique's going to pass on a handout, and there's an article that I posted.

296
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:27,330
So if you go to today's session on canvas, there's an article about Project Bright and the intervention that they deployed in the personal setting.

297
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,340
And I want you to work in small groups who responded to their worksheet questions.

298
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:42,750
So go ahead and pull it up from campus and then work in small groups, maybe 3 to 4 people that are in clinical depression.

299
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:52,110
So I'm really curious about your observation of the application of behavior

300
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:58,470
modification techniques in this study and maybe some of the ways that it appears to

301
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:22,880
work and some of the limitations that you might be observed in this case tell

302
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:38,390
you there's a field of study revealed and you look at your behavior generally,

303
00:39:47,100 --> 00:40:02,830
let's say, like how you think by using the references we look here, we just tried this before.

304
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:36,360
You can you know, I just I like something on and I was like, you want to learn if it's affected since the beginning.

305
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:48,700
I just I just think that it is the most.

306
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:54,420
So when I started, like you make the other side.

307
00:40:55,650 --> 00:41:08,730
Yeah, absolutely. Trust me on this. Now, you know, also let me say that I mean, this is like, oh, I don't know.

308
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:20,040
I don't think it's not a good thing.

309
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:29,220
I'm not really sure everything's okay.

310
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:41,080
You just those questions like how to look like you.

311
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:50,100
You're right. You're not doing all right.

312
00:41:52,440 --> 00:42:13,590
What would you do if you just look at these sorts of things or anything like that?

313
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:28,830
You wouldn't believe it. Look like you do ice cream or you can get treatment for cross-border.

314
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:45,810
So let's say when I was reading the delivery, you know what I would say?

315
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:50,070
Yeah. And you think, okay.

316
00:42:51,240 --> 00:43:02,170
It's just messing around, said the text of the symposium dictation show.

317
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,150
What I'm saying is set is in study,

318
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:20,760
where he's constantly producing negative results in this type of abstract scheme or anything like this that we have had on screen.

319
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:43,050
Because I don't have the spectacles in the case of anyone over our Internet that we can simply give you points of light horsemen over and over.

320
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:50,990
You know, you can change the definition.

321
00:43:51,630 --> 00:44:25,770
It's been a while, not much of which just seems like it's very much reaching the leader in the Republican Party as well.

322
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:40,920
I think the only thing I think that's one of the most interesting points is the

323
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:51,280
obsession means that in completing tasks that they intended to become sessions,

324
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:59,770
group sessions, and completing treatment related tasks and cheat on personal sources.

325
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:11,160
It involves meetings with health companies and stimuluses early and good.

326
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:30,270
My point is, I think can be completed whenever we have to work on the behavior for them.

327
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:57,410
Could you just say, you know, just exactly, exactly the point that they're making here in March?

328
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:12,800
And that's I was waiting to go over to 405 to give you an extra sec.

329
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:24,419
We also do need to use the points because the employee has since they want to work on certain things,

330
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:31,910
it doesn't mean they don't have to tell you that they're going to have an opportunity to get $0.10 and you get

331
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:45,420
your points to charity and to developing the change over time to increase their visits in general in like these.

332
00:46:46,560 --> 00:47:07,460
And for whatever reason, you were talking points in this particular case, you're talking about big and you know, things.

333
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:42,880
I just want to talk to the price common sense and trying to bring something up under that should be very short order in the queue.

334
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:55,380
So from. Basically it's like giving them something.

335
00:47:55,410 --> 00:48:02,880
I think you're going to drop out of school.

336
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:10,280
I mean, I guess you don't know exactly what happens thinking then you go to different positions.

337
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:18,970
I was having trouble with those.

338
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:24,710
You know, I understood what you guys had said.

339
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:28,590
I think that would be great.

340
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:40,440
You know? Me, too. Because like I said, it's kind of that traditional sense of me, positive feedback.

341
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:45,030
But other than that, I like negative things.

342
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:54,470
But it not being so negative and you may not like other things like negative reinforcement or any name,

343
00:48:54,470 --> 00:49:05,960
like taking care of my variables because we cope with the negative.

344
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:22,490
They don't swim around like, you know, whether it's like substance abuse treatment.

345
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:34,940
So for number two, we could just be like, how important was he doing?

346
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:43,520
So I guess he's like a little island in Cape Town, like a kid, like, I don't it's yeah,

347
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:54,470
I would really like to be like pro-social behavior if I was going to country.

348
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:14,870
I mean, like, you know, it's not one that seems like, you know, it's not okay to not worry about someone is one thing that's easy for them to have.

349
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:23,160
Like they can be strong. Like, that's kind of like what happened this morning.

350
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:27,850
I mean, it's like that we should also be getting out like that.

351
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:37,750
You like enforcement of the law enforcement, like maybe you took a magistrate that it's not like invades marketing as well.

352
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:46,070
Like maybe my personality has been taken away.

353
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:56,010
So like I don't see anything like that.

354
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:12,580
But I mean, if you're going to say, Oh, you did that, I'm taking the people that you could be talking about.

355
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:21,079
You told me anyway that those people that would seem like punished.

356
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:46,090
It's a punishment that says, you know, that is people get attached to the area and I don't even know what to say.

357
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:59,770
Yeah, I know. You get those times.

358
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:11,180
I feel like, hey, I'm busy right now.

359
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:15,850
It's a bad feeling that.

360
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:28,010
I mean, it seems like it's your money. I guess you have to be one.

361
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:41,690
The first person for sort of juvenile, just like, I don't know,

362
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:49,820
this is going to be probably as far as like anything from I guess like I'd rather they'd be like.

363
00:52:50,550 --> 00:53:01,770
I think he says he's got a sad reality like it,

364
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:14,129
which is like a cold or even an extra point like plant trees on the other end because it's actually going to be a positive reinforcement.

365
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:19,670
I don't know if that's an ethical. It's not possible.

366
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:23,730
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. The problem with that.

367
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:38,420
I mean, I was like, wow, this is going to be such an extra one.

368
00:53:38,820 --> 00:54:02,399
Yeah, I don't know. And I think, you know, he was like, oh, I'm going to call the female prison in a minute.

369
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:14,610
But I'll tell you, I'm telling three programs like for like not all programs were kind of like you heard, you know, in other media of it.

370
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:33,300
Right. You can get away with agreeing to stand in that when you say, like,

371
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:45,060
I'm writing stupid back to the office, I ran out of room anyway and we don't have one.

372
00:54:46,170 --> 00:55:04,890
I think that I don't like it. This is something I had to do because it is hard to be here.

373
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:11,370
Oh, is it like you?

374
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:20,690
Obviously, I think it's like I wouldn't know something.

375
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:42,500
And what about how? I mean, I used to love doing such great laugh and stuff like that.

376
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:53,700
So it's like they're saying, Oh, you train them for drugs.

377
00:55:53,790 --> 00:56:09,300
There's like so it's like there's nothing about, like, trying to change their behavior.

378
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:18,780
And I imagine that was just like you.

379
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:37,409
I don't know, maybe just like it's probably because I was like, Oh, my God, this is a problem.

380
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:40,080
So I think that's why you should injury prevention,

381
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:51,580
to try to help them make sure that they're able to support systems that are in prison where you don't have access to like this.

382
00:56:51,960 --> 00:57:11,790
It's not like you're going to get across the street from another house where, you know, there's a lot of bad things about me.

383
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:25,950
I think. I don't understand how I'm not going to get learn how to find out.

384
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:43,990
I'm sorry for realizing that, like the environment, I mean, like I was, like I was something.

385
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:50,070
I was just, like, thinking of education as like.

386
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:59,850
Opportunity. I mean, the summit's due to open up on time.

387
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:06,930
What's the most interesting discussions about this one that I think looks like a very engaging entry,

388
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:26,549
and then the next step is like psychosocial functioning. And you started to impact how you like, oh, let's see, they're missing.

389
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:35,550
The whole thing about in this show and try are like home for him I know that's like you're supposed to be like very powerful.

390
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:43,450
Like if you prevent the problem with this whole thing and you can see placement, that's what I wasn't aware of.

391
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:57,550
The reasons they're having to target behavior in the House is probably coming from thinking, Well, it's not working on that.

392
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:01,770
So that's always something that's fine.

393
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:08,960
But if that health care system works very well, it's like trying to prevent three 6 hours.

394
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:29,310
So I was thinking, okay, well has to be working.

395
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:40,840
So I don't think that that's how we should do something like this must be kind of the same.

396
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:47,130
Melinda you guys are discussing. You need to be more creative.

397
00:59:52,680 --> 01:00:00,360
So how is our current conditioning used and what were you able to pick out of?

398
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,750
The article was is very different.

399
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:20,850
Yes, we almost exclusively use positive motivational incentive points if they were like participate in the program activities.

400
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:32,670
So I use the use of positive reinforcement with those points based on their participation and some of the programing.

401
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:45,580
Well. Once they earned the points, they were able to earn their own privileges.

402
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:54,490
They have some options around what they wanted to do with the points in terms of redemption.

403
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:12,459
Yes. I have a question for supplying an extra blanket, a form of negative reinforcement, since you're kind of taken away like it's cold in here.

404
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:19,030
So let me give you another point. Like, is that negative reinforcement embedded within the positive reinforcement?

405
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:26,710
You're you're giving something to take something away.

406
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:36,080
Doesn't. Oh, thank you.

407
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:46,010
So what is it that you're giving something?

408
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:55,230
We're taking away negative stimulus.

409
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:04,160
I think I was.

410
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:20,140
I can't it be both just situationally context dependent.

411
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:27,810
So what is one way and what is one when you're receive that?

412
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:32,880
So it's positive reinforcement because you're giving them the blanket, which is reinforcing the good behavior.

413
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:37,650
It's negative reinforcement because you're taking away the being cold, which is a bad stimuli.

414
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:45,390
And so that's reinforcing the positive behavior. Why are they giving them a blanket just for three days?

415
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:49,170
That's my goodness. I'm sorry.

416
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:55,530
That's what I'm thinking about. I was just saying no endorsement.

417
01:02:55,530 --> 01:03:01,680
Saying that's not even. Oh, because, like, it's positive that you're giving them something, but you're taking it away.

418
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:15,659
I just want to say that I want them to pay for us when to be subjected.

419
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:24,090
But most of these consider the unconditioned reinforcer because the idea of warmth is like a survival beat.

420
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:29,210
So if you're taking that away, maybe that's a stimulus that you need for survival,

421
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:33,210
something that's going to motivate you to keep on with the behavior change.

422
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:37,740
Right. Yeah.

423
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:45,880
I mean, I guess it can also be an unconditional search because it gives you immediate satisfaction.

424
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:53,130
So I think that's a good way of looking at it as well. And again, context dependent in terms of how you're viewing.

425
01:03:54,900 --> 01:04:04,050
So you saw different ways of applying these concepts depending on how you saw some of these activities.

426
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:20,190
So what do you think this intervention approach did in accountability in terms of thinking about behavior change?

427
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:38,100
Any just general thoughts about this approach in this context?

428
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:49,500
Yeah, I well, we were talking about how this is like this intervention is interesting because they're in this closed, controlled environment.

429
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:57,360
So, you know, specifically with staying sober, they don't have the access to drugs or alcohol they'd have on the outside.

430
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:02,220
But say as soon as they're released, their apartments across the street from a liquor store,

431
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:07,260
it's like all the progress they made while in prison doing this intervention.

432
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:14,220
You know, it might be gone because now the availability of alcohol is a lot easier to get than it was in prison.

433
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:17,730
Yeah, that's an excellent observation because, you know,

434
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:25,110
the premise of these approaches is really on like directly observable behavior in the immediate context.

435
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:29,940
But what you're describing is a much larger context that people live in.

436
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:43,410
And like we said, these approaches don't they don't really account for culture or access to some of these stimuli and these,

437
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:46,780
like, further antecedents that might drive the behavior.

438
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:55,830
So that's where this may be limiting because it may not be instilling deeper behavior change or sustained behavior change.

439
01:05:55,830 --> 01:06:02,610
That would hopefully be it would translate to different sort of contexts beyond the one that they're.

440
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:09,720
I never related to that. There's also how this was this reinforcement was continuous.

441
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:16,020
And and maybe if it hadn't been continuing, she would have found out they stopped a lot faster.

442
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:24,420
So you can expect once they get out into the real world, that every time they make the right decision, something's going positive is going to occur.

443
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:32,610
Yeah, like we said through our lecture like this, they're on a reinforcement schedule that's I guess, not optimal.

444
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:37,469
And in real ones, they're sort of out at these settings.

445
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:46,290
And there is hopefully a desire to continue some of the behaviors that they're wanting

446
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:51,590
to shape and reinforce because it's a continuous reinforcement learning about to the.

447
01:06:53,370 --> 01:06:57,120
I'm wondering if there would be like a follow up program on the option,

448
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:02,580
like whether it be like a therapy like group sessions for like once they're done

449
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:08,790
serving time for them to like discuss what's going on with their lives since

450
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:13,120
being out or even if people are still like being able to like still have that

451
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:17,640
sense of community because I know people do it for connections quality first.

452
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,300
Yeah. So I think what you're pointing out is there,

453
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:34,950
there must be some other person differentiator or behavior change that's related to how we connect with other people.

454
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:46,860
And when we talk about social networks and social support, we're going to really dissect exactly what you're saying and its relevance to this concept.

455
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:55,409
So you bring up a good point. There may be some of these other things we know about that are just not accounted for in this approach,

456
01:07:55,410 --> 01:08:01,930
which is really do the behavior and here's your reward and here's some choices of what you can do with that.

457
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:13,430
Let me see the reactions or observations.

458
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:26,090
And another thing that comes out of that approach, Sierra, that you mentioned is motivation.

459
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:33,410
We haven't really talked about motivation yet in everything we've covered in this class so far.

460
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:41,280
So there may be opportunities to like, what are we talking about when we're talking about motivation and you know,

461
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:47,390
what is that sort of rule of behavior change and what are learns that you can create to really,

462
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:54,220
really get that out in people as it relates to the types of behaviors single issue.

463
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:11,060
So again, like like I mentioned these sorts of approaches, they really depend on the behavior and context you're working in,

464
01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:21,810
and they're not often used as prospectively as we sort of read about in this article.

465
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:31,020
My my goal with having you read this was just to see one approach, like how one might actually apply in a real world setting.

466
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:33,719
But clearly there are some limitations to this.

467
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:44,220
And this may not, you know, as we learn about different sort of frameworks in class and different psychosocial constructs and intervention approaches,

468
01:09:45,630 --> 01:09:56,500
we may consider something far more potent or complex in addressing the types of behavior change that was was really the goal of the project.

469
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:05,510
Any last questions or thoughts before we wrap today?

470
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:15,500
Okay. So one day for work, one's name will come back across.

471
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:37,370
And no serious assessment this week. So how come you're saying you're never going to like something in a 19 year old?

472
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:58,910
There's still something. I mean, I know it's not like there was a lot of discussions already.

473
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:10,970
I don't know.

474
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:37,100
You know, I think that's what I want to do.

475
01:11:37,810 --> 01:11:44,450
So I'll find you. You're not going to ever leave her alone.

476
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:51,340
Okay. You know, so.

477
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:55,160
Oh, yeah.

478
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:03,710
You know, I felt it was really good to watch online.

479
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:39,440
So I think that we can avoid that because you have a number of things that makes good sense of the 33 year old.

480
01:12:41,720 --> 01:13:12,440
I think what we really need to do right now is and I think it would be really hard to do like who had to explain to me, why did you go through?

481
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:19,070
You know, you'll have to go now.

482
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:32,540
Oh, I see. I see. We could do it to that question or something like that, right, Stu?

483
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:45,009
Except for the latter. We want you to let me I'm not going to grow any worries.

484
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:49,640
So, yeah, that's what I want to do is not going to stop with the graph.

485
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:54,530
Look. I do that.

486
01:13:54,790 --> 01:14:01,790
I know I could do. I should not take the time to get an equity.

487
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:10,280
Thought. It was a great idea.

488
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:17,230
I'm sorry. I look for to tomorrow.

489
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:23,030
I've done. Enough is enough.

490
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:30,319
Thank you. I did not write it.

491
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:38,270
Could I? Not long ago I was writing so good to not be missed though.

492
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:42,620
Of course I've just got to write a share. I said. I think mine's okay.

493
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:50,720
Maybe like maybe that's why I'm doing it, but I would rather do my own thing.

494
01:14:50,970 --> 01:14:54,720
But yeah, my sister is okay.

495
01:14:54,800 --> 01:15:00,100
Maybe I should do like. Okay.

496
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:04,460
So I'll just do it for you four and then I'll just pop it in when I call you.

497
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:08,550
Yeah. Sounds good. I'll see you guys tomorrow. That's.

498
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:14,090
But sometimes yellow. Yeah. Oh, thank you.

499
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:22,250
Is that how it goes? It is not. Well, no, it wasn't.

500
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:28,219
It was a spot in front of us. It seemed like there was a spot print. Yeah, it was actually really tight.

501
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:33,410
But I know. I mean, let me ask a question for you.

502
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:37,980
What time you get here? I'm too well in.

503
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:43,010
I can hear it early because I don't like to be in traffic. I like to get my spine.

504
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:47,720
I'm not like that because I commute. So I like to get here early, go my left, my little impact.

505
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:56,330
Then keep it going around like I'm I'm planning to always here early, have like a slow track I'm decent something like it's about no,

506
01:15:56,330 --> 01:16:03,890
you're always I'm you and a few other people but I've been here I've been trying to get here because I'm I listen, that is not it.

507
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:21,520
I said I have a feeling. Okay. Right you guys take care into.

508
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:30,050
Is there a lesson here? I don't think so. Because I just.

509
01:16:30,810 --> 01:16:31,710
That's where I hang out.
