1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,620
Okay. So so the last lecture Wednesday will be midterm, too.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:14,550
So we'll. Go through the lecture and then we should have 20 minutes or so.

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:26,190
It was a quick trip. It was really, you know, pretty simple review as we didn't cover too much after the first midterm.

4
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:37,110
Okay. So so I can cancel Fridays off as our domain imagine you will have still have questions after

5
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:45,329
the midterm but if you do set up an appointment and move it to tomorrow from 430 to 530,

6
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:52,920
hopefully everybody come back and it's a Zoom office all where is so 530.

7
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:02,280
But I won't be there. And then after 530, if there are still people asking questions that are done for you,

8
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,000
well, if you have something you cannot make, make the 430, just get it.

9
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:14,310
Get to the zoom before 530 and stay there or extend the office for.

10
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,360
Was right.

11
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:25,649
So the rules for the midterm, too, is the same as midterm one.

12
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,810
So we can bring in the electorate and size and shape both sides.

13
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:39,360
Only one cheat sheet. You can now bring your first feature once cheat sheet.

14
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,850
Last time there was a question about.

15
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:57,209
Okay, so if you want to adjust to the weights in I mean, no email don't need to make announcement anywhere, so just send me an email.

16
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:04,980
So the options are so currently is 30, 30, you can make it like 5% shift.

17
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,000
You can oh you can put more weights on the second midterm button on the.

18
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:23,530
You know, the first thing. So the least ways you can put out the the first midterm is 10%.

19
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:29,130
Okay. Right. So it's kind of a hygiene.

20
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:33,930
Right. But you need to do that before you take the second midterm.

21
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:42,040
Any questions? Good. Um, so the last lecture dealing.

22
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:54,220
So the last like curfews with the continuous time, continuous stay space mark of process.

23
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:01,180
So first we need to give a definition, formal definition for the mark of property under this setting.

24
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:14,650
So the definition, you know, all these essence, the essence of the Markov property remains the same.

25
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,380
It's always given the present, the past and the future.

26
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:30,010
Independent is just need to you just need to adjust the the notations to accommodate different setting.

27
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:39,070
So now we have a continuous time, continuous state space process.

28
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:56,120
Let's say this is continuous time. Of U.S. space.

29
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:18,980
Space stochastic process defines the Markov properties in the continuous time we have seen this version in the script space.

30
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:24,900
We just need to insert arbitrary, complete points to the timeline.

31
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:32,370
So is any zero less than zero one.

32
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:40,020
So essentially to break this. The definition is about these great time points.

33
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:49,300
But because the arbitrary of these time points actually provide a pretty rigorous definition for the continuous.

34
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:58,680
So if you insert for some of these time frames and then you have the following properties, the probability of X,

35
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:16,850
P and last are equal to Y conditional on all oh the other things x is zero equal to zero one you commit to x one and so on,

36
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:25,980
so forth, all the way up to say x minus one is x minus one.

37
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:38,580
So we can simplify this conditional probability to establish the conditional independence in such a way, this one equals probability.

38
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:50,870
You hear everything before and minus one certainty the past year, minus one is the present.

39
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,980
Some of the adjacent time points to a future.

40
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:08,540
This one is this what we will call this markoff?

41
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,810
This is the Markoff property under this setting.

42
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:32,890
This is so the only difference between this version and then the discrete time version is we use the distribution function form, right?

43
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:41,750
So that that's not equal to Y. So if you remember the first class we talk about the the most the general or the most effective.

44
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,820
The generators for the Sigma Andromeda rail line.

45
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:56,870
It's o take this form. So this is the this is for gently defiant distribution lines.

46
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,140
There you go. So this one is actually I'm trying to say it's actually more general.

47
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:10,850
It can convert. You can actually use this type of the definition and the distributional form to define even the discrete state space.

48
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:26,640
So despite the change of the formulation, the notation on the Markov property remain intact,

49
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:33,520
that it's still the same thing given the present, the past and future independent.

50
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:43,630
We need to define the transition kernel in this case definition to just before transition kernel.

51
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:51,430
So this is why we use some words like terminology like kernel.

52
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,380
So this transition is no longer a probability, right?

53
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:05,680
So this is actually density, but we re because we don't get into the measure of it or you don't we haven't formally defined conditional density.

54
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,700
So businesses just don't need to worry too much about this.

55
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:17,379
So this is the transition kernel intuitive way, very clear.

56
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:33,610
So if you have a process by the time point T in position X and then at the time point the S at a position Y, so at the time point.

57
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:39,160
So this is the time point. This is a position time point position.

58
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,610
This defines the transition property, right?

59
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:53,530
So this if you can calculate this conditional density that tells you how this transition going to occur for a

60
00:08:53,530 --> 00:09:07,959
specific continuous time continuous they space Markov process in the literature or in the under in the lecture notes,

61
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:19,930
there is a different notation is more like a shorthand notation, but just like this so that this is going to be a position in time.

62
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,370
So current position is s as I'm sorry,

63
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:38,960
the time point is as position this why it transition from the position of x and then type point is T so well you.

64
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:51,060
Reduce the strokes to right. Probably this is most be used in physics, literature and those that don't.

65
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,780
At that time there is no formal definition of conditional probability.

66
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:00,520
But this is a way, when we talk about Brownian motion, those are again discovered by physicists.

67
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:09,990
So there's initially that's sort of a notation by position, position, time, time, and then from here.

68
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:26,040
So usually it's less or less than that of every time we talk about transition kernel, we think about time homogeneity.

69
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:32,690
So, so this one doesn't necessarily implies time homogeneity.

70
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:37,740
Right. So think about time. What time, how much? Maybe time homogeneous kernel means.

71
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:46,320
So that transition probability invariant with respect to the anchor point only what

72
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:53,670
matters is the difference between the time points in this case is t minus us.

73
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,170
So the time homogeneity here we can't write.

74
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:09,620
So the p y as a t you can write this as p y as plus.

75
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:18,780
Um. Delta X.

76
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:29,390
So if this condition satisfies, this is a time homogeneous market process.

77
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:41,130
Because so the way we do this, we shift the time by the same amount, write the present and then the future by the same amount.

78
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:48,360
And then this transition probability doesn't change. So this is a set shift, the anchor points by Delta.

79
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:55,830
So the difference of the time points deal T minus s m, so t minus S,

80
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:01,439
and then they they have the side of the and then in this case, it's also a T minus,

81
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:13,860
as if the kernel invariant with respect to the shift of these anchor points that we call this is a kind of homogeneous Markov process.

82
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:26,040
And then in this case, we may have a even kind of simplify this kernel into he acts transit to Y.

83
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:37,110
Um, right. So this is a from x to Y in as minus t, t minus s as.

84
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,600
Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. So this is minus.

85
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:52,410
So in this case, you only give the interval and then you know, and then the position.

86
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:59,610
So if it's a time homogeneous Markov process, what matters is the interval once.

87
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:05,130
So that's minus T and the position change is from X to Y.

88
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,190
All right. So those are all these are the notations just.

89
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:19,640
It's too long to compare to what we already have in the previous setting.

90
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:26,090
Any questions? Right.

91
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:36,319
So up to this point, you may already know the most important thing or maybe the most important property for.

92
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:43,820
And the mark of property is called the overall equation.

93
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:54,500
We have seen Chapman chromatography equation in Markov chain in continuous times, a disgraced deep space Markov process.

94
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:59,150
And this is the final version for the continuous space case.

95
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:08,419
Okay. So we're interested in this transition in terms of transition density in Y.

96
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,870
S X, right?

97
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:17,180
Thinking about this as a transition position, this is the transition of the time.

98
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:23,960
All right. How do we express the type of equation?

99
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,980
So we need to insert where all elements are intermediate point.

100
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:35,540
So in this case, so our starting point is X 70, right?

101
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:44,810
So let's make the intermediate stop as Z and U.

102
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:59,719
So at the time point, you we stop at Z. This is an ex T and then we continue the journey from Z and you to the target Y.

103
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:13,670
And that's why as you write so some of you assume there is a intermediate stop and this is better,

104
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:20,690
that intermediate is always denoted by time you position Z.

105
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:27,790
So the only thing you need to take care of is you are assuming a position.

106
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,010
The Z and this position need to be integrated out.

107
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:37,489
Right. So these are kind of marginalized. So you do to you here.

108
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,300
Is that the right this.

109
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:53,530
Okay. So usually this is an integral from negative infinity.

110
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:59,040
So that's all possible values, alpha Z or in the over.

111
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:15,010
And then to show the the chronicle of the relationship between the three time points, this is the past, the present and the future.

112
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:19,270
So we should have the last few months.

113
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,960
Okay. So you is arbitrary as long as it's in between as you can always insert this.

114
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:44,130
This is the Chapman method for my growth equation, the integral form for continuous time and this generation.

115
00:16:54,190 --> 00:17:00,309
All right. So the secret ingredient, if you are fix your starting point, you may get from here.

116
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:08,690
So you've got fix access 006, meaning that that particular quantity is given at time zero.

117
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,860
The position is good so that you can actually derive the problem,

118
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:21,190
the marginal distribution of the displacement or the position of this process at the time.

119
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,090
Right. So I skipped that part. This is true.

120
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:37,720
Okay. So those are the general problems for continuous time, continuous space, space, Markov process.

121
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:56,020
So the specific process we have to study this is called Brownian motion of or winner of process.

122
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:11,170
So the winner, I think, is the first one to actually discover the Brownian motion under the microscope.

123
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:20,440
So probably all know the best story. So there is there's a kind of important discovery in.

124
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:30,180
In physics. So they are showing there is the molecules and the existence of molecules that the

125
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:38,730
water molecules make and the polymer particles move doing some irregular movements.

126
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:46,380
So this is also known as the winner process. From our perspective, we.

127
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:56,940
So last time we said there is there is a way to derive this type of the winter process

128
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:03,900
using that knowledge of this great time and even the discrete state space Markov chain.

129
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:13,700
Okay. I'm not going to the details of the derivation of a lot of the derivation as the details are shown on the the light channels.

130
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:20,070
You just need to read through those. But some of the basic idea is actually a random walk.

131
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,290
So the starting point is a random walk in the lattice.

132
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:33,540
So, so our starting point is so this is a trying to show how we can get a process like that.

133
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:48,010
So the starting point is a simple random walk on the cross.

134
00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:01,620
So your state space is going to be one dimensional. The space space is going to be zero.

135
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:10,260
Positive negative, delta x positive negative with two, delta X, so on and so forth.

136
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:16,980
So you get the idea so that every movement and you take one step, that's the unit of Delta X, right?

137
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:27,210
So this is a basic setting for random walk. Previously we kind of ignore there is a unit just positive negative one.

138
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:32,640
Positive negative two. So you could go up one or two, one step.

139
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,610
Now it's just attached to a unit to it. It's kind of important later on.

140
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:45,850
And then the movement is also. The TV is in.

141
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,560
So this is an index set, right? So we should use the capital T here.

142
00:20:51,940 --> 00:21:00,880
We're considered zero delta T, so this is basically the discrete side, zero 1 to 3, so on and so forth.

143
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,620
But again, we're going to attach a unit to it.

144
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:15,250
Well, the idea is we can well, this doesn't change the nature of random lock.

145
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:29,330
We can simply write, describe this random walk with this new location without any issues.

146
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:33,490
Right. So those are just a unit attached to it.

147
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:47,770
So let's define this. You acts t as the probability acts of t x.

148
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:53,260
So this is a marginal distribution for the number of random variables.

149
00:21:53,530 --> 00:22:02,950
So I'm interested in track of this random walk, and I'm trying to ask the question, what is the probability this random walk ended in position?

150
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,000
X at the time? T Right. So.

151
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:24,690
So we use this notation to do that. How do we get there?

152
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:33,480
It's actually pretty simple, right? So we we have deal we have been dealing with this type of problem from the first electrode,

153
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:39,370
this clause from the from the gamblers towards type of the problem.

154
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,790
We can conditional on one specific right.

155
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:48,870
So that, you know, it's only possible that.

156
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:55,080
Right. So let's say we kind of write out this.

157
00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:04,050
So this is basically we're trying to understand what is the position of this run the walk,

158
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:13,530
what is the probability of this random walk ended up in position X at the time scale at the time point the T plus building.

159
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,430
All right. Well, I mean, just move a little bit forward.

160
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:26,690
So this is kind of an idea for looking forward for a short period of time and then to figure out this.

161
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,040
The most natural way now to do it is a conditioned on a position.

162
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:41,160
Of this of this random walk at a time t. So it's actually pretty simple to write that out.

163
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:50,520
So is the probability p. If the position the move the the run them walk at time t is x minus delta x.

164
00:23:50,940 --> 00:24:04,600
So this basically means that the move a movement is moving up towards the right as he hides you next minus delta x over time he is free.

165
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:20,180
So that's one possibility where because basically conditioning the position at the time T and then plus two.

166
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:32,310
So this is one minus p famous you x plus mailbags so you can be one letter up but move backwards with probability q.

167
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,380
So. So like this. Right.

168
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:42,800
So this is a different situation.

169
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:51,150
If you want to call this right, you get this type of the simple equation from the WAF on.

170
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:55,800
And at this point we can easily drive this.

171
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:07,170
The rest of those derivation, it's all calculus is basically no probabilistic thinking anymore.

172
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:19,470
So you get this type of the differential equation and then you feel that Delta T close to zero and the Delta acts close to zero.

173
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:33,980
So what I what I won't show up here with in the lecture notes is some sort of a Taylor expansion.

174
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:37,280
That's only the function you ask.

175
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:42,650
You have to assume this is some continuous property for this function.

176
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:47,240
If you then if you make delta t goes to zero and then the other acts.

177
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:51,350
So essentially you are just making that unit arbitrarily small.

178
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:59,270
Right now, it's if it's arbitrarily small, you still get like discrete moves about that move.

179
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:06,280
But the movement, the displacement is so small, is getting to the property of continuous movement.

180
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:12,260
So you need to take both build axes goes to zero on a scale that goes to zero.

181
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:24,260
And then you get this. So call it the fusion equation when you p equals negative.

182
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:34,330
See you across over to x.

183
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,460
Right. So the key here is from here to here is all calculus.

184
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:48,980
There's nothing really special, nothing really complicated in terms of a probability theory.

185
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:53,990
But you got two continuous variables you're considering.

186
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,870
That's why you get a partial differential equation.

187
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:04,850
One is you make delta T, the T is a is one variable and then the displacement axis another variable.

188
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:12,140
Right. If you make the accent and the movement arbitrarily small, you get this diffusion equation.

189
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:22,280
This is not all very different than the way we're thinking about the processing process.

190
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:28,640
As a matter of fact, you can derive for song process this way.

191
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:34,490
The underlying discrete process is known as binary process.

192
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:40,489
You have this delta, the T and then the delta X.

193
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:44,300
There is just basically a binary event, right?

194
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:51,860
Any time points, you just flip a point. If it's a one, that means something happening and then if a zero, nothing happened.

195
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:59,000
So if you keep counting this occurrence of the events, you get your a discrete version of a plus on present.

196
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,360
And then if you take the limit to.

197
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,820
In that case. Take the limit, though, just with respect to.

198
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,310
You get your croissant processed. We didn't show that. But this way.

199
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:21,660
This is how we get to the Brownian motion, the solution to the partial differential equation.

200
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:27,630
So first of all, solving a partial differential equation, even like this one, is non-trivial.

201
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,080
You need some conditions, but this one happened to be solvable.

202
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:36,629
And then it's actually well known in physics.

203
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:46,530
When people study of thermodynamics, they have been having control of this type of equation.

204
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:52,830
And then the solution to this is what we know nowadays as primary emotion.

205
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:57,690
Okay. So essentially the solution I can show you.

206
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:18,150
It's. And so there you see the solution.

207
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:31,530
So I also didn't say what is see, what is the those are the calls to define the by some of the properties.

208
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:36,330
But those constant names require some particular records.

209
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:42,029
There are some conditions to make sure there's whole movement.

210
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:46,170
This moves everywhere. So those are the.

211
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:56,240
You need additional assumptions to make sure the young people of Eastern Europe defied Kennedy.

212
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:06,080
You get this, you have to set this sort of a marginal stance on the acts he has is for.

213
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:26,650
Any time he thinks about Rachel to me he acts minus X zero, minus C, Times Square.

214
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:32,870
So this is a given over time. Zero. The position of the movement is that X is zero.

215
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:43,290
Okay. By the whole purpose of writing this, all of this string, just trying to show the density is actually a normal density, right?

216
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:51,890
So there are ways that the variance being eight times T and the center is X zero.

217
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:55,850
So this is a C type C is non-zero, you see a shift.

218
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:04,160
So the C is the shift a term and then this D is the variance term.

219
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:08,930
So this is how diffusion is solved is the variance is like.

220
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,790
Keep the center the same and then just getting bigger and bigger.

221
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:19,380
So this is the diffusion term. It's call it the second term is for the diffusion term.

222
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:25,920
The first term is called the shift term. But nevertheless, none of these matters, the solution isn't normal.

223
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:42,390
So that means marginally the max follows normal distribution with means that six year old plus price plus C times three.

224
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:51,840
I like various types. Okay, so this is the marginal distribution.

225
00:31:52,440 --> 00:32:02,579
We derive them from a by doing this calculus trick and that applies over these properties.

226
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:07,230
So implicitly, we already applied the Markov property there, right?

227
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:12,330
The Markov property is embodied in the random walk scheme.

228
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:23,340
So the movement to from a to t possibility only depends on what the position t what the particle is at the time.

229
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:28,440
T Right. So okay, so there you go.

230
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,190
So this is the solution for the Brownian motion.

231
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:42,749
Again, this is a how you can get Brownian motion without any preliminary knowledge.

232
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:51,120
Just trying to think of doing this kind of thought experiment, just make the discrete time,

233
00:32:52,290 --> 00:33:02,370
this great state space process here are time interval and the displacement of each step arbitrarily small.

234
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:12,580
Then this is the consequence of that. You get a continuous time, continuous space process and then they have the property margin.

235
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,600
All the anxiety is normal distributed.

236
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:28,700
All right. So next so we can afford it and find the Brownian motion or standard Brownian motion.

237
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:34,940
So the standard of Brownian motion will be a special case of what we cannot discuss,

238
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:44,240
specifically the shift to term, the C going to be zero and then we going to specify D equals one.

239
00:33:44,280 --> 00:34:05,300
So that gives us the standard from emotion. But the way because it's a destination, we have more things spilled into that, into the statement.

240
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:16,760
All right. So that motivates the brand emotion. And then this is worked on to define the standard for emotion.

241
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:37,750
So this is known as the winner process with the equals one and then no [INAUDIBLE] in terms of C equal to zero.

242
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:51,160
This usually use the notations w t stop instruments for the winner process.

243
00:34:52,720 --> 00:35:02,590
All right, here is the definition. So remember, the person has five assumptions to define.

244
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:07,419
So the postulate for a song is five are five.

245
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:18,690
And then for Brownian motion, there are three. Pretty straightforward for one last but the two.

246
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:27,720
First of all, we have double duty to -1 trillion.

247
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:34,200
We need to have 201. Oh, no, this is fine.

248
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,850
So right this way.

249
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:49,040
So this one first. Define the marginal distributions of 50 to -21.

250
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:55,760
All as normal. Your secret like this one.

251
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:07,549
So if you're trying to calculate displacement from time points, t one and two.

252
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:10,910
T two. Right. So that the time.

253
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:21,780
Interval s t to minus t one. So those displacement is a random variable and that random variable is normally

254
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:27,600
distributed with meaning zero and t to avoid the variance t two minus t one.

255
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:36,000
Okay. Well, visit. Go back and visit this problem again the second.

256
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:43,620
So this defines and essentially defines the marginal distribution because if I tell you what the top zero is,

257
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:51,870
you could condition on that in zero that you find the marginal distribution of every random variable in that process.

258
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:58,070
Right. Secondly, we have W with T two.

259
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:06,840
So this one is. Secondly, we have wt2.

260
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:15,840
So that displacement for non overlapping time intervals cannot be independent

261
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:41,190
1.0 So the statement says there is a three so 0021t2 it looks like consecutive.

262
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:45,660
So the type two time intervals are consecutive, not overlapping.

263
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:53,640
You could actually do the same statement. The four again just arbitrary two non-overlapping intervals.

264
00:37:54,180 --> 00:38:00,419
This is a kind of lazy combination without introducing the same two time points,

265
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:09,390
but as long as they're two type intervals non-overlapping with displacement, the in those intervals are independent.

266
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:22,630
Okay, that's part of the definition. So you could actually combine with.

267
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,750
So true. Okay. So it's not in.

268
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:34,940
So the third one. So the first one and second one.

269
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:56,520
So we had the first one and the second one. The third one is simple, which is basically saying probability w zero equal to zero is one.

270
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:02,610
Or you could write this probability statement us w zero equal to zero.

271
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:09,540
Right. The same thing. So that zero is things that happened.

272
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,350
Zero. And then that's it. That's the story.

273
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:18,100
The definitions, the three assumptions need to.

274
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:23,330
Needed more defined a standard Brownian motion.

275
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:37,880
So given the destination one one kind of a comment.

276
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:47,720
So you don't need to know. So this the derivation from the simple random walk is a way to motivate Brownian motion.

277
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:51,890
Right. So the definition doesn't depend on prevention.

278
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:57,020
This is just a formal way to define what it is. And then there is a connection.

279
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:01,610
So that basically saying you can get Brownian motion from discrete time,

280
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:08,060
discrete states, space, random walk, but you don't have to have it to explain anything.

281
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:14,629
In the formal definition, the formal definition is just this three assumptions saying if you have one,

282
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:17,900
two, three, you've got yourself a Brownian motion. Okay.

283
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:30,620
But there is some thing we do. Well, overall, this three properties that you should be unfamiliar with.

284
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:39,530
You should be familiar with all of these. And there are some if you put them all together, there are some interesting consequences.

285
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:43,390
So, first of all, what is the marginal distribution of stamp duty?

286
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,560
All right. So we can pick the first one third.

287
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:57,800
So w t equals w t minus W zero.

288
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:09,800
Yes. Because W zero always equals zero. So this one, this form zero, t -0.

289
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,830
So stability is always normal.

290
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:19,340
Zero T distribution. Yeah.

291
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:33,710
So the. So this gives you the marginal distribution essentially by combining one and three.

292
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,600
But if you look one up.

293
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:47,180
So again, there is a problem. We should remind you what we have studied in the porcelain process.

294
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:56,490
So the displacement, the t to to t one only depend on the interval length, not the anchor point.

295
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:02,300
So the first property essentially is stationary.

296
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:16,330
And similarly, you can tell the second one non-overlapping intervals are independent.

297
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:22,870
That is again independent to something.

298
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:46,440
Right. So essentially to define this, the alternative way to define the Brownian motion of we have stationary increment,

299
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:53,700
we have independent increment, and then we can define this marginal distribution w t as just normal zero t.

300
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:01,840
So all of this is real. So this is reinterpret the interpretation of those.

301
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,300
They're essentially equivalent. It's pretty easy to understand.

302
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,920
Yeah. So with this.

303
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:29,770
We can all we can also think how do we simulate a motion of or visualize problems is the right term to use because of these things.

304
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:44,860
So you cannot completely replicate the realization of of the stochastic process of finite random variables in

305
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:51,790
this in this case uncomfortably in finite or the variable by you can visualize this based on the destination,

306
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:56,590
right? So how do you do that? There is a simple way.

307
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:09,340
So one is on the Y, you track the placement of displacement w, t and in the x axis you would just hope so.

308
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:15,970
Let's say you are only interested in the certain time points so we can print in service intervals.

309
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:23,950
So only in this, but you can make this time intervals more.

310
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:27,610
This takes of time arbitrarily dense.

311
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:32,590
So you have a lot of these intervals and this intervals is really, really small.

312
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:41,200
It's become the similar idea of tracking a simple random walk and then take a limit sort of thing.

313
00:44:42,640 --> 00:45:05,320
So fixing so what we can thinks of t01 all the way up to ten a priori I thought we just need to simulate the displacement before each interval.

314
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,830
Right. So what is the wt0?

315
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:14,559
So if you start doing the simulation that says the first points, you need to do it.

316
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,190
You have to do it in a in a.

317
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,330
In the order when these things are pretty fine, right?

318
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,030
So just look at the definition.

319
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:36,350
This one here, be normal. Zero zero. So you first simulate that point for me.

320
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:49,999
If I say it's here, zero. And now you need to simulate t one and you don't really necessarily need to know do the marginal thing.

321
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,890
Because in this case, it's a if it's a realization, it's always conditional.

322
00:45:55,190 --> 00:46:07,579
So y you know, is wt1 conditional, wt0 is equivalent to simulate the interval t one minus one minus wt0.

323
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:14,209
Right. So this is basically simulated a movement conditional on either t zero.

324
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:17,510
You are in simulated position.

325
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:29,890
And then what is the most. So this one by the property you want minus one at this point so you can control these points.

326
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:35,990
So what we see, see is a pattern, but you can simulate them and then you can connect them.

327
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:43,220
So that's visualize the Brownian motion this way.

328
00:46:50,290 --> 00:47:08,930
Good. So if you go back to the definition there's not really difficult to figure all some of the.

329
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:18,680
Things in the program. Emotion again.

330
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:22,340
What we know about Brownian motion is the definition.

331
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:28,470
You don't need to go back to the partial differential equation, but again, that's something that's a motivation.

332
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:33,110
All you know is the definition. Everything is encoded in that definition.

333
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:49,840
For example, let well, I think one of the questions we can ask the joint distribution of wt0, wt1.

334
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:55,740
Let's just say this what the joint distribution that just to time points t zero last month.

335
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:01,010
You want to know what is the, um, the joint distribution of those?

336
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:08,239
All right. So first of all, you need to know this is a marginal distribution.

337
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,640
So you want to figure out the drawing that you need to know. What is the marginal distribution?

338
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:18,910
Um, the marginal distribution is normal, right?

339
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:25,010
And then that's well defined by the definition. So here is.

340
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:31,370
Kind of a tendency to think the drawing distribution must be also be normal.

341
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:38,540
Not always the case. Just be careful. In this case, it is indeed a normal.

342
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:45,740
And then there is you can view life from the point of view of using all these properties.

343
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:51,850
So they have zero zero.

344
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:56,930
So. So. Well, if it's a drawing. So, first of all, not if.

345
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:04,580
Okay, let's let me put this way. So if you are given the question I ask you, you have two normal distribution.

346
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:11,510
And then what is the drawing? Distribution is not always multivariate normal.

347
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,170
Most cases is not. That may be surprising,

348
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:25,880
but this is the the case one people study for example the formula finger all there is all kinds of the distribution you can have

349
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:33,680
their joint distribution big margin marginally there the normal distribution but the joint distribution is not that's being said.

350
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:44,300
So you can actually derive in the way trying to write about zero on the coffee table one from the first principle,

351
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:53,480
you can derive that this is indeed the density of a multivariate norm or in this case, a by normal distribution.

352
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:57,719
Okay. This case is. All right.

353
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:04,140
So the question is, if we if I tell you, if this is a multivariate normal, what is that distribution?

354
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:09,690
Can you figure all that? So while the very normal has this property.

355
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:13,140
Right. So the mean determines the by the marginal mean.

356
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:20,920
So zero zero. That hasn't been true. What about the variants?

357
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,700
You also know this is t zero is at1.

358
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:30,660
Right this way. Right.

359
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:36,790
Those are just the variants. And the only thing I need to figure out is what is the covariance?

360
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:53,930
Is the choir in zero? Now.

361
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:58,930
Why not? Very good.

362
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:02,990
I think it's not zero because they share a path. Right.

363
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,870
They share the path of the zero path so that we have the zero.

364
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:14,680
Okay. So if it's all zero, how do we calculate that?

365
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:24,950
Okay. This seemingly is difficult problem. But the worry, I think in the example, if you have this type of the problem, what do you do?

366
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:32,710
We only know the definition. But the flip side is that this to solve this problem, we only need to know the definition.

367
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:37,120
Right. So just go back to the first principle.

368
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:41,380
If you want to calculate covariance on something, then you can calculate.

369
00:51:42,340 --> 00:52:00,660
Go back to the destination. Whereas again in zero nine, stop 91 and then divide it by expecting about zero and expecting documents you want to write.

370
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:06,810
And in this case, this is simple. This one zero already set marginally.

371
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:12,220
There's the expected value of both of these are zero. So we only need to calculate.

372
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:37,000
Up. Well, the other thing you want to think about this is the property tells us about intervals.

373
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:46,330
Now the absolute data points, if you have to sequentially place the time points, you can rewrite that as the interval.

374
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:53,320
For example, once you kind of rewrite that, the key one.

375
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:05,200
Stop moving to zero class wt1 -0.

376
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:08,920
Right. So this way you you're right.

377
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:12,800
But leave her putting points at the entryway. Right.

378
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:23,770
And this also shows here is a condition that the wt1 dot zero share the path because you first need to get to about zero.

379
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:29,020
And then they do another displacement property one zero.

380
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:32,590
Right. Okay. Now, if we can right this way.

381
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:46,240
And this is after zero multiplied by wt0 plus minus.

382
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:51,990
Well, I think if we cannot see this, I think everybody can see this.

383
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,080
But you can't you can always write this.

384
00:53:57,370 --> 00:54:03,100
So this is always a creation plaza t zero, subtract the T zero.

385
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:08,559
And then here you use that stationary increment condition.

386
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:20,260
So this one, this random variable, has the same distribution and as this is the only way.

387
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:25,800
And then this becomes easier.

388
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:37,410
So because we're dealing with two different intervals, one is from zero 2 to 0, the other interval is from 0 to 2 one as indicated here.

389
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:52,770
Then you have expected value wt0 squared plus wt0 multiplied by 21 -0.

390
00:54:54,350 --> 00:55:00,770
Or maybe you want to write maybe this way that's easier for them and for the argument.

391
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,810
The key of these is all of this run.

392
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:11,510
The variables has zero. And then you should realize this random variable wt0.

393
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:21,740
And then the run. The variable essentially is wt1 minus not zero are independent because of this independent increment assumption.

394
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:27,650
So they have a mean zero. Both of them have a marginal you have zero on their independent.

395
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:36,560
So this term okay means zero. So at the end of the day, it's just the zero square.

396
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:48,230
And what is that? That is basically the variance of top zero, which is zero.

397
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:53,090
Again, this is the second moment, but the first moment is zero.

398
00:55:54,170 --> 00:55:59,150
So this is a equals the variance of the topic of T zero, which is zero.

399
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:02,700
So. So we figure this out.

400
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,270
The covariance is essentially the smaller one.

401
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:16,670
So the feel of this, you got t 0 to 1 and everything else is zero.

402
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:26,190
So in general, you can write this.

403
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:42,460
So we can write up the covariance of W as w t just equal to minimum number.

404
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:51,630
Right. So it's basically determine the by the shared timeline.

405
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,580
Right. So which one is smaller? That means this part is share.

406
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:59,960
The share in time length is the minimum S or T.

407
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:12,350
So this is just trying to show that every thing you want to learn about the Brownian motion can be derived from the first principle.

408
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:17,570
There is a lot of interest. There are a lot of interesting properties of all the Brownian motion.

409
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:26,180
So. So you may know that from, you know, from other contacts.

410
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:29,450
LeBron emotion is everywhere continuous.

411
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:35,090
I again you can prove that from the first but nowhere differentiable.

412
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:41,420
So this is a kind of a we are a process everywhere continuous but nowhere.

413
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:45,560
Well, how can the function be continuous, not differentiable.

414
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:49,170
So you should be able to see this type of function, right?

415
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:59,180
So that if you have like this type of the sudden change like this, the straight line, straight line here, x x, absolute value of x.

416
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:06,229
So this point is continuous, but not differentiable. So, so branching motion is everywhere.

417
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:15,410
Continuous in the sense you can, you should know what what the meaning of continuous is from the calculus.

418
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:19,160
And then you should also know what the meaning of differentiable.

419
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:22,969
This is not like on the lecture notes,

420
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:32,420
but this is kind of interesting probably for from the motion is everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable.

421
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:43,420
All of these can be derived the from the first principle just using glossary definitions.

422
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:57,000
Okay. I guess that's all for the lectures.

423
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:04,980
The one to squeeze more than that for your and for your preparation for the midterm.

424
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:11,010
Meantime, to fall back on emotion, think about the, you know, the big picture thing.

425
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:19,010
Just the. You know, if you have to write down that she changed that story, property should be sufficient.

426
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:29,120
But kind of applying those properties requires a little bit more familiarity with the whole process.

427
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:32,450
So go through some of the example on the lecture notes.

428
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:42,610
Okay. Um, so we have about 20 minutes, like to give you a quick review on what we have learned,

429
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:50,380
what our, what my expectation is for you for the new term to go backwards.

430
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:54,910
Um, so, so this is a Brownian motion.

431
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:59,860
My expectation this, you know, the, um, the definition.

432
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:06,009
Obviously you should understand the connection between the, um, well, I mean, that motivation,

433
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:12,310
for example, you definitely don't need to know how to solve that partial differential equation.

434
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:24,489
But the important thing is that three is that independent increment, stationary increment assumption and then the w t is normal zero t distribution.

435
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:29,400
So that way we define Brownian motion. Okay. So that's the function.

436
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:47,440
So the rest of those are going to be continuous time, discrete state space.

437
01:00:47,470 --> 01:01:05,950
Markoff process. The most important one being the pull song because so if you look back with all of the knowledge we have now,

438
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:15,790
we have now with respect to continuous Markoff property on Chapman for my part of the equation,

439
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,400
if you look at the pull song process,

440
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:26,050
you should understand that the derivation is actually based on the for the Chapman core girl for equation, right?

441
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:35,230
So for actually for any of those continuous times, stochastic under continuous time, discrete state space,

442
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:43,620
stochastic process is critical to understand the what is the sort of the derivations come from the the forward equation.

443
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:52,660
So essentially you draw this type of the diagram from zero to T and then you look ahead for T plus H.

444
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:57,400
So this is all interval H. So this gives you that.

445
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:04,830
The four equation Y because you have the zero T plus H and then the intermediate stop at the T.

446
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:08,710
So you are interested. We are actually interested in the property at the time.

447
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:14,780
T, but we look forward to a small window and then trying to relate this, um,

448
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:22,980
the random variable x, t plus h with that and that's how we derive all these processes.

449
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:34,610
So for Poisson process, obviously you need to know the definition by how we define the and the Poisson process,

450
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:42,660
the, the counting process requirement and zero equal to zero stationary increment, independent increment.

451
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:47,260
And then the way we define the small window and run parallel.

452
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:56,069
So that's been a theme how to define this right enough age and matter of fact,

453
01:02:56,070 --> 01:03:04,690
all these others have similar way to define the small window random variable, right?

454
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:09,180
Is that the pure birth process in the person death process?

455
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:25,350
The other important thing for may be for all of these things are arrival time distribution.

456
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:35,880
All right. Again, you can kind of review the entire arrival time distribution for over the Marcos process.

457
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:45,090
So so last time we you know, I don't know if all of you are here or you have reviewed the lecture recording.

458
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:51,359
So all the Markov process can be characterized using the internal arrival distribution, right?

459
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:59,460
So they are all independent exponential distribution and then the next is embedded,

460
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:06,930
some sort of a movement Markov chain invited into exponential distribution.

461
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,170
So you can make sense of that.

462
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:17,670
So we last time also said the difference between a markov process versus a CI, my Markov process, those are not in the lecture notes.

463
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:28,049
But this is those things make it easy to, you know, make high level connections that make you're sort of clear on a lot of things, right?

464
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:37,920
So for CI, my Markov process, we have arbitrary wait time distribution and then we have invalid Markov jump process.

465
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,220
We can move from one state to another state, but only.

466
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:48,510
But typically it is not a markov process that doesn't follow the Markov property.

467
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:56,940
Only if the wait time distribution, the entire arrival time distribution is exponential, independent, exponential.

468
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:01,890
That makes the underlying process being Markov.

469
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:09,390
Why is that case? This has to relate, has to be related to memory loss property, right?

470
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:19,709
So if you have wait long time enough and then for any other distributions, if you don't have memory loss property, you wait long enough.

471
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:26,250
I actually tell you, you know, that you are going to occur soon in the way, right?

472
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:34,470
So that is not Markov. The longer you wait, the sooner the expected, the time of event cannot occur.

473
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:44,400
So this is not Markov only the memory, the less property ensure the Markov property in the intuitive way, the longer how long you wait.

474
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:49,200
You look at hat, you don't have a clue about where the rival going to come, right?

475
01:05:49,560 --> 01:06:01,320
So this is why intuitively we all you have you have all these wait time distribution in Markov markup process being exponentially distributed.

476
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:09,240
So this is just the first time Poisson process is the first time and this is the strongest one they have idea, right?

477
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:15,450
Not only the way time distribution is independently exponential, they are identical.

478
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:19,480
You. Distributed with exponential lambda.

479
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:29,380
This is the same lambda dictator PDA, the porcine rate and the plus on that.

480
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:34,809
So in that way we talk about the inter arrival time distribution also.

481
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:39,370
We also talk about the arrival time distribution.

482
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:54,309
So the arrival time distribution versus intertribal is just the scale is different the more

483
01:06:54,310 --> 01:07:01,010
the reference point that the arrival time distribution always refers to the time zero.

484
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:06,580
So the first that you find is s one, the second and then is the same as the T one arrival.

485
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:17,049
But the second arrival time is going to be asked to, which is inter arrival time t one plus two to the two inter arrival time.

486
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:21,850
I have that together. So you may know this is going to become a random variable, right?

487
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:27,940
So this is some of the independent exponential is going to be the IP one.

488
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:34,660
But others well, this is this is a consequence you already know.

489
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:44,080
But we actually study the conditional distribution of arrival time, conditional on arrival time of being by such and such.

490
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:50,200
What is the distribution number? What is the arrival time in the interval?

491
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:58,570
Right. So the sum of the uniform distributions should remind you, take a look of that.

492
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:07,900
So there are going to be problems and ask you about those either, especially in the homework problem.

493
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:13,569
I need to ask you about the inter arrival time versus arrival time.

494
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:20,020
So first of all, and I'll sort those things out and then sometimes it's not.

495
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:28,850
Just memorizing the results is how flexible you can use these.

496
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:39,920
Equivalency between the space space you have versus versus the random time distribution.

497
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:55,340
Right. So if I say she won less than or equal to T, that implies this is an equivalent distribution, this equivalent statement about and what is on t.

498
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:01,910
At least one is safe again. At least one.

499
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:11,760
At least one, yes. Very good. So if you can freely thinking about these two lines, you cut through one problem, one type of a problem into the other.

500
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:16,290
Which way is easier? You can use that to solve your problem.

501
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:21,270
So a lot of problems are going to be like this. This is a kind of a very, very useful.

502
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:28,900
Thinking in solving problems in continuous time, stochastic process.

503
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:37,150
All right, so this is a poor song. I know. We start relaxing after this thunder before song.

504
01:09:37,150 --> 01:09:43,570
We start relaxing the the constraints we get the generalization of the poor song.

505
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:56,440
Some of these are the feeling of the full song process and that you should also remember the non homogeneous and pull song,

506
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:09,760
you know, thinking about the generalization, about the being, being a curve.

507
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:22,990
And then if you want to calculate t0t1 so this area under the curve going to determine the median, right?

508
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:31,230
So if you're asking the question and the key one -20 zero in the non homogeneous pool of song.

509
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:45,370
So you know, this is a poor song and then the rate, the mean variable is determined by the area under the curve.

510
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:51,880
It's the wrong terminology, but you know what I mean.

511
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,730
So there are different ways to write this.

512
01:10:57,490 --> 01:11:07,750
And then in the standard poor song, because this is just the straight line, so therefore it's just the line that you want, minus the right one times.

513
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:14,200
Parenthesis, one -0. Okay.

514
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:21,500
So other variants of the person, we have a sampling of a person process.

515
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:27,150
We have the conditional person. But that's a more like a conceptual thing, right?

516
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:35,410
We if we remove this independent increment constraint, we can make the lambda a random variable,

517
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:39,650
then this is a conditional or mixing mixture of such process.

518
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:42,950
So conditional alarm, but still with the standard poor song.

519
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:52,100
But you do need to understand now you don't have independent increment because different increments

520
01:11:52,480 --> 01:12:00,800
not overlapping control share of information about random variable lambda so not particularly.

521
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:10,670
Tricky is just a conceptual thing. Right.

522
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:13,800
And then there's kind of a component person process.

523
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:19,790
Those are the probably the most difficult one, the queuing application.

524
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:27,920
I guess it's unrealistic to test anybody if you've never seen a queuing process until you find

525
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:35,270
the solution for one queue without high level of difficulty is reasonable for a mid-term.

526
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:47,540
But at the same time, I think you should go through the lecture notes to see what the where is the creative way to solve

527
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:55,060
that so that the representation of ion q AMG one Q is really the key to solve all the problems,

528
01:12:55,190 --> 01:13:06,440
not necessarily the underlying processes to to to represent the waiting queue as a tree is really the key point to to solve the whole thing,

529
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:11,840
which, as you may argue, is not really related to the casting process, but.

530
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:21,420
You know, if your only care for the exam, you could ignore that, which is true.

531
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:32,700
But you need to know we can build upon the person process and then come up with something like more

532
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:41,460
complicated the processes and the interactions between done for for for real life application.

533
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:46,980
Okay then from person to pure birth.

534
01:13:50,610 --> 01:14:00,570
Now we move upon the the person process, the first mark of process, we learn that it's the pure birth.

535
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:11,690
So again, this is can be viewed as a generalization of the person process is just the rate becomes population dependent right.

536
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:23,160
So does the read of the pure births is always a function of the the current population size and the birth and the process.

537
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:37,620
The expectation for the person death is you should be familiar with the following concept the definition.

538
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:43,500
Right. How do we define it? It's very similar to what we have in the persona process.

539
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:53,790
How do write the forward and backward the equation right and the consequence of a stationary distribution?

540
01:14:54,570 --> 01:15:04,500
So what the implication, if I tell you there is stationary distribution, then what is the implication on the forward of that course equation?

541
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:10,120
So they basically, you know, that's the definition.

542
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:16,580
Right. But he goes for infinity. Yeah. He cannot be in Taiji.

543
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:27,340
Right. So the consequence of that is if you have the the differential equation about P,

544
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:43,330
I, G, if this is a constant, this one has to be, you know, zero against three.

545
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:50,050
So connecting the mathematical interpretation and then the definition.

546
01:15:50,410 --> 01:16:02,410
Right. So the last one is finite state space. You know, there we talk a lot about representation, um, on different things.

547
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:07,660
But all of those are consequences of Chapman for my girl equation.

548
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:16,870
If you would, just review. So I expect you to understand the basic representation of finite state space.

549
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:34,600
Um. Markov process on continuous time and uh, understand the derivation of why we cannot write the derive the so the partial differential I'm sorry,

550
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:41,139
not the partial, the differential equation. How do you write the differential equation?

551
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:44,380
Just using the Chapman court rules.

552
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:57,710
For me. Yeah, I think we're we've got to don't be too stressed that we don't have a lot of materials after this.

553
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:06,290
You know, I think, as I said, I think the exam is also a kind of a learning process.

554
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:10,730
I may throw something, you know, you'd never we have never.

555
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:19,910
It's not a test of how how well, you you you know, you are the material part of those are for those purposes.

556
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:30,170
But I think there's also something like learning how you can use different properties you already know to discover something you've never heard of.

557
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:37,700
So you don't need to prepare for that sort of thing. Yeah.

558
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:41,940
So office hour. Anybody want the office or today?
