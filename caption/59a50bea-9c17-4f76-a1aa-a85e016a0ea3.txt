1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,210
Yeah. Yeah. You're already over here.

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:14,090
Look at the screen. Yeah. I forgot to mention.

3
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,130
That's what happened before. It doesn't like us. Yeah.

4
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:31,100
Now, wait a minute.

5
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:40,520
I don't think I'm any better at this than you. Actually, I think you're better at it, so just leave it.

6
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:47,860
At last time, it was crazy. I mean, how we feel.

7
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:57,140
We feel that for the extended weekend when it was. You have, what with?

8
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:12,110
I think you raised it and would like you know, we feel that that might be valuable.

9
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,040
Yeah, I don't know.

10
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:29,560
It's fine. Yeah.

11
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,970
Yeah, yeah.

12
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:46,590
You probably don't care. Yeah.

13
00:01:48,390 --> 00:02:05,120
I mean, I back. Even myself here at I company.

14
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:29,160
You know, I was happy to be able to tell you how, but I don't know how to get the right joke.

15
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,290
Yeah. Did you use app? Yeah.

16
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,420
All right, everybody ready? Oh, my God.

17
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:46,349
Good afternoon, everybody. So we last left off talking about beryllium.

18
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,670
So just a few more metals to talk about in a few slides on each of them.

19
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:58,679
Zinc is my think of is relatively innocuous in the sense that it it's an essential nutrient.

20
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:07,290
It's used in a lot of enzymes, protein synthesis in the body, but too much of it can be toxic.

21
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:17,460
And, um, but I'm not talking about getting too much nutritional supplementation when you're hospitalized,

22
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:27,420
where for the most part talking about zinc that you get exposed to by inhalation, which is the typical way to get exposed in the occupational setting.

23
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,020
Zinc is very commonly used as an alloy.

24
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,829
You know, an alloy is a metal, it has a bunch of different elements in it.

25
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:44,700
And it's it's a it's the the term we use is galvanized when there's zinc in there to prevent metal from, from corroding.

26
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,390
So, um, I've mentioned metal fume fever.

27
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:56,610
It's, it's a fairly common entity, um, for people who work with metal, typically welders,

28
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,410
people who cut metal and process metal, that's, that involves heating it up.

29
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:09,000
And when metal is heated up, it will form a fume, which is sort of this condensate of,

30
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:17,400
of metal that's vaporized and it condenses into these particulates that can be inhaled.

31
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:25,770
And so it's just like the flu, as I said on Monday, it doesn't you don't get the symptoms right away, sometimes several hours afterward.

32
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,600
And it feels like you're coming down with the flu.

33
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,530
You get aches and pains, you start coughing, maybe some shortness of breath, and it just goes away all by itself.

34
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,179
It doesn't require antibiotics.

35
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:46,170
So, um, and again, zinc is probably the most common cause of this little bit about chromium from the Greek means color.

36
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:53,280
It's commonly used and has been for many years as a pigment in dyes and so forth,

37
00:04:53,610 --> 00:05:01,889
and it's also commonly used as an alloy in metals, including and so forth.

38
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:06,750
And I showed you a picture playground equipment with that pressure treated wood.

39
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:16,590
So again, we're talking about a preservative that involves chrome, copper and arsenic.

40
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:24,410
Arsenic. So chromium comes in lots of different forms and salts,

41
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:33,200
but also its valence state and the third and especially the six valence states are the ones of most importance.

42
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:40,250
So Chrome six is the is the one that is most toxic.

43
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,860
If you've seen or read about the Pacific Gas and Electric in California,

44
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:55,670
where there was environmental contamination with Chrome six, Erin Brockovich, the movie made about that story is pretty well known.

45
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:02,930
So the story has gotten out in the, in the, in public arena.

46
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,870
Uh, and uh, and it all centers around Chrome six.

47
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,380
So Chrome is an irritant.

48
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,810
It can actually cause ulcerations. So like the septum, the,

49
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:23,570
the separation between the sides of the nose and nostrils that can actually cause holes

50
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:31,450
through the through the septum burns and ulcers in mucous membranes and in the nasal passages.

51
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:39,320
And sufficient exposure to inhalation can cause this pneumonitis again, itis meaning inflammation.

52
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:47,840
Anything that says high risk means inflammation in this case of the lungs can cause the teeth to decay.

53
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,970
And yellow. Uh, similar to what we'll talk about with nickel.

54
00:06:53,930 --> 00:07:02,600
Um. Chromium can sensitize the skin and therefore cause allergic contact dermatitis.

55
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,930
It's associated with cancer of the lungs and can also cause kidney damage.

56
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:17,020
And as we've talked about repeatedly, you start damaging the kidneys, their ability to filter and reabsorb the protein is impaired.

57
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,290
And so you start leaking protein in the urine that turn proteinuria.

58
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:29,740
So manganese, another element that is an essential trace element for humans,

59
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:38,890
also used as an alloy commonly and other applications that you can see listed there.

60
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:47,500
So manganese can be an irritant and can also be a cause of metal fume fever.

61
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:54,580
With sufficient exposure, inhalational exposure, it can cause bronchitis or asthma.

62
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:03,520
So effects on the lungs. But the really the take home message about manganese is that with high sufficient exposure,

63
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:07,509
it can cause a picture, just like Parkinson's is Parkinson's disease.

64
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:15,310
And you've probably heard of Parkinson's. It's it's a central nervous system disease where there's muscular rigidity.

65
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,620
People are kind of stooped over what they call masked faces,

66
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:29,589
meaning that the ability to control the muscles of the face, to actually show expression, for example, is impaired.

67
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:38,050
So people have an inability to, to, uh, to have facial expressions.

68
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:47,830
And so, so if this is a disease, then that will mechanism that will look just like Parkinson's disease.

69
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,420
And you can determine it partly by exposure.

70
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:57,970
We talk about beryllium causing this berlioz's this disease that looks like sarcoidosis.

71
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:03,549
So, uh, so there's the history of exposure partly.

72
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:14,260
And for manganese it would be biological monitoring that you can see they're testing the blood, the urine or hair, and then Parkinson's disease.

73
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,430
Parkinson's disease is often associated with cognitive deficits.

74
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:25,090
And so neuropsychological testing would be the diagnostic tool to to detect that.

75
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:37,150
So nickel again, an essential element again use as an alloy in multiple applications, batteries and so forth.

76
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:48,550
So the exposure typically would be by inhalation, working with alloys or smelting or something that causes airborne exposure or by skin contact.

77
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,230
So nickel salts are very common sensitized hairs.

78
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:03,430
Uh, this belt buckle almost certainly is plated with nickel, and if it touches your skin back of the watch,

79
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:14,820
you get a rash underneath your watch or wear your belt buckle is it's very likely caused by the nickel plating so a very common skin sensitize.

80
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:22,120
Ah, I love the fact that the American Contact Dermatitis Society voted it the Allergen of the year in 2008.

81
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:29,500
So it is a very common sensitize year with sufficient exposure though it can also cause respiratory symptoms.

82
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:36,010
Nickel carbonyl is a form of nickel that is particularly toxic.

83
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:47,979
It can cause this flu like syndrome, but also it'll cause a significant inflammation in the lungs and it can cause central nervous system injury,

84
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,770
encephalopathy and essentially brain damage.

85
00:10:52,310 --> 00:11:03,560
Nickel is also associated with cancers, cancer of the lungs, cancer of the nasal passages seen in refinery workers with with occupational exposure.

86
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:14,480
And Nicole Carbonell on a more chronic basis can cause pulmonary fibrosis and similarly to chromium.

87
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:26,060
Sufficient airborne exposure can cause both inflammation as well as ulcers in the upper respiratory tract, sinuses and nasal septum.

88
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,520
So just a little bit of a wrap up about heavy metals.

89
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:40,710
We talked extensively about lead, and so you understand that in terms of environmental contamination.

90
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:48,450
Tetra for lead in gasoline was a significant source that we've seen some very dramatic

91
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:54,840
improvements in from controlling that led of course in water distribution systems.

92
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:05,910
That's heavy in the news. And now we've seen a fairly dramatic decrease in lead levels in the US general population

93
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:11,160
because of these environmental controls and also better occupational controls.

94
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:18,299
The difference between exposures environmentally and occupational, the difference between, for example,

95
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:28,380
someone who's in the painting business and rehabbing old houses and children in Flint who are consuming water that's contaminated with lead.

96
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:37,080
We talk it's very important, I think, to understand that lead finds its way into the skeleton and resides there for a very long time.

97
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:47,250
The half life is very long and it's a repository and possibly a source of bone is mobilized due to various medical conditions.

98
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:52,260
That can be a source of of endogenous source of lead exposure.

99
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,520
Talk about children, especially being a vulnerable population.

100
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,820
The fact that their ability to absorb lead through the gut is significantly greater than adults.

101
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:11,760
That testing for lead is important when you suspect it and you should suspect it in certain circumstances,

102
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,450
but that the symptoms are nonspecific or they're subclinical.

103
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:25,920
You do the test and maybe you find some anemia or you find a lead level, but you may not have symptoms at all, or they just may be nonspecific.

104
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:36,990
And then that that one graph that I showed where this continuum of toxic effects in populations where high levels,

105
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:45,420
high level exposures in small numbers of people can alert us to that this this substance is potentially toxic.

106
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:51,840
And then we start seeing subclinical effects in larger numbers of the population.

107
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,950
And in some cases, then we have what might be called the silent epidemic,

108
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:05,550
where we can see some significant effects at lower levels and very large segments of the population.

109
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,149
So there are various environmental sources of arsenic and mercury.

110
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:24,250
We talked about the the tremendous populations poisoned by arsenic from the two wells in near the Asian subcontinent.

111
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:32,890
Nickel, both in our nickel carbonyl is a very toxic substance, but also nickel salts as being a source of of dermatitis,

112
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:42,550
beryllium in association with this sarcoidosis like lung disease and chromium associated with lung cancer in particular.

113
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:48,280
Cadmium. Cadmium and its effect on the kidneys.

114
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:58,990
The lungs are bone disease. We talk about this eating disease in Japan from cadmium, from environmental contamination.

115
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:06,759
We just talk about manganese and it's neurological disease, organism, and then metal fume fever,

116
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:17,830
which can be commonly seen with a whole range of metals that are alloys and with metal working that heats it up and you have inhalation exposure.

117
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:29,630
So that's that. And we'll let Dr. Robbins come up and.

118
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:39,050
Hollow point appears. Okay.

119
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,200
So before I start with cancer, because I just can't help myself,

120
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,400
I want to mention a few more things about specific metals that are mostly war stories.

121
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:55,200
Please do. Okay. So first of all, with respect to arsenic.

122
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:03,089
Dr. Burton was describing what's probably been the worst environmental disaster, what happened in Bangladesh.

123
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:11,940
But I just wanted to drive home the point that there's a number of countries that have major problems with levels of arsenic in their water supply.

124
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,370
One example where they're monitoring all kinds of wells very carefully is Taiwan.

125
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,820
Another is an area in northern Chile where they just bottle they just ship all the water in permanently.

126
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,620
So it's a big issue.

127
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:33,990
And the other thing is that there are reports in the literature of situations where the arsenic was there, but it wasn't a very high levels.

128
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,230
And then because of drawing down the water table,

129
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:45,640
it's actually mobilized natural arsenic out of the rock and actually ended up increasing the concentration as the water table was used.

130
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:53,520
So there's a lot of potential issues there. And just I did mention that there was that link that I showed where you can actually look

131
00:16:53,520 --> 00:17:01,110
at maps of the U.S. of whatever you want in the arsenic concentrations in groundwater.

132
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:09,180
Right. Right. Then just I think it may not have been mentioned cadmium.

133
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,880
Dr. Burton was just refreshing us on a wide variety of adverse effects.

134
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:25,500
Just a sort of factoid is that in terms of what is the recommended standard for it, it's actually based on nonmalignant renal disease.

135
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:34,410
So the kidney seems to be viewed as the most sensitive organ type affects cadmium, beryllium.

136
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:43,020
I also I've been involved with some studies that really and I just wanted to make a point that I think Dr. Burton said this,

137
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:50,110
but just realize because Borreliosis, unlike all the other pneumoconiosis, is actually an allergic disease.

138
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,750
You're sensitized of the beryllium.

139
00:17:52,380 --> 00:18:01,260
You can have very young people who have not had long term exposure become very sick very quickly, especially if they continue to be exposed.

140
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:09,870
And so that I mean, we told you that, you know, if you have enormously high exposure to silica, you can get an acute silicosis.

141
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:15,990
But this is frequently happens to people become sensitized with prevailing disease.

142
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:24,149
So in that sense, it gets a lot of attention because it can cause permanent, irreversible lung damage.

143
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:28,860
And it's rather young people that haven't necessarily had that much exposure and exposures,

144
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,640
even though they're maintained to be very low, are relatively low.

145
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:40,320
If you're one of those unlucky individuals who becomes sensitized, you can react very badly in terms of lung disease to quite low exposures.

146
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:47,260
So I just want to make a point of that. Mercury.

147
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:55,270
So the first day I arrived in South Africa, in the early 1990, the first day I was there,

148
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:02,350
the person who met me at the airport who was a physician and had been working with a lot of the trade unions there.

149
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,000
His name was Mark Colvin. He unfortunately passed away a few years ago.

150
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,690
Said, I want to take you to the hospital and show you a couple of patients.

151
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:17,379
And he took me to see a couple of patients who had been working at a place outside of Durban.

152
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,120
This was in Durban, South Africa,

153
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:28,150
where they were they were taking essentially toxic waste was being shipped by one US company and one UK company, chemical companies.

154
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:34,240
And they were recovering the mercury because mercury is expensive and worth a lot from the toxic waste.

155
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,690
And apparently these workers were given no kind of protection, no kind of training.

156
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,950
Nobody said that, you know, this is a potent neurotoxin, etc.

157
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:48,730
So the reason that. Mark Colvin Well, take me there was that there were two different patients who had worked there

158
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:53,500
for relatively short periods of time and were in permanent vegetative states.

159
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:59,800
They were in a coma, they were alive, but they'd been that way for months, and no one believes they're going to ever wake up again.

160
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:07,720
So I don't know. I like horror stories because I think it makes it sticks in your mind, makes you remember what goes on in some of these agents.

161
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,880
And then say a similar story with chromium.

162
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:19,530
There are different completely different places. The fact that it was using chromium S.R.O. for.

163
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:25,220
So that's the plastic surveillance state, the more toxic one for a number of activities they were doing.

164
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,459
And so we had a clinic and I've never seen this in the US,

165
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:38,030
but in South Africa I did see people with these well-defined small ulcers in their skin crawl halls and also people who had nasal septal perforation.

166
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:45,080
And unlike what usually causes here in the US, I'm pretty sure these people were not snorting cocaine.

167
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,170
They just got this exposure at work. All right.

168
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,669
Oh, and the last thing. Everyone already knows us.

169
00:20:53,670 --> 00:21:03,570
But how many people in this audience never wear cheap jewelry anymore because they develop a rash when they do so?

170
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:10,680
Right. So that looks like it's close to half of. You talk about a common allergic reaction.

171
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:18,630
There's one. All right.

172
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,750
So let's turn to occupational and environmental cancer.

173
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,560
Actually, I want to do so. Sure.

174
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:33,190
Absolutely. Well, we're talking about immigration during this.

175
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,620
It was. Short term occupational for very long.

176
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:53,400
Right. What I was just wondering is. So during, you know, yeah, it is sometimes used to treat children when they have acute toxicity.

177
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:59,909
Remember the example I gave about long term versus short term exposure was quite specific to that because of the

178
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:07,830
issue with having such a long half life in the body and re mobilizing from bone and getting into the blood.

179
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:14,280
So that was why for lead specifically, I was saying that if you've had somebody who's had 25 years of workplace exposure and

180
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:20,130
comes in with a white level of 60 or 70 or 80 micrograms per deciliter of blood level,

181
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:26,819
that you're probably not going to get anywhere with that, that you'll it's essentially like you'll remove,

182
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:31,080
you know, 0.1% of the load when you do that in the person's body, when you do it.

183
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,200
And the blood is just going to break with their goal,

184
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:42,719
which is where most of it is very different than the example I gave you with the guy who hadn't had any lead exposure before and had these

185
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:52,110
astronomical exposures because he was sandblasting off high light content paint without enough protection with 120 micrograms per deciliter.

186
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,980
That case, because he'd only worked for two or three months, he probably,

187
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:03,120
even though he has a very high blood level because of acute exposure, probably has a relatively low total body mass.

188
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:11,040
So there it would make sense to try to kill this. I guess they were bringing up the bringing in bringing it up because they wanted to.

189
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:15,760
You use that? Oh, speaking of.

190
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:22,190
Yeah. So I actually I missed the presentation and I actually don't know.

191
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:27,770
Did she talk about what the actual blood lead levels were in the in the most exposed children?

192
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,130
Was anyone there? And. Around ten.

193
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:40,960
Yeah. So for ten micrograms per deciliter, nobody would use Croatian because it's, it's just not considered high enough that, you know,

194
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:48,030
probably the, the rest of the collation doesn't really balance out with how much you're going to improve the situation.

195
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,130
You know,

196
00:23:49,140 --> 00:24:00,720
if you had a child come in with a lot of this is more likely like probably from being exposed to breaking down old lead paint inside of a home.

197
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:07,740
I mean, I've seen this, too, but, you know, comes in with like like 50 or 60 micrograms per deciliter.

198
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:15,230
That's the kind of situation that you might seriously consider. Yeah, I saw a study just this past week.

199
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:27,300
That the cognitive benefits in terms of the cognitive cognitive deficits, behavioral deficits for of bloodletting of kids.

200
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:33,540
That's less than I think it was 40 or 40 times that it's not worth it.

201
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:38,040
But you don't see the the positive impact of.

202
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:42,980
With that. Okay.

203
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:51,980
So occupational environmental cancer. So we're going to start with a rough working definition of cancer that will sort of refine it as we go along.

204
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:58,339
So it's a genetic disease because it almost always changes, mutates, DNA.

205
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:08,240
That's almost always part of the process. And so you have cells that are in sensitive, the usual controlled by the local cellular environment.

206
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:14,330
The other thing I'm sure everyone knows many of these things I'm going to say, but remember we're talking about cancer.

207
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,660
But cancer is really many, many different diseases.

208
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,910
They actually, though they share some common traits, they have quite different biology from each other.

209
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:28,160
And so very, very specific treatments for many cancers are quite variable depending on what kind of cancer it is.

210
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:34,070
They're not really all the same disease, but they they share a lot of factors we'll talk about together.

211
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:46,350
And so you've got these abnormal cells and groups of cells where growth is that are able to grow in an uncontrolled fashion, not the usual fashion.

212
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:53,280
And so you just some sort of medical these terms we sometimes use.

213
00:25:53,580 --> 00:26:00,209
So you may see hypoplasia in the tissue, which is an increased cell number, hypertrophy,

214
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:04,800
which means individual cells may be increased size and hyper proliferation,

215
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:10,020
which means that they're growing much faster, reproducing much faster than normal.

216
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:14,190
So as it says, there you see more cells that are bigger and grow faster.

217
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:18,990
And also the growth is not ordered, it's disordered.

218
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:22,650
And these are sort of different levels of disorder.

219
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:31,470
So matter pleasure would be the lowest level where basically you have some of the wrong cell type mixed in where it's not supposed to be,

220
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,700
even though the cells don't actually look at abnormal dysplasia,

221
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:42,120
where you have more immature cells that aren't well differentiated like they should be.

222
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:51,060
And next would be an area where you start seeing structural and functional cellular differentiation.

223
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,950
And another part of this disorder growth, you know, we'll we'll talk about this a lot,

224
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:06,749
but there's a lot of different mechanisms for when I mean, just tell you logically when cells are behaving the way they're supposed to.

225
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,739
There's a lot of mechanisms in your body to try to do something about this.

226
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,710
And one of the most common things to do is to cause that cell to die.

227
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,000
So apoptosis is programed cell death.

228
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:27,810
Right. So. So typically in order for a tumor to take off and grow, you usually see some loss or great reduction in programed cell death.

229
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:35,600
All right. So here is this adds a couple extra things. And so this is some of the characteristics of cancer.

230
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,970
So we mentioned things are growing faster.

231
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:46,250
So it's like they doesn't need signals from outside the cells to grow.

232
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:52,280
They're going to keep growing on their own. And they actually are insensitive to anti-growth signals.

233
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:59,690
They're supposed to turn them off. They evade apoptosis so they're not dying when they're supposed to.

234
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:05,750
And they end up with eventually sort of essentially limitless.

235
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:10,110
Ability to to reproduce, to replicate.

236
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:22,540
Now, for cancer to actually have an impact at the level of the full organism, the person in this case, you have to have it.

237
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:29,910
If the cancer is outgrowing its blood supply, it won't get very big and it may not become a problem.

238
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:35,430
So one of the things that also happens is there's these changes where there's sustained angiogenesis.

239
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:39,570
That means creation of new blood vessels that are feeding the cancer.

240
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:48,960
And then the other critical part of the of the reason that you see so much people dying, etc.,

241
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:57,600
is because you get localized tissue invasion and often metastatic disease at some point so that you

242
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:03,480
have the ability for the cancer cells to travel to new areas of the body and create a new tumor.

243
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:14,380
QUESTION Oh, okay. So let's talk for a minute about cancer types, even though I said it's lots of different diseases.

244
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:21,130
So as you see, there are about 4/5 of all cancers are a type of carcinoma.

245
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:26,410
So that means they're derived from epithelial epithelial tissues that line or cover

246
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:34,840
various organs and body structures than other types of cancer cell carcinoma,

247
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,080
you know, like some of the more common, you know, most.

248
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:46,690
Almost all lung cancers are carcinoma, colon cancers or carcinoma breast cancers or carcinoma, almost all of them.

249
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:51,090
So this is by far the most frequent type sarcomas.

250
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:57,130
That's where the original cells are derived from connective tissues, including what you can see there.

251
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,640
Things like cartilage, fat, muscle, tendon and bone.

252
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:08,380
Something that's referred to as a lymphoma. If it's derived from cells from the lymphatic system referred to as the chemo.

253
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:14,320
If it's cancer affecting the blood cells that are being created in the bone marrow.

254
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:19,450
And myeloma is cancer of a particular set of type of.

255
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:29,980
Cells, plasma cells also in bone marrow. So let's talk about some of the theories of carcinogenesis, how cancer happens.

256
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:38,940
Yes, I was probably underestimated. There's probably all kinds of different models that people have, and we're learning more about this all the time.

257
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,540
So this model of models of carcinogenesis that have been proposed.

258
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:47,070
And I would say there's probably not any single model that explains all cancers.

259
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:52,710
It probably varies quite a bit, but there's a lot of concepts to be aware of that are applicable here.

260
00:30:53,430 --> 00:31:00,520
So. In some ways when I'm about to describe here is where it says that the bottom is sort of we've gone beyond this.

261
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:06,790
But historically, there's the sense that there's different stages that need to take place,

262
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:12,190
that in order for to end up with an actual cancerous growth,

263
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:19,000
you have to have an initiation, which usually involves actually some mutation of DNA, some change in DNA.

264
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:27,610
And then you have to have a set of factors that will promote the growth of the cells that have this change.

265
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:35,710
And then you have to have a progression where it becomes, you know, invasive of local tissue and may be metastatic.

266
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:44,649
So so the idea here is that there's some agents which might not actually be able to mutate.

267
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:51,820
DNA may not be involved with initiation, but they still can be considered important factors in the causation of cancer

268
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:56,800
because they may affect other steps in the path like promotion or progression.

269
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:04,270
And so there's also this idea that the promoting agent by itself isn't going to cause cancer alone.

270
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,590
I'll come back to that.

271
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:15,280
But as it says at the bottom, probably the take home message of this slide is that usually for most the agents we're interested in,

272
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,030
it's very hard to use this classification unambiguously, you know,

273
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:23,439
that everything doesn't fit nicely into it, but that is sort of a traditional way of looking at it.

274
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,640
So here's a diagram that says, okay, you start with a normal cell, you have DNA damage.

275
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:34,150
It's obvious it's not just any DNA damage, but DNA damage in the wrong place.

276
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:41,920
And that leads to initiation. It may be repaired, in which case we go back to being a normal cell and nothing more would happen.

277
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:49,690
But if it isn't, then you get into proliferation and promotion.

278
00:32:50,290 --> 00:33:01,419
So one thing is if apoptosis is being turned off, then this cell that's now has some DNA chains that allows it to reproduce more quickly.

279
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:12,280
Those cells are not going to undergo a programed cell death and then eventually you'll get a pre neoplastic, pre full blown cancer.

280
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:19,660
And if things progress enough, more changes, you end up with irreversible changes.

281
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,140
You know, there's usually multiple mutations at this point.

282
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:32,860
And so you can end up with a like what we call a cancer, a malignant group of tissues that often can metastasize to other parts of the body as well.

283
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:37,209
So this is sort of covering the same thing. It's just set up differently.

284
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:41,320
I think I might have three of these in a row because different people like different types of diagrams.

285
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,010
The cells had great pictures, but this might have a little more information on it.

286
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:51,100
So this is saying, all right, you start with DNA damaging agents.

287
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:58,510
So the environmental agents are going to be interested in this talk is is going to be mostly about chemicals as we go along.

288
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,200
We're going to talk about radiation on Monday.

289
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,770
And I'm not sure I might mention viruses once or twice.

290
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:09,310
So it's the same thing. You have DNA damage that's not repaired.

291
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:18,129
And this is also pointing out that there's some some individuals have genetic defects that put them at

292
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:24,730
high risk for developing cancer because they have other genes that are responsible for DNA repair,

293
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,600
aren't functioning as they should. So you end up with more mutations in the genome of these somatic cells.

294
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:38,979
And the things you have here are you've got activation, the mutations.

295
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,730
You get the. Lead to a cancerous growth.

296
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:48,200
Of that you have activation of growth promoting oncogene so called meaning genes that promote cancer.

297
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:53,270
You have alterations of genes that regulate apoptosis.

298
00:34:53,270 --> 00:35:01,250
So so you no longer have the right programed cell death. And you usually also have inactivation of cancer suppressor genes.

299
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:04,280
So there's genes that are specifically supposed to suppress these changes.

300
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,150
So they've been inactivated. When you have all this going on together,

301
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:16,040
then you get all kinds of altered gene products and loss of regulatory gene products that are supposed to regulate cell reproduction.

302
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,620
The you get clonal expansion and you go from a few cells to many thousands,

303
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:28,429
eventually millions of cells, and there's additional mutations which may cause more progression.

304
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:38,310
So. So one thing I'll come back to this, but you end up with a usually heterogeneous mix of cells in a tumor.

305
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:46,429
They actually aren't all identical in terms of the DNA lesions of various kinds,

306
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:54,130
and they actually probably often can act together to increase the level of malignancy, maybe make them more metastatic.

307
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,260
So anyway, at that point, you have a lot of latent neoplasm.

308
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:03,830
Stop me. If there's any questions or if anyone wants to dispute anything you're welcome to.

309
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,770
I'm sure some of you in this audience probably know a lot about this already.

310
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:19,880
So this what this is emphasizing is that tumorigenesis cancer developing that is usually a multistep process.

311
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,210
And there's a couple of things here. It's got a different symbol for different types of processes that are involved.

312
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:33,950
And the other thing you'll notice, which I sort of like, is this diagram does on purpose, is that not everything has to be in lockstep.

313
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:39,950
It's not for every type of cancer. It has to occur before B, B, B for C and C, before D.

314
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:48,709
Sometimes things can happen in different orders. And the other thing I like about this diagram is that here's an acquired capability.

315
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:53,960
It's self-sufficiency and growth signals. So, you know, basically out of control growth.

316
00:36:54,290 --> 00:37:02,900
And then it gives an example of a mechanism activation that has oncogene insensitivity to anti growth signals.

317
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:12,979
So the example that would be lose retinoblastoma suppressor and type of cancer that affects the eye will come back to P53,

318
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:20,870
which is often what's involved with the loss of anti growth signals, the evading of apoptosis.

319
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:25,610
So an example of this is produce IGF survival factors.

320
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:35,090
There's limitless capacity to regulate and to replicate involves certain aspects of the DNA,

321
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:40,280
the sustained angiogenesis that's being able to make blood vessels to keep growing.

322
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:47,960
So there's certain factors that do that. And then finally being invasive of other tissue and being able to metastasize.

323
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:55,310
Various factors do that. So you can see it's potentially a very long and complicated process involves many different factors.

324
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:03,529
All right. So. This sort of says again what was on a couple of those diagrams,

325
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:08,900
that there's many different ankle genes involved in, many different tumor suppressor genes involved.

326
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:15,830
And when you couple all of these together, then you end up with a situation where you have a tumor that can grow.

327
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:27,530
So. So here's a specific example of the molecular basis in the smallest processes and sort of not always exactly what happens,

328
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:35,750
but is very typical for adenocarcinoma of the colon, which is, of course one of the biggest killers of people in our society in terms of cancers.

329
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:48,080
So this is why you start at the normal epithelium lining the colon and you may have something like loss or mutation of APC, locus of stool.

330
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:51,889
And of course, these are all all of these genes are at specific chromosomal sites.

331
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:59,629
So this is listing the sites. APC is. Adult poly process.

332
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:08,360
It's basically there's a genetic version of this that puts you at very high risk for developing colon cancer, where you have an abnormal one.

333
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:15,800
But of course, you can have a genetic change that makes it abnormal. So that gives you a hyper proliferative epithelium.

334
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,450
And then notice this is loss of DNA methylation. So that's actually an epigenetic effect.

335
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,959
So it doesn't necessarily always have to be specifically mutating.

336
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:37,480
The DNA may lead to early adenoma and then you mutate that RAAS gene which advances it and then you lose tumor suppression chromosome.

337
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:44,690
So you get a late adenoma and finally you lose p53 gene and then you have a frank carcinoma that's

338
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:51,230
not going to be able to get to invade other tissues and eventually probably metastasize as well.

339
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:54,110
So it's sort of the same point over and over,

340
00:39:54,110 --> 00:40:00,950
but I'm sort of given different examples of the some of the genes involved and the steps just to give you more sense of that.

341
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,450
So a little more about wrasse, which is the names from rat sarcoma.

342
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:12,620
So it's this family of genes that produce proteins that act as cellular, single transmitter, signal transmitters.

343
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:20,629
And it's gets a lot of attention because it's if you look at human cancer widely and you say,

344
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:28,730
what's the most frequent gene or gene family that's abnormal in cancers, I guess rest Wensley the popularity contest.

345
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:39,680
So there's a variety of growth factors that get signaled that grass is very important for and it's located some under the cell membrane.

346
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:51,049
And then p53 is a tumor suppressor gene and it's supposed to bind DNA in the cell, which induces the P21 gene to express its protein.

347
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:56,270
And that protein is supposed to prevent the cell from passing to the next stage of division.

348
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:05,630
So if you get mutation of p53, then you lose that stop signal and so cells can divide and more uncontrollably.

349
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:22,190
Also, p53 can activate a gene, a death gene called Bax, which promotes apoptosis, and if the mutant one doesn't promote the Bax.

350
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:30,110
And so all these things add up. And this is further there's a number of important cancers where P53 is the most frequently mutated gene,

351
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,930
as you can see there, like colon and breast cancer.

352
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:41,150
And it's also clear that mutations in P53 are sometimes associated with non carcinogenic exposures like tobacco, for example.

353
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:45,380
So here's a diagram to make.

354
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:50,690
It's it's looking at p53 and then changes afterwards which to make the point that,

355
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:56,749
okay, you could have different carcinogens, including ionizing radiation.

356
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:07,790
We'll talk about next time that might cause DNA damage and affect the normal p53 in a normal cell and.

357
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:15,230
When that. It happens if you go down the left side.

358
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:21,620
So you're going to get transgress. Transcriptional upregulation of target genes.

359
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:28,010
And this is basically saying if there's successful repair, you go back to having normal cells.

360
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:33,620
If there are successful repair fails, then you have the potential to develop a tumor.

361
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:46,360
But the fact that a a ptosis gene might still work and stop it, whereas on this side you've got the DNA damage and you don't get any repair art,

362
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:50,660
and then you get mutant cells and expansion, you end up with a malignant tumor.

363
00:42:51,110 --> 00:43:01,430
So it's just sort of trying to show in a diagram that although it's multi stage, it may be absolutely critical what happens with a P53 mutation,

364
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:06,710
whether things get repaired or don't get repaired, and whether you would end up with a tumor eventually.

365
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:15,980
So I think we already mentioned some of this, but so the effects of carcinogens, many of them are genotoxic caused DNA damage directly,

366
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:24,530
but others have epigenetic effects so they can cause damage to RNA or to proteins,

367
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:29,870
or they can change the methylation of DNA, either remove methyl groups that are supposed to be there.

368
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,930
Usually when you remove methyl groups, that tends to activate whatever the gene is there.

369
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:41,480
Or alternatively, it could put methyl groups where they're not supposed to be, but with a tumor suppressor gene.

370
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:48,710
You will be responsible for every single thing on this diagram on the midterm in great detail.

371
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,040
That's a lie. I just it. I just put in this.

372
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:56,930
I'm not going to try to go through it. But just to give you a sense of, as we know more and more about this,

373
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:06,230
like understanding all the different interactions and chemokines and so on and how things interact with each other is it's variable.

374
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:11,840
Well, from individual individual even with the same cancer, but very variable across different kinds of cancer.

375
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:16,830
But it's it's a very complex set of mechanisms overall.

376
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:19,970
That's really the take home message of this as we learn more about it.

377
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:31,670
And I guess the good news is that means that you may there may be many ways to have a a therapeutic solution,

378
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:37,760
like a new treatment that targets different aspects of this that may be vital for sustaining a cancer.

379
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,080
And that's sort of. We're on.

380
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:52,790
I'd say we're on the threshold. I suspect it's going to become very real in the next ten or 15 years anyway, where rather than just saying, okay,

381
00:44:53,120 --> 00:45:03,290
you have colon cancer and here's the set of drugs, we usually try first that seem to be effective that that instead there's going to be very detailed.

382
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:07,850
And I mean, this is beginning to happen to some things already detailed looking at exactly

383
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:13,430
what mutations do you have and do we understand what mechanism is going on?

384
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:19,880
And we have, you know, say there's some protein being generated that you don't want there because it's promoting this.

385
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:26,059
You know, we either have a way to do something about which is a little tricky or something about the mutation

386
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:31,400
or we have we can target F specific protein in you because that's what you have a problem with.

387
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,389
And we've got some kind of antibody that's going to bind with that protein.

388
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:37,670
And so so that sort of thing,

389
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:45,950
that's sort of like personalized medicine where you're you look at in great detail exactly what's going on with this cancer.

390
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,280
It I think it will become much more.

391
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:54,260
Hopefully, that'll mean we'll have more and more effective treatments as time goes on.

392
00:45:54,410 --> 00:46:02,730
And we're already seeing some of this, obviously. So a little more on theories of carcinogenesis.

393
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:16,080
So here's a model that's sort of focusing on chemical exposures, which as well as radiation and viruses that might lead to carcinogenesis.

394
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:21,270
And so an example of this model is you get mutational activation of oncogene.

395
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:26,180
So I talked about that as well as in their activation of tumor suppressor genes like p53.

396
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:36,060
We talked about that as well and that there has to be mutations of multiple genes greater than four or five to actually develop a malignancy.

397
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:41,160
If you don't develop all those changes, you may have not much of anything.

398
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:45,629
You may have a tumor that's nonmalignant meaning it's not going to invade the tumor.

399
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:51,780
It's an abnormal growth, but it's not going to invade other types of tissue and it's not going to metastasize.

400
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:56,910
And therefore, it's very, very unlikely actually kill you because it doesn't do that.

401
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:04,170
So it's just total accumulation. Mutational and related changes are responsible for determining its properties.

402
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:10,350
The other thing I want to mention is usually like most of the theories, at least up to recently,

403
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:14,699
of how people have thought about this has been and this is well,

404
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:20,820
definitely true for many cancers are probably the majority is a monoclonal origin of cancer.

405
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:29,040
I mean, if there's a single original cell that some set of daughters of that cell had all the different changes to them sequentially.

406
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:36,060
So that that so that you end up at the end with a cell that has all the properties that become a cancer.

407
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:43,100
Okay. So that if you look back at it, you can see that originally it was all the same.

408
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:49,390
Now this is heterogeneous because you. You may get changes.

409
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:54,549
All the daughters may not have the same changes and on and they may interact with each other.

410
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:59,560
And that's why it may be it developed the ability to be invasive or to metastasize.

411
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:11,070
But the point here is that. Probably it's not as common, but there's certainly good data supporting the idea that you don't always have a monoclonal.

412
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:15,660
Sometimes it's polyclonal or you've got a set of normal cells and that sort

413
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:19,650
of transformation of events all happening at the same time on several cells

414
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:28,650
so that all the all the cells that end up being part of the bulk of the cancer didn't have or didn't originally arise from a single parent cell,

415
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:32,520
you know, going back. So that's of some importance or interest.

416
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:41,910
Okay. So sort of summarize this discussion of Carcinogenesis and have a question on causation.

417
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:48,240
So it appears that in many cancers it takes it off a very complex sequence of

418
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,110
events to cause transformation from normal cells to actual malignant tissue,

419
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:57,050
a true cancer. And this I put this back up here just as a reminder.

420
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:05,520
We already looked at this. And you know what? So, okay, p53 got turned off, but there's nothing to have to turn it back on.

421
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:11,550
Or does it still, you know, this, that you have to do this whole series of steps before you end up with this malignant tumor.

422
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:20,190
So here's a question which I guess goes back to the presentation we did early on about causality.

423
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:26,220
So if above generically tends to be true that there has to be these model steps,

424
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:34,410
under what circumstances can we stated a particular environmental or occupational exposure was a cause of cancer in a particular individual.

425
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:41,160
I know at least two groups of students that are going to be very interested in this question, but I actually was trying to get some feedback.

426
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:46,470
Anyone, anyone's brave enough to give a person even a partial answer what they think about that.

427
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:51,700
How would you decide? In fact, if.

428
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,520
Suppose I said to you, okay, well,

429
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:05,909
maybe the I've been selling tobacco products or maybe the cigarets that this person smoked led to a

430
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:12,450
mutation or two that had something to do with this person eventually developed developing a cancer.

431
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:21,089
But it's quite clear that it's also because they were exposed to something else in the workplace, maybe asbestos.

432
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:30,990
And it's clear that they start out with a defective gene that so they're likely to not have normal apoptosis.

433
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,620
And you can't really pin this all on the tobacco.

434
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:43,110
It's multiple causation and we're not paying for it even though this person got sick and smoked some of my cigarets.

435
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:49,550
So what do you think about that argument? Yeah.

436
00:50:53,630 --> 00:51:01,540
And such a temptation would. Okay.

437
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:05,910
So logically think. So.

438
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:11,640
All right. I'm saying this out loud. Well, I don't know. Maybe it doesn't work anyway, but so the tone of what you said.

439
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:16,440
So you're saying that has some validity? Actually, I can't repeat it.

440
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:20,430
Say it again very loudly.

441
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,700
So I think they pay where multiple factors can.

442
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:32,970
Where the worst reason, I guess. Because if you take one aspect away.

443
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:38,140
Then it wouldn't have cost anything. But I think you're going to partially respond.

444
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:46,720
Okay. So so I think that's a very vague and reasonable answer.

445
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:51,220
Is anybody want to add to that or are even contested in some part?

446
00:51:53,930 --> 00:52:03,070
All right. So. So let me give you a specific example.

447
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:12,210
We know that. Smoking tobacco products, which are increased risk for cancer the lung.

448
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:21,260
And we know that being exposed occupationally say to asbestos for many years puts you at increased risk.

449
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:28,140
And as a matter of fact, we have more specific data than that, you know, roughly if you compare.

450
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:38,340
I mean, it all depends on exactly what the experience is. Say, two pack a day, you know, 40 cigarets a day smoker for 25 years or 30 years.

451
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:46,139
You compare that to somebody who's never smoked, but in the individuals that's been smoking is probably usually found to be about

452
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:50,160
10 to 11 times more likely to develop lung cancer than the average smoker.

453
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:59,260
And then if you take separately somebody who's a non smoker but had intensive exposure to asbestos in the workplace,

454
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:02,860
say they were back in the 1960s seventies.

455
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:08,020
They were insulation workers that are actually working all the time with asbestos because it hadn't been banned yet

456
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:14,850
and it was the main type of insulation was used with no respiratory protection or controls in that kind of situation.

457
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:18,100
Typically what was seen and they did this for many, many years.

458
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:25,410
Typically what has been seen is about a five fold increase in your risk of lung cancer as compared to another person that,

459
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:28,660
like you, never smoke but never had this occupational exposure.

460
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:35,650
Okay, so. Somebody shows up and they both have smoked a cigaret.

461
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:43,600
Well, let me not get to that yet. So the the it seems to be more or less multiplicative in the sense that if you look at

462
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:50,170
people that both had that intense of asbestos exposure at work and were heavy smokers,

463
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:58,720
they're actually close to 50 times as likely to develop lung cancer as somebody who never was exposed to either.

464
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,320
Okay. With me. So it's it's close to multiplicative.

465
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:09,010
I mean, there's studies that typically have found that. So now somebody shows up and says and.

466
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:20,990
You know, you have all this history of asbestos exposure and they were a substantial cigaret smoker and they had lung cancer and say you're I mean,

467
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:27,679
an attorney is trying to argue that this person should be fully compensated because

468
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,459
they wouldn't have developed this disease except for their asbestos exposure at work.

469
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:36,470
And some attorney for the company that would have to pay the saying yeah but they're

470
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:40,490
a cigaret smoker and cigarets seem to have an even bigger risk to asbestos.

471
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:43,970
We shouldn't have to pay. So I'll tell you a real concrete situation.

472
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,270
What would you say about that? Which argument would you like to take?

473
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:56,960
Yes. Look at. So if they had.

474
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:04,300
But. Right, right. You're you're 100% correct that that's easy.

475
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:08,080
When we say lung cancer, we don't mean is that the alien is a female.

476
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:16,240
That is not usually called lung cancer. It's a cancer of the the plural, the membranes lining the lungs and the body cavity.

477
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:24,220
So we don't count that. And cigaret smoking has, as I think Dr. Burton told you, has nothing to, is not a risk factor for mesothelioma.

478
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:28,720
So there you wouldn't have a problem. Open and shut. Took out. Mesothelioma has to pay.

479
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:35,740
I'm giving you the harder situation. Yes.

480
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:43,190
Can you not say for sure whether or not you can't take away the exposure and say,

481
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:47,870
if I wasn't exposed to asbestos and only smoke and I still got cancer?

482
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:56,030
It looks like the smoking because it already happened. You can't say for sure that it was either one or combination of both of them or not.

483
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:00,340
So then wouldn't the company have a case for not paying?

484
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,470
Okay. So you're right, right? You can't do the counterfactual.

485
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:09,010
You can't see what would have happened if you had had an exposure.

486
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,550
But I told you, it's multiplicative. Right.

487
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:19,810
So I guess I'm waiting for someone to make A to B, stick their neck out and make a stronger argument.

488
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:25,040
You want me to do it? Is everybody else have an idea of what I'm trying to get at?

489
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:34,810
Yes, they are responsible. Okay. Because they just made the risk of the employee, even though the employee made the.

490
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,970
The decision is at least partially responsible.

491
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:43,710
For. I work at.

492
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,030
Okay. So that I did want someone to say what you just said, that they clearly should be at least partly at risk.

493
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:56,620
But I wanted you to actually make a sort of mathematical causation argument.

494
00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:00,130
Anybody have a mathematical argument? Like, how much?

495
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:04,760
How much are they responsible? Okay.

496
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:10,559
So here, tell me what you think of this. I told you that if person only had this best exposure,

497
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:15,300
there are five times as likely as somebody who never smoked, never had asbestos to have lung cancer.

498
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:21,930
If they only had the tobacco exposure, they are, say, ten times as likely when they had both, which is the real situation.

499
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:28,620
They're 50 times as likely. So you are an epidemiologist.

500
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:37,230
Tire. That is one person. All of this is that I'm telling you the results of the epidemiology study that we already did.

501
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:43,260
But you're right that that's what I'll look at. So here's let me finish the last argument.

502
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:52,740
It's pretty simple. It's like, well. We're trading the fact that he was cigaret smoker as a fixed point.

503
00:57:52,770 --> 00:58:03,120
The question is how likely is it? Is it more probable than not that if he had not been around all of this asbestos?

504
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:07,080
But let me put it in posit. That's going to be confusing. Is it?

505
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:16,080
And is it more probable than not that only because of this mess, this exposure on top of the cigaret smoking.

506
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:20,790
Only because of the asbestos exposure. He now has lung cancer.

507
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:26,640
And it's much more probable that if he never had that asbestos exposure, he wouldn't have lung cancer now.

508
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:34,710
Therefore, the company is responsible. First of all, do you think that argument makes sense in terms of the arithmetic, the math?

509
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:38,870
And you also say what you think it makes sense. It turns out that as an argument.

510
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:44,300
Any comments? Would you say that again? Sure.

511
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:50,180
So my argument. I already told you what the epidemiologic study said.

512
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:55,430
Right. But we found several. My argument is the following, you know.

513
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:01,130
Well, let me let me elaborate. Which probably just confused things.

514
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:05,719
You know, you didn't have a policy of saying you weren't going to hire people that smoked cigarets you didn't

515
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:09,380
monitor where they smoke cigarets you just hired people off the street and gave you this job.

516
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:15,170
So, you know, here's someone that arrived a cigaret smokers status cigaret smoker.

517
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:24,410
But because he was exposed by your company at work to this asbestos, he now has lung cancer.

518
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:28,400
How do you how do I know it's not from the cigaret smoking alone?

519
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:33,709
Well, we can't really answer that question because it's only one person.

520
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:40,070
But we can look at this epidemiologic data and say if he'd had only.

521
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,260
He's a cigaret smoker and asbestos exposure.

522
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:50,530
He's 50 times as likely to have gotten lung cancer as somebody who never did either.

523
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:56,680
Whereas if he was only a tobacco smoker and hadn't been given this horrible job that you should have known better about,

524
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:03,850
he'd only be ten times as likely. So there's an 80% chance that he wouldn't have lung cancer now.

525
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:09,520
If you had an exposure to asbestos and only a 20% chance that he would have it anyway.

526
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:15,460
I think the jury is ready to meet. How is that for an argument?

527
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:22,829
Does the math make sense? Yeah, I do.

528
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:26,000
The math actually does make sense. What you decide to do with the math.

529
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:31,179
It's always a question because because somebody could come back and say, well, turn the thing on its head.

530
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:35,049
And why don't you know, you're saying you're treating the cigaret smoking as fixed,

531
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:40,270
which I would argue is like what you need to do ethically, ethically in this situation.

532
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:47,590
But we could argue that. But say, you know, the cigaret smoking on average is a bigger contributor than asbestos.

533
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:52,300
You had both. How can you how can you say it's just asbestos?

534
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,600
But actually, that argument doesn't have very good math behind it.

535
01:00:55,690 --> 01:01:02,290
Even though everything you said was true, it's still it's still true that if you took away the asbestos exposure,

536
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:08,140
you'd only have a 20% chance of having that lung cancer at 20%,

537
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:18,430
as much chance as it did with asbestos exposure, because it went from ten times someone unexposed to 50 times because of the asbestos.

538
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:22,680
All right. Well, you can think about that one.

539
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:29,190
But I just want to point out and this is also the issue about, you know, we talk about causation with those diagrams you remember,

540
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:34,820
and say, well, you know, this particular individual, maybe he he was only going to get the lung cancer.

541
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:38,130
He had all these things, both the cigaret smoking and the asbestos.

542
01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:42,630
Right. Another individual that would have gotten it anyway. Without without the.

543
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:47,860
Cigaret smoking with that. Those [INAUDIBLE]. All right.

544
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:53,470
I hope at least make it. You might not be happy, as I said, but at least makes you sort of think about things.

545
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:58,690
I want to tell you this. This what you're going to have to do for your presentations,

546
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:03,459
which is argue that it's more probable or not that this disease or argue that

547
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:08,080
it's less probable that not that this disease was caused by this exposure.

548
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:12,490
It's a it's an interesting argument.

549
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:18,070
The logic can be quite complicated. Have fun.

550
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:31,450
All right. Meanwhile, back at the ranch. So let's talk about how we evaluate chemicals with respect to their capacity to induce mutations.

551
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:41,170
So. The biggest gold standard is what you brought up, which is epidemiology.

552
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:46,030
If you want to know whether something causes cancer in humans, the best data is always.

553
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:49,340
Did it cause cancer in humans as opposed to anything else?

554
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:57,880
Right. So that's epidemiology. Probably next best data is to do animal studies.

555
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:03,460
Almost always rodents, mice and rats are used for these animal studies.

556
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:08,840
And actually, some of you are several of you are in toxicology.

557
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:19,570
So can someone tell me, are we leaving out the fact that you might have some some people unhappy with what they think the ethics are?

558
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:25,120
Why do we usually use rats and mice for most of these?

559
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:30,440
Why don't we use either? Baboons.

560
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:36,100
Or alternatively. Praying mantises.

561
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:41,440
Baboons are more like us. We'd be more sure about it. Praying mantises.

562
01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:44,980
You can get them to, like, reproduce really, really fast and have millions of them.

563
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:50,410
And it doesn't cost much money. And you have a lot more data. Why are we doing mice and rats?

564
01:03:55,330 --> 01:04:03,580
Cost benefit. Okay, well, that's always the right answer to everything, but you have to explain why that's the best way for money.

565
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:07,210
They're close enough to us that I was very curious, but they also.

566
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:14,090
Well, right and right. So they're close to a certain evolutionary tree.

567
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:19,370
I'm sorry I didn't interrupt you. Go ahead. Okay. And they reproduce relatively quickly a couple of years.

568
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:22,520
They also if they're gonna develop cancers, they also develop the cancers quickly.

569
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:26,480
They have accelerated growth. They don't just reproduce fast. They die early, too.

570
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:31,120
Right. So watch what you want. It has to be economical.

571
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:31,840
I agree with that.

572
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:40,709
What you want is something where usually if you see cancers in this model, this animal model, it's likely to have implications for humans.

573
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:48,290
So it's very hard to be sure. And you can find out the answers quickly and cheaply.

574
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:52,640
Right. I mean, for example, you wouldn't do this with course.

575
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:58,990
I don't know if there's any good examples. Probably not. If elephants only live two years, you wouldn't do this with elephants, right?

576
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,569
Because you have to have real big facilities, feed them a lot of food.

577
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:06,770
It's also good that they're small, right? Relatively small because it makes it cheaper to do it.

578
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,910
All right. So that's that.

579
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:14,720
And then there's also genetic toxicity assessment.

580
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:21,779
It can be in vivo or in vitro. So you can screen agents to see whether have mutations.

581
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:28,850
And like the one well known test, it's called the Ames test. We actually look for mutagenic potential, the chemicals using salmonella bacteria.

582
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:35,269
That's what they're going to mutate. There's a way to do this. That's, you know, you can do it very quickly and that's good.

583
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:39,080
But of course, bacteria are single celled organisms.

584
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:47,860
You've proven that it can damage DNA, but they're a long way from what our biology is at the same time.

585
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:51,440
Right. Which is why you're more interesting what the Rodan test says at the end,

586
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:59,510
and then you can even do it, you know, without actually looking at structure activity basis.

587
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:08,420
You know, you can look at comparable compounds and make a educated guess about what's likely to be the carcinogenicity.

588
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:13,190
So there's certain there's a number of nitrosamines that are known human carcinogens.

589
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:20,149
If you see nitrosamines, it's very slightly different structure, but sort of like a sort of has the same reactive groups on it.

590
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:23,809
You can probably say, I don't think we should be exposing any humans to that.

591
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:30,440
I don't even know if you need to do the animal study. I use that we are, you know, very closely related compounds cause cancer in humans.

592
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:35,360
Does that make sense to everyone? That sort of logic. All right.

593
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:42,469
So International Agency for Research in Cancer, which is based in Lyon, France,

594
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:49,070
and say like France, I have had some of my advisory students decide to go spend the summer there.

595
01:06:51,890 --> 01:07:01,129
So they're sort of the lead agency in the world for reviewing all this data, epidemiology,

596
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:13,220
animal and other data and coming to a conclusion about what's known about the carcinogenic potential of a particular agent in people and humans.

597
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:18,320
And this this fight, in one sense, is not that important.

598
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:21,650
In another sense, very important in terms of the mechanics.

599
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:27,680
Basically, this if you read what the slide says, it's basically them saying, we're going to we're going to.

600
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:34,910
It's a lot of work to do. This kind of report on an individual chemical, the chemicals we're going to go after are the ones that one,

601
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:41,090
we have some reason began to think that could be carcinogenic, but of course we're not sure too.

602
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:48,650
There's a lot of people exposed. So it's important to know this for in terms of the public health issue, it's a big public health issue.

603
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:57,530
And three, we know that there's studies that have been done we can look at that should give us some information to help us decide this as opposed to,

604
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:01,759
you know, actually, they have this great expression in South Africa we don't have here,

605
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:07,190
which I just love where somebody is going to give a completely wild guess, an educated guess.

606
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:10,219
They call it a thumb suck, I think, because you stick your thumb in there.

607
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:14,629
But I'll just see which way the wind's blowing. That's when people say, well, I'll give you a sound.

608
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:17,720
Suck on it. Say, you don't want that for my for my art.

609
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:26,150
All right. So so how does I categorize carcinogens carcinogenicity in humans?

610
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:33,049
So you see these categories, there's sufficient evidence that there's a causal relationship that's been established,

611
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:38,930
which is very unlikely to be caused by chance or bias or confounding or all the other

612
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:43,909
things that could go wrong with an epidemiologic study versus limited evidence.

613
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:54,280
There's a positive association, but we're not sure how, whether it's really causal or not for various reasons or there's inadequate evidence.

614
01:08:54,440 --> 01:09:02,780
The studies are just aren't good enough for one reason or another to come to any determination.

615
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:08,570
And there aren't the kind of data we need. And then, as you'll see, once in a.

616
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:13,120
Very great while they'll say there's evidence for a lack of carcinogenicity.

617
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:21,920
But that means there has to been studies done that cover the entire range of human exposure, meaning you have to have some if the high end,

618
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:30,670
the people have the highest end exposures to people who usually it's workers working around in Asia usually have the highest exposures.

619
01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:36,759
If they haven't been studied. Just because you didn't find it in an environmental exposure of the population,

620
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:43,809
I would never say there's no evidence of carcinogenicity because they would say, well, the group most likely at risk hasn't been studied.

621
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:50,740
So we don't know. Okay. They also look at the animals data, the rodents and so on.

622
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:56,049
And they you'll notice four sufficient causes cancer in humans.

623
01:09:56,050 --> 01:10:05,920
They want two or more species to have gotten cancer from it, or at least two or more independent studies in one species, not just a single study.

624
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:15,460
Limited evidence is that maybe it only showed up in a single experiment, and maybe there are tumors, but they seem to be benign.

625
01:10:15,490 --> 01:10:22,930
They don't actually seem to invade other tissues and inadequate evidence is usual kind of thing.

626
01:10:22,930 --> 01:10:27,549
And then lack of carcinogenicity, adequate studies of two or more species.

627
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:29,350
And there's no evidence of cancer risk.

628
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:37,420
Now, since we're on animal studies, I want to point something out to you, which I only have this one slide about,

629
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:42,520
but it's actually incredibly important in terms of actual decisions that are taken

630
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:47,649
about what standards should be for carcinogens and which means how much money,

631
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:54,520
time and effort should our society or any society be investing in reducing human exposures to this,

632
01:10:54,850 --> 01:11:01,509
which is the following what they do in animal studies, it's cheap, but it's not that cheap, right?

633
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:12,340
As they typically have, they typically go for the maximum tolerated dose and usually one half the maximum tolerated dose, maximum tolerated doses.

634
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:20,440
You are you don't can you find out how much of this chemical do you have to give to the animal for it to become acutely ill?

635
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:24,129
Not from cancer, but it's like it's not acutely ill.

636
01:11:24,130 --> 01:11:26,500
It's not functioning normally. It doesn't live a normal life.

637
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:35,470
And you back off a little bit of that and then you take half as much and then you have for a little exposure and then you take no exposure.

638
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:40,270
And typically there may only be like 50 animals in each of those three groups.

639
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:47,110
Okay. Because even even with that arrangement it to do a full two year study, I think it's still going to cost more than $1,000,000.

640
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:56,219
So you don't just take anything and do it. All right. But what that means is that almost always, not always,

641
01:11:56,220 --> 01:12:02,730
but almost always you're exposing the rodents to two doses per body weight

642
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:08,640
that are orders of magnitude higher than you expect humans to be exposed to.

643
01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:13,100
I said, not always a counter-example would be formaldehyde.

644
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,180
You had rats getting nasal carcinomas.

645
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:24,589
That exposure to formaldehyde that were within five fold of what was known exposures happened to people in workplaces at the time this was done.

646
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:31,760
But that's very that's relatively unusual. You know, typically these exposures, it's going to be 100 times higher, something like that.

647
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:42,170
Everyone with me so far. So then the question is, so you find a certain number, a certain number of increased cancers per 50 rodents,

648
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:50,419
and then you have to estimate what the risk is going to be to humans, assuming that the humans react the same way as the rodents do.

649
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:59,450
Now, I'm leaving out a lot of the fancier, newer stuff, which has to do with looking at mechanisms and making sure the mechanism in the rodents and,

650
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:03,650
you know, in terms of metabolism and so on matches the mechanism that it would be in humans.

651
01:13:03,650 --> 01:13:11,270
But forget about that for the moment. It's just tick the numbers. So, so then you have to back up to way lower exposure and predict.

652
01:13:12,670 --> 01:13:18,460
If the humans are like the rodents, what's what's the risk for cancer in humans?

653
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:28,150
Because, you know, if let's take the US EPA if if the risk if they estimate risk for exposure to the general community

654
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:34,389
environmental exposure if it's less than one in a million less than one in ten to the sex and for some things,

655
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:43,380
less than one in ten to the fifth. Basically, EPA says, well, at that level, we're not going to try to do something about the exposure.

656
01:13:43,390 --> 01:13:47,110
It's just because it's infrequent enough we don't think it's necessary.

657
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:55,150
Whereas if it if they think it's one in ten or the fourth or particularly 110, the third one 2000, not jump all over it.

658
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:07,810
Okay, that's huge. I got carried away, but we have next week. So so the thing I want to point out to you, just as a take home, is that.

659
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:15,370
Usually that's not the situation for workers. Workers are often some.

660
01:14:15,370 --> 01:14:19,480
For some the standards for workers have estimates of risk of death of higher than one in 100.

661
01:14:19,990 --> 01:14:24,940
So very different attitude for production workers than for the general population.

662
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:28,300
But that's a that's a different discussion than what I'm trying to get at here.

663
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:30,310
But I'm trying to get at here is the following.

664
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:40,590
You have to extrapolate from this observed high dose in these rodents, even assuming that the mechanism is right and that the rodents are like humans.

665
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:47,520
The question is still, what's the shape of the curve? Because you got humans, say, getting exposed maybe down here.

666
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:52,200
I mean, this doesn't say whether it's on a large scale or straight scale, but let's say it's down here.

667
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:58,649
So if you draw a straight line to zero increase cancers, you're online.

668
01:14:58,650 --> 01:15:09,510
B Whereas if you say there's a reason to think, for example, that it's linear quadratic, that the that there's a concavity to the curve,

669
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:17,430
that the risk doesn't go up linearly, it increases more dramatically as you increase the exposure.

670
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:23,669
Then instead of being up here for that same you're down here, you know,

671
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:28,620
maybe less than half that actually could be much less than half as much exposure.

672
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:35,190
Or there might be some argument for super linearity where you say, well, it's already sort of.

673
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:43,000
Hitting its peak. It's going the wrong way because you're over here hitting its peak so that actually,

674
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:46,540
if you try to extrapolate a straight line, you're underestimating the exposure.

675
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:52,230
And then just for completeness, this this this green line is hard misuse.

676
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:58,840
This is the claim that or a line that you would draw if you said, not only is it less than linear,

677
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:02,380
if you have a very low dose, it's actually a little bit protective.

678
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:08,710
It's not a long, interesting discussion. But let's just worry for the moment about B and C,

679
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:16,450
because some people will try to draw a straight line and other people will argue for various reasons that and partly has

680
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:25,600
to do with the math of a multi-stage set of things that have to happen to get to cancer that it should look more like.

681
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:39,410
This less than linear. So every time EPA decides whether they need to regulate the level of exposure to chemical fire in the air in the US.

682
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:46,569
They have to come up with an estimate of how many excess cancers they're going to see in the population

683
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:52,680
that is exposed over a lifetime for a certain average level of exposure in the air to whatever the is,

684
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:55,960
say, benzene. Okay. To do that.

685
01:16:58,290 --> 01:17:03,030
So you realize that no one's ever going to know. So that benzine causes leukemia.

686
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:09,990
Some people. And if you do the city of Chicago or in Chicago, some people in Chicago will definitely get leukemia.

687
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:16,230
You're never going to know from those. Much lower exposures than any worker ever had.

688
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:21,050
Of what's the benzene that's in the air in Chicago? The general air.

689
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:27,000
You're never going to know whether it contributed to this leukemia in this individual in this particular case.

690
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:32,550
You're going to have to use a mathematical model for people or others that have higher exposure.

691
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:41,969
So I just want you to realize that besides everything else, you know, it's it's actually critically important what your model is.

692
01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:47,430
And a lot of times that's where the big arguments happen between people saying we should regulate this or we don't need to regulate it.

693
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:52,140
There's disagreement about what happens when you extrapolate from the high exposure, low exposure.

694
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:57,030
So that would be the take home message for today. And I'll finish up with this on Monday.

695
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:13,650
Okay. Thank you. Will be.

696
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:31,240
I'd like to could the. Really?

697
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:38,050
Yeah. So. So I think.

698
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:54,680
I.
