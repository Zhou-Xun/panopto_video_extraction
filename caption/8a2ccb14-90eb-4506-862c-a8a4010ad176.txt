hey. okay. thank you. sorry about that.

32
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:05,769
okay. so so this is what I'm ready to talk about today. I will

33
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:12,169
start fresh with. I see why the work place. like

34
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:17,449
when you left this because we shaking the working but the last and then one of them in place I'm doing

35
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:22,729
this. the base. I love it. Emily just just to talk about the file that we

36
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:28,069
did with funding. we went and then I'll talk about it a little bit about the future to be signed

37
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:33,629
and then I have some final reflection. okay so.

38
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:38,729
anyways Joe this is Liza Gross because this is the best study because this is gonna

39
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:43,789
play showing. it was very colorful. so I like it. so this is basically showing

40
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:49,229
that we know this is not useful for you that. we just a few kind of like lifestyle

41
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:54,429
changes you can actually improve your life expectancy a_lot. I gonna replace the average

42
00:05:54,429 --> 00:05:59,897
customer received this is David. just to play for

43
00:05:59,897 --> 00:06:05,137
I got a consumption. if you got DVD smoking and eating fruit. I need improved

44
00:06:05,137 --> 00:06:10,357
greatly. before eating healthy diet. and then you guys see that you do

45
00:06:10,357 --> 00:06:15,697
come in as you told us to send you kind of like increase your chances of leaving ten years more.

46
00:06:15,697 --> 00:06:20,877
so we we know we know for many many years. just a few kind of light

47
00:06:20,877 --> 00:06:26,017
changes in your by your physical activity and not smoking with kind of like in to

48
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:31,777
your house. this is another kind of like say showing that we got us about.

49
00:06:31,777 --> 00:06:36,943
basically we are becoming more or seven thirty I said I gotta behave in such a little later

50
00:06:36,943 --> 00:06:42,003
so this is a more recent one showing. you kinda like should

51
00:06:42,003 --> 00:06:49,283
be ten minutes with been sitting on my policy.

52
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:54,843
what happened is that we have so seven thirty. we are using so badly because basically

53
00:06:54,843 --> 00:07:00,103
because we didn't know if this is Stacy I miss this time. there's a portion of your trust

54
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:05,403
people in the US. in the last century. I recently suspected to continue and also another very

55
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:10,643
small work place and that ways you can like apostles mortality

56
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:15,983
but this is Diane. because most people most supposed those to spend a_lot_of time

57
00:07:15,983 --> 00:07:21,303
on work work site. our idea of places to implement changes in the build environment.

58
00:07:21,303 --> 00:07:27,463
so what prevention of. BCC in twenty pieces. we know that because

59
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:32,963
basically the recent explosion of one lesson around the wall so most

60
00:07:32,963 --> 00:07:38,056
companies are kind of like implementing wellness program because they won to

61
00:07:38,056 --> 00:07:43,536
them and some prevention. we have her own wellness program. calling healthy. you know

62
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:49,236
this one and I'm going to do like our small spot for commission.

63
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:54,256
I'm gonna help a chance. I was wondering

64
00:07:54,256 --> 00:07:59,356
actually this is related to what I'm gonna say. later but. I was wonder how many

65
00:07:59,356 --> 00:08:04,716
of you are participating in healthy. okay.

66
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:10,256
how many of you have done there maybe for see the new meditation activities

67
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:16,596
or say one. I'm sorry.

68
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:21,636
this is not a new one. you'll even like to

69
00:08:21,636 --> 00:08:26,716
see people. so this is courtesy because basically a couple of your several one of April.

70
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:31,796
I was see one of the committees. we were trying to increase our participation the stuff is

71
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:36,866
doing much better in participating in hospice and the faculty was really

72
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:42,086
yeah. wonder why. so I'm wanted to say this is.

73
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:47,306
this is crazy. if this is like one of the brothers with the faculty. is that they

74
00:08:47,306 --> 00:08:52,466
complain about this today. so they have a huge level. right

75
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:57,506
right. so did you have those huge letters and then you have this kind of like I said if you like

76
00:08:57,506 --> 00:09:02,726
a couple of revision. I love you. right. no_one is doing. I do not wanna miss some people

77
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:07,786
are doing it right. many people I love the way. so. so we know

78
00:09:07,786 --> 00:09:12,826
that mission work. bye. we know that kind of like we

79
00:09:12,826 --> 00:09:18,666
should do. but kind of like of those activities. but we know that changing.

80
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:23,986
very challenge. so we know that we should we should do more exercise.

81
00:09:23,986 --> 00:09:29,086
we should kind of like maybe there which would not small questions like that. but many people don't do it even

82
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:34,978
though we know sometimes it's not really a problem of celebration. probably another prospect

83
00:09:34,978 --> 00:09:40,578
actually it's a complex fire. so basically when people get so much information about

84
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:45,978
this issue you know how kind of like how much gonna like do is wish you the one day notice that they don't do that.

85
00:09:45,978 --> 00:09:51,318
they try to do it. most of the time they would try to do it intentionally.

86
00:09:51,318 --> 00:09:56,458
that was entered in this kind of light loops I was kinda like what I ever received they would

87
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:01,958
lose that way they will be giving away. actually they will begin even more with them before the

88
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:07,118
due cycle. you gonna blind site. feeling like a failure.

89
00:10:07,118 --> 00:10:12,118
so now some people have_to come up with some exciting disorder. you should receive videos

90
00:10:12,118 --> 00:10:17,158
and file yet. but I think it's probably it's kind of like nothing happens to

91
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:22,598
all of us. so. so given that actually if you just

92
00:10:22,598 --> 00:10:27,658
I had this kind of like to be funny but I realized that putting on the of

93
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:33,018
professional people without changing the environment. the bus is gonna convert in

94
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:38,492
which really is not ready for on is not sustainable most of their wellness program.

95
00:10:38,492 --> 00:10:43,892
actually would like you to do the CDs and you making the changes. they're wonderful I'm gonna send additional

96
00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:49,092
be in place. but clearly the really needs that they're asking us to make changes

97
00:10:49,092 --> 00:10:54,232
in our life as we start changing that environment that is actually completely against

98
00:10:54,232 --> 00:10:59,312
living a healthy lifestyle. voting do here she's from CCI this

99
00:10:59,312 --> 00:11:04,352
is one of their decision people move from the country. she safe. we want people to go with the

100
00:11:04,352 --> 00:11:09,392
flow. not again because you cannot will you like will follow by I need some people have a_lot_of

101
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:15,012
will power but with somebody with Michael we know that some point I need today. if I don't miss completely

102
00:11:15,012 --> 00:11:21,472
healthy. you will end up in know maybe you might be illustrating

103
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:26,512
the other fan is not finished. I need to be this morning. so if

104
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:31,692
you feel like going to the game. like I might mess for you. eventually you

105
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:37,032
will never go. you may end up kind of like going for two three days and then another there for days

106
00:11:37,032 --> 00:11:42,378
he probably would be tired because you gonna enjoy your life this thing was full.

107
00:11:42,378 --> 00:11:48,578
I mean if you'd like if you like to know be. I'm in that old average is it was right. so

108
00:11:48,578 --> 00:11:54,238
how many of you have seen this video. you. okay.

109
00:11:54,238 --> 00:12:02,898
I do. so you do what you do business with less than two minutes and maybe sell of the funds.

110
00:12:02,898 --> 00:13:10,265
this is something that they didn't leave a message a couple of questions

111
00:13:10,265 --> 00:13:44,820
hello

112
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:50,020

113
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:55,080
of my face. have fun. lizzie I'm not like you know like

114
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,680
on my back. I mean people will be right. so hopefully I'll prevention.

115
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,840
should be focused on trying to make these changes in the bottom and the people we kind of like

116
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,920
embrace. you know with with feeling like this is

117
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,947
something that is not really a future for for me. bye she had twenty five to

118
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:21,867
live with people working with them but and they said that the default option should be a healthy options like.

119
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:27,007
if you need help even people and he would be healthy and just because that's what it is. bye. I need to have an open house

120
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:32,807
for options. my number. okay so what kindly do. so after that kind of like

121
00:14:32,807 --> 00:14:37,807
if be funny that I had been I decided to change something in my

122
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:42,887
line of research and I'm still doing my policy but I didn't

123
00:14:42,887 --> 00:14:47,927
embark in this new line of recess and now I have_to would just call.

124
00:14:47,927 --> 00:14:53,067
appreciate working but I'm in last. it's actually an office space because that's what I want to do. I want

125
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:59,167
to try to change it. I know he space that we. I need people help.

126
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:04,267
I need to have on your logo. so my sister maybe prescription. but anyway

127
00:15:04,267 --> 00:15:09,487
so. so that you probably just that I've been working on for Ms. S L

128
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:14,859
E disconnecting later. I'm just to come up today but I wanted to mention

129
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:20,519
that removed as soon because you know I mean when you you know that I have a tremendous.

130
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:25,639
been using it for five or six years now. I have_to actually have another one at home. so I'm becoming

131
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:30,799
a little. I think I was in another. I know that many of you making again. maybe think

132
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,839
that I'm crazy right. this is what I saw was I guess I will when I knew that people were using them

133
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,739
I thought Emily might be crazy because is no way that you've done work on work at the same time right.

134
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:47,059
actually you've done. I saw the lady on the nice talk to you soon if you could.

136
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:58,459
I know that the special work for everyone. so I'm again this is this is one of the many

137
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:03,599
options for people to gonna making process DVD. but older people

138
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:08,879
will probably break it but what because this is not supposed to be working the whole day. you can show them

139
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:13,939
in the apartments and then you can work for one hour for someone really is at the moment you sure

147
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,780
that was terrific. so basically what they did is yesterday based on the benefits

148
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:05,560
and the benefits because of it's benefits.

149
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,660
he said that was actually at the Medical. actually hot race engine

150
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:16,219
and medical certification to be made this less than two months but our

151
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:21,779
this is not running. again this is for for Kingsley Lopez. like you cannot really work.

152
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:27,119
but he said that is limited in back on voicemails for the employee when you use space

153
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:32,479
with Monday. because I wasn't make enough flight. so which is nice. yeah

154
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:38,159
sure got any need to have my husband a deal in losing weight right. and we know that.

155
00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:43,439
but anyway I know that be funny for me because then I decided that

156
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:48,639
what I have_to do actually partnered with people of the business goals that they know how to change

157
00:17:48,639 --> 00:17:53,719
the culture of organizations because one of the probably implement this type of changes in the work

158
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:58,819
environment. is not so much bring in the equipment. it's kind of like changing the hall channel

159
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:04,859
seven station because clearly this is Tony Miller. if you can have that.

160
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:10,459
anyway so that was kind of life of Riley that he say somebody at some point I will do it

161
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:16,461
that because I have both seen in the same room and the [INAUDIBLE] I gonna really help participants balls

162
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:22,081
so today when I went to talk about this day. Lee this guy let him later.

163
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:28,701
so now this long to. let me start

164
00:18:28,701 --> 00:18:34,161
telling your wife like is important for good health. you know that I'm gonna see how

165
00:18:34,161 --> 00:18:39,161
many people things that when I put in that. I love to talk about vitamin_D. and no I mean vitamin_D is very good

166
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:44,361
for you. no actually Sunday night. actually it's very busy for your most.

167
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:49,661
I'm leaving for the for your mother. so you know about this and in effort to disorder that. you know that this people

168
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:55,301
when they went that because of lack of lives they are gonna be ready for it right.

169
00:18:55,301 --> 00:19:00,621
I do this short survey completely. following

170
00:19:00,621 --> 00:19:05,681
scientific mess. I'm on day for help with this and like

171
00:19:05,681 --> 00:19:10,841
I can go slicing. I was like fifty four percent participation with very good. I

172
00:19:10,841 --> 00:19:16,020
probably usually you you get a forty percent participation if this is was euros only.

173
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:21,080
so this is very good. and I was asking if my mood lack of

174
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,240
life in there waiting on Dan. Dan is twenty three people. I need your pussy.

175
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,620
I was surprised because I'm I'm ready. my mood is very effective I love the place in the winter. the hospice

176
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:36,660
and I do saw that I'm probably borderline but you can see that many people actually is

177
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:42,780
affected by my lack of my people but I'm not a force because of liability.

178
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,900
by many people are affected. the most

179
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:53,080
important thing of life is not so much better. but your more is that basically everything in our body

180
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,201
go very much. bye-bye I like his date. you should get them specially

181

182
00:20:03,261 --> 00:20:08,401

183
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:13,461
they respond like that. bye. all are

190
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:49,681
this process. basically like it's time that you should not be

191
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:54,754
supposed to like my supposed. you're supposed to like you like. have a nice then you will have

193
00:20:59,854 --> 00:21:05,294

195
00:21:10,574 --> 00:21:15,594

196
00:21:15,594 --> 00:21:20,714
I completely release the language for Columbus. we know that more detail with you. I'm unsure of what

197
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:25,794
this is. it's much. because. so. so we know where we sit

198
00:21:25,794 --> 00:21:30,794
about to get in with and usually we can. I think the water is leaking water. I received like oh yeah. life

199
00:21:30,794 --> 00:21:35,854
is good. my sleeping partner. this is Nancy Moore. I'm actually this is Rushing.

200
00:21:35,854 --> 00:21:41,634
this is an important message. so we know

201
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:46,834
to bring samples in the literature that she's work on short sleeve dress

202
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:52,014
is see with higher receivable. basically because of those people with this

203
00:21:52,014 --> 00:21:57,100
office is restored. if you like hi Craig it's from

204
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,420
four four. because I need a couple phones with an American Home Express. so everything

205
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:07,560
is kind of like you know wait to see if you do kind of my life.

206
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:12,620
so I just kinda like we are gonna see this is working the step space. so the step of

207
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:18,640
the spaces. I need you to look at like spaces that are just

208
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,720
personalized. how are you going. been leaving in biology because back because basically

209
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,900
you on the kind of life. supposedly any sunlight. some of this message. maybe if

210
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:34,520
anything maybe not. but basically it's kind of like maybe we should be

211
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:40,100
foursome or not as well as many people I know it's kind of like working around when the.

212
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:45,280
so no_one that's why we kind of like should go down with

213
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,440
some muffins so. bye. so. so I'll still just

214
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,828
gonna lay low low in this election like tell you this is what we have one of your sites.

215
00:22:55,828 --> 00:23:00,928
basically within that I spoke to you today tonight kind of like is going to

216
00:23:00,928 --> 00:23:06,008
eventually. I love life. continue to wait to bring. okay. maybe Chris

217
00:23:06,008 --> 00:23:12,668
with Dwayne. speak day. you take a full screen.

218
00:23:12,668 --> 00:23:17,768

219
00:23:17,768 --> 00:23:22,808
supposed to be in that day and your mood is going to be worst. I just

220
00:23:22,808 --> 00:23:28,808
had to have a higher grade in hiring. kind of like

221
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:34,688
you're leaving but hasn't to be inside too. I know those three intermediate. we know that

222
00:23:34,688 --> 00:23:39,768
the city. I kind of isolated to gaining wait in the long run of course but to

223
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:44,828
been waiting one week. but in the long run. doing great. just tell me that that's

224
00:23:44,828 --> 00:23:50,048
for sure it's probably a chronic special because you working with respect for many many years

225
00:23:50,048 --> 00:23:56,144
I mean you're basically not receiving but you should be this is a half a case.

226
00:23:56,144 --> 00:24:01,184
we are proposing is to use this LED based

227
00:24:01,184 --> 00:24:06,364
in late. basically maybe next day bye. this is kinda

228
00:24:06,364 --> 00:24:11,624
like a fancy one. I'll show you know the ones that on you sooner. because

229
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:17,264
this has like. this is. actually this is not a stylist. I'm in the guy that is like I said.

230
00:24:17,264 --> 00:24:22,824
if you sign happy. so basically it looks recess so it looks like a sky light.

231
00:24:22,824 --> 00:24:27,824
and actually that because is like maybe one of their sides. this is Monday morning the ladies

232
00:24:27,824 --> 00:24:34,144
so basically switch your brain thinking that it's been like going throughout the class.

233
00:24:34,144 --> 00:24:39,284
he has full spectrum Life. this is not there. Lou and Rachel like the people you're supposed

234
00:24:39,284 --> 00:24:46,424
to with your service of the what this would actually be fine for us. space is not

235
00:24:46,424 --> 00:24:51,524
but the quality of life is way much better than the usual person lives in danger

236
00:24:51,524 --> 00:24:57,508
since busy here. is that yeah Jill this is Katie said you can kind of use

just checking I won't I won't open up my phone or whatever is happening outside and

238
00:25:02,528 --> 00:25:07,668

242
00:25:23,868 --> 00:25:29,388

243
00:25:29,388 --> 00:25:34,528
the weather weather system. so they guys that you feel when you're in one of the rooms you really

244

246
00:25:46,508 --> 00:25:52,628

247
00:25:52,628 --> 00:25:57,642
Brian and I dad if you was not sure because he

248

251
00:26:15,122 --> 00:26:20,122

252
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:25,162
mind. is what I need you. if I don't tell you that make

253
00:26:25,162 --> 00:26:30,202

259
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:02,676
sign outside. so there's not too much in our maybe if you have like two we just wondered if we

260
00:27:02,676 --> 00:27:07,756
just wake me up. but you can be around on my cell. you have a special

261
00:27:07,756 --> 00:27:12,876
video and then you can ask them for intervention and maybe would

262
00:27:12,876 --> 00:27:18,296
be to make sure. so call number on Marcus because in

263

313
00:31:49,747 --> 00:31:54,807

315
00:32:00,347 --> 00:32:05,747
so this is day. you have a special phase one phase one was done

316
00:32:05,747 --> 00:32:12,407
last week. he the efficiency of the values.

317
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:17,667
they're kinda like a section of the skylight and laser on those details

318
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:23,007
on the like on stuff and then you can see it in any way.

319
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:28,179
you can see that in the morning. kind of light LED region reality

320
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:33,299
assessment. and people with my sister yesterday in the afternoon.

321
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:38,399
they were less nervous and there's no hearted when you look in morning or afternoon to gather your Cecile

322
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:44,079
and Leslie. Leslie I was more excitement. I need to share. so

323
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:49,599
this is amazing because they only four people here. talk to you later. love you. can't find anything.

324
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:54,599
if you can please do that we have to mentioned we have like morning afternoon for five days and if

325
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:59,999
I the celebration. but that's very promising. now

326
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:04,999
it's rolling with this Friday night. the study is gonna be three weeks in December.

327
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:10,081
this is very very low. we got gonna like what kind of

328
00:33:10,081 --> 00:33:15,444
life plus people called Ross and I'm driving because really you cannot really nine people.

329
00:33:15,444 --> 00:33:20,524
bye. bye. this is Sylvia. bye. life is different. but I need you

330
00:33:20,524 --> 00:33:25,784
can do something with Leslie website because the program is out in the first page who are basically

331
00:33:25,784 --> 00:33:30,964
complained out nice kind like the lady with very usual crappy

332
00:33:30,964 --> 00:33:36,224
for us life. so that when people look at those. hopefully either this is

333
00:33:36,224 --> 00:33:41,504
right because I needed to use it for a call back. so you know this is my least concern a little before

334
00:33:41,504 --> 00:33:46,724
that. the company actually works a nice day. be sign at Sean

335
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:51,824
light. so this young looks exactly the same as

336
00:33:51,824 --> 00:33:57,044
their release. we said everything kinda like to the same but inside

337
00:33:57,044 --> 00:34:02,544
instead of having an early. bye. whatever they call it the Hartford. but

338
00:34:02,544 --> 00:34:08,624
is not specially designed because clearly I need to spend together you can see the difference in the quality of life.

339
00:34:08,624 --> 00:34:13,724
event together. they see them in two weeks apart. so like well

340
00:34:13,724 --> 00:34:19,091
maybe done we are asking been. I haven't seen those results

341
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:24,231
but because we don't have of you people. they usually they

342
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:29,831
know what it is remiss but they don't know it complete service. so the lease

343
00:34:29,831 --> 00:34:34,891
they can have like let's what we are concerned this is possible that there's some place you like to see was it because there's

344
00:34:34,891 --> 00:34:40,251
no other way that we can do it. bye. this is the best we can do. so the second phase.

345
00:34:40,251 --> 00:34:47,411
we were actually using the sham Life. I know we have actually twenty two Chevrolet.

346
00:34:47,411 --> 00:34:52,711
second part numbers the show. very very believe me ever solved. we conduct the analysis.

347
00:34:52,711 --> 00:34:58,071
so really don't explain. call me back so late. like

348
00:34:58,071 --> 00:35:03,131
I said reported. I do have that you got to meet them and I haven't been able to look at that. so this

349
00:35:03,131 --> 00:35:08,591
is says reported and then I was we were asking people how to use the phone. later.

350
00:35:08,591 --> 00:35:15,325
I don't know that you can see that there people when people were on their LED lights

351
00:35:15,325 --> 00:35:20,785
list actually that's when they were on the first. I mean it's not difficult. I just kind of like

352
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:26,625
like to meet with you. bye-bye. right. we were asking about

353
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:31,765
the rate the quality of your sleep last night and then you can see the others know

354
00:35:31,765 --> 00:35:36,945
before they leave the house and I believe they did this is Holly Chris from one two five.

355
00:35:36,945 --> 00:35:42,105
this is. better but it's not really I mean there's no effect but we were asking

356
00:35:42,105 --> 00:35:47,265
how many you when you got in the mail of the night and then Missy Kelly. we still kind

357
00:35:47,265 --> 00:35:52,385
of like a significant decrease day and maybe I'll back to the site

358
00:35:52,385 --> 00:35:57,385
which is very promising because it's kind of like everything goes in there. right direction. so that's

359
00:35:57,385 --> 00:36:02,785
that's nice. I still have a_lot_of data that I have. I need to finish they file out

360
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:07,865
and then I kind of like need to kind of like maybe some any other

361
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:12,925
parameters. but in conclusion. if I missed about the benefits of the

362
00:36:12,925 --> 00:36:18,095
LED lights. most what I need and they they let in relation

363
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:23,215
condition they were. Morris is Jessica excited and happy. listen I was on

364
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:29,295
more locks and then also today

365
00:36:29,295 --> 00:36:34,475
if it's a baby license. if you can pop in so the office workers will cost less. I will supposed

366
00:36:34,475 --> 00:36:39,995
to be really delightful but today second day. so going back to our reading

367
00:36:39,995 --> 00:36:44,995
night. Diana Wilson. Lisa Kelly. we know

368
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:50,155
that share I said we can process the move. I still need

369
00:36:50,155 --> 00:36:55,255
to see what happened with Dave for his rabies but he does but I'm at the

370
00:36:55,255 --> 00:37:00,655
second light change. I mean we think that in the long run. they can't

371
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:05,735
wait a day. one very important scene that I have_to say that we're not claiming that people

372
00:37:05,735 --> 00:37:10,735
are going to lose weight. maybe one's now. so just supposed to sign it I need

373
00:37:10,735 --> 00:37:16,035
a idea here is to prevent gaining weight because people been way very slowly over the years

374
00:37:16,035 --> 00:37:21,195
was like how someone to November here. which looks like

375
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:26,415
nothing buddy. thank you and you become a beast. bye. basically is like. you

376
00:37:26,415 --> 00:37:31,475
don't even realize it. anyway very slow you back. so we can kinda like at least to slow down.

377
00:37:31,475 --> 00:37:36,675
that's when will be great. maybe to stay there. kinda so much for losing weight.

378
00:37:36,675 --> 00:37:41,795
no gain more weight. bye. and one of the nice things about

379
00:37:41,795 --> 00:37:47,275
this project. even if our lives are successful in preventing. just a small fraction

380
00:37:47,275 --> 00:37:52,275
of weight gain. basically this intervention is very sustainable because

381
00:37:52,275 --> 00:37:57,295
we are not asking people to do anything. so they don't have_to go to the house to go to the game they don't have such a

382
00:37:57,295 --> 00:38:02,375
scale you don't have_to do anything. just go to our office. they found a very nice light

383
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:07,675
ride. so it's like I mean it's perfect. so I'm gonna be the last

384
00:38:07,675 --> 00:38:12,895
day because basically you gonna sell the flies everywhere. they are very efficient because early right.

385
00:38:12,895 --> 00:38:17,927
so if this is how we waiting. so so I think that

386
00:38:17,927 --> 00:38:23,147
they really work. I will be leaving this late. I will still in regards

387
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:28,367
to letter that I'm leaving. if this is look like. but but he still.

388
00:38:28,367 --> 00:38:33,447
so anyway I wanted to see if some final reflections because I miss when I talk about the

389
00:38:33,447 --> 00:38:38,847
Stephanie people strange way like I need you losing your dog. this is

390
00:38:38,847 --> 00:38:43,907
this is not going to hockey. because I mean I thought especially if I like that right. I

391
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:49,047
mean they're actually not much expensive at any all the light fixture is like

392
00:38:49,047 --> 00:38:54,107
the same with this redness is like in Mississippi. much space that any of

393
00:38:54,107 --> 00:38:59,267
us. that's. so if this is not really I mean if this is not a huge

394
00:38:59,267 --> 00:39:04,367
in the minute. talk to you later. hi. so I believe you talked

395
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:09,467
yet. this said office you have all of money. we

396
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:14,647
know we don't they look like a playground. I mean why I mean everyone should be able

397
00:39:14,647 --> 00:39:19,745
to move it. I mean is not that expensive nice places for people to

398
00:39:19,745 --> 00:39:26,105
kind of like feel comfortable answering. you know happy in their workplace.

399
00:39:26,105 --> 00:39:33,565
so I just wanted to finish. I know that you might consider doors

400
00:39:33,565 --> 00:39:39,445
and to schedule the appointment he runs one of their lives. looking at to get in person.

401
00:39:39,445 --> 00:39:44,785
Bruce is no longer with our system. your file but they guys will do call me as

402
00:39:44,785 --> 00:39:49,885
to where my coupon. talk to you see how you know Cathy and she's she's

403
00:39:49,885 --> 00:39:54,909
my decision. sorry I Ashley your house. she's in psychology she's in

404
00:39:54,909 --> 00:40:00,329
the sizing that you know because maybe we just with you

405
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:06,509
was the one who's gonna play with me. who is missing. this is Missus Theresa this is

406
00:40:06,509 --> 00:40:13,189
Sandy in queue. I will like give me a money. this is a no this is me.

407
00:40:13,189 --> 00:40:18,309
now I'm giving you because they found this many of a few letter that

408
00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:23,869
I was using this. first I wanna do and kind of like the

409
00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:29,489
size of my students because without that and then there was a chapter seven until the next event.

410
00:40:29,489 --> 00:40:35,309
please. this is a very nice day.

411
00:40:35,309 --> 00:41:17,648
as we do participate. so you still have time for questions

412
00:41:17,648 --> 00:41:29,748
press four. this

413
00:41:29,748 --> 00:41:34,748
is not a

414
00:41:34,748 --> 00:41:39,828
levy. yeah and actually that was one thirty to do some of them I just really really change that because they were saying

415
00:41:39,828 --> 00:41:44,908
that it will be more powerful than know God that they were mentioning about doing

416
00:41:44,908 --> 00:41:49,937
that would be for to that. I mean I wanted to gonna lay this was a

417
00:41:49,937 --> 00:41:54,937
position I had available to. I'm in the building with getting people one the best is like

418
00:41:54,937 --> 00:42:00,036
and he said he finished. I mean they did they did receive a really need blue light I needed to have something to be patient

419
00:42:00,036 --> 00:42:05,896
but if you that I could gonna like try to identify people who are more kind of light

420
00:42:05,896 --> 00:42:11,937
line with this is that I'm working for any weeks on Monday probably would benefit more from those lights.

421
00:42:11,937 --> 00:42:17,856
that's the reason why I chose like a house keeper position was to anyone. because most

422
00:42:17,856 --> 00:42:23,156
look at the house we actually shows like I need more. but also because I want to both.
