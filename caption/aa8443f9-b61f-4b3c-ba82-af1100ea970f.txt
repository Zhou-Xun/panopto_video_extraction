1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:09,080
All right. So we're good to go. Okay, so intro to studies and then we're going to go into cohort studies.

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,980
So lecture outline for today, right? We're going to do a little bit of an intro to study design overview.

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,190
Again, we did get that a little bit in the in the first lecture. Right.

4
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:27,470
But just to go back to it, so common elements to all studies and then we're going to dove into cohort studies.

5
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:33,080
All right. So our study designs classified. This should be look a little bit familiar, right?

6
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,600
We've got our observational studies. So cohort studies, case control studies are multiple different designs.

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,799
We'll be looking out their cross-sectional studies and ecological studies.

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,570
They're kind of listed there in the order of like how much weight you give them when,

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,370
you know, thinking about whether or not, you know, this association is causal.

10
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,260
Right? And then we've got our experimental study design.

11
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:01,100
So intervention trials, randomized controlled trials. There are some other experimental designs as well.

12
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:11,239
Those are the main the main ones which are really kind of our gold standard of evidence because we're assigning the exposure.

13
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,200
Right. So that therefore, if we do it properly and it's large enough,

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:22,100
we're kind of hoping that the two groups that we're comparing really only differ by that exposure and maybe some small, random effects.

15
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,250
All right. So experimental studies are studies of the prevention and treatments for diseases.

16
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,410
The investigator is going to actively determine which groups receive the exposure.

17
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,299
They're the gold standards or gold standard is a randomized controlled trial where

18
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:45,130
we're going to randomly assign persons to either receive or not receive the exposure.

19
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:54,700
But there are lots of reasons why randomized controlled trials may not be possible, or you think you should not be them, even if they are possible.

20
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:00,970
So one, it's just it's not possible. You know, we can't randomize people on many things.

21
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:10,270
We can't randomize you on height, hair color of your biological sex.

22
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:15,879
Right. There's nothing we can't go back and randomize that. And genetics is another thing.

23
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,320
We're never going to get the randomized right. Well, at least we can just at this point.

24
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,580
So sometimes it's not possible just because of the exposure you want to look at.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,739
Sometimes it's not ethical. You could say, you know, but but you're not going to randomize it.

26
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,770
And that's because it's harmful to people, right?

27
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,310
So like if I said I'm going to do a study on smoking,

28
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,879
I'm going to sign all of you in here randomly to smoke one pack a day for the next 30 years or not, right?

29
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,890
Like that's not okay. Right. And that's not okay because we know smoking smoking is harmful.

30
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:56,290
So so typically you cannot randomize people to something that's harmful,

31
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:02,860
although occasionally there can be kind of a little bit of an ethical dilemma around where we're at,

32
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,880
where that might happen in certain circumstances, but usually never happen.

33
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,580
I would say almost never going to happen. All right. They're also expensive, right?

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,920
Randomized controlled trials are very expensive to run. And so sometimes that may make it impossible to actually do that study.

35
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,390
And then it's you know, it's it's not really it would be very difficult to do a randomized controlled trial.

36
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,239
I always have to watch what I say because I say, you can't do this.

37
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,920
And then somebody is like, well, but there's this one example of when they did, right?

38
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,830
So that's a little bit tricky, but like for really rare outcomes, right?

39
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:49,659
The problem is your study would have huge and it would be so expensive and so, so, so typically almost always for rare outcomes,

40
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,820
you're not going to be able to do a randomized controlled trial,

41
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:58,030
which means you're going to have to rely on observational data in observational studies.

42
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:04,360
So for observational studies, we're going to study the causes, preventions and treatments for diseases.

43
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,010
The investigator is going to passively observe what happens, right?

44
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,870
We want to interfere as little as possible in the normal process of what's going to happen.

45
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,579
We're not going to determine the exposures that people receive.

46
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:24,970
Right. That's an observational study. Some of the basics of observational studies, we have cohort studies.

47
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,910
We're going to ascertain exposure status and then we're going to follow and we're trying to ascertain outcome.

48
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,120
Now, this doesn't mean that it can't be done retrospectively.

49
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:41,980
That important thing is that we're first ascertaining kind of exposure status and not enrolling by outcome.

50
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:48,790
Case control studies is going to ascertain outcome status and then assess exposure.

51
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:54,219
So we're really enrolling or selecting people based off of their exposure and their outcome status, right.

52
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,590
Are they a case or not? That's the name.

53
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:04,270
And then cross-sectional studies are going to ascertain exposure and disease prevalence at a single time point.

54
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,670
Now one note which we'll get into later,

55
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:13,510
you can do kind of sequential cross-sectional studies and people will sometimes mix those up with cohort studies, but we'll go into that here.

56
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,910
But for the purposes of this moment, you know, a single point in time that you're looking at.

57
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:28,720
Right. And then an ecologic study is examines associations between exposure and disease with population level data rather than individual level data.

58
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,680
And there are, of course, complications for that to or something might be population, another individual level.

59
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:40,150
Well, we'll talk about that as well. All right. So that's just kind of a quick outline.

60
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,950
We will, of course, go through all of those study designs in a lot of detail.

61
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:51,760
But it's just to kind of remind you of the first lecture a little bit and remind you of all the different study designs.

62
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:57,440
Okay. So common elements or selection of subjects?

63
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:02,600
There's different ways that we can decide to select subjects.

64
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:09,940
You might decide to restrict, right? You're going to only do you know certain people that meet certain criteria.

65
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,179
Right. You can also do a random sampling of the source population.

66
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:24,860
I'm going to try to sample from everybody. Or you can stratify the source population a stratification of the source and study populations.

67
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,250
We'll go into each of these in more detail, sort of a restriction.

68
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:34,339
You're restricting the eligibility of potential subjects by including or excluding

69
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:40,070
individuals based on one or more variables that might be known risk factors.

70
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,160
Right. You might want to only include people with that other known risk factor, or maybe you're going to exclude them completely.

71
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,530
Right. Because you don't want that complication in your study.

72
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:56,270
Test or procedures that allow exposure, measurement or thought to influence disease detection, e.g. screening.

73
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:04,460
You might be restricted to people who've done that screening other diseases or conditions related to the exposure status.

74
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:12,410
You're often excluding those individuals, although there are complications of doing that.

75
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:19,940
We'll talk about that. Categories of the exposure of interest or place and time.

76
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,530
Right. You have to think about who is going to be eligible to be in your study.

77
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:34,760
And this is you know, this is determined by your question. It's also often heavily determined by the resources that you have.

78
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:41,600
Right. So for restriction, which we have two types you're going to have complete.

79
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,640
You're going to have uniform eligibility requirements for all participants.

80
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:50,420
An example would be women aged 50 to 59. So the only people I'm going to enroll in my study,

81
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,890
I may not be the only people that get my outcome of interest, but by restricting it to that age group.

82
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,570
You know, I don't have to worry about biological sex.

83
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,589
I don't have to worry as much about age effects.

84
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:10,100
Right. Because it's a more narrow band or you can have partial restriction that is matching.

85
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,540
Right. Which is used to make a comparison comparison groups more similar.

86
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,990
And we have a whole lecture around math matching later in the course.

87
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:30,530
So we'll go into that in quite a lot of detail. So reasons for using restriction one might be a research question.

88
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,719
You don't want to enroll people in your study that are actually going to contribute to the analysis, right.

89
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,320
Because they don't actually meet the criteria for your research question.

90
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:44,540
You can also do it to gain control over other factors that could distort the results.

91
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,890
It may be more feasible, like I said before, reduce costs.

92
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:57,860
Right. So limiting and time in place really reduces costs for study and may be necessary to obtain the needed data.

93
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,969
Right. For example, if data from a screening test is needed.

94
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:07,310
So ideally you'd like to do it in everybody in the population, but that's really not feasible.

95
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:13,610
So you're going to center down in on women who've had a mammogram in the last five years.

96
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:22,100
And in the Ann Arbor area, for example, it may also be done to make the study more statistically efficient.

97
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,860
That is, to gain power. All right.

98
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:34,810
Restriction code can introduce methodological problems and certainly has implications for generalizability.

99
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:46,870
Okay. So probability or random sampling which the selection of participants is based on a known probability of being included in the study?

100
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,509
Now note they don't all have to have the same probability of being in the study.

101
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,630
You just need to know what that probability is, right?

102
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,740
If every person in the study has the same probability, then it is a simple random sample.

103
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:10,630
This is required really for estimating population specific parameters like disease frequency,

104
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,280
and it makes the study population representative of the source population,

105
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:21,160
which are generally hoping it's representative of the general population but does depend on your situation.

106
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:29,800
We also have stratified sampling, independent selection of subjects from various strata.

107
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:36,480
It's and so they're going to be mutually exclusive sub populations that we're dividing people into.

108
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:45,760
Right. It's often done to balance different straight up that are unequal in the source population and it's often used with random sampling.

109
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,820
So it'll be stratified random sampling. Right.

110
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:54,640
So, you know, if I wanted to do a study of one example, there are many examples of this,

111
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:03,670
but if I wanted to do a study in the Ann Arbor area and I wanted to be kind of generally representative of the U.S. population,

112
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,480
we can argue on a bunch of different things, but let's say around age, just to make it really simple.

113
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,139
Right? Do you think I should do random sampling or stratified?

114
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:17,650
Random sampling and why? Because the population here is you.

115
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,610
Yeah. So it should be stratified. And in fact, there are fewer children in Ann Arbor.

116
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:31,110
So you're going to actually want to uplift certain age groups like children, which are going to be underrepresented in our population.

117
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,610
You were going to want to evaluate age groups, which most of you are in, right?

118
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:41,130
Because it's going to be overrepresented and represented because we have a large university here.

119
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,120
Right. We've got like 40,000 students or something like that. Right.

120
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,750
And that is not the typical age structure of the U.S.

121
00:11:50,990 --> 00:12:01,680
So. All right, so stratified sample with all types of strata of variables we're going to really stratifying on and maybe known risk factors,

122
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:10,709
maybe place in calendar time could be the main exposure variable, especially when the exposure is rare or very common.

123
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,020
Right.

124
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:18,210
You want to get a good group to compare them to and it might be on disease status, right, that we're doing that when we do case control studies.

125
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:32,440
The type of outcome measure. So disease status may be defined across sexually and might also be defined longitudinally and outcome may be measured.

126
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:39,780
So we're switching from simply outcome to outcome may be measured on a continuous square scale that is quantitative,

127
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,469
quantitatively or on a categorical scale.

128
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:53,560
So qualitatively. So yes. So right. So in all of our study designs, we're going to be thinking about the type of outcome measures that we have.

129
00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:01,070
We have a method of data collection. You have primary data collection, the secondary data collection, right.

130
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,440
Primary data collection. As when you're going out and collecting that data yourself.

131
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:09,580
Secondary data collection is where you're using data that's already been collected for another reason, right?

132
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:22,290
For your study. Another thing that we always have to think about when we're thinking about studies is the induction and latency period.

133
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:29,309
People will often bring this up as an issue in infectious diseases and not at all think about it for chronic diseases.

134
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:35,100
Of course, actually it can be a bigger impact in chronic diseases than infectious diseases.

135
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:35,880
Right.

136
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:42,629
Just because they often it's a long time between that exposure and when the outcome is actually occurs, or at least when the outcome is detected.

137
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:47,160
Right. So here we've got this action, the first component of the cause.

138
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,910
Some induction period. Right. We've got the completion of the causal high diseases.

139
00:13:53,940 --> 00:14:00,570
Onset is going to occur as individual. But then you've got this latency period which can really vary in time.

140
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:06,030
Right. You know, waiting for that clinical diagnosis to occur.

141
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,340
All right. So something we should always think about and something you should really start to think about.

142
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:20,990
When you see differences in studies, you know, when you're like, Oh, this woman says it's a risk factor, and that one says it isn't.

143
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:28,709
You know what might be responsible for it. You need to think about, like, how they define the outcome, what they're there,

144
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:32,120
how they're thinking about induction and latency when they're doing the study.

145
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,820
Right. You need to think about exposures. You know what?

146
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,970
How are they classifying that exposure?

147
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:46,800
So when we think of exposures, you want to think of all things that are risk factors and sort of things that may be bad for you smoking.

148
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:57,010
This is like heat, right? Air pollution is supposed to represent down there as well as exposures that are protective or good for people.

149
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:01,409
Right. So we've got breast feeding exercise, right?

150
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,590
So those are the type of exposures we'll be looking at.

151
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:13,380
So exposure factors are often going to be reduced to a simple numeric summary of the exposure exposure history.

152
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,460
That might be the current level of exposure, right?

153
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:22,920
The average exposure over time or the cumulative exposure that happens over time.

154
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:31,320
It often is lag, right, because that exposure doesn't immediately lead to the disease necessarily, or at least disease that's detectable.

155
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,480
Right. So it's going to be different. That's going to be determined by what's biologically plausible.

156
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:43,320
And then it's going to take into account both that induction period that we talked about, as well as the latency period.

157
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:56,010
So for defining chronic exposures, it's more complicated than when exposure only occurs at a single point in time, right?

158
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,930
Probably not surprising because of course, it's going to change over that time. How do you really categorize that?

159
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,280
How do you deal with it? Or are you going to categorize it? Are you going to have a continuous scale?

160
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:11,050
Right. So you've got this period of accumulation of that exposure.

161
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:20,649
It's going to be a kind of a complex function, really, of not only the intensity of that exposure, but the amount of time that you have that exposure.

162
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:28,150
And of course, that intensity may change over time. Right. And then we've got multiple levels of exposure.

163
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:32,770
The number of levels is really going to be determined by the investigator.

164
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:38,589
Right. You might say high versus low or low, high, medium, low, etc.

165
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:45,640
Right. Composite nature or of cumulative or average exposures.

166
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,900
So this is really just say, you know, they're fairly complex, right?

167
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,910
So many exposure measurements used are a combination of two or more components.

168
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,320
So we've got for example, this is pretty common packagers of cigaret smoking.

169
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:06,550
Right. That is the composite of the duration of smoking with the intensity of smoking.

170
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:13,060
You can also do it separately. Life, the components that's actually that's better if possible.

171
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:20,380
Should you do supplemental analysis of your smoke? So splitting out duration and perhaps per day intensity.

172
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,750
And of course, here, this would be something that's changing over time. So you would need to deal with that in your analysis as well.

173
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:33,790
And we'll talk a little bit about how methods have changed over time. So what people are doing has changed over time, right?

174
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:38,680
Because time varying methods are a little bit more recently developed.

175
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:48,570
So for categorizing exposure, it can really be difficult to determine how you say unexposed compared to exposed.

176
00:17:50,030 --> 00:18:00,499
And somebody think of an example where that would be. Air pollution is kind of a classic example.

177
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,620
We're all exposed to some level of air pollution.

178
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:12,220
So if you're just trying to really simply put people into exposed or not, you know who's not exposed to it, who are we really comparing them to?

179
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:16,860
Right. Um. All right.

180
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,760
For the intensity of exposure.

181
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:27,089
When you're thinking about that, sometimes people you might choose to go with maximum intensity or there may be you know,

182
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:33,630
you might go with average intensity. You can use a time weighted approach for average intensity.

183
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:41,040
And, you know, if you're doing average intensity, you really have this need for having multiple measurements over time.

184
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:47,000
Right, to figure out what that average is. So I'm kind of thinking about that.

185
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:55,400
We can start to take into account multiple factors, you know, around exposure or multiple aspects of exposure that we might be thinking about.

186
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:00,889
So this is a timeline showing how a smoker moves into higher categories of cumulative

187
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,730
smoking exposure and how the time at risk corresponds to those categories.

188
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:12,920
And it's taking into account a five year minimum kind of latency induction period, right?

189
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,390
So here, right, we start here there are light smoker.

190
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:22,879
Then they kind of they actually that smoking history starts to come into effect and we're so we're not going

191
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,580
to consider them even as exposed until they've been smoking for five years or in this particular example.

192
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,250
And then they move to become a moderate smoker. But once again, they're not moved into that.

193
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,600
So that category. And so they've been at that level for five years, etc.

194
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:49,430
So it seems like exposure should be really easy, right? But when you start to look at some exposures in particular,

195
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:56,690
it can be very complicated to categorize them or to think about how you're going to summarize that exposure.

196
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:05,200
All right. So that's it for kind of our basic things that we're going to be thinking about with all of our study designs.

197
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:13,000
And we'll have an activity today where you're talking about exposure, for example, you're going to say what the outcome is, what the exposure is.

198
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:18,180
And for this class, I want you to be very specific, right?

199
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:23,050
Provide me all of the information that you are provided with about the exposure,

200
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,710
so how it was measured, what they were looking at over a long period of time, etc.

201
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:37,360
Right. And the reason for that is, as I already said, depending on how studies, you know, define exposure, right?

202
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:44,440
You can get very different results. And this is something you need to get really used to looking at and in really fine detail.

203
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:52,030
All right. So cohort studies, as I already told you, my favorite studies, I have three currently ongoing cohorts right now.

204
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,310
And then I'm a lead epidemiologist on another cohort.

205
00:20:54,910 --> 00:21:02,650
So I tend to do these really big studies that have they have thousands of people on them or the smallest one has like 1800 children.

206
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,219
And there are observational studies, right?

207
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,430
We're just sitting back watching what happens.

208
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,479
And we don't you know, we don't have control over those exposures.

209
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:21,040
So that can be a lot of confounding, which we will get to compounding later after that in the second module.

210
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:26,500
All right. So cohort studies are also called longitudinal studies or follow up studies.

211
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,120
It's really funny.

212
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:35,280
At a recent meeting, friend of mine said like, well, we should do you know who's actually a very good epidemiologist longitudinal cohort study.

213
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:39,640
So I was like, Well, what other type of cohort studies are there? Which we then got kind of a good laugh at.

214
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:44,260
He's like, Well, there's those cohort studies that are actually cross-sectional and the infectious disease.

215
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:50,020
People think they're cohort studies, right? They're also called follow up studies.

216
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,480
But you don't need to see a longitudinal cohort study, right?

217
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:59,980
So study or cohort study with cohort study being kind of more the preferred term two years at this point,

218
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:04,510
they're their gold standard of observational designs.

219
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:12,040
That's because they're closest to an our however because they're an observational study.

220
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:17,889
Right. They're unlikely to have they're likely to have an unequal distribution of confounding factors.

221
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:22,930
So other risk factors or preventative factors between the exposed and the unexposed groups.

222
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:27,640
And so we have to always think about those other factors and adjust for them.

223
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,500
So here slow has some really good graphics.

224
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,990
Here's a hypothetical cohort study. So we enroll a thousand people into the cohort.

225
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:46,999
We follow them through time. Right. And then here we've got the cohort at the end of follow up 989 times that intermediate people.

226
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:56,239
Sorry. And we're losing people over time either to our daughters, our outcome of interest or because they we lose them for another reason.

227
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,470
They're lost to follow up or may have had another outcome.

228
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:03,740
All right.

229
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:12,470
So the basic cohort, analytical approach is we're going to compare the incidence in the exposed group to the incidence in the unexposed group.

230
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,790
And what you usually see is a relative risk and we'll tell you.

231
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:22,340
But of course, I would say you can and should look at the risk difference as well.

232
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:40,950
So our measures of association per cohort studies are going to be we've got our relative measures which are the cumulative incidence ratio, right?

233
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:45,780
And that's going to be per count data. And then the IDR, the incidence density.

234
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:52,240
Rate for a person time ratio per person time data.

235
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,750
And we've also got our absolute measures right,

236
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:04,780
our risk difference or an attributable risk attributable risk percent population attributable risk and population attributable risk percent.

237
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:11,710
At some point in this process, the sense cumulative incidence instead of CFR.

238
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:18,320
So if you manage to get the really older versions of the slides we first posted, you should correct that error.

239
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:26,829
So sources of data for cohort studies, we've got records that you can go to existing records, right?

240
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:34,629
So vinyl records, medical records, disease registries, occupational records, employment records.

241
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:39,250
Sometimes we can also do surveys or interviews.

242
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,690
And then of course there is direct measurement of your of your exposures and outcomes of interest.

243
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,700
All right. So that's the basic concepts around cohorts. Are there any any questions?

244
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,220
And you know,

245
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:04,370
you can always ask questions at any point because I'm actually really bad about stopping and asking questions to just shout out a question.

246
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,580
Raise your hand if you have a question. Um, all right.

247
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:15,139
Super cohort studies really can kind of divide them up into three main timelines.

248
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:19,250
I guess this is one way to put this right. We've got our prospective cohort study.

249
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,820
That's what people tend to think about when they think about cohort studies. Right.

250
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:27,570
You're going to enroll participants, then you're going to follow them for nine.

251
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:36,380
And then the exposures may or may not have already occurred before you involve people.

252
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:42,860
Retrospective cohort studies also called historical cohort studies.

253
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:50,040
Right. You're collecting data on exposures and events that have already occurred.

254
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,260
So you're looking backwards in time, right?

255
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:57,290
The time you start your study sort of identifying who's going to be in your study, everything's already happened.

256
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:05,270
And then there are directional studies which have both prospective and retrospective components.

257
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:11,720
So here just I like to say things in words and pictures differently.

258
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:19,070
Right here we've got our prospective study, which Sloan calls the Converse study that for the term prospective study.

259
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:23,420
Yes. So here the investigator begins.

260
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:32,810
Right. So going forward here in the current study or historical cohort or a retrospective cohort study.

261
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:40,640
Right. Our investigator begins the study at this point here and is going backwards in time right at the end of that time.

262
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,070
And then I having directional or a mixed design as you begin some work here.

263
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:51,710
Right. So you're looking at this kind of period that it's already happened and then moving forward in time as well.

264
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:03,080
So how do you determine what you're going to do or what determines what people do per retrospective perspective or directional?

265
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:07,550
There are a lot of issues to consider when deciding determining the type of cohort study.

266
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:14,450
There's really the research question right at the time and money that it will take to do that study.

267
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:19,220
What what study design do you think is going to be the most expensive? We will go into all of this in more detail.

268
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,450
Which of these. Anybody ever do a prospective cohort study?

269
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:31,900
Right. Because you're following people over time and then the availability of suitable study populations and records.

270
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:36,979
Right. It's hard to do a historical cohort study or a retrospective cohort study.

271
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,820
Right. If there are no records for you to go to is in fact impossible to do it in that case.

272
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:50,780
All right. All right. So our prospective cohort study, some of the advantages of these studies are you get a baseline exam.

273
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:59,840
We've got great methods for follow up and the ascertainment events are planned and implemented for the purposes of the study.

274
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:07,270
That's a big plus on the prospective study because you get to determine all of that and hopefully you do a good job of doing that.

275
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,090
But some of the and you can implement quality control measures, right, because you're controlling how the data is collected.

276
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,180
Some of the disadvantages, though,

277
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:26,570
are the amount of time it takes a really long time to do a cohort study and the high costs associated with prospective cohort studies.

278
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,030
So an example of a prospective cohort study.

279
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,290
And for all of these examples,

280
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:40,650
I'm going to try to bring in some really classic studies that I think people should all know about the Framingham Cohort Study.

281
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:50,370
So in 1948, on 5209, residents of Framingham, Massachusetts, aged 30 to 62 years, were enrolled into the study.

282
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,570
It was two thirds of the general population in that town at the time.

283
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:01,180
And then exposures and outcomes are assessed or were assessed on an ongoing basis.

284
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,270
I believe it has been done now, but Exam 32 ended in 2014.

285
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:15,390
So this is a cohort study that ran for a very long time, actually gave rise to other cohorts, which we'll talk about in a second.

286
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,650
But that's a classic example of a prospective cohort study.

287
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:29,540
So for a retrospective cohort, some of the advantages are that it's less expensive than prospective cohort studies,

288
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:37,180
and it's also going to be much less time intensive, right, because you're not waiting for events to happen.

289
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:43,670
They've all already occurred. Some of the disadvantages, though, are it's going to rely on available information.

290
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:49,230
You didn't determine how that information was collected. Right. So you might not have all the information you want.

291
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:53,500
It may not have been collected in the way that you want or the categories you want.

292
00:29:53,510 --> 00:30:01,460
Right. So you really potentially have less than ideal quality of exposure or outcome data.

293
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,880
That's why we kept the quality control checks in place.

294
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:10,710
So a classic example of a retrospective cohort study is the gas worker study.

295
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:15,360
So they used a list of all pensioners. So that's retired people, right?

296
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:23,400
Who had received 60 year who had reached 60 years of age as of 1938 or in the following ten years.

297
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:27,480
That was their their population that they were going to use.

298
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:31,710
They used the recorded date of birth, the date of entering the pension scheme,

299
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:35,940
and when applicable, the date and cause of death if that person had died.

300
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:45,690
And then they found that gas workers had 181% of the risk of developing lung cancer compared to other occupations in London.

301
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,259
So that's a prospective cohort. Sorry, a retrospective cohort study retrospective.

302
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:58,610
Right. Because we're using records. Everything has already happened at the time that we're doing it.

303
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,990
All right. So here's another more recent example.

304
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,629
We threw that quickly. And what I want you to tell me is, is it prospective or retrospective?

305
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:20,710
And what effect measure for measure of association would you be would you use for this study for the information presented here?

306
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:32,510
So what? What study design is this? Sorry.

307
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:41,390
Yep. Prospective cohort study. How do you know that? I've read for the formula and the number of kids.

308
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:48,050
Yeah. So we're talking about in certain cases, right. But it gives you the follow up time.

309
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:59,050
Right. So this is a prospective cohort study. We also don't have very good S&P data records.

310
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,170
Yeah, we know there are there aren't great S&P records.

311
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:06,900
Right. So what you're doing is only having a survey at the start of, you know, your baseline exam.

312
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:10,450
You've got a survey that assesses the S&P.

313
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:15,310
So, all right. So what's our what's our measure that we're going to be using here?

314
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,470
Actually assessing.

315
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:26,880
Mean earlier in the Kardashians lives.

316
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,820
Without having it in the direction so much of it.

317
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:38,840
Well so for directional their outcomes are also you can also go back to the records, right, so that the outcomes may have occurred.

318
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:45,850
Before people are in the study or before you've kind of before you started deciding what was right.

319
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:50,590
And in this particular case, that's that's not what is occurring a lot of times.

320
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:56,110
And that's one reason for this example, a lot of time exposures have already occurred before people involved in the study.

321
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:02,030
That does not make it a consideration. All right.

322
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,770
Our measure is going to be the IDR, right?

323
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:09,020
The incidence density. And why is that?

324
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,780
How can you tell that that would be your measure that you would be using?

325
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:29,889
Because it's got person time and in the it's like a piece of the abstract from that paper, right?

326
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:35,770
It's got person time they're going to be calculating the air could also be like a hazard ratio with.

327
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:43,210
All right, sorry, but, uh, you actually have to write.

328
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:47,710
It could be. And, you know, and I should fix this, right?

329
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:57,640
But in the, like, on the exam and stuff, we would ask you for the appropriate relative measure just to make it make it clear.

330
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:01,690
But yes, absolutely. And absolute measure can be calculated.

331
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:10,360
Although when the study was done, oh, I didn't put the year on there, it's unlikely they would actually be reporting a risk difference.

332
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,680
And I'm sure they didn't, in fact. But yeah, but that's a very good point.

333
00:35:16,180 --> 00:36:12,310
All right. What about the study? All right.

334
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:20,970
To maybe chat briefly with a neighbor about what kind of study design it is and why, how you can tell that study design it is.

335
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:30,490
Want to parents and care and explain to you, if you don't mind.

336
00:36:36,780 --> 00:37:05,090
Would that. Obviously not going to.

337
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:17,590
It's. Oh, yeah, sure.

338
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:24,140
All right. That is actually my favorite sound in the classroom. Me not speaking to you all speaking.

339
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,950
So. All right. Somebody want to tell me what type of study it is?

340
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:37,040
Those things. In retrospect, we can all just shout it out. Why?

341
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,490
Maybe this is the sort of thing where it's best to blame one person because they don't drop the violence.

342
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,970
Yeah. So we're using this registry data, right?

343
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:52,970
Like this reliance on registry data is going to tell you right away that it's a retrospective cohort study.

344
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:02,420
And what effect measure are we are we calculating here?

345
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:19,230
At least most likely. This is actually the incidence density ratio which you get from a course on regression,

346
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:25,260
but you could go back from a course on progression and deposition. So like I said, I will I will change that.

347
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,560
So I say what relative effect measure to make it a little bit clearer.

348
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:35,809
But they do tell you that they're doing this on models, but you you can get to a risk difference with that.

349
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:39,360
So. All right. So there we go.

350
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:49,230
And if we can correct those slides to put relative or we actually better yet effect measures and then we can put comment,

351
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,880
although I will say that neither of them did a risk difference in either of those papers.

352
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:57,700
But because some of you know that. The answer.

353
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:01,150
All right. So populations.

354
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:05,110
All right. So I'm thinking back to the timing. Right.

355
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:08,620
Retrospective, prospective, retrospective and bidirectional.

356
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:18,460
Knowing anything about the populations we're going to be looking at in cohort studies and we'll get through this little section.

357
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:25,570
We're going to take a break. Okay. All right. So for cohort studies, we've got an open cohort that's a cohort that is not fixed.

358
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:30,969
You have new members can be added throughout the study or at least throughout at least part of the study.

359
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:35,980
Right. A close cohort, on the other hand, is a cohort that's fixed.

360
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:42,670
Once the cohort is formed. We're not going to enroll any additional participants.

361
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:52,990
So dynamic population or that open population can be kind of artificially transformed into a fixed cohort.

362
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:56,290
A follow up information is available for for a member.

363
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:59,680
So here we've got people who are enrolled over time, all aboard.

364
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:03,550
But of course, we didn't put them as like study time point zero for them.

365
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:12,160
Right. And that's transforming it, kind of artificially transforming it into a fixed.

366
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:23,560
Cohort. An example that we could look at is the outcomes of community health studies, and that was one that was run out of them, right?

367
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:35,770
And in my field, at least, a very famous study. So we had all 8800 residents of the 2400 households in Tecumseh in 1957 were Canvased.

368
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:48,910
So they went out to each household and each of the three rounds of data collection that occurred in 1959 to 1960, 1962, 1965, and 1967 to 1969.

369
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:54,610
Interviews and medical examinations were conducted with remaining and new household residents,

370
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:05,800
yielding a total of 11,563 persons who were examined at least once and 4312 who were examined during all three rounds.

371
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:18,030
So is this an open or closed cohort? Did we enroll everybody at the beginning and then not enroll any new people?

372
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:27,100
The new people come into the study. I see lots of new people came into the study.

373
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,410
Right. Because we've got these new household residents.

374
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:35,010
So since new people came into the study what, what type of studies this open.

375
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:38,480
Yeah. Daniel like you.

376
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:44,640
All right. So the British physician study is another classic example.

377
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:52,560
But so Daniel Hill and Pettigrew, you should recognize their names, possibly from the other smoking examples.

378
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:59,340
In October 1951, the study wrote to all registered physicians in Britain.

379
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:04,739
Males and females. I like to put that in because everybody thinks of the British physician study.

380
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,650
If you've seen the publications and you think, Oh, no, wait, there's only men.

381
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,050
In fact, they did enroll women, but mostly their publications just focused on men.

382
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:21,420
So or maybe they all did, in fact, for 40,701 replied to the first survey,

383
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:29,430
and then it provided evidence that smoking cause lung cancer and a variety of other cancers actually over time.

384
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:34,050
So is this an example of an open or a closed cohort study?

385
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:38,550
So closed, right, because we reach out to them and we're just going to follow them forward.

386
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:40,920
We're not adding in new physicians.

387
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:50,550
As a side note, why why do you think they focused in on men didn't include women and most or maybe all publications I would have to look back to see.

388
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,630
Sorry. Social norms around the. There were.

389
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:04,020
That was kind of part of it. But actually there were there were very few female positions and they just kind of wanted to knock out that.

390
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:08,250
The complicating factor.

391
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,020
Right. Women probably so different and they were very unique, you know, positions.

392
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:19,020
And so you do see it. I have seen the numbers of women that were in it, sort of it exists somewhere, but but very few.

393
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:24,990
All right. Let's quickly. All right. We can have single cohorts or double cohorts.

394
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:32,060
This is something that often really confuses people about what what they're doing and whether it's a cohort or a patient study.

395
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:36,870
So a single cohort or participants are enrolled regardless of exposure status.

396
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:42,840
Right. So you go out, you decide whatever your restriction criteria are, how you're going to identify people,

397
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:47,790
maybe you randomize them, maybe it's kind of a convenient sample because you put up a flier and they come to you.

398
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:53,760
Right. But you're you're enrolling them regardless of whatever their exposure status is.

399
00:43:54,180 --> 00:44:00,900
A double cohort, on the other hand, is participants are going to be enrolled based on their exposure status.

400
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:12,499
Right. So here we have a single cohort trying to look at our core population.

401
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,190
We figure out which exposed or unexposed, and then we follow them for to their outcomes.

402
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,150
For a double cohort, we enroll people who we know are exposed.

403
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:26,059
We know enroll people who we know are unexposed, and then we follow them for 2 hours.

404
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:29,540
Desired outcome or outcome of interest.

405
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,100
So with the double cohort, we considered a stratified sampling.

406
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:47,359
It would be a yeah. Be stratifying on exposure status. So here we'd better double cohort and ascertainment as done separately in the exposed and

407
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:52,670
the other exposed groups here would make the list similar as possible if there is still.

408
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:58,420
So from school. All right.

409
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:04,420
So study populations. When we think about study populations, we want to think about them, represent such openness.

410
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:09,760
So you might want to study population that is representative of the general population.

411
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:18,429
Some examples of studies that were or were set up to be representative of the general population or at least were marketed,

412
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:21,159
I would say, as representative of the general population.

413
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:28,690
And you can argue whether or not they were are the Framingham study that becomes the study health study and the black women's health study.

414
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:33,910
Right. That's all meant to be representative of the general population.

415
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:40,459
They can also be selected based on geographic location, which is part of why the preferred engagement comes.

416
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:46,960
They could move down here then, right? Because it's one location. But the argument was that that was supposed to be like typical America, essentially.

417
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,969
And so they were wanting general. So geographic location.

418
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:57,580
So the life span study is one example of San Francisco's men health study is another

419
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:03,850
example of like limiting or selecting specific geographic locations for a reason.

420
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:10,510
Could be professional group. Right here we've got the British physician study, the nurses health study.

421
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:16,450
There are reasons why people select medical groups to do studies. And why do you think that might be?

422
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:22,880
We talked about why why would you select physicians to look at smoking it?

423
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:28,580
It's easy to find them. It's easy to find them. Right. You got a list of the people.

424
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:33,110
They're licensed, right? They're going to be a pretty broad age group.

425
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:38,120
Right. Is it but specifically medical people. Why do you think that might be done?

426
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:49,370
Well, because the individual. Huh? Well, actually, as somebody running a current cohort study that has a large population of medical workers in it,

427
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:55,220
I have to say that is slightly like we. So we have a system for getting blood samples from my study,

428
00:46:55,220 --> 00:47:01,280
which is which is actually that you can go to any of them blood draw center right and you don't need an appointment,

429
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:06,410
you just show up the orders there, you get your blood drawn usually very, very quickly.

430
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:14,480
Right. There's like 28 places you can go, however, particularly in the nurses, like they're like, well, I'm on shift.

431
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,989
Hey, could you take my blood for the study? Right.

432
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:21,200
And then just to show up and somebody is like, what? But the order was never fulfilled.

433
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,859
Where did this come from? Like, you know, so there are complications to that.

434
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:28,400
So we're hoping they're not doing their own testing. In fact, usually in a cohort study.

435
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:36,290
But there was the idea that they'd be really compliant and very good at filling out these surveys,

436
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:40,999
questionnaires and understanding, you know, the questions that are being asked.

437
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,710
And one can, you know, debate about that. But that's that's a big reason why they were selected.

438
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:54,530
But also these existing lists right then we've got high risk groups or occupational exposure.

439
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:58,130
So some classic examples of that are sex workers or minors.

440
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:03,590
These are, of course, classic examples, not the only examples.

441
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:07,100
And you can certainly move some of these. You could argue for the bonding in different groups.

442
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,690
Right, as well. All right.

443
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:19,850
So issues and selection of cohort study populations, participants in the exposed and the unexposed groups enter on the basis of self determination.

444
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:24,350
That is, they determine what they're going to be exposed to. Right. So we don't control that.

445
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:28,370
And that, of course, brings up a lot of issues around confounding.

446
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:36,590
So and then differences in the exposed in the unexposed groups other than the exposure

447
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:46,849
right can make results difficult to interpret and with that we will take a a break.

448
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:50,810
And when we come back, we're going to at least start on the in class activity.

449
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:57,649
So let's say 1125, right?

450
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:06,050
So take a break and then start on the in-class activity. And I will need to look at it again and tell you where not to go past and in class activity.

451
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:13,710
No, no. I've got it right here. Here.

452
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:25,020
I'll help you get. And, you know, I'll take the side.

453
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:57,050
So. We do.

454
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:33,090
I found scarfs everywhere. But this is just the sort of small like I said, it's a very dark clothes.

455
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:43,610
He always wears like like really light pants, super like taxes.

456
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:48,500
And if you go like young Dennis, just you go off and be like dark pants.

457
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:51,350
As they get a little older, they all go into attack.

458
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:58,760
You seem like pretty much cocky because of all this stuff, the powder coating so that you don't see it through.

459
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:02,210
Like that's a light shirt like this.

460
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:08,810
Like just graduated this one, ten year old. One suit was dark, you know, and then.

461
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:17,980
Within a few years, they had converted. From your blog.

462
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:32,870
There is one question for us. Obviously, that's what they can find out.

463
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:41,700
I didn't say they wouldn't talk. I just said we want to write something interesting.

464
00:51:53,640 --> 00:52:10,480
We could even. Really?

465
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:17,870
Everything's going to work. Over.

466
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:31,300
There. But not.

467
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:55,290
Although all is. What?

468
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:10,040
All right. We can do it here.

469
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,980
It's kind of like. But.

470
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:38,850
Candy. Yeah.

471
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:51,990
Oh. One question. Words to that effect.

472
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:59,750
Oh, yeah, that would be great.

473
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:19,210
If you do not know. I don't hear.

474
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,840
You're exactly what I need to convert to.

475
00:54:34,870 --> 00:55:01,250
That's for sure. Yeah. Yeah, but this. We concentrate.

476
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:11,520
Yeah. I like. No, I appreciate that.

477
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:18,280
But a bunch of us should be least something. Yeah.

478
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:25,080
Like that. You should do somewhere. About your questions.

479
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:32,050
So sorry. Okay. Yeah, sure. Let's.

480
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:38,380
I should probably have.

481
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:48,030
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

482
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:56,390
Mm. It can be slightly off on that. You don't want to be that way all the time and it will be all right.

483
00:55:57,970 --> 00:56:02,830
It'll be like. Because I knew I was watching you out yesterday.

484
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:06,969
Yeah, well, yeah, that's the way.

485
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:19,840
Exactly. To take it out otherwise. And I agree, like, you can be completely unfair, like in the studio, you know, that's the way it is.

486
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:34,080
But it also doesn't mean that you can see what's happening. Really representative of what he's asking for the house, which I think is wrong.

487
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:37,010
And if we're going to do something really tricky and.

488
00:56:42,010 --> 00:57:04,110
SIMON And I generally like to think that if you put it right, so I'm going to have a favorite that,

489
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:13,230
you know, every time every time I get some stuff so I can again.

490
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:20,500
Which which they tried his best was actually.

491
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:34,270
I like this train, but it's so much faster.

492
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:44,900
So now I'm going to students. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

493
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:50,940
And a lot of the problems are abstract. And you see them and I.

494
00:57:52,820 --> 00:58:00,980
Let's make it simple, Aristotle, but especially when they say let's figure out how to write it.

495
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:07,060
So. It's.

496
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:13,380
But that's a massive a massive timesaver. Right.

497
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:20,960
You know, although some of us. Stuff like that's actually not.

498
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:31,480
Yeah. People about I mean, they should be thinking about how to do it conditionally for everything from the like.

499
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:39,760
And I also think. We're talking.

500
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:53,360
Stuff like that. I used to really like.

501
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,570
It's fun. Did you see your friend? Yeah.

502
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:04,850
They used to be pretty fashionable, but, like, when I first began to look for hair.

503
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:20,180
I know. Yeah.

504
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:28,460
They work every day.

505
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:34,010
I don't. I.

506
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:43,600
Because it's better to, you know, pay them for those hours on, say, the course.

507
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:52,220
Yeah. And then students like. Yes, they're very.

508
00:59:53,630 --> 01:00:01,170
For her. I think that it was really.

509
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:12,880
Yeah. No, I mean, that doesn't happen either.

510
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,100
Peter Jennings.

511
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:48,220
I would say to go up through actually you can go through the whole thing, but try to try to get at least in through D or E before we start back up.

512
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:53,490
We'll see how time goes. If we have enough time to go over this, we will. And otherwise it'll be online.

513
01:00:57,230 --> 01:03:22,970
Yeah. For. I drive.

514
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:35,440
Oh. Oh. I thought there was a camera out there.

515
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:44,710
So that's there is a trick there.

516
01:03:49,100 --> 01:04:46,850
Yeah. There are these all purpose disinfecting wipes.

517
01:04:48,720 --> 01:05:36,810
Yeah. Jill, who was in the class last year, was into my reading and it was like.

518
01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:51,880
So did you want to talk to him about European?

519
01:05:53,710 --> 01:06:06,390
Surely the. Okay.

520
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:14,659
I mean, you know, yeah, I was sitting there stressing for a bit and like I told you this, right, like I tried to record it.

521
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:18,940
Remember every passing response, I actually pass it. It wasn't.

522
01:06:20,077 --> 01:06:23,647
I think both of us will get longer by exam two is what you're going through.

523
01:06:23,827 --> 01:06:29,677
I think the highlight and note on the side is what's the problem or the question I'm trying to answer?

524
01:06:30,097 --> 01:06:34,237
What study type business? Who is the population?

525
01:06:34,267 --> 01:06:38,227
How do they recruit them? And then what's your alcohol level?

526
01:06:38,247 --> 01:06:44,437
What's your exposure? And how do they measure those? Later on, we'll go on to the validity of those and other stuff.

527
01:06:44,437 --> 01:06:48,336
So like assume, but why don't you know these there's a lot of assumptions you can make along the way.

528
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:51,247
Don't make picking out the information you need it a lot easier.

529
01:06:52,567 --> 01:06:55,837
And you should practice doing that of course, because you need to be able to read that.

530
01:06:55,837 --> 01:06:59,826
You don't have to read something 20 times to pull out that information.

531
01:06:59,827 --> 01:07:03,127
Right? Like both on exams and in real life, in fact.

532
01:07:03,607 --> 01:07:08,227
Right. So you you don't want to have to constantly be going back through and scanning the entire paper.

533
01:07:08,737 --> 01:07:17,136
Okay. So I told you I was not not going to go over this and I'm not going to go to this right now.

534
01:07:17,137 --> 01:07:23,107
I suspect we'll run out of time. But but just in case, I want to go over one on one answer really quickly,

535
01:07:23,557 --> 01:07:29,287
because sometimes people do it in class, but the really good about it, they don't go look at the key.

536
01:07:29,887 --> 01:07:37,987
If we don't, you know, if they up I got that you know so just to get make sure you understand like the level of detail that we are looking for,

537
01:07:38,197 --> 01:07:44,047
we're going to choose question sheet. So what was the exposure and how and how was subjects classified?

538
01:07:44,047 --> 01:07:46,357
Was exposure fixed or time varying?

539
01:07:47,257 --> 01:07:52,717
So here's the official answer that he or she doesn't have to sell exactly like that, but you need to pick up the same key points.

540
01:07:53,317 --> 01:07:56,677
So the exposure was postmenopausal. Unopposed.

541
01:07:56,677 --> 01:08:00,066
Oral conjugated estrogen use. Yes. No.

542
01:08:00,067 --> 01:08:08,287
And duration. Right. If you just write estrogen use, you're like that is not going to get you full credit on the exams,

543
01:08:08,587 --> 01:08:16,557
nor will that really be useful to you when you are reading a few papers and trying to compare different studies later on.

544
01:08:16,567 --> 01:08:20,767
Right. And it was measured using males questionnaires.

545
01:08:20,767 --> 01:08:29,586
It was treated as time varying because the subsequent questionnaires sent every two years to starting the exposure status for each participant person.

546
01:08:29,587 --> 01:08:32,377
Months were allocated to the categories of estrogen use,

547
01:08:32,377 --> 01:08:40,327
according to the data reported in 1976 and updated at each two year interval, according to the information obtained subsequently.

548
01:08:42,427 --> 01:08:46,627
That's what we're looking for. Right. So like a lot of detail.

549
01:08:46,627 --> 01:08:50,157
So people often say, like, how could this activity take that long? I was done like that.

550
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:56,797
Right. In fact, there's a lot of detail in these answers. We want you to be exact, you know, particularly around outcomes and exposures.

551
01:08:56,797 --> 01:09:02,407
So make sure you practice doing that and that you do look at these keys if we do not have time to go over them a lot.

552
01:09:05,197 --> 01:09:09,247
All right. So challenges in cohort studies.

553
01:09:10,867 --> 01:09:16,807
We're going over each of these in detail. Right. But lost of all missing data, the time to conduct a study,

554
01:09:17,407 --> 01:09:24,097
it's really not great if you need an immediate answer to two relatively recent examples are Zika and SARS-CoV-2.

555
01:09:24,127 --> 01:09:30,217
Right? We have an ongoing epidemic or pandemic. You don't want to enroll people in wait five years to get your answers right.

556
01:09:31,357 --> 01:09:36,637
There are inefficient career outcomes. You just need a really large study.

557
01:09:38,677 --> 01:09:42,637
It's difficult or can be difficult to expert to classify exposure.

558
01:09:42,907 --> 01:09:48,937
I would say that's kind of a champagne or a luxury problem actually, but it can be really complicated just to do that.

559
01:09:50,557 --> 01:09:55,897
The expense, right. It particularly if they're prospective cohort studies, they're going to be more expensive to do.

560
01:09:56,977 --> 01:10:03,967
And then relying on existing data if they're retrospective study is right because that has its limitations.

561
01:10:04,687 --> 01:10:11,016
Okay. So for lost of all, the lost of old is usually a major issue in prospective cohort studies.

562
01:10:11,017 --> 01:10:17,017
Of course, the longer your cohort study goes on, the greater the issue of after follow up tends to be.

563
01:10:18,097 --> 01:10:23,437
It can lead to bias, loss of power and issues and generalizability.

564
01:10:23,977 --> 01:10:30,367
Right. Because people will you will not lose people equally across all different kind of categories, etc.

565
01:10:30,367 --> 01:10:42,487
Right. Or likely will not reasons for lost of all for or people may no longer wish to participate or you may not be able to locate them.

566
01:10:42,847 --> 01:10:46,566
Right? So they come in and tell you I'm out of here or you just got to contact them.

567
01:10:46,567 --> 01:10:50,617
They respond to contact. Yeah, they don't respond. Or you even drop by their house, right?

568
01:10:50,647 --> 01:10:54,337
Depending on your study set up and find out that they're not there.

569
01:10:54,907 --> 01:10:59,556
Nobody knows when they were there last, you know. So you don't really know where they've moved to.

570
01:10:59,557 --> 01:11:07,987
And when they stopped participating in the study. Some strategies to minimize loss before or during enrollment.

571
01:11:07,987 --> 01:11:14,047
There are things you can do so you can exclude those that you think are likely to leave the study.

572
01:11:15,517 --> 01:11:22,807
That could be people planning to move or who have uncertainty around a willingness to return.

573
01:11:23,277 --> 01:11:27,037
You know, you could ask them, are you are you sure that you be willing to come back?

574
01:11:27,037 --> 01:11:31,677
This is a commitment to the study. And if there are if they waver too much.

575
01:11:31,837 --> 01:11:36,007
Yeah. I mean, yeah, you know, you could exclude them based on that.

576
01:11:37,897 --> 01:11:41,917
There are obviously are concerns around excluding people, too, for generalizability.

577
01:11:41,917 --> 01:11:47,587
Right. But you can also obtain information to allow for future tracking.

578
01:11:48,247 --> 01:11:55,207
So contact information is a subject, of course, but you might want contact information for a family member or a close friend.

579
01:11:55,477 --> 01:12:02,677
Hey, if we can't get a hold of you, is there somebody that we could contact to ask about your current address or phone number,

580
01:12:02,917 --> 01:12:07,297
or at least to let you know that we are looking for you? So you hopefully contact us back.

581
01:12:09,457 --> 01:12:17,077
You can also do things during follow up. So really periodic contact with subjects is really important, right?

582
01:12:17,347 --> 01:12:27,547
So remind them they're in this study to check on where they're at so you can use mailings, emails, phone calls, home visits, right.

583
01:12:27,757 --> 01:12:32,466
To periodically check on them, make sure they're still in the study,

584
01:12:32,467 --> 01:12:36,277
and then be sure that they feel like they're really participating in the same involved.

585
01:12:36,277 --> 01:12:43,567
You're going to be less, much less likely to lose those participants. You can also do follow up measures as well.

586
01:12:45,777 --> 01:12:53,157
So this. What situation would.

587
01:12:55,257 --> 01:12:58,447
This analysis. First cohort study because.

588
01:12:59,547 --> 01:13:02,827
Systematically taking out people. This surveillance.

589
01:13:04,147 --> 01:13:08,917
Not a good idea. Yeah.

590
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:12,066
So yeah systematically we're moving with our we don't have complete data.

591
01:13:12,067 --> 01:13:16,357
I'm going to drop them. Right. Like there's massive issues around that. We'll talk about that a little bit more later.

592
01:13:16,357 --> 01:13:19,477
In class, obviously, you can impute the missing data.

593
01:13:19,807 --> 01:13:23,977
Another thing that people often do is look at and this is like a standard thing, right?

594
01:13:23,977 --> 01:13:30,217
You look at who stayed in the cohort and who left the cohort and look for systematic differences between those two populations.

595
01:13:31,027 --> 01:13:34,207
That may just be something you then discuss in the discussion and say like, Hey,

596
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:38,616
but we might be underestimating or overestimating because those we lost for follow

597
01:13:38,617 --> 01:13:42,547
up differed in these important ways from those individuals who stayed in the study.

598
01:13:45,677 --> 01:13:51,767
I have a question. If we do, the exclusion is exclude those who are likely to be lost.

599
01:13:52,187 --> 01:14:00,177
So if they are planning to move or they move often, are we kind of exclude some part of the population that they might have a special condition,

600
01:14:00,207 --> 01:14:05,446
say, if they're in a more important economic condition instead of making a contribution?

601
01:14:05,447 --> 01:14:09,077
That's representative. Yeah. So that's always going to be an issue, right?

602
01:14:09,087 --> 01:14:12,257
So the question was around like excluding certain populations,

603
01:14:12,257 --> 01:14:19,007
if we exclude people we think are much more likely to move along or even to have difficulty coming back in for follow up appointments.

604
01:14:19,367 --> 01:14:25,907
Right. Are we then reducing generalizability and specifically excluding important segments of the population?

605
01:14:26,627 --> 01:14:33,737
The answer is yes. Sometimes we are. So you really want to think about that and see if you can come up with another manner to deal with the problem.

606
01:14:33,947 --> 01:14:42,077
One example is if you think that people are going to have difficulty coming back in for the follow up appointments because of job,

607
01:14:43,037 --> 01:14:48,167
you know, like work loss, right? Because they're and how do they play, for example, or transport.

608
01:14:48,497 --> 01:14:51,867
Right. You can pay them per permission to come in.

609
01:14:52,547 --> 01:14:56,506
Of course, you don't want to make it so much that it compels them to be in the study.

610
01:14:56,507 --> 01:15:00,017
Right. But you could you before you just exclude them.

611
01:15:00,617 --> 01:15:04,816
Right. What you're first going to want to try to do is see like, is there another solution?

612
01:15:04,817 --> 01:15:10,697
I can come up with that in order to keep these people in the in the study.

613
01:15:10,877 --> 01:15:18,367
We've don't exclude on other things. We don't even like sometimes people don't think about, you know, so they'll do like, you know, cell phone, right?

614
01:15:18,407 --> 01:15:22,187
Cell phone registries and random digit dialing and stuff like that.

615
01:15:22,367 --> 01:15:25,297
Of course, you're excluding everybody who doesn't have a phone. Right?

616
01:15:25,307 --> 01:15:31,617
Or you might be excluding people in this area that are recently moved into the Hanover area because they have some other zip,

617
01:15:31,667 --> 01:15:34,547
you know, other area code. Right. And you're not going to pick them up.

618
01:15:35,267 --> 01:15:43,547
So you really have to think when you're enrolling about who you may intentionally or unintentionally be, excluding from your study,

619
01:15:44,657 --> 01:15:51,437
what the results of that will be on your on your study potentially, and how that might impact generalizability.

620
01:15:51,437 --> 01:15:56,537
And then really think about how you could be more, uh, more inclusive, like include more individuals.

621
01:15:56,717 --> 01:15:58,957
And sometimes it's just not possible, right?

622
01:16:00,227 --> 01:16:04,757
You'll be like, Yep, I could go to the door, then I could like get a whole list of everybody in Ann Arbor,

623
01:16:04,757 --> 01:16:08,087
and then I could, like, randomly select off of that list, and that would be preferable.

624
01:16:08,657 --> 01:16:13,486
But of course, that's going to be much more expensive. And you still won't catch everybody at home.

625
01:16:13,487 --> 01:16:15,647
And there's all sorts of other complications for that.

626
01:16:17,147 --> 01:16:23,927
But thinking through it and discussing it, you know, like at the time that you're setting up the study is incredibly important.

627
01:16:24,167 --> 01:16:29,507
And then as well, when you're analyzing the data, thinking about your results and explaining any any caveats,

628
01:16:30,647 --> 01:16:35,807
potential biases, a friend of mine likes to say frailties of the study, which I kind of like that term.

629
01:16:36,197 --> 01:16:40,217
Right? Limitations, right. Okay.

630
01:16:41,687 --> 01:16:48,047
So here's a cohort study and it's an example to show why the words, in fact, can be so challenging to conduct.

631
01:16:48,647 --> 01:16:54,377
So here we have dietary vitamin D supplementation is associated with reduced risk of type one diabetes in animals.

632
01:16:55,157 --> 01:16:57,197
So they're kind of telling you why they think this might be the case.

633
01:16:57,217 --> 01:17:08,207
You know, starting off, our aim was to ascertain whether or not vitamin D supplementation or deficiency could affect development of type one diabetes.

634
01:17:08,807 --> 01:17:19,387
Okay. A birth cohort was shocking with all pregnant women, 12,035 in northern Finland who were due to give birth in 1966.

635
01:17:19,447 --> 01:17:24,556
Four and more data was collected in the first year of life about the frequency

636
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:30,017
and dose of vitamin D supplementation and the presence of suspected rickets.

637
01:17:31,667 --> 01:17:38,207
Our primary outcome measure was the diagnosis of Type one diabetes by the end of December 1997.

638
01:17:38,777 --> 01:17:46,187
Look at that time difference right there, collecting information, 1966, 1967.

639
01:17:47,277 --> 01:17:52,127
You think about vitamin C, maybe 1968 a little bit, you know, first year of life for these infants.

640
01:17:52,517 --> 01:17:58,457
And then it's basically kind of shoved away. Maybe it was used for something else as well, that this was just one aspect of this cohort.

641
01:17:58,457 --> 01:18:02,386
Right. And then you look at it many years later, right?

642
01:18:02,387 --> 01:18:12,737
So this is 31 years to conduct this cohort study to answer this question, why do you think we didn't use a retrospective design or they didn't?

643
01:18:19,557 --> 01:18:28,467
Sorry. Recall. So. Well, I'd also like to ask you to raise your hand if your mom supplemented vitamin D during the first year of your life.

644
01:18:30,537 --> 01:18:36,507
Raise your hand if your mom did not. Raise your hand if you have no idea what your mom did.

645
01:18:36,987 --> 01:18:40,267
Right. There you go. So that's the other issue here.

646
01:18:40,287 --> 01:18:43,676
Obviously, you're not going to know what your exposure was. Right.

647
01:18:43,677 --> 01:18:45,597
And your mom might not remember it either.

648
01:18:45,627 --> 01:18:53,967
So, yeah, there are certain questions where a cohort designed, you know, prospective cohort design may really be the only alternative.

649
01:18:54,147 --> 01:19:00,867
There's also you could do a randomized controlled trial, although we know that vitamin D supplementation is good for a variety of things.

650
01:19:01,197 --> 01:19:07,166
So we wouldn't really want to randomize young children to not receive vitamin D supplementation.

651
01:19:07,167 --> 01:19:11,787
Right. Because we know we would be randomizing them to ill to bad outcomes.

652
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:19,107
And here we're postulating that it is favorable. So this is definitely something we're not going to randomize on.

653
01:19:19,767 --> 01:19:29,247
All right. So here's just like the birth control, the birth cohort, vitamin D supplementation and.

654
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:33,987
You can see if they did a relative risk here and adjusted relative risk.

655
01:19:34,797 --> 01:19:42,407
And you see a big benefit for use of vitamin D supplements, whether they used.

656
01:19:44,367 --> 01:19:44,657
Right.

657
01:19:45,867 --> 01:19:52,917
So this is really this example, I would say, really highlighting a massive strength of cohort studies because we can look at stuff like this, right,

658
01:19:53,607 --> 01:20:00,567
as well as a huge weakness because of the amount of time required to conduct this study using this design,

659
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:04,797
although in this case, we think it's probably the only feasible way to do the study.

660
01:20:04,797 --> 01:20:11,057
Right. So there you go. All right.

661
01:20:11,657 --> 01:20:15,707
So some of we're talking about some of the strengths and utility of cohort studies.

662
01:20:16,337 --> 01:20:22,847
So some of the strengths of cohort studies are temporality. We know the extra exposure preceded the disease.

663
01:20:23,297 --> 01:20:30,136
Right. Because we're not enrolling people after they already have the disease. And so and so, yeah.

664
01:20:30,137 --> 01:20:32,567
Because exposure status is measured before disease. Right.

665
01:20:33,947 --> 01:20:39,137
We know that the disease status does not influence the amount of error with which the exposure was measured.

666
01:20:39,527 --> 01:20:46,246
And once again, that's because the exposure status is measured before the disease and that the disease status does not

667
01:20:46,247 --> 01:20:52,187
generally influence the selection of subjects because subjects are selected before disease develops.

668
01:20:52,187 --> 01:20:56,687
Right. It is the word generally.

669
01:20:56,687 --> 01:20:59,687
Of course, you can always think of examples where that isn't the case,

670
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:07,787
particularly if you've got some kind of preclinical effect from the disease or early clinical that

671
01:21:07,787 --> 01:21:12,127
may not be picked up and that might impact whether or not people are selected or not into the study.

672
01:21:12,137 --> 01:21:16,427
But you can study multiple outcomes and exposures.

673
01:21:17,687 --> 01:21:27,197
So multiple health outcomes, multiple exposures, exposures that change over time, outcomes that may be identified after the start of the study.

674
01:21:27,367 --> 01:21:30,407
Right. You can add outcomes on which is great.

675
01:21:30,977 --> 01:21:34,216
So some examples of this, we're going to go back to that Framingham study.

676
01:21:34,217 --> 01:21:38,117
So the Framingham Heart Study, multiple outcomes, multiple exposures.

677
01:21:38,507 --> 01:21:45,827
So they looked to found that cigaret smoking when exposure increases the risk of heart disease that increased cholesterol,

678
01:21:46,037 --> 01:21:52,397
another exposure and elevated blood pressure another exposure increased the risk of heart disease exercise.

679
01:21:52,877 --> 01:21:58,307
Yet another exposure decreases the risk of heart disease and obesity increases it.

680
01:21:58,697 --> 01:22:01,877
So if you then got the same outcome, looking at a bunch of different exposures,

681
01:22:01,877 --> 01:22:08,897
rate elevated blood pressure increases the risk of stroke with no switch to a different outcome.

682
01:22:09,317 --> 01:22:17,717
Right. In women who are post-menopausal, you know, exposure here, risk of heart disease has increased compared with women who are premenopausal.

683
01:22:18,887 --> 01:22:21,737
And then psychosocial factors affect the risk of heart disease.

684
01:22:22,157 --> 01:22:26,507
Probably they were not really looking at psychosocial factors when they started this study.

685
01:22:26,507 --> 01:22:29,267
Right. So that's something added on later on.

686
01:22:30,107 --> 01:22:37,067
So Framingham Study is a really great example of studying multiple exposures, multiple outcomes over time.

687
01:22:39,467 --> 01:22:47,567
Utility of cohort study. So tracking the occurrence of disease, describing the prognosis of disease, finding risk factors of disease.

688
01:22:47,567 --> 01:22:50,977
People don't necessarily leave the cohort when they get the disease of interest, right.

689
01:22:50,987 --> 01:22:55,007
So there's a lot you can do. Evaluation, evolution, story of cohorts.

690
01:22:55,007 --> 01:22:58,097
Over time, they may change over time. What they're focusing on.

691
01:22:59,477 --> 01:23:07,877
And you know, both as we get interested in new exposures we build up knowledge you outcomes may be and as methods evolve as well.

692
01:23:10,697 --> 01:23:17,237
And they're great to use that to study if a rare exposure happens to a group of people, go through some examples of that.

693
01:23:17,867 --> 01:23:24,137
So the Framingham Heart Study has looked at risk factors, prognostic factors, done, preventative models.

694
01:23:24,977 --> 01:23:31,247
We threw all of these for you, but obviously a lot of different uses for that cohort study.

695
01:23:32,797 --> 01:23:36,317
And also great example of asking various types of questions.

696
01:23:37,937 --> 01:23:48,287
The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study or Max was implemented in 1984 and 1985 as a prospective study of 4954 homosexual

697
01:23:48,287 --> 01:23:54,977
men in four studies in four city study participants are examined and provide blood samples every six months,

698
01:23:55,337 --> 01:24:00,257
and seroconversion onset of AIDS and death have been closely tracked in that study,

699
01:24:00,787 --> 01:24:05,027
initially established to characterize risk factors for in the natural history of AIDS.

700
01:24:05,447 --> 01:24:08,747
Right. And it was because they didn't know how it was transmitting.

701
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:12,377
Right. And there were no treatments available at the time.

702
01:24:12,377 --> 01:24:19,297
Right. So that's that's what we're doing now for history has also provided information on the effects of therapeutic interventions, right.

703
01:24:19,397 --> 01:24:23,867
As those became available and reductions in high risk behavior.

704
01:24:24,257 --> 01:24:26,867
Right. How to how to put in interventions for that.

705
01:24:28,217 --> 01:24:36,647
So Max is a good example of a cohort that's evolved over time as there was additional knowledge that came into place.

706
01:24:38,867 --> 01:24:46,246
So with cohorts, one things you can do is you can do one of the things is problems like you enroll in Cohort II over here,

707
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:52,247
people like I did publications. You started less than two years ago when we started enrolling people.

708
01:24:52,247 --> 01:24:58,146
Then they have to do with the outcome or we do have the publications, but they're like, Where are the big AP papers?

709
01:24:58,147 --> 01:25:03,317
You take some time. Either one of the things you can do here, which always is to do cross-sectional analysis, right?

710
01:25:03,587 --> 01:25:08,987
And so this is an example of using that back study where they did a cross-sectional analysis at the beginning.

711
01:25:09,557 --> 01:25:16,247
To look at risk factors or for being zero positive at enrollment.

712
01:25:20,777 --> 01:25:24,976
And here for the same study over time.

713
01:25:24,977 --> 01:25:31,007
How computers are evolving. The statistical methods are evolving.

714
01:25:31,007 --> 01:25:34,066
Right? So here comes cosine regression. Right.

715
01:25:34,067 --> 01:25:38,657
And they can start to ask different, different questions.

716
01:25:38,657 --> 01:25:43,367
Right? Because the study, the methods have evolved and the study has accumulated data at this time.

717
01:25:43,367 --> 01:25:49,477
Right. So we can start looking at. Exposures over time.

718
01:25:50,047 --> 01:26:01,266
All right. And then here just to show you for the same study that the findings expanded as the data accrued and methods of.

719
01:26:01,267 --> 01:26:02,316
All right.

720
01:26:02,317 --> 01:26:09,937
So they have the aims over here to determine the prevalence of infection here, higher prevalence rate, logistic regression, fairly simple method.

721
01:26:11,257 --> 01:26:17,707
And you're doing here's the publication from this and this is over time just kind of this is a paper that

722
01:26:17,707 --> 01:26:23,137
goes over all the all the findings up until that point from this study and how things evolve over time.

723
01:26:23,917 --> 01:26:29,977
But anyways, data accumulating, questions changing slightly, methods evolving.

724
01:26:33,037 --> 01:26:37,567
So some of the subsequent findings for that study are the incubation period of HIV as characters.

725
01:26:38,047 --> 01:26:42,207
I think I've already highlighted this before, but you don't have to memorize this kind of stuff.

726
01:26:42,217 --> 01:26:49,417
I'm just like trying to in part highlight what I impart some knowledge about some of these classic studies,

727
01:26:50,167 --> 01:26:56,377
but also like the idea that these cohort cohort studies can answer a huge number of questions.

728
01:26:56,377 --> 01:27:00,067
Right? So these are some of their important findings for subsequent findings.

729
01:27:00,367 --> 01:27:04,987
Incubation period of HIV was characterized or I think that's that natural history piece,

730
01:27:05,347 --> 01:27:10,537
the rate rates of CD4 cell decrease and predictors of rapid, rapid decline.

731
01:27:11,707 --> 01:27:17,887
So what causes your TB support cells? Keep looking for cells which are T cells to tend to climb rapidly.

732
01:27:18,607 --> 01:27:24,127
And how to predict that viral load is a key determinant of CD4 cell count decrease.

733
01:27:24,607 --> 01:27:29,407
Uh. Social Determinants of prognosis pregnancies. Effects of AIDS treatments.

734
01:27:32,677 --> 01:27:37,476
All right. So other ways cohorts can evolve over time.

735
01:27:37,477 --> 01:27:43,207
Generations are framing the original Framingham Cohort Study that we had the Framingham offspring, right?

736
01:27:43,207 --> 01:27:51,457
So older children, then Framingham generation three and then the family heart study was actually enrolling spouses.

737
01:27:51,457 --> 01:27:56,646
I believe the kids, although I'm trying to think of how it was it was actually kind of went out.

738
01:27:56,647 --> 01:28:01,716
Right but evolution of a study. Right and we have these generations of Framingham.

739
01:28:01,717 --> 01:28:07,207
You can start to look at genetic factors in detail because you've got the the original enrollees,

740
01:28:07,207 --> 01:28:16,877
then their children and then their children's children. Radiation effects research.

741
01:28:17,237 --> 01:28:22,787
So atomic bomb survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki investigated the effects of ionizing radiation.

742
01:28:22,997 --> 01:28:27,767
This is one of those things where you have a rare exposure happen to a group of people.

743
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:35,477
We got 4 minutes. So radiation effects research.

744
01:28:37,007 --> 01:28:45,996
Basically, the idea is it started right away. There were a number of studies that were put into place to look at the effects on their children,

745
01:28:45,997 --> 01:28:52,667
on the effects on their children, both the ones that were in utero at the time and then future kids.

746
01:28:52,667 --> 01:28:55,937
Right, James, are different questions.

747
01:28:55,937 --> 01:28:59,237
So multiple cohort studies were were established.

748
01:29:01,037 --> 01:29:04,366
They they have several important findings. Right.

749
01:29:04,367 --> 01:29:11,477
So mortality studies that those directly exposed to atomic bombs and those exposed in utero and the children of A-bomb,

750
01:29:11,627 --> 01:29:18,866
survivors of the studies that were that were put into place, reconstruction of radiation doses.

751
01:29:18,867 --> 01:29:22,666
So this commentary so to really set the standards for what is is and is an

752
01:29:22,667 --> 01:29:28,847
okay characterize physical risk of radiation exposure leukemia solid cancers.

753
01:29:29,657 --> 01:29:33,707
They also detected no genetic defects in children of A-bomb survivors.

754
01:29:34,097 --> 01:29:37,907
Right. So that wasn't then passed on if they weren't already in utero at the time.

755
01:29:38,657 --> 01:29:48,917
Okay. Um, so analytic methods, um, so analytical methods for cohort studies with that focus on regression.

756
01:29:48,917 --> 01:29:55,277
Cox Proportional hazards model, you can do a quick tox model time to kind of course model for logistic regression.

757
01:29:56,467 --> 01:30:00,617
You should know these exist. You're not going to get tested on any of these methods in this class.

758
01:30:02,207 --> 01:30:05,537
So for Poisson, what we might ask you a few basic questions.

759
01:30:05,867 --> 01:30:10,017
I should revise that. We may ask you some basic questions on it.

760
01:30:10,037 --> 01:30:14,117
So basically you need to know the information that are on these slides here.

761
01:30:14,807 --> 01:30:21,886
So of course, on regression used to model count variables, it's a multiple of regression analysis typically used when the desired outcome

762
01:30:21,887 --> 01:30:27,557
variable is a rate or a rate ratio assumes that observations are not related.

763
01:30:28,967 --> 01:30:31,307
You can use force on distribution on other models.

764
01:30:31,307 --> 01:30:38,327
So generalizing estimating equations for example, the of which I'm distribution also called a log linear model.

765
01:30:39,647 --> 01:30:44,177
COX Proportional hazards. It's a standardized approach for survival analysis.

766
01:30:44,507 --> 01:30:46,277
You should be getting these in your bio stats.

767
01:30:46,277 --> 01:30:55,037
Classes, of course, are extensions of the models to exist, such as the grouped Cox model, and that's used when exact time points are unknown.

768
01:30:55,817 --> 01:31:08,386
So if you have interval data and there's the time dependent Cox model for time dependent covariance, this will be the last slide for today.

769
01:31:08,387 --> 01:31:10,517
I'll go over the reporting standards next time.

770
01:31:10,757 --> 01:31:19,787
So pooled logistic regression that assumes longitudinal data has repeated measures on risk factors of various interval times right on your device,

771
01:31:19,787 --> 01:31:26,807
the repeat measures into equally spaced intervals and then pulls the number of subjects at each risk at each time point,

772
01:31:27,467 --> 01:31:32,427
the number of events of interest are pooled. In order to examine a particular endpoint of interest rate,

773
01:31:32,447 --> 01:31:38,926
we need these different methods for cohort studies because we're getting more like we're following people over time, right?

774
01:31:38,927 --> 01:31:43,637
We're getting multiple measurements over that time and of course you need to incorporate all of that information.

775
01:31:46,787 --> 01:31:51,316
So and with that, we will end for today.

776
01:31:51,317 --> 01:31:57,137
I can stick around for a few minutes if there's any questions and we'll see you on Tuesday.
