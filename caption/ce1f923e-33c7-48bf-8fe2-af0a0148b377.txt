1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:16,919
No know would believe that it's a big of A because they know that they're doing so well that I got to tell you,

2
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,860
like doze off for like a minute, you know?

3
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:28,280
And so I don't know what you do in lectures.

4
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:41,400
I'm wondering if you have any problems about any of the projects.

5
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,300
I don't. I'm like in coffee with like 15 or 20 years.

6
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:56,510
Oh, okay. So maybe we can just get started on logistics and questions and such.

7
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,580
Okay, we will be here and it's not a problem.

8
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:13,830
So the homework is going to be posted later today. The first time we've said it, it'll be due in two weeks should be self-explanatory.

9
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,979
There's a data set that when your SO you go to the homework schedule and that's where you'll find all the information.

10
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,879
You'll be able to download the homework problem set as well as the A's.

11
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,630
That is that's going to be for the homework.

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,270
It's a covered data set basically in advance.

13
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,430
So in the US since beginning of the pandemic.

14
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:50,890
So a lot of the questions this last on the evaluation was around classification.

15
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:59,830
And there is there is some confusion about either where their pathogens could be or infectious needs to be in two different categories,

16
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,360
which is is true.

17
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,530
And a little bit of confusion of something like norovirus, is it directly transmitted or is it fomite transmitted or is it waterborne?

18
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:16,780
And actually, it's all of the above. I'll probably try and provide some more clarity in these lecture slides, continue to go over.

19
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:25,450
But there are different ways that we talked about classifying infectious diseases.

20
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:30,339
We talked about taxonomy and a lot of people use that, you know, is it a virus?

21
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:36,549
Is the bacteria protozoa? We talked about a pathway of transmission,

22
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:44,740
and that's a lot of what we're focused on when we say waterborne or foodborne may say direct sexually transmitted,

23
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,070
that's a pathway that's also the route of transmission.

24
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:55,630
So respiratory would be the routing routing transmission so that COVID is a respiratory disease,

25
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:02,410
but it could be transmitted through airborne, it could be transmitted through droplet.

26
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:10,030
And, you know, potentially even, oh, my norovirus is a fecal oral pathogen.

27
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:17,970
So that's the route of transmission. But it can be transmitted, it could be waterborne, could be foodborne.

28
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:28,630
And usually it's contaminated water that contaminates food like raspberries or shellfish or or oysters and then that.

29
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,170
So you wind up ingesting a food and they call it a foodborne outbreak,

30
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:39,459
but it's through water contamination and also fomite transmitted because norovirus can last a long time.

31
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,510
So all the cruise ship outbreaks are all about this fomite transmission.

32
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,320
Any questions on? More questions on.

33
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,450
How things are. Classified in that category.

34
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,740
So you're going to see less.

35
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:07,879
Especially online and in different areas that are going to be inconsistent with what may be a list that you're seeing on this lecture slide.

36
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:16,180
And that's just due to the fuzziness of how we characterize that next disease.

37
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,490
And in fact, it's, you know, the direct. The direct.

38
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:28,430
Classification here was directly transmitted as viewed as STDs or would be classically directly transmitted.

39
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:40,150
That is really close. Contact is needed and the only way most of the attitudes are transmitted by for all the others, that's not true.

40
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,670
So measles is often directly transmitted, but measles is aerosolized.

41
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,020
And so let's say here is here.

42
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,950
And so there is this environmental transmission aspect of it.

43
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,870
And that is important.

44
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:13,100
And it depends on your perspective of whether or not you're thinking you're thinking about control or thinking about different environments, right?

45
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,300
Like you could be thinking about large scale environments like water and food

46
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,790
actually said you could actually just switch to a different source and switch back.

47
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,870
Okay. Which states do you mind? Yeah, probably you should.

48
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:40,940
Thank you. You're welcome. And so often it makes more sense to talk about measles directly transmitted.

49
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:46,610
Very seldom do we deal with the environmental aspect of measles.

50
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,469
So it's almost always directly transmit considered, directly transmitted.

51
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:57,950
But things like influenza, where we are, we're thinking about ventilation systems,

52
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:05,250
we're thinking about masking, we're thinking about a lot of environmental interventions there.

53
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:16,220
There influenza can be classified in some in some sites as direct, but also as environmental we transmit it to.

54
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:30,079
Hopefully that I've clarified the lack of clarity in the way in which people deal with these effects, these systems, but nonetheless.

55
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:40,620
So this is going to try and run through these next few slides quickly so I can make sure we can get into the measures section.

56
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:48,390
So here we are. We differentiate column one direct column to indirect.

57
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:54,910
And what is indirect. Indirect means either a factor is Quito Tech.

58
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:06,300
I'm going to use now considered a vector or sometimes it's considered an intermediate host could be water or a vehicle which is going to be water.

59
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,230
So it's some sort of environmental media.

60
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:20,430
Air would be a vehicle that we've got column, one direct column to interact and then we've got direct environmental exposure,

61
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:29,160
anthropogenic anthro anodic infection and zoonotic infection and zoonotic infection.

62
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,010
In this category, categorization is very humans are dead end hosts.

63
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,440
So and what I think there was a question about that so a dead end and host means what?

64
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:47,249
It means that the dead end host an escape that humans cannot be infectious so their

65
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:54,600
viral level in wherever in their body is not high enough to actually be infectious.

66
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:03,690
But they can get infected, they can get disease. So what zoonotic infections where and humans are dead and host means there's other

67
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:09,690
animals that are part of the transmission system that keep that pathogen sustained.

68
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:20,060
And then this is just give us some examples of pathogens that fall into these different categories.

69
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,809
And you can look at the leisure.

70
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:30,049
And again, there there can always be some fuzziness there where people may.

71
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,730
And in fact, here I just see measles as an indirect airborne.

72
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:42,500
And measles is here. Correct. So it's actually but this came all together that is classified into both categories.

73
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:55,730
So these next set of slides just to run quickly is just how ways in which we can modify or the environment gets modified to increase transmission,

74
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:03,140
increase in this case, agent survivability of the agent, its ability to move through populations.

75
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:13,490
So in the left, if I may increase density, in this case the housing situation, it could be increased density in a community also.

76
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:25,970
And also the use of water for recreation could be for bathing proportion of rodents is another way in which agent can expose hosts.

77
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,900
We're going to talk about antibiotic resistance in later on the course also.

78
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:39,620
So the changing environment that is the use of antibiotics can actually can result in the bacteria invading,

79
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:48,829
becoming resistant to those antibiotics, and therefore being able to thrive.

80
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:54,220
And in the use of, you know, an antibiotic resistance, if you apply an antibiotic,

81
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:59,990
you kill off the susceptible bacteria, allowing all the resistant bacteria to actually multiply.

82
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:06,380
So you often have a minority strain in your body because you've ingested in resistant bacteria.

83
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:12,110
And when you take antibiotics, that's when you kill off the susceptible ones.

84
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,879
And now the resistant ones have a competitive advantage and are able to multiply.

85
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,880
And that's how we get the spread of antibiotic resistance.

86
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:25,910
Air conditioning is one way off. A lot of research in the Central Valley in California,

87
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:35,750
how air conditioning moved people indoors and actually was protective in the sense that they kept mosquitoes away from humans.

88
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,979
Flooding. Increasing exposure to water contamination and flooding.

89
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,750
And recently it's been increasing a lot around the world.

90
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,460
And then we've got the environment changing climate change.

91
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:59,890
It has affected the way in which where mosquitoes thrive and where they won't thrive.

92
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:07,910
And so it doesn't just necessarily expand the distribution of where mosquitoes will be able to transmit,

93
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:13,160
but it may actually to stabilize certain areas and stabilize others.

94
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:18,440
There's this shift, making it really challenging for health departments to actually and help ministries of

95
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:25,290
health actually work on end and prioritize diseases that may be changing over years.

96
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,850
So and where where I work in Ecuador, we see that.

97
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,410
Decrease in malaria and an increase in dengue.

98
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,410
But there are many, many years where people were just in their head.

99
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:45,020
When they get a fever, they think malaria. And they go to they go to the malaria clinic when in fact, they actually had dengue.

100
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:52,340
And so it took actually a long period of time for people to shift and think that dengue is actually a risk in this area.

101
00:11:54,450 --> 00:12:04,410
Food handlers again is another and we've talked a lot about that as an important mode of spreading pathogens.

102
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:15,180
And this is just an example where climate change can affect a disease here in Rift Valley fever, where humans actually, again, a dead end host.

103
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:28,410
It survives in wildlife and mammals and has a vector is a mosquito vector that vectors the disease.

104
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:33,990
Host So in iran and average rainfalls,

105
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:42,510
we see this zoo and zoonotic or endemic transmission that's happening but with heavy rainfall and flooding and such,

106
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:48,180
that allows the mosquito population to surge.

107
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:57,870
You wind up with these outbreaks and get these zoonotic or epidemic conditions.

108
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:14,920
So. And lastly. Hospital room is also an important environment where agents and our disease agents can thrive again.

109
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:21,040
Fomite Transmission. Health workers turn out to be important mechanical vectors again,

110
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,900
so they just get their mechanical vectors because they're not getting infected themselves.

111
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:31,150
They're actually through contamination of their clothes or their hands. Move it from one room to another room.

112
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:41,020
And so you get this spread throughout a hospital with, you know, maybe relatively immobile patients, and they're coming in with the disease.

113
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,800
But it's the health workers that are mobile and spread it through the hospital.

114
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:57,560
Is data just showing the increase to increase the amount of time that a patient is in a room.

115
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:08,240
The increased prevalence of a positive, increased prevalence in patients and on surfaces, different pathogens.

116
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:16,130
Okay, so this now or that, I kind of covers the first section of this lecture and now we're more moving into

117
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:23,000
how we characterize disease spread and more of the quantitative aspects of it.

118
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:27,260
So we'll move through different metrics that are used.

119
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:33,980
Some of the metrics that you've already seen in courses like 600 others that are new, like the reproductive number.

120
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:47,340
And so here are basic measures that we can use case infection ratios.

121
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:54,960
So it's the number of clinical cases per infection. So how likely, if you're infected, will you have symptoms?

122
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,819
And then the case fatality rate is given that you have symptoms,

123
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:08,070
how likely is that you're going to actually die so that the severity of a disease and so these to provide important

124
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:15,330
metrics on understanding the likelihood of having symptoms and then the likelihood of having a severe outcome.

125
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:25,400
There's also the infection fatality ratio over time. It's the number of deaths divided by a number who are infected.

126
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:33,920
And so it's kind of a composite of these two here where we start with infection in the denominator and have deaths in the numerator.

127
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:42,170
This one is much harder to estimate, but through serologic studies and such,

128
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:52,280
that's often the best way we have to actually get at infection as opposed to waiting for somebody to be symptomatic.

129
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:58,010
And so a lot of serology studies are conducted in order to get a sense that, well,

130
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:08,420
what's the actual infection rate in a population so not used as much, but a metric that can be used.

131
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:22,550
And so here we're showing a table that compares this one column for different pathogens and strains of pathogens like the case.

132
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,880
Rate per infection, as well as the fatality rate per case.

133
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:42,560
And so we see here. Smallpox and measles both have are very infectious that if you get over 90%, 95% of infections become symptomatic.

134
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:51,520
But. It's the burial of a major strain in smallpox that is much more virulent,

135
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,820
causing a lot more mortality, whereas the minor strain and also measles, it has a lot less mortality.

136
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,300
And then there's something interesting about poliomyelitis.

137
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:12,830
So since the case definition of polio is acute flaccid paralysis, which is a pretty severe, very severe outcome of polio,

138
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:22,909
you wind up with polio looking very not very if not very infectious, but in fact, polio is quite infectious.

139
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:29,930
So the infectivity is quite high. That is that if you are exposed to polio in the environment,

140
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:38,510
you're you're using the rate in which you become infected and maybe have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic.

141
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:43,580
It's pretty high. But the probability that you develop.

142
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,510
The paralysis symptom is going to be quite low.

143
00:17:48,870 --> 00:18:02,130
So this is this low number is based on the fact that it is based on the fact that poliomyelitis in case is defined by paralysis.

144
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:13,049
So I showed you this before and in a different format.

145
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:22,080
But this is again showing us the natural history of disease or some important metrics for us to know with respect to transmission.

146
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,370
We talked about latent period as being critically important.

147
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:32,310
The time from start of an infection to being infectious.

148
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:38,670
And this line here characterized the level of the agent in the host.

149
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:46,139
So this is and so we can see that the latency period is defined by the time it

150
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:52,710
takes to have enough pathogen in your system for you to become infectious.

151
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,370
So again, for a respiratory disease, influenza, COVID,

152
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:04,979
it has to be we have to have enough virus in your upper respiratory saliva so that when you cough,

153
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:11,850
when you talk, you release an appreciable amount of antigen for something like malaria, dengue.

154
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:19,260
It's how much parasites you have in your blood. And so that when a mosquito bites, it can actually become infected.

155
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,360
And so this latent period is, is, is.

156
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:33,490
Defined by this level in which your little pathogens, the host, increases at a threshold.

157
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:42,430
So the latency period in port and then again in the incubation period, from a clinical perspective, as important as the time to become symptomatic.

158
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:51,170
And then we see that often what happens is this is a typical situation, but it varies by patch, patch and pathogen.

159
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:59,319
Know your your low and your pathogen load peaks at some point, that's when you start becoming simply symptomatic.

160
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:05,200
And after that it starts dropping off. It starts dropping off because your immune system starts to kick in.

161
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:10,660
And so at some point it gets below the threshold where.

162
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:19,030
You are going to be less likely to be infectious.

163
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:32,030
And then at some point the symptoms resolve. And so we use this skirt as schematic in order to develop, for instance, transmission models and such,

164
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:41,170
in trying to understand and trying to characterize different infectious diseases by its model infectivity, the probability get infected.

165
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:49,810
What's the latent period, what's the infective period to period in which you are infectious, and then what's the immune period?

166
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,160
So we got these classic characteristics that we can quantify.

167
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:01,270
Some are harder to quantify than others, much easier to quantify the incubation period because you're waiting for somebody who is symptomatic.

168
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:07,520
Much harder to quantify in late period because it's harder to see.

169
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,310
It's harder to test for whether or not somebody is actually infectious.

170
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:26,590
So there's one additional term here, generation time, which actually is the time,

171
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:34,330
which is the time from the time you acquire an infection to when you actually transmit the infection.

172
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:45,280
It's a it's close to latency. Latency says your infectious generation time tracks when you actually do have a transmission event.

173
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:53,620
And so they often use generation time just to calculate the reproductive number and how quickly this pathogen,

174
00:21:54,040 --> 00:22:01,240
the infectious disease, is actually growing. So.

175
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:10,770
The SO infectious disease processes are highly dynamic and we're going to go over a little bit about what we mean by dynamic

176
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:18,900
in in the following lectures and more specifically in the transmission modeling lecture that comes later in the course.

177
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:28,200
But the question is what factors influence how fast an infection will spread over time and space is spread geographically,

178
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,680
but also the epidemic curve itself.

179
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:40,290
And so these are some of the factors we've talked about all of these in the past, but these are the factors that impact the dynamics of the spread.

180
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:48,299
What's the infectivity, what's the probability that you become infected if exposed latency?

181
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:57,180
How long does it take before you're actually infectious and right. And then you can spread the disease infectious period.

182
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:03,540
Well, how long is it that you're going to be able to transmit the pathogen?

183
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:12,180
And then immune response is what's your susceptibility if somebody else's infection is for you to become infected?

184
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:18,479
So these are four very important factors that define and help define the dynamics

185
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,629
of spread that we're going to go over in more detail in the following slides.

186
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:30,750
So these are the four key factors that you'll see in classic dynamic transmission model.

187
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:35,760
So here's the classic transmission model we call the SDR model.

188
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:44,970
As for Susceptibles, I for infected slash infectious is really about whether or not you're infectious and not infected.

189
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:50,370
And often they were infected and then ours for recovery.

190
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:56,940
That just means you're recovered from the disease, you're removed from the transmission process.

191
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:03,990
Your move to the transmission process could be that you would die from the infection.

192
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,280
It could be that you're actually your new infection. In the cases.

193
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,890
What we're dealing with in the disease is that we do what is often removed from the transmission process to.

194
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:28,020
And so this. This this this framework for thinking about transmission was developed in the early 1900s.

195
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:41,380
We see our model was codified in 1927 by McKendrick, and it's still the basis for what we do and what the kinds of models that we developed.

196
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:53,580
No matter how complicated the model is about modeling transmission of Seattle or, you know, these huge complicated simulation models.

197
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:57,480
The basis for all those models is this SARS model.

198
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:10,120
And so there's two important parameters in our model that drive the dynamics, and one is the transmission rate.

199
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:16,960
And the transmission rate is basically the rate in which susceptibles become infected and infectious.

200
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:23,260
The rate of generating infections per infected, again with these transmission models,

201
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:31,089
and we'll look at it in more detail later in the course, a transmission event happens when a contact happens.

202
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:35,080
If it's a directly, you're modeling it as a directly transmitted disease.

203
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,610
And it's when an infected infectious person contacts.

204
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:52,940
This is to old person. And then the second important parameter is the recovery rate parameter, the rate in which you are no longer infectious.

205
00:25:53,690 --> 00:26:03,019
So that becomes a critically important factor, because how long you're infectious is an important risk to the spread of the disease,

206
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:11,120
as is how likely it is you're going to get infected and you have an exposure, which is the transmission rate.

207
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:21,200
So sometimes people are many times people extend this model and we'll talk about the extension of this model later in the course.

208
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:27,560
But one common extension is to add this E for exposed state.

209
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:37,669
And so now we have and this data actually helps us our includes the concept of latency so somebody can be exposed,

210
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:43,159
they move from susceptible to exposed, but they know they're not immediately infectious.

211
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:50,750
And that's what the latency period's about. So this the time in which you are exposed but latently exposed,

212
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:56,150
you're in this e state and then you move into the infectious state once you become infectious.

213
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:00,530
So this is called an SBIR model, which is an extension of the SDR model.

214
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:07,730
Sometimes the expected latency period is so short that it doesn't make sense to include in the model.

215
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:13,460
Sometimes it's important because you want to matt for data fitting reasons.

216
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:19,220
I think some diseases like HIV and TB, that latency period can be decades.

217
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:24,350
So it's incredibly important to include it in the model that depends on what you're studying,

218
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:28,819
what your questions are, and what specific model that you may be addressing.

219
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,660
But we're going to focus mostly on the ASPIRE model today.

220
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,229
And then they add.

221
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:45,700
Another variation could be that you are temporarily immune or recovered and eventually become more susceptible, or you're just partially immune.

222
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:51,820
That is you. And we're seeing that with Kobe, that you have Kobe, it doesn't necessarily mean you're not going to get Kobe it again.

223
00:27:52,360 --> 00:28:02,800
And even some people are getting it soon after. So you can be partially immune and eventually over time, you may be completely susceptible.

224
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:09,490
So those are other variations that you can have for these kind of models.

225
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:17,760
So I want to go over a little bit about, well, what is this transmission rate parameter?

226
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:24,120
And so it's a product of two processes.

227
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,390
One is a social process. We've been talking about that a lot.

228
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:32,360
The contact, like a transmission, is not going to occur unless the contact occurs.

229
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:40,250
But then also there is the infectivity piece and that's the biological piece, the probability of infection given contact.

230
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:50,440
So it's really the product of these two terms as social and a biologic that results in our transmission rate brand.

231
00:28:52,310 --> 00:29:00,290
And so sometimes often there's just and we use the letter data often to talk about transmission rate.

232
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:07,100
Often you don't people don't distinguish are the aggregated into these two terms.

233
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,589
But for sexually transmitted diseases,

234
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:17,990
it's often this aggregated because the contact and the contact patterns are so critical in transmission in that case.

235
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:30,080
And so what that contact is depends on the mode of transmission for.

236
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,549
So for sexually transmitted disease and sexual practice,

237
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:43,790
the number of different partners is a critical contact term that that defines how the disease is spread.

238
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,710
If everybody's monogamous, the disease is not going to really spread very easily at all.

239
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:59,180
So it's really a number of different partners and types of practices that are going to determine this contact rate for vector borne disease.

240
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,320
It's going to be a biting rate.

241
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:11,660
So the biting rate of the mosquito is the contact rate that we're were focused on where waterborne disease is going to be.

242
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:19,150
Our transmission is going to be ingestion rates. How much water are you ingesting and what rate are you ingesting and.

243
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,040
And then for a directly transmitted disease.

244
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:33,560
Again, if we're going to and if we're going to consider it directly transmitted, close contacts are going to be how we model.

245
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:38,870
So we often model influenza, ignoring the fact that it's airborne or droplet.

246
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:48,410
We just assume that there's going to be a close contact that's going to be needed in order for us to be a part of transmission to prevent to occur.

247
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:59,660
Less, you know, less defendable if there's if it aerosolize is and can actually stay in an environment for a long period of time.

248
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:05,599
But that's what the assumption is when you classify it as a drug that transmitted disease from a perspective of

249
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:13,459
a model and in zoonotic diseases is going to be contact with animals in different kinds of animals livestock,

250
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:21,800
wild animals, x nesting pets. So what goes into this parameter will depend on the mode of transmission.

251
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:31,839
So the reproductive number is an important metric that I think a lot of people now have been exposed

252
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:40,150
to because of COVID making my life a little easier and how in introducing this term and of course,

253
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:49,959
it's like the definition is the number of secondary cases generated from a single and effective case introduced into a fully susceptible population.

254
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,600
So this and this is this is often called the basic reproductive number.

255
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,470
And this is really an idealized number.

256
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:06,840
Because we don't have a situation now, even with Cogan necessarily, that there's going to be a fully settled population.

257
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:13,320
And so this is. And so but it's a useful metric because it talks about the.

258
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:19,560
Epidemic potential of a disease system like COVID.

259
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:33,010
And so. When we talk about the river dying, number two, the question is we got one infected person introduced into a susceptible population.

260
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:41,080
How many new cases are there going to be? And really what we're concerned about and we'll see later is are we going to see more than one case?

261
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,640
We're going to on average every going to see just one case.

262
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:50,440
Are we going to see less than one case? So we see more than one case.

263
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:57,520
The epidemic is going to grow. We see less than one case. It's going to die out if it's around one.

264
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:07,590
And our endemic situation. So let's look at how we calculate Arnott.

265
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:13,870
Now we've got four terms that we're interested in and.

266
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,820
The contact rate, which we talked about and the probably infection which you talked about.

267
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,200
So together these give us the transmission rate.

268
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:30,630
So the transmission rate is a big part of our not how many cases.

269
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:37,980
What's the potential of secondary cases that a person has to transmit?

270
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:43,800
But then there's this second or third term, which is the duration of infectiousness.

271
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:48,510
So you've got this rate of producing new cases, but for how long?

272
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:51,120
We'll have for as long as you're infectious.

273
00:33:51,630 --> 00:34:01,860
And so we have the duration of infectiousness, which is the lifespan of the disease or or the lifespan of how long you're actually infectious,

274
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,420
because you can stop being infectious and you might be still symptomatic.

275
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:09,330
It's not being infectious and you haven't been symptomatic for weeks.

276
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,940
So it's a duration of infectiousness and it's last term.

277
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:21,359
So we have the transmission rate. There's last term is this attenuation factor, which we won't talk that much about in this course.

278
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:27,390
But it's important in the fact that if you've got an environmental mode of transmission,

279
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:35,970
the pathogen is released into the environment, then that pathogen will die out over time.

280
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:43,800
So there's some attenuation that occurs before it's re-exposed to or somebody else is exposed.

281
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:49,190
So that attenuation factor has to do with the diaphragm, the persistence of the pathogen.

282
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:59,590
So this is this is basically this is how we calculate and are not in and determined.

283
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:05,560
We are not for a given given condition.

284
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:11,160
So here we have an example of which, you know,

285
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:19,240
we start with two infected individuals in a central population and they recover and wind up you wind up with only one new case.

286
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:24,070
That's an example of our not being less than one. The disease will die out.

287
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:32,290
You start with two infectious individuals and you wind up with two infectious individuals.

288
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:38,500
You have this endemic state that's equal to one. And then we have the situation where our not is greater than one.

289
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:48,979
And you have this epidemic situation where these two individuals resulted in more than two new cases of infection.

290
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:53,930
And that's why we're in our epidemic phase are not is greater than one.

291
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:04,390
This is more of a schematic the way that we think about transmission,

292
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:14,020
where disease die can die out and can be endemic and can be epidemic, is very highly dynamic, are not going to be less than one.

293
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:21,639
And you can wind up with the disease being eliminated but then reintroduced and new conditions such that it becomes Arnott's greater than one.

294
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,100
So things can change over time.

295
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:32,650
But this is sort of conceptually how we think about the best way to use are not and as we can see if we can formulate what goes into are not.

296
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:37,840
We can look at the kinds of interventions that will get us into this.

297
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,880
Area of Ana you know where Ana it's less than one as opposed to are not creative one.

298
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:54,810
So passions have. Have different ARNOTTS Here we can see a range from influenza 2 to 4 of the

299
00:36:54,810 --> 00:37:00,990
measles of 1218 and pertussis of measles protesters have a very high are not.

300
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:10,650
COVID has changed over time it's just our crime variants four times more transmissible from the data that we see from Delta.

301
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:14,360
Some are not for all.

302
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:23,280
The crime has been estimated in different areas. As high as eight are not going to vary from place to place.

303
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:29,550
So these are not for COVID and one area might be very different than another area.

304
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:40,530
That's a lot of reasons why we have measles ranging from 12 to 1870 has to do with like if you're in Africa versus Southeast Asia,

305
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:47,700
if you're in higher density, lower density areas, that's going to affect are not going to be.

306
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:56,360
So Arnott's is kind of a moving target. It's going to change from place to place and not just a function of the pathogen.

307
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:06,780
So even though when we talk about on the ground, we say, oh, it's more infectious pathogen, one of the factors that goes into our calculation.

308
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,660
Measles is incredibly infectious.

309
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:19,710
We often talk about it as some very highly infectious pathogen.

310
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:31,740
Here's an example where they were able to discover that a child who was infectious in an airport transmitted it to somebody else,

311
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:38,190
even though they were not coincident in time and place. They both use the same gate, but they weren't there at the same time.

312
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:42,240
So here's an example of where measles was aerosolized.

313
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:50,850
It could survive for hours in the air. And it's so infectious that even a small number of particles were able to infect.

314
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,810
Was another person so highly infectious pathogens?

315
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:02,399
This is an example where, again, due to the fact that we're seeing lower and lower coverage,

316
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:10,800
because the higher your your are not and the higher the coverage is needed in order to control the disease.

317
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:14,700
So we're seeing measles crop up all over the country.

318
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:20,490
Here's some examples of that. In Ann Arbor, 2016 to 19 months.

319
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:33,060
Also incredibly infectious is an outbreak that was on campus, even though everybody had at least two doses of measles, mumps, rubella.

320
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:37,170
We still see evidence of this outbreak here. Here's the outbreak curve.

321
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,470
But a lot of this had to do with waning immunity.

322
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:52,400
What we thought was these lifelong these vaccines that gave life long protection actually don't bear attacking when they're hurting.

323
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:58,860
And so as third dose to students dealt with was able to deal with this outbreak.

324
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,060
And this is going to be a focus, I think, over to you, going to be looking at this.

325
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:13,660
I managed this manuscript. So this talked about the different phases of an epidemic.

326
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,910
You've got your stage in which things are the pathogens getting established.

327
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:26,259
You got your exponential phase and then you got your phase where you get exhausted and susceptible.

328
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:34,840
So you get this drop. And then you've got sometimes this equilibrium situation or a recurring epidemic that occurs.

329
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:44,090
So in this homework set, you're going to look at five phases of COVID, the COVID pandemic and different epidemic,

330
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:57,980
periods where we went from a low level and then this exponential increase, and then finally a decrease due to exhaustion of susceptibles.

331
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:06,770
A key point here when we think about interventions is this the establishment phase is really where we're going to have the most bang for our buck.

332
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:08,780
This is where we're going to be the most effective.

333
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:15,470
Unfortunately, this is also the point where we have the most uncertainty of whether or not you're going to have an epidemic.

334
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:23,930
And so and then we get into this exponential phase where we're a lot more certain about having an epidemic, a lot harder to control.

335
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:27,890
And this is what we see over and over and over again. This is what we saw in COVID.

336
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:34,010
This is what we see in every outbreak that we deal with.

337
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:40,610
And part of this has to do with the fact that unless you act with when there's a lot of uncertainty,

338
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:48,620
your chances of really addressing and squashing an outbreak is going to get harder and harder and more and more difficult.

339
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:53,330
And so our shutdown occurred in October when we were in this exponential phase.

340
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:59,180
And that's why it was didn't seem, you know, took a long time for it to drop back down.

341
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:06,979
And often when we look and study epidemic curves. We think that our intervention actually worked,

342
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:11,450
but it was actually the exhausted susceptibles across the down that we were so late in the

343
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:18,610
intervention that it it ran its normal course and we talked a lot about flattening the curve.

344
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:22,250
Sometimes we aren't able to flatten the curve because we act so late.

345
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:29,210
And so this is a pretty good illustration of why that's the case.

346
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:41,900
So another concept is the effective reproductive number, and that's the measure.

347
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:48,229
That's actually the actual measure I talked about are the basic reproductive number are not

348
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:54,139
as this idealized situation where everybody's susceptible and an infected person enters in.

349
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:58,940
Well, this actually measures the epidemic potential when some people are immune.

350
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:12,070
And so. Are not times the number of susceptibles is our effective are not and it becomes a useful tool in the middle of an outbreak to better

351
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:19,480
understand what we need to do in the context of the fact that there are some people that are having a mutiny and others that don't.

352
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:25,510
So we, the effective reproductive number is this actual infection potential.

353
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:29,420
Our basic reproductive number is our idealized infection potential.

354
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:38,440
A lot of factors affecting are not depletion of susceptible individuals, as we just talked about,

355
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:45,999
as well as things like population growth, population density mobility is a huge part of transmission.

356
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:54,160
The more mobile population is, the much more difficult it is to control the ability for it to expand in geographically

357
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:59,070
and then the pathogen changing and mutating into new variants like we're seeing.

358
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,840
So average age of infection is another important feature.

359
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:19,220
An important measure to know about.

360
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:25,070
So the average age infection. We'll talk about this a little bit more in transmission model.

361
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,940
Being lectured that and I addressed this a lot more in my class.

362
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:37,850
With average age infection turns out to be one over the incidence. So that's when the average infection is small low.

363
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:41,330
So that that means it's a much more infectious pathogen.

364
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:50,540
So measles, the average age infection might be like three or four years of age and something that's less infectious,

365
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:56,300
the average age, the first infection is going to be maybe five, six, seven or ten years.

366
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:04,710
How do we get average age infection? We talked about how do we get more information about infection?

367
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:07,430
We used to usually get through serology data.

368
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:17,960
And this is a study done in the seventies looking at SEROPREVALENCE of hepatitis A in different countries in Europe.

369
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:26,150
And so we see this curve here. So the X axis is age, y axis is percent.

370
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:36,680
People that are positive, we see we're all Greece is has a small, average age of infection.

371
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:44,990
And therefore that means it has higher incidence because again, there's this inverse relationship between average age infection and incidence.

372
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,850
And the other extreme is Sweden.

373
00:45:48,410 --> 00:46:00,630
So Sweden has the lowest incidence and you can see that in the serology data because it's average age to first infection is much older per se.

374
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,980
These are equations that we won't go into but it turns out are not is related to average

375
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:15,689
to infection and how being the lifespan of an individual adding average age of infection.

376
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:25,890
So Arnott has had this inverse relationship. So Arnott greater Arnott means infection is more likely early in life.

377
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:31,100
And also that also means that you need to get at your vaccinations a lot earlier.

378
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:39,030
So for measles, because it has a high arnott and you want to get at vaccinated children.

379
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,030
Early in life before they actually got their first infection it.

380
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:52,760
So last concept, which we talked about already a bit, is this concept of herd immunity.

381
00:46:54,260 --> 00:47:03,410
I'm going to go through these slides and probably pick up slides more next week when we talk about immunity.

382
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:18,730
But the idea here is that the herd immunity is this idea that you're going to get indirect protection because most of your population is vaccinated.

383
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:22,250
So herd immunity is all about protecting the unprotected.

384
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:28,040
Those that are not vaccinated have some degree of protection, indirect protection.

385
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:32,840
So we'll talk about this a lot more in our study design lecture.

386
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:37,010
This is how to measure this indirect protection.

387
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:44,270
But if you're vaccinated, you actually have to have a direct protection because you've got vaccinated, but you're also an indirect protection.

388
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:52,850
So that vaccine isn't perfect. You also get this indirect effect of there being a lot less transmission of pathogens in the environment.

389
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:59,780
So given the time, I think I'll stop here and we'll pick up some of this.

390
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:16,580
Next week when we start talking about immunity and there's just maybe this one final show that it turns out that the

391
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:24,170
theoretical apportion of populations needed to be vaccinated or to stop transmission is inversely proportional to our not.

392
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:33,050
And this is the equation when people are saying, oh, we need 80% of the population in COVID vaccinated or we need 70%.

393
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:42,169
They were actually using the estimate of our not that that people were providing to come up with this so if you are not is too

394
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:54,229
you need 50% of the population vaccinated that is 1 to 1 minus one or 2.5 are not because five and that's the Delta variant.

395
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:59,540
We were seeing numbers like five. Now, as I said, people say, oh, we need 80% of the population.

396
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:06,560
Again, this is in a very homogeneous population where risks are homogeneous and everything.

397
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:16,670
So it's it's really a rule of thumb, but it does give you a sense, you know, measles, which is up in 15, we need 95, 93% of that coverage.

398
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:21,470
So when we start seeing coverage below 90% and measles in the U.S., we start worrying.

399
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:29,490
So I'll stop there so we can go into the discussion groups and.

400
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:44,230
So this is also I put this in the same PowerPoint slides that last week's discussion question was.

401
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:54,670
So it's the second slide. So in class we talked about the reproductive number is a function of those four terms.

402
00:49:55,090 --> 00:50:02,740
And the first three terms which I want you to focus on the contact rate, probably the infection given contact and duration of infectiousness.

403
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:10,600
But like you in their groups to discuss the various interventions that will drive the reproduction number below one.

404
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:24,280
So you can decrease contact with social distancing, you can decrease the time someone's infectious treatment and also screening.

405
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:29,410
You can decrease the problem of the infection. You can say that through vaccination.

406
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:36,669
So basically, look at the various interventions that will drive the reproduction number below one which term and are

407
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:44,139
not the intervention effects and also the strengths and limitation of these interventions based on real,

408
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:53,469
real world politics, economics and such things always go into our decision of, of, of what interventions are going to be useful.

409
00:50:53,470 --> 00:51:03,250
So I rotated everybody so that they're they've got a different the groups have a different transmission pathway to focus.

410
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:11,230
And so focus on your transmission pathway, take that pathogen and then talk about how to think,

411
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:17,360
how to conceptualize, are not in the context of interventions. Any question.

412
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:28,750
Okay. And it's intriguing that this science is getting where it is.

413
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:32,310
Everybody in a group. You.

414
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,460
I mean, that's okay. In your name? Yeah.

415
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:40,630
Oh, okay. Okay. So a little bit.

416
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:49,600
And then we'll come back and I think you'll find.

417
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:36,420
Authorities is concerned that these games of speculation certainly doesn't imply anybody has a lot of knowledge about what's possible.

418
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:43,690
So we're just focusing on this one.

419
00:52:45,180 --> 00:53:05,100
So I guess I'll never get to regardless of the disease, because I think I'm in love with him.

420
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:17,520
He's in my life, whether it's a sexually transmitted disease or not.

421
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:38,520
And I think that there's another reason why these people are beginning to make it sound like, oh, my God.

422
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:47,830
More on that later. So once I had a guy, we were really I just monitored.

423
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:56,360
But yeah, we don't fly over things.

424
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:15,440
Our world helping to make sure that it's funny because they know they just because you're not touching.

425
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,550
Yeah, that's what I'm doing. Your life.

426
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:36,749
So I guess I heard his voice.

427
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:45,090
Keep an eye on it. They're always wanted to do comedy.

428
00:54:46,140 --> 00:55:16,270
I know that sounds a lot like the last time I checked your emails and you see a lot of the because I have lived in all probability with Brexit.

429
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:47,480
I think it is interesting to me as we talk about the fact that you we let's start with the whole country,

430
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:58,250
because I think that this is just one example.

431
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:10,430
Yeah, this one is Charlotte's 26 states.

432
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:38,500
It originated with someone from Microsoft Corp, which is great because then you have this single person for people to tell people what he was like.

433
00:56:38,520 --> 00:57:02,990
If you had a moment just yet another question and I'm not sure it's not really useful to talk about, you know.

434
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:20,890
My work with the vaccines was only recommended for two years, which is really starting to ramp up.

435
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:28,270
So, you know, when you're at the end of next year, nobody likes them.

436
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:36,200
Like, you know, experts said it wasn't that bad.

437
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:46,450
I was impressed. You know, if somebody's hearing aids.

438
00:57:47,330 --> 00:58:02,600
So I was like, wow, I would like to do something like that.

439
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:08,090
Usually it's going to be the right thing to.

440
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:17,300
But I just I just watched the video so much.

441
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:22,970
And you think obviously there's a lot to like about it, but what if I did?

442
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:32,300
Forgive me. Yeah, I'm sorry.

443
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:41,060
Yeah. So then I can see you guys can read more.

444
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:46,330
So they can. It just reduces the birds. Yeah. Mosquitoes in that population, especially.

445
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:51,140
I never seen anything else. Obviously, that's.

446
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:59,800
That makes it difficult to identify. Just like lightning strikes.

447
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:24,050
Very limited. I mean, like, there's a lot of mosquito netting at the same time, you know, I have no idea how long you're actually wearing a mask.

448
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:40,459
And so limitations that that was like I have been battered for the treatment rather than

449
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:46,160
they're not like there was a cure for this was probably one of the things that's cool.

450
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:53,120
Yeah. So they're like, they're just like, so tired.

451
00:59:53,270 --> 01:00:10,580
So it's like, yeah, it's get rid of, like, control over the ones, you know, like I run like something about using kids they'll get something to of.

452
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:17,490
This is the first time. Yeah. They're like, I wouldn't.

453
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:23,400
Why are you saying the problem?

454
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:34,570
They don't think that you're less likely to be able to do anything.

455
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:50,750
Yeah. And my mom's like, as far as, like, everything is so bad, you have.

456
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:56,870
Everything's hysterical, you're gonna win something.

457
01:00:57,350 --> 01:01:02,750
Never mind our situation. I don't know.

458
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:11,550
I'm sort of tracking all these power discussions and things as bad.

459
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:19,580
Is that what you're kind of getting into? You know, just trying to really work the space.

460
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:26,720
There's also infrastructure limitations, you know, limitations. I love you.

461
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:33,620
I think you have to be aware of that.

462
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:44,400
You know, that these are really you know, it's just really oh, I can just, like,

463
01:01:46,190 --> 01:02:01,730
specify the point of the journey, which is that we're like being more aware of it.

464
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:30,780
Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that's what I thought, that I'll keep our human population to be here on this show for those limitations.

465
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:34,580
You know, I don't know.

466
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:45,139
I mean, the new vaccine just came out and know I don't know that this is really just I

467
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:49,730
don't think there's any good that's that's the one that just sounds ridiculous.

468
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:53,870
But it's not missing. That's the one. That's the one I was talking about.

469
01:02:53,870 --> 01:03:05,270
But I thought it was only images that are like, that's going to start like in Florida.

470
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:19,670
It's just going to be things like the territories where it needs to be with its territory.

471
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:38,030
And it's the same one. But this is probably going to be a long wait for my car and are I guess this Generation Z is more like 2036.

472
01:03:41,990 --> 01:04:06,139
Yeah. I mean, to use the word bang, what kind of massacre of 6 to 45 that I spoke to about four or five years earlier?

473
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:10,350
What makes the vaccine very real?

474
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:18,530
The first vaccine they released, they tried to say you had to be a pharmacist to try and interrupt you,

475
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:27,559
because if you give somebody a vaccine that they got first vaccine, that means their second infection in my ear.

476
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:49,910
And they found, you know, you really want to do things like that, you know, that they were targeting pieces of your case to hold it back.

477
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:54,200
So that's why in the U.S., it's only for 16 years old.

478
01:04:54,470 --> 01:05:02,660
Yeah, I agree with you. It's 6 to 45 a few weeks and it's tricky.

479
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:18,740
I couldn't sleep. I would never I would get a vaccine before I travel to the university because I think they are all I have.

480
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:26,000
Never, ever so slowly started using, especially the last meeting.

481
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:32,500
You are like 20, $30. It's like, which is going to be a lot of the euro.

482
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:36,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It looks like you're missing, too.

483
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:41,060
Oh, yeah. I don't know. What did you get?

484
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:53,780
I think she wasn't in our program.

485
01:05:55,730 --> 01:06:01,460
Yes. Yeah. It's really funny because we all are going to take a break.

486
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:06,140
Tell you right now. I hope not. But you got to do something about it.

487
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:15,409
If we do something that's true.

488
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:26,650
Yeah. Going to be standing. Water is probably disinfectant. So is there someone they're not going to look like?

489
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:34,309
Because I keep saying the same thing is true I think are okay,

490
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:44,150
let's go back together and do some reporting out and let's start with group one being waterborne.

491
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:53,090
So we chose cholera and we said that some interventions to drive down reproductive

492
01:06:53,090 --> 01:06:57,080
number would be to boil water and you save water for cooking and drinking,

493
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:03,680
washing hands thoroughly with soap and water. Cooking all foods sufficiently, not consuming raw.

494
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:13,130
Sufficiently washing fruits and vegetables so that this would this intervention would impact the contact rate.

495
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:22,660
And we said that some strengths and limitations a lot of the times, like boiling water, can be very tedious and it's a lot of work.

496
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:30,700
And so people might just choose not to do it. Or once the boil water boil water advisories would have been issued,

497
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:37,000
you've probably already been exposed because you don't really necessarily know that there's an exposure until people are already sick.

498
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,850
And that's true for like a lot of things as well. The timeliness of the intervention is critical.

499
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:46,449
Yeah. Okay.

500
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:50,350
So you're hitting mostly the contact rate by doing all these.

501
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:58,420
Yeah. And hygiene, oil, water. Is there a way to think about one or the other?

502
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:08,170
What's another way to address another aspect of our not, for example, duration of infectiousness?

503
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:17,590
You could treat the disease. You can treat right. So you can identify people.

504
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:23,250
You may not isolating them effectively. You know, with infections, too, because you're known.

505
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:27,259
Because if you're not but you know, technically you're not contacting it yet.

506
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:33,590
So treating the disease would be one way of dealing with that.

507
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:40,640
Duration of infectiousness and in general screening, because there's there's a lot of these if you're asymptomatic,

508
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:44,060
gonorrhea, you're asymptomatic quite a bit as a male.

509
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:51,680
So screening is often very effective in decreasing that duration infections.

510
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:59,210
So any so you talk about patients with respect to their people.

511
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:09,980
I think with with a lot of, you know, hand hygiene and asking individuals to boil water as opposed to centralized treatment,

512
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:16,579
you're dealing with adherence to the intervention. And that's always going to be an issue.

513
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:28,670
And they and there's something called a hierarchy control and sort of de interventions that are do not require volition and B, are at the lower rung.

514
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:35,150
And then vaccines and infrastructural changes are getting closer and closer to being much,

515
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:42,110
much more expensive and takes longer to implement but much more effective.

516
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:48,660
Right. So group to the environment.

517
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:58,040
So most of the interventions we mentioned deal with the contact rate and probability of infections getting contact.

518
01:09:58,910 --> 01:10:03,590
We discussed like you can isolate, post infection or treat the disease,

519
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:07,370
although it's a little harder because you don't always know what it is or what the process is.

520
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:17,130
You can increase hand-washing and like food handling, and then you can also control it to an extent by like the temperature you bring.

521
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:22,610
Like, are you cooking it sufficiently? Are you storing it properly, like at proper cool temperatures?

522
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:30,230
I think this is particularly important like cooked meats because I like, boy rare, but maybe that's not the safest way to eat your meat.

523
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:39,170
And then environment like a monitoring environmental conditions and like controlling the environment to control the transmission.

524
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:44,779
And in terms of streaks, they're pretty easily like interventions.

525
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:48,590
They're really easy to implement and they're pretty straightforward.

526
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,960
A limitation is there tend to be pretty broad.

527
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:57,710
So you have to be like, Oh, we're going to recall all of these things, but maybe only a little few of those products are actually contaminated.

528
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:04,630
And then in terms of it's hard to reinforce because like,

529
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:13,160
you can't make someone not eat a product or a consumer product and it can take a long time to establish like acceptable methods and policies.

530
01:11:16,010 --> 01:11:24,590
Foodborne is one of the examples that is very expensive, controlled by FDA and this passive protocol of having food hygiene.

531
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:36,080
And the problem because food borne is is such a high burden in the U.S., you know, these interventions,

532
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:44,810
they have been successful in these strong mandates early on, like shutting down restaurants or doing.

533
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:51,860
The last one that we've just been experiencing is the Wendy's outbreak with E coli on contaminated lettuce.

534
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:59,599
They do have a lot of power in to shutting things down and stuff. And and like you said,

535
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:07,910
there's a lot of economic consequences to shutting things down or acting or and that's that's the that's the dilemma a public health officer has.

536
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:11,779
You know, the earlier that the more likely you're going to be successful,

537
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:18,470
but more likely you're more uncertain you are the more likely you're going to get political flak.

538
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:26,030
And eventually, if you don't see anything, that means if you're the most successful, you act early and then you end up seeing nothing.

539
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,050
People start second guessing Mother Nature.

540
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:39,440
So like foodborne pathogens are the ones, I think that there is the most political nobody should react strongly or with.

541
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:55,470
Airborne three. We looked broadly at most airborne pathogens, Skippy, the Soviet or measles, just pending some of our interventions.

542
01:12:55,480 --> 01:13:00,550
Most of them, I think is very similar to all the other groups and that contractor, it was more prevalent.

543
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:04,929
So we looked at social distancing, quarantining limits on social gatherings,

544
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:10,930
ventilation and sick leave as things that would allow for reduction of contact rate.

545
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:16,540
Of course, these have some limitations, like mask wearing is fairly easy to implement,

546
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:22,450
though it requires a lot of compliance on individual behavior, which isn't always something that we get.

547
01:13:23,410 --> 01:13:28,569
And then things like ventilation, you know, you only have to have one person make that decision for an entire building.

548
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:31,960
However, it's very expensive to implement. You know,

549
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:41,920
limitations on social gatherings or enforcing shut downs can be economically deleterious and just have a real stress on the personal finances,

550
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:48,920
even if there's not lost employment. And then we also talked about some probability of infection given contact information.

551
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:55,799
And a lot that we looked at there was vaccinations as well as that surgery duration of infectiousness.

552
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:01,020
So if you have a partially effective vaccine, you can still get the disease,

553
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:06,509
but there's a reduced chance of it and also a reduced chance that you'll be infectious for a longer period of time.

554
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:10,620
So both continuation of risk and of spread.

555
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:21,680
And then one thing we hit on a little more at the end. It's like how pointed out nutrition is going to increase your quality of health and

556
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:25,310
reduce likely the cow infections or how sick you're going to get while you're at it.

557
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:35,090
And so we extend that idea. Just redistribution of wealth to improve like, yeah, it's going to help to literally every level.

558
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:42,620
This kind of good point that like any anti-capitalist like intervention is probably going to improve basically every part of this safer attenuation.

559
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:48,500
Yeah, I think that's pretty much true for all regions.

560
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:54,770
Distribution of wealth and dealing with economic and political issues are paramount to any.

561
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:59,870
We see that because quickly COVID, we saw it very quickly.

562
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:08,870
We saw that people that were economically disadvantaged were kind of everywhere at a higher burden.

563
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:13,910
You know, we saw that with HIV that it had you know,

564
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:22,100
it had gay population that was apparently economically and politically pretty savvy and was able to address the disease.

565
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:25,730
And so over years, it became a disease of the poor again.

566
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:32,690
And so we see that over and over again and even, you know, inherent pathogens, cholera,

567
01:15:32,690 --> 01:15:39,350
typhoid, everybody was getting dying of cholera in London early on and now it is.

568
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:55,580
So ultimately that that's the most distal ultimate kind of intervention you can have and the most difficult one to actually address logistically.

569
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:04,219
And so yeah, so you mentioned in fact, so vaccines as we see with COVID, if you look at a population level,

570
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:10,790
there's no question about the power of the vaccine and how effective it is for a variety of reasons.

571
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:17,870
When we look at masks, very, very difficult to look at the data and believe that anything is happening at population level.

572
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:23,930
You can look at you know, you can do mean you can look at all sorts of indicators with vaccines,

573
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:29,749
states that are predominately Democratic and Republican. And you can see large signals with masks.

574
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:34,280
You can't see that at all. And so and a lot of that has to do with.

575
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:41,140
Who's wearing the mask when you're wearing a mask? How often you're wearing the mask?

576
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:50,620
What kind of mask wearing? All those kind of things affect its ability to control and control the disease, at least in the population level.

577
01:16:55,550 --> 01:17:02,870
Before. I don't know if you can hear me with the mask, because it looks very good.

578
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:08,480
Yeah. Okay. All right. So we were talking about HIV AIDS because we had been sexually transmitted.

579
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:17,390
So some of the interventions that we pointed out were increasing condom usage, usage of prep and pre and post exposure.

580
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:22,580
And then we are also talking about treatment of HIV with antiretroviral therapy.

581
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:31,330
So condom usage, you're saying that that affects the probability of infection in contact as well as have been?

582
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:40,730
They would be the same. I was thinking that HRT would affect the duration of infectiousness because then you're not as effective over time.

583
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,510
And then we also kind of we're talking about education,

584
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:50,870
sort of these stigmatization initiatives that would kind of try to tackle the social aspect of HIV.

585
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:55,580
Therefore, like the contact, the ability and then.

586
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:05,040
So the limitations that we were thinking, were they all of the kind of pharmaceutical related ones are susceptible to stigmatization?

587
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:10,230
There might be accessibility issues when it comes to cost. They're also susceptible to human error,

588
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:17,040
as if you have to take your pills on time every single time for a long time, especially if you're on your team.

589
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:23,010
There could be an ability to tolerate the side effects of all those medications.

590
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:29,320
You're saying that condom usage is probably one of the better interventions because it's somewhat cheap.

591
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:35,260
You're also saying that that's kind of susceptible to error as well because you don't know how durable a condom could be and it could still break,

592
01:18:36,610 --> 01:18:40,610
especially if you have limited sex education you wouldn't even think about.

593
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:54,850
Yeah. Good. HIV is a good example of where the antiretroviral therapy and the amazing job and decreasing the mortality and,

594
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:59,050
you know, in turn, you know HIV and much more into a chronic disease.

595
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:07,840
It became know that at that point much harder to address some of the other high risk sexual behaviors because

596
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:14,490
now people that you know are doing their own risk calculation in their head of whether or not they are,

597
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:19,959
you know, willing to take on some of these risks, that became much more challenging to deal with.

598
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:27,510
Some of those interventions are low end of the hierarchy and control types of interventions because of those.

599
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:33,540
Because of because of that shifting kind of risk calculation that people are doing.

600
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:39,959
And then the other thing I was going to mention is that, you know, the cost of these therapies have had a huge impact globally.

601
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:49,050
And Paul Farmer did an amazing job in trying to bring not do not not be in the mindset that says it's too expensive.

602
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:54,980
We can't afford to treat people in lower income countries and actually was able to manage it at least in a few sites.

603
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:58,050
I mean, scaling that concept globally.
