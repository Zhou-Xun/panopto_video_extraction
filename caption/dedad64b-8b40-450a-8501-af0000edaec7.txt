1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:16,680
This is this the earliest? You know, I feel like it's hard to tell.

2
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:24,660
Like, I know it's not year.

3
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:33,850
You know, I know a lot of my friends.

4
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:54,070
But I want everybody to probably like I was thinking about like science and math practice where I got it, I thought, that sounds great.

5
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:04,240
Like, you know, it's going to get to the side of the building, like emulsify or something on the side.

6
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:12,620
Oh, yes. Yeah. Like when I was, like, really sick, I was so nervous.

7
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,590
That's where, like, a really great example.

8
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:25,000
So I just decided I'm like this in front of me.

9
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,800
I think it was like.

10
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,370
I think it was a like a late night adventure.

11
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:39,690
Oh, I thought you were thinking.

12
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,639
Oh, did you know how these guys are?

13
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,750
They like, I was like, Oh, he just went off.

14
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,630
This guy.

15
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:03,070
Guy went over there. Yeah. I mean, that really has nothing to do with that.

16
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:10,100
Oh, my.

17
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:22,500
Think they're having a chance to prove that somewhere else.

18
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:30,120
But you're right. You're right.

19
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,160
I mean, I don't think so. Yeah. One of my other friends.

20
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,590
Yeah. Right now I'm just deducing.

21
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:53,090
Yes. I was like, oh, definitely.

22
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,370
Oh, for God's sake.

23
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,550
Like, are you going to like that then?

24
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,730
Because I guess you can look at that.

25
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,880
I think that just me and I go home.

26
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:24,750
Oh, sorry, I didn't I didn't like it.

27
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:59,430
And I secondly, I think there's a good reason I would say I mean, I don't think it was like I had to do something.

28
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,760
Go ahead, please. I think that's true.

29
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,160
That's true.

30
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:30,270
That's true. I mean, I don't know if you go back to Africa.

31
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:54,860
That's right. You know, it's like, oh, this is really going to probably just because one of your images are also telling me that you.

32
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:10,870
But implying that I should just increase the size of this and it will fill up more of the space.

33
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,720
And then I.

34
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,190
I don't think it's normal to want to change that.

35
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:34,390
So I would make those different sizes bigger or say, I guess from stereotypes, you know, it's like I said,

36
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:48,490
I think you have a lot of good stuff on how to your eyes on this one how a different color as possible.

37
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:57,810
It's not going to happen that I thought about it more.

38
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:10,170
No, it's not.

39
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,580
Yeah. Not necessary.

40
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:36,180
Yeah. So, yeah, these are the BBC that are discovered, you know, and I like unless you can't read it, I don't want to show.

41
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:46,240
I mean, I never play one section, but I'm like, okay.

42
00:06:46,990 --> 00:07:04,620
I just, you know, she likes, I guess what she wants to make the overview word up with the cast work and I'm like, Oh, oh, I don't know.

43
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:11,870
I want to know what's really going on.

44
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:25,680
Right. That's wonderful. So I had to go back and change one of the settings on the quiz because I couldn't save the correct answer for number three.

45
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:32,350
We're going to go through this this morning. First off, can everybody see that it's kind of dark in here this morning is a light.

46
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:38,950
Okay. So let's go to the first question.

47
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,910
So Chris was on last couple of the last two lectures.

48
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,740
Question number one regarding theories that explaining the underlying mechanisms for binge eating disorder.

49
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:59,030
Which of the following best describes the affect regulation model and this is specifically

50
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:05,510
referring to binge eating occurs to escape the experience of negative emotions.

51
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:13,460
So this was the descriptor for this particular theory on what causes binge eating disorder.

52
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:26,060
Okay. Questions about that next one had to do with a palm tree deficiency that we described.

53
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,790
So this is a rare condition leading to early onset of childhood obesity.

54
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,470
And the questions in regard to what do you do?

55
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:44,150
How do you what what is your treatment position? What causes this? And the correct answer here was it can be treated with several at a time.

56
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:55,340
The other options were can be treated with daily injections of leptin causes extreme elevations in pro insulin, the precursor of insulin.

57
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,500
And that is an example of syndromic obesity. So let's go through these one at a time.

58
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:06,740
It can be treated with daily injections of leptin. Well, here's the slide.

59
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:16,640
And here we have policy deficiency. So if you can't make policy, you're not going to have this break on the appetite.

60
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,230
Working through the Atlantic short for receptor.

61
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:25,250
And as a consequence, food intake increases and energy expenditure decreases.

62
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,640
Now, if you put leptin in the system, add more leptin,

63
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:34,840
it's not going to do anything because the way leptin stops feeding behavior is through primarily through this mechanism here.

64
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:42,600
Okay. So with several genotypes,

65
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:51,540
you're actually providing a ligand for this M.S. for our receptor that can suppress appetite and increase energy expenditure.

66
00:09:53,090 --> 00:10:00,330
All right. The last one is the one where there was a mistake and I had to go back and correct the quiz for everybody.

67
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,670
It took me a little time. That's why I'm late this morning. So the question was, gee,

68
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:14,970
watch studies have shown that polygenic obesity is most likely influenced by a single nucleotide polymorphisms with penetrance.

69
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:22,740
You know, it refers to a condition where you have many genes, many risk cereals acting together.

70
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,510
An increased number of risk is expressed in endocrine tissues only.

71
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:33,350
Well. When I showed this figure, it showed.

72
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:40,700
Okay, here's here's the endocrine tissues here, here. The risk of expression from these two studies.

73
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:49,520
So there's an increase, but not nearly to the same extent that you see in the risk of male expression in tissues of the nervous.

74
00:10:52,890 --> 00:11:03,750
So that's why question the answer to this letter, I should say neurological tissue enrichment with risk associated with life.

75
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,860
And then so that's why that was the correct answer.

76
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:21,390
And again, this is an increase in the number of risk loss, and it's not due to any one particular T or single nucleotide polymorphisms.

77
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,040
In the case of letter D, so that's why that was the correct answer.

78
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:38,850
So I went back, I had mistakenly had a as the correct answer here, which was wrong and I didn't find this.

79
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,120
Why is everybody getting two out of three? And I went back and I, I don't know,

80
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:51,419
I didn't I didn't save my I didn't save my selection of C When I was uploading the correct answers for the quiz, I went back and I changed.

81
00:11:51,420 --> 00:12:00,200
Everybody is great, so everybody's grades should be correct. Now she sent me an email and I'll take your yes many letters to clarify.

82
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,440
A polyclinic and common obesity are the same thing.

83
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:12,090
Pretty much. Okay. Very, pretty much, yes. Many results adding up to increase our associated increase in BMI.

84
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,430
Yes. Okay.

85
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:23,490
Today, we're going to talk about early life exposures. And in terms of learning objectives,

86
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:29,910
you need to be able to explain the importance of early life exposures in metabolic to metabolic health later on in life.

87
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,809
And in the cases examples I'm going to give you today,

88
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:43,230
it's either undernutrition or overnutrition that can lead to a greater risk of metabolic issues later in life related to greater adiposity,

89
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,740
related to greater risk of metabolic disease and so on.

90
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,980
And there are many studies that have been done in animals and there have been cohort

91
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,140
studies where they followed people and human studies to demonstrate these principles.

92
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:06,700
So the mechanism seems to be driven by this epigenetic modification.

93
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,160
So you should be able to identify different types of epigenetic modification mechanisms.

94
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:23,300
You should be able to describe the importance of the timing of the exposure and famine as the example here on the metabolic disease later in life.

95
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:31,230
And then we'd like you to understand the impact of maternal Western diet, exposure on offspring,

96
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:38,490
metabolic outcomes and hepatic inflammatory mediators, and that the example here would be that we'll be the non-human primates.

97
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:49,110
This is a colony of of attacks that have been given a Western style diet most of their lives, and then they follow them after they become pregnant.

98
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:56,610
We follow them, the offspring, and look at how that experience in utero affected their metabolic health.

99
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:10,459
So. So just to establish the importance of this kind of work of genetics and the prevalence of obesity,

100
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:14,900
obesity and diabetes influenced by genetics and environment, we've discussed this already.

101
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,490
So parents with obesity and their offspring, there's an increased risk of obesity in the offspring.

102
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:30,920
And this is associated with a greater likelihood of the offspring having a higher BMI.

103
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:40,280
However, this is not an explanation for what we're seeing today, an increase in the average BMI, the U.S. and other developed countries.

104
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:47,630
So if we looked at the prevalence of obesity in 1916, it was about 13%.

105
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:59,420
During the most recent data from the enhanced data set, the prevalence of obesity was 42% in the United States.

106
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,280
Our genes haven't changed very much during this period of time,

107
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:10,130
so there's got to be other explanations as to why we're seeing this increase

108
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:15,019
in the prevalence of obesity and metabolic diseases like type two diabetes.

109
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,870
That can't be explained by our changes in genetics.

110
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:29,180
Perhaps it can we can gain some insight into epigenetic modifications that may have occurred during this time.

111
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:44,660
So the idea that your genome can be affected by exposures in your adult in utero is ideas that have been developed in the past 50 to 60 years or so.

112
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:51,469
And this type of work falls under this umbrella of the developmental origins of health and disease.

113
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:56,210
Or. Go ahead. How many of you have heard about this before?

114
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:03,920
Okay. How many of you have watched the video on The Hunger Winter that I posted?

115
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,750
Just a couple of you. Have you seen it before? Have you seen this before? Some of you are shaking your head.

116
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:20,300
Yes. Okay. So those experiences in utero can have significant impacts on the metabolic conditions later in life.

117
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:28,050
So um, these early life exposures ah do ah occur within, um,

118
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:35,370
in utero and they can affect growth patterns, they can affect all kinds of different things,

119
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:49,080
as we'll see in terms of risk of diabetes, risk of heart disease, level of adiposity, blood lipid levels and so on.

120
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:55,350
So these early life experiences are significant, um, in a number of ways.

121
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:07,840
So that this would be considered a risk factor in terms of whether you're exposed to conditions

122
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:16,540
which it may experience during the famine or overnutrition in the case of having excess lipids,

123
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:26,680
excess blood glucose present in utero. Either of these conditions can promote a greater risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease later in life.

124
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:41,430
So why? What happens? It's actually the most vulnerable period of life is during the first 1000 days of life.

125
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:46,930
So changes that can occur during the first thousand days of life are significant.

126
00:17:48,880 --> 00:18:00,070
And then the exposures that I mentioned, it's either undernutrition or overnutrition, and it's the metabolites within the blood that reach the fetus.

127
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:06,340
It can be in the form of not having enough macronutrients protein.

128
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:13,900
For example, in the case of undernutrition, it can be excess glucose and excess lipid in the case of overnutrition.

129
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:31,080
So there's now quite a bit of evidence for the environment and the cumulative

130
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:37,379
effects of lifestyle and mental factors on genetic epigenetic susceptibility.

131
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:45,510
Again, these are modifications to DNA that can affect protein expression later in life.

132
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:55,010
So the lifestyle and environment factors act together in a tissue specific manner and manner,

133
00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:02,670
and the offspring memorize these encounters and the memorization comes in the form of epigenetic modification.

134
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,430
I'm going to give you three examples as to how that occurs as we go through the lecture today.

135
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,530
So. Here.

136
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:23,070
Here are more examples. Genetic, gestational diabetes, obesity, chemical exposure and undernutrition.

137
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:31,550
So at one time there was a flurry of research done and chemical exposure in the form of this phenol.

138
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:43,290
A bisphenol A is a plasticizer agent used in plastic containers, and there was a flurry of research done to assess the impact of this.

139
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:51,479
Finally, on the epigenetic modifications that occurred in subsequent offspring to determine whether or

140
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,940
not that influenced whether or not the offspring develop and evolve disease later in life.

141
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,960
Now in human studies, it was difficult to decipher.

142
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:13,560
Was it the exposure to the external age or was it exposure to food that was contaminated with this phenomenon?

143
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:18,360
And if you consume more fluid, you get more bisphenol A.

144
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:30,770
So it was difficult to separate those two human and human studies and a number of studies were conducted in which we would feed mice.

145
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,740
These were studies done in mice. You take mice and you take two different groups.

146
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:44,190
You had one group consuming a control diet and another group consuming a diet that had just been substituted through.

147
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:53,250
You had increasing doses in different groups, so you'd feed the mothers and then the mothers would get pregnant,

148
00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:01,709
and then you would follow the offspring of those mothers after they reached a certain age,

149
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:06,450
and you would measure all kinds of things, your body size, how much adipose tissue they had,

150
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:11,130
what glucose levels were different, whether their blood lipid levels were different, and so on.

151
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:20,580
And if you were to just do this in wild type mice, you found that there were differences,

152
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,760
but there weren't differences that looked like bisphenol A was contributing to

153
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:35,010
greater adiposity in the offspring or greater problems with glucose homeostasis.

154
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:42,540
There were things that came out from these studies that Anderson did, one of these studies published in 2013,

155
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:57,450
and she found that there were differences in the male and female pups after birth in terms of their activity levels, in terms of their body size.

156
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:01,829
But it wasn't in the way you would think bisphenol A, if anything,

157
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:07,080
had an effect on having offspring that might have a little bit of lower body weight.

158
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,800
But it was a sex specific effect and a dose dependent effect.

159
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:21,600
So in wild type animals didn't seem to explain this contributing to greater metabolic disease and obesity in the offspring.

160
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:34,170
And then there are a number of cohort studies done looking at exposure and to bisphenol A and the way they could tell if you were exposed to sunlight,

161
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:38,280
it would take blood samples at different stages in life.

162
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,079
So if you had a cohort study and you had Biobank, all of these blood,

163
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,280
you could follow them and you can look at the levels of Bisphenol-A in their blood

164
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,859
and see if that higher levels were associated with greater adiposity issues,

165
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,900
with blood, glucose control and so on. And there was confounding there.

166
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:02,759
You know, people who who have greater adiposity have a greater intake of total calories.

167
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,690
So they could have also an increase in the sun exposure.

168
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:11,430
And it was difficult to divide from that or to pass it up or to show causality.

169
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:18,140
The animal studies showed, for the most part, no, it doesn't seem to be the cause.

170
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,140
The human study showed this this compound effects.

171
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:29,490
So this is the point of the story is it's difficult to tell what's going on with the later offspring.

172
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:37,020
You have to do both studies using animal models and you have to look at cohort studies to be able to answer this question.

173
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:43,170
Yes, because no question about this is evidence for parental environment.

174
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:49,169
So what would it be specifically the maternal environment during pregnancy?

175
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:56,790
Yes. Okay. So the maternal environment would be in the case of overnutrition or undernutrition.

176
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:03,040
So limit access to calories. Lots of calories or a limited number of calories.

177
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:07,630
So abundance of calories or famine. So that's the maternal environment.

178
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,290
Now that's going to affect what's going on in utero.

179
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,710
Yeah, I'm just wondering about like because parental. So if it's only maternal.

180
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:29,709
So because a lot of sort of both both this can affect this effect can be influenced by the environmental conditions in which the males the parents,

181
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:39,160
both parents, male and female. There's more evidence and literature for the maternal exposures and the paternal exposures.

182
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:46,720
Okay. But there are other are like it could possibly epigenetic inheritance can have some fathers.

183
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:54,620
Yes. Just one. Yeah. FOSTER You said 1000 days, the first 1000 days.

184
00:24:54,620 --> 00:25:03,950
That includes the president. Yes. It's not even that is the health of the sperms and eggs to get around, even try it.

185
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:07,230
I'll show you a diagram that explains this. Yeah.

186
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:26,900
So the mechanisms that I'm going to describe here are in the form of epigenetic inheritance, DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNA.

187
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:41,160
So epigenetic modifications are modifications to DNA that you can either turn on or turn off the expression of a protein.

188
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:51,130
It can reduce or permit overproduction of a gene products without changing the gene sequence.

189
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:57,070
So the genes are the same. They're just modified so that they increase or decrease.

190
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:04,110
And then here are the three different mechanisms that I'm going to go to.

191
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:13,770
You going to start here with that methylation and then we're going to talk about the other two histone modification and RNA associated signs.

192
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:23,840
So DNA methylation, the DNA is methylated and the methylation of DNA results on gene silenced.

193
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:35,540
So the more methylation you have, the less the product of that gene is produced and the methylation actually occurs on the cyst,

194
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,750
mostly on the cysteine and bloody basis.

195
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,270
And within a gene, you have what are known as CPG islands.

196
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:55,879
These are segments of DNA that are rich in cytosine and guanine, and they can be hyper methylated or hypo methylated or hyper methylated.

197
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:01,010
You're going to get less of that protein product of that particular gene or hypo methylated.

198
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,840
That gene is going to be more active, producing more of its protein.

199
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:16,940
And that effects the epigenetic modification through methylation and persist.

200
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:22,370
It can persist if a cell divides. So the daughter cells will have that modification.

201
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:29,930
And this type of inheritance can be passed from parent to child.

202
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:48,030
So here's a chromosome. And within this chromosome, you have a gene.

203
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:57,500
And this is a simple diagram explaining what happens in terms of epigenetic modification through methylation.

204
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,980
So as I mentioned,

205
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:18,260
if there's decreased or no methylation that gene can have that you can become more active if that particular segment of the gene is methylated.

206
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:24,860
It can inhibit gene expression. So gene expression has increased with no methylation or low methylation.

207
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:29,070
And it's inhibited with an increase in methylation.

208
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:34,910
So how does this work? What is the mechanism?

209
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:46,400
So different experiences in terms of the external environment can affect the activity of methyltransferase enzymes.

210
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:57,770
So DNA methyltransferase or DNA motifs, these are enzymes that are influenced by these different types of exposures.

211
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:08,450
So it's this enzyme that can methylated this particular portion of sustainable honey that can affect gene regulation.

212
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:15,550
Yes, but technically it can stop, too.

213
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:21,770
Like if a change happens and then exposure stops, sometimes it stops too, right?

214
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:29,750
So, yeah. So if the exposure stops, does the inheritance stop what you're asking for?

215
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:38,209
Yeah. How would. How would you test that or. No. That's where I'm kind of like, is that an unknown?

216
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:43,100
Or whether or not you can change this level of methylation.

217
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:48,710
So the answer is, in some circumstances, yes, you can.

218
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:53,599
So this has been done in animal studies. I can't I can't remember.

219
00:29:53,600 --> 00:30:03,080
I can't quote a human study where you can give methyl donors to increase this type of a pattern

220
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:12,170
and then you can provide inhibitors of this enzyme that can decrease the level of methylation.

221
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:19,140
And this has been done in animal models. I don't know if it's been done in human in human circumstance.

222
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,670
I don't think so. Okay. So we don't know yet.

223
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:34,080
We know that methylation does happen, but we don't know precisely if it stops or not or if the changes are not reversible.

224
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,030
Right. Whether you can reverse it with some kind of a treatment.

225
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:46,820
So in my. Yeah. You know, people have experiments have done this where they've inhibited that methyltransferase enzyme.

226
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:51,260
You can you can get a free agent that does that and it works in humans.

227
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:56,030
I'm not aware of a of a trial that's been done to do this.

228
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:07,820
That that brings to mind what conditions would you have methyl donors that can enhance this response?

229
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:18,169
So in this country and other and other developed nations are given or suggested

230
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:23,880
to take a supplement of vitamin and mineral supplement during pregnancy.

231
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,470
Right. And that's that provides them with enough iron.

232
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:40,130
It provides them with enough micronutrients to produce issues with the baby's health later in life.

233
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:48,560
Some of these supplements are met with orders so they could potentially increase inflation of

234
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:54,650
certain genes and through this epigenetic mechanism have an effect on that baby later in life.

235
00:31:55,430 --> 00:32:03,890
So that practice has been called into question with of the levels of micronutrients that have been provided with that supplement.

236
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:11,059
So you have prenatal vitamins, prenatal vitamins.

237
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:18,850
So you have you have folic acid, you have iron, you have component development.

238
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:28,040
And I can't remember which of the other other things that are in there that are potential methyl donors that can enhance this response.

239
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,630
So the first thousand days, this is what I'm sure he was asking about.

240
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:43,240
So why is this a vulnerable period of time?

241
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:53,350
Well, this particular figure is an explanation of what happens in regard to DNA methylation level.

242
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,140
So here on the Y axis, you have a higher degree of methylation are lower degree of isolation,

243
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:03,400
and then the sperm and then the oocytes, the degree of methylation is high.

244
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,240
So the epigenome is stable.

245
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:15,760
During fertilization demethylation occurs and in the egg, in the sperm,

246
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,010
the process of demethylation is a little bit different in the maternal or the

247
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:25,690
active or the methylation in the sperm occurs through a different mechanism,

248
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:29,920
occurs through this tete mediated enzyme.

249
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:41,290
So this is an enzyme that is responsible for demethylation of these nucleotides in the maternal or in the oocyte.

250
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:49,170
The demethylation occurs through a passive more of a passive dilution of the DNA methyltransferase enzymes.

251
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:53,250
So the mechanisms that are a little bit different. But the same thing happens.

252
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,890
There's a pattern, overall pattern of demethylation that occurs.

253
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:02,950
So you have the zygote forming blastocysts and this is pre-implantation.

254
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:12,940
So this would be a very vulnerable time for manipulation of the level of methylation and in the early part of pregnancy.

255
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:18,910
So after implantation, things change a lot.

256
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,889
After implantation,

257
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:33,460
there's a high degree of de novo methylation and this is mediated by an increased activity of these DNA methyltransferase enm t three energy.

258
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,120
So their activity increases dramatically after implantation.

259
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,820
So you get higher degree of methylation.

260
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:56,120
Methylation shuts down the protein synthesis in certain genes, and then after a period of time, the methylation status is maintained.

261
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,820
And so you get somatic cell maintenance of methylation throughout life.

262
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:07,300
Okay. But there's also the germ cells,

263
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:15,100
the primordial germ cells where you can have active or passive demethylation occurring as a consequence of these exposures.

264
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:26,230
So in that way, in that mechanism, you can have a particular epigenetic modification that can not only affect the subsequent generation,

265
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:30,580
but one generation by two or three and so on.

266
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:41,380
So that epigenetic modification happens in terms of the primary germ cells, then that can be carried on through subsequent generations.

267
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:57,800
Yeah it's Y-axis a rate or like an absolute amount its it says here level so it's a level of methylation.

268
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,090
So it's it's it's a.

269
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:10,580
A representation that is easy to explain in this diagram in terms of the absolute level,

270
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:17,240
in terms of what percentage of genes are methylated and methylated.

271
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:21,410
I don't know exactly. It's not zero and 100%, let's just say that.

272
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:33,140
So that's one way these epigenetic modifications can occur.

273
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:38,360
The other one is through histone modification. So what is a histone?

274
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,940
Histone is kind of like a spool, which DNA wraps around.

275
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,850
And within this histone, there are eight different subunits.

276
00:36:48,200 --> 00:37:01,340
And within the complex, like the DNA wraps around it, like a wire around the spool, and that histone units can be insulated or methylated.

277
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:05,750
And this affects how tightly the DNA wraps around the system.

278
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:15,680
So that the degree to which the DNA wraps around histone or the binding to the DNA effects,

279
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:27,440
it's whether or not that DNA can be transcribed so that you can have active or

280
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:34,130
silence parts of the gene based on the association of the histone with the DNA.

281
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:38,960
Here's a picture of this. So here's the chromosome.

282
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:43,970
And here is heterochromatin. This is silent DNA.

283
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:51,050
And you have here histones now that are tightly bound to DNA.

284
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:58,760
And you have methylation at certain sites within these molecules making them.

285
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:05,930
These genes now aren't going to be producing proteins as a consequence of this interaction.

286
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:13,070
Can you chromatin you have more active genes and a new chromatin?

287
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:18,860
The examples here are these particular sites and that histones have been isolated.

288
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:27,080
So these isolations now open up these segments of DNA now that can allow translation.

289
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:39,560
So anything that affects or can modify the histone now can also affect whether or not you get translation of a gene or not.

290
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:44,570
So this is another mechanism, another epigenetic mechanism.

291
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:02,090
Okay. Irony silencing. I don't have a nice, handy simplified figure to explain this.

292
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:10,150
I'm just going to use bullet points. So Ana's messenger RNA is the message for protein.

293
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:24,069
In the ribosomes, that message is turned into protein. Well, with RNA associated silencing, you have the RNA that aren't translated into protein.

294
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:35,350
These are transcripts of RNA that are in the antisense transcripts that can stop translation of a protein,

295
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:43,270
or they can code be noncoding, they can pick and form RNA that just interfere with other RNA.

296
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:51,220
So if you're not forming a protein and other words, they don't result in the formation of a protein.

297
00:39:52,320 --> 00:40:03,270
So they interact with DNA and it can cause methylation at CPG islands and they can also interfere with

298
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:10,320
histone configuration to produce heterochromatin and make the DNA bind more tightly to a histone.

299
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:17,820
So RNA associated gene silencing can occur through all of these different mechanisms.

300
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:35,140
So how do we study this and a relevant model system?

301
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:39,910
Well, with humans, this is really difficult.

302
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:50,260
So what's been done is to harvest the umbilical cord and isolate cells from that familial part.

303
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,890
So many times when women deliver their baby, the mother or father will be asked.

304
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:04,570
We would like to keep the placenta and the umbilical cord because these tissues are valuable for research.

305
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:09,010
Do you give your consent for us to do that? You can give your consent or not.

306
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:15,010
And from the umbilical cord, you can harvest these kinds of stem cells.

307
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:21,850
These are cells that can differentiate into other cell types under the right conditions.

308
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:26,590
So you isolate these stem cells from the umbilical cord.

309
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:34,230
And you culture them in conditions that can drive them towards becoming, in this case, a muscle cell.

310
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:43,770
And so your culture and conditions that give you a mild blast or a pre adipocytes.

311
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:54,400
So you can have the culture conditions now that can allow the differentiation of either way.

312
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:07,510
So in this particular example. You have stem cells now that have been taken from women who have a BMI 30 and over.

313
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:18,760
And in these individuals, the level of this transcription factor, beta catenin is reduced as a consequence.

314
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:25,330
These massive kind of stem cells have a greater tendency to form creative insights.

315
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:36,709
And there have been studies looking at now markers of a dip of Genesis and potentially how this

316
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:44,390
stem cell now has the intrauterine environment been directed to form more adipose tissue?

317
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:50,700
So they contain it as a transcription factor that affects a type of genesis.

318
00:42:51,570 --> 00:43:02,280
It essentially can promote our downregulation of a beta Catenin can promote more active Genesis.

319
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:12,180
And you have more lipid content in the bio site and the same types of cells.

320
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:18,000
So you get some cells that are now becoming skeletal muscle cells eventually.

321
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,200
And even in these cells you have higher lipid content.

322
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:26,550
In both cases you have more oxidative stress.

323
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:35,550
And interestingly, there's less oxidation of the lipids and these cells that go on to become muscle cells.

324
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:40,110
And then there's a reduction in the energy sensing pathways.

325
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:43,680
So the AMP guidance pathway that you've talked about at 630,

326
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:55,109
it's expression is decreased in this scenario so that the portion of this particular figure,

327
00:43:55,110 --> 00:44:01,800
I have expanded this diagram of this explanation so it's easy to see.

328
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:08,880
So is our human umbilical cord derived some kind of stem cells from infants born to mothers with obesity?

329
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:17,549
And in this diagram you have a star here and the star indicates some epigenetic modification

330
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:23,400
that occurs to these different enzymes that affects how these cells handle lipids.

331
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:29,520
So you have a decrease, decreases in energy sensing pathways.

332
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,780
And here you see stars next to these molecules.

333
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:43,919
AMP kinase is lookalike carboxylic carboxylic acid carnitine polymer oil transferase attracts a lipid inside the lot of

334
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:55,890
concrete and these are differentially expressed are the modifications occur in more readily in women with a BMI 30 and over.

335
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:05,370
So these modifications are increased methylation of genes indicated by the stars that affect myocardial

336
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:12,660
and that affect the transport of the lipids into the mitochondria affecting fatty acid oxidation.

337
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:16,379
And if you look at the percent fat mass at birth,

338
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:23,730
you'll find a higher level of fat match in infants born to mothers with a BMI of 30 and over compared to women who don't have a BMI of 30.

339
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:33,350
So it's through these types of experiments that we it has been determined that this higher

340
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:42,590
level of of macronutrients that would be present at birth would affect the production of.

341
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:50,450
I should say that the utilization of lipids and the size of the adipose tissue and the infants.

342
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:55,940
And this is how this these types of experiments were done.

343
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:13,479
Okay. So this is a summary. Some of the human animal stem cells have been searched for two infants born to mothers with obesity.

344
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,010
There's a cell specific program,

345
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:22,780
differences in infant stem cell metabolism and mitochondrial function that correspond to differences in body composition at birth.

346
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:26,920
They predict changes in adiposity gain in these infants.

347
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:39,399
And this model is used to persist specifically identify metabolites as important biomarkers in infants and address efficacy of interventions,

348
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,420
studies and others.

349
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:51,100
I haven't seen any of these intervention studies mothers, so I can't tell you if these mechanisms can be inhibited through these types of studies.

350
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,600
At the very end of the video on the hunger research test, said,

351
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:14,979
GROSS describes a study that she's going to start looking at interventions with a population of pregnant women to affect the epigenome,

352
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:21,180
perhaps, and whether or not that can decrease risk of metabolic disease later in life.

353
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:27,430
But I looked for some of her studies and she's looked at exposures to things like aspirin and some drugs.

354
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:40,239
But I didn't find anything that looked at this idea of epigenetic changes in utero and how it affected metabolic health later in life,

355
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,320
specifically related to famine and overnutrition.

356
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:55,590
So it's hoped that this is a way to address major gaps in understanding cell specific biochemical

357
00:47:55,590 --> 00:48:00,630
and epigenetic developmental programing of childhood obesity and risk later in life.

358
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:09,930
So these are some ideas. What about real human studies and is there evidence to support this notion?

359
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:16,710
At that time, excuse me, the intrauterine environment has an impact on the metabolic health later in life.

360
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:28,160
So the first example was just looking at stem cells and its association with metabolic infants.

361
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:33,420
This next study is looking at human data, looking at human populations.

362
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:40,030
And so there is some evidence for epigenetic modification in human cohort studies.

363
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:49,210
And these DNA modifications are associated with what's going on in the environment

364
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:55,120
and it can result in adverse outcomes for the offspring at birth and later in life.

365
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:08,320
The evidence is associated, however, and we it's difficult to prove in a proving that this is a cause or a consequence or an association.

366
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:21,580
So let's look at the history of the Dutch famine or the hunger winter that was referred to that occurred in between 1944 and 1945.

367
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:32,430
So during this period of time, during the Second World War, there was occupation of the Netherlands.

368
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:37,200
And that's what's shown here, despite our color. The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany.

369
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:45,540
And this famine occurred after the D-Day invasion of France.

370
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:54,540
So the allied forces were making their way into northern Europe, liberating countries from German occupation.

371
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:08,520
And during this time, there was a mission now to cross the Rhine River and liberate the rest of the Netherlands.

372
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:14,040
Well, this operation, Operation Market Start, failed.

373
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:25,500
And during this operation, the authorities within the Netherlands asked the railroad people who controlled

374
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:30,510
that the trains coming in and out of this portion of the Netherlands to stop.

375
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:40,350
And what that did is it affected the the German army's ability to fight the allied advance.

376
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:48,750
And as a consequence of this failure, the Germans still occupied most of the Netherlands.

377
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:55,440
And as retribution for shutting down the railroads,

378
00:50:57,030 --> 00:51:03,149
the German authorities shut down the distribution of food by stopping any trains

379
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:07,500
from getting into this region of the Netherlands for this period of time.

380
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:11,970
And this was right about the time when winter started.

381
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:31,200
So here is a diagram showing you the distribution of food rations, calories per day from the Western Netherlands, and it goes from 1941 to 1945.

382
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:34,380
So during the war, food was limited.

383
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:46,710
People were given ration cards and they were allowed to buy food based on how much how many calories they were allotted on a daily or weekly basis.

384
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:54,149
So whenever you went to buy food, living in occupied Netherlands, you had to have a ration card in order to buy food.

385
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:59,970
And there was a black market for things. So but for the most part, people were living under these circumstances.

386
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:11,410
So here is the total caloric allotment during the ration system from 1941 to 1945.

387
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:18,850
So based on evidence that they had, they could calculate the amount of calories from carbohydrates,

388
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,090
fats and protein that were available during this time.

389
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:35,410
And you notice during the third and fourth quarter of 1944, there was this sudden drop in calories that were available to the population.

390
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:38,470
And this was known as the hunger.

391
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:46,120
This occurred during the very cold or before and during the very cold winter during the end of the war.

392
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,820
And it lasted for 3 to 4 months.

393
00:52:50,380 --> 00:53:01,540
And then after the liberation of the Netherlands, the rationing stopped and they were able to get more food and consume more calories.

394
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:14,180
So there have been a lot of studies done with this cohort of babies born during this time period.

395
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:21,080
So the environment for the parents here was the famine.

396
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:25,640
And so women experienced famine between 1944, 1945.

397
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:32,840
So the children of women who were pregnant during the famine were included in the study.

398
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:43,550
And there were, in this particular cohort, about 2400 term singletons born alive between November 1943.

399
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,730
And February 1947. And this was in the city of Amsterdam.

400
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:58,129
And they have detailed records about all kinds of things in regard to the pregnancy, the size of the the size of the placenta,

401
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:04,730
the size of the baby at birth and subsequent birth weeks after this particular period of time.

402
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:11,030
They also have information about these babies 50 and 60 years later.

403
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:20,480
So they followed up this cohort of babies born during this time when they were 52, 58, 62,

404
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:27,620
68, and they evaluated a bunch of health outcomes based on their exposure to the famine.

405
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:46,700
So within this cohort, they divided up the exposure period into different times when that corresponding to the different periods of pregnancy.

406
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:54,590
So here's the time period that we're looking at from November 43 to February 47.

407
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,090
So this is where they collected a lot of this data.

408
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:06,360
So they have data in terms of calories consumed, birth weight and so on, before the famine and after the famine.

409
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:13,290
And within this cohort, they have babies were born or exposed to the famine.

410
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:16,500
They're born during that during this period of time.

411
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:25,020
They were exposed to the period of famine between November 44 and here later in 1945.

412
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,430
So this is the period of famine.

413
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:39,360
And the three different groups that they studied in regard to exposure to the famine where the babies were exposed in utero during late gestation.

414
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:46,340
Mid gestation for early in gestation. So here's the exposure to the famine.

415
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:55,680
And here are the three different groups. I don't go on the scent of leave me early.

416
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:03,930
So the famine occurring here during this particular time so this is conception is back here.

417
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:10,950
So their exposure to the famine was during the last three months here.

418
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:20,240
They were exposed in the middle. So here's the exposure right here to the famine during gestation and then for the early group.

419
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:24,380
They were exposed early during pregnancy and.

420
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:30,440
So the gray boxes correspond to birds.

421
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:46,620
So this is a graph showing you the birth weights based on the period of time that the pregnancies occurred within the family.

422
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:53,340
So this is the baby's weight in kilograms on the x axis.

423
00:56:55,230 --> 00:57:03,780
And so this is the average wait and they don't show error bars here and they wish they would for before the famine.

424
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:15,750
And then here are the pregnancies that were they had exposure to the famine, late gestation gestation or you see low birth weight in these babies.

425
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:28,250
The babies that were exposed to the famine in early gestation had a normal birth weight and those that were occurred after the famine,

426
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:31,940
they also had a normal birth weight, perhaps a little bit higher than before.

427
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:37,820
The fact, perhaps due to the rationing of calories during this particular period of time during World War Two.

428
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:48,970
So low birth weight for those exposed late gestation, normal birth weight for those who are exposed in early gestation.

429
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:56,370
When they followed up this cohort at age 50,

430
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:10,710
the time of exposure to famine was associated with different types of higher prevalence of certain types of conditions 50 years later.

431
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:17,910
So that exposure to the famine occurred in late gestation.

432
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:31,209
You might see some glucose intolerance, perhaps pre-diabetes is associated with late gestational exposure, gestation exposure.

433
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:39,910
You had glucose intolerance as well as macro albuminuria, which is a condition where there's moderate levels of albumin in the urine.

434
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:46,210
But exactly, sure. How that could have been affected by this exposure to the famine.

435
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:57,520
Yeah. So malnutrition during pregnancy can affect kidney function and perhaps.

436
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:07,410
Yeah, possibly. Interesting it this not it was not mentioned as an early gestational defect, which is really interesting.

437
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:17,280
Also, what she was more common in those who were exposed at gestation is more obstructive pulmonary disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

438
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:22,740
I wonder if that's indicating adjustments are adjustments because I mean,

439
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:26,910
depending on the developmental stage, you may get to the point you can't fix it.

440
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:31,420
Yeah. Or you may adapt to it. Perhaps.

441
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:35,390
Perhaps. And this is this is very complex interactions going on here.

442
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,209
So these are some generalizations. You know, there's a lot, lot here.

443
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:42,210
These are just generalized all in this cohort. What do we find?

444
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:52,830
Yes. That what you're saying is true. So those exposed early gestation had more issues related to metabolic health outcomes.

445
00:59:53,400 --> 01:00:01,500
Yeah, there was glucose intolerance, but there was also a significantly higher level of a pathogenic lipid profile.

446
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:06,759
Altered blood clot, coagulation, obesity just just in.

447
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:19,479
Women, though, in an interesting light, a greater stress sensitivity in this cohort is a greater prevalence of heart disease or greater incidence,

448
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:26,410
I should say heart disease, breast cancer in women. They looked at things like food preferences.

449
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:30,940
There was a greater preference for fatty foods in this individuals in this cohort.

450
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:38,350
And there is also an association between lower cognitive scores and this group followed up 50 years later.

451
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:46,910
So these were some observations made in the hope and diverse cohorts of those who were exposed late gestation.

452
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:59,710
So it's really hard to pin down a mechanism with these cohort studies that show that these exposures in utero do something.

453
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,129
But putting that down to a mechanism is really difficult.

454
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:10,390
So you collect samples, you have blood from these individuals and you look for different things and you're trying to find differences.

455
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:19,270
And one of the things that they looked for in terms of differences in regard to epigenetics was methylation status with different genes.

456
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:30,640
So this is a really complicated figure and we're looking at preconception exposure and exposure, late gestation.

457
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:35,160
So they're trying to show their differences.

458
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:43,799
And when the babies were exposed to the famine and they're looking at in grain

459
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:50,250
here during the period of rationing both grass and then changes in methylation.

460
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:56,200
So there's a change percent exposed versus unexposed siblings.

461
01:01:56,220 --> 01:02:05,610
What is that? So his zero and zero refers to a no change in methylation status or no difference, I should say, in methylation status.

462
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:15,240
So for these studies, they had the baby that was born after exposure to the famine,

463
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:24,720
and then you had a sibling that was born after the famine, and they're comparing the methylation status between those two pairs.

464
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:39,600
So within this particular set of pairs, siblings, you see that there's a modest difference here in terms of the methylation status.

465
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:47,970
There's hypermethylation here and one particular gene, it's some growth factor two.

466
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:58,830
So it's 5% less methylation and it's between individuals prenatally exposed to famine and their same sex siblings.

467
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:12,069
Here. When we're looking at the date of birth, we're looking at children that were were not exposed early in gestation and we're

468
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:17,830
not seeing a significant difference and methylation status of this particular gene.

469
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,980
So this 5% change now.

470
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:28,740
It doesn't seem like a lot. And exactly what that means in terms of IGF.

471
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:36,090
Well, the IGF two gene provides instructions for making a protein called insulin like growth factor two.

472
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:41,060
And this protein plays an essential role in growth and development before birth.

473
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:55,350
What other evidence do we have that there was some kind of a change in the epigenome to babies that were born to men during this period of famine?

474
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:02,720
Well, here we gather again, siblings discordant for preconception exposure.

475
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,110
So you have those that were sibling pairs.

476
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:13,050
Same family is more exposed or babies were exposed during the famine and those reported the same mothers after the famine.

477
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:18,900
And we're looking at within pair differences in terms of methylation patterns.

478
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:23,300
And within this study they found some differences.

479
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:34,980
And the different color bars correspond to different genes that are responsible for the protein in this case.

480
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:39,300
And this is an anti-inflammatory cytokine. This is all of them.

481
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:43,950
Red, which corresponds to a noncoding RNA.

482
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:50,230
So the methylation patterns here would be an increase, right?

483
01:04:50,910 --> 01:05:00,030
And then there's a decrease in the methylation pattern for this insulin like growth factor shown for all of them, less methylation.

484
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:04,530
And when you are exposed as babies and a little bit less women,

485
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:13,320
and then the blue corresponds to the methylation difference and left it to the left in genes.

486
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:29,780
So here we have for all of them it's. Those expect exposed to the defendant had more methylation, a greater degree in men and not so much in women.

487
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:35,370
And then there are some other differences here that were related to metabolic health,

488
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:45,240
the ATP binding consent subfamily member a this is is responsible for cholesterol transport let's see this here

489
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:52,140
when we look at just men and women and then maternally expressed three non-coding RNA here and in yellow.

490
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:59,130
So these are the kinds of epigenetic changes that they observed in some of these cohort studies.

491
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:11,220
Student They put forward a reason that those leptin genes so sex dependent do they not cause any.

492
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:15,780
I don't I don't know if there's a good explanation for that.

493
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:28,480
It's really interesting that. So that would suggest that you'd get more methylation so there'd be less mess, less left and produced in those.

494
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:35,559
And there's less leptin, a certain level of adiposity that would be less sensitive,

495
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:46,120
or they would produce less leptin at any level of adipose tissue, suggesting that that signal to turn off appetite would be reduced potentially.

496
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:52,450
Right, in many, many years because.

497
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:57,330
And one earlier, it said obesity was only in women.

498
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:01,830
Yeah. So that's the kind of messy data that you get with cohort studies.

499
01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:08,309
You see these two changes and then you see these outcomes and it's really hard to explain their associations.

500
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:12,389
That's what you can you can what you can get from these cohort studies.

501
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:19,560
You can show that you can say, yes, there's an association and perhaps this might be a mechanism, but we don't have cause and effect.

502
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:25,810
Demonstrating causality is difficult. Okay.

503
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:32,589
So that's human studies, right? And then and an animal studies in rodents,

504
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:40,900
you can restrict food during this these same periods of time and you can show the same kind of thing in mice.

505
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:48,310
In this case, they're looking at food restriction during pregnancy, in rodents.

506
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:56,530
And in this particular example, the offspring have more fat cells and they have fewer muscle cells.

507
01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:07,399
That as the mice grow into adulthood and you feed them a calorically rich diet,

508
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:15,530
either high fat or high sugar and fat, the mice now have a greater susceptibility to obesity and diabetes.

509
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:19,400
Now, there's no BMI in mice.

510
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:24,710
There's no cutoffs for obesity in mice. You just look at the level of adiposity.

511
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:36,230
So there was greater adiposity in these animals that were exposed to the restriction of food, the mothers being restricted to food.

512
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:46,340
So this type of a relationship, you know, when he asked the question was this is just the mothers or is it the mothers and fathers?

513
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:51,890
If you if you look at the influence of fathers in this case,

514
01:08:52,430 --> 01:09:01,250
the mice were fed a calorically rich diet and, um, and they were fed also a low protein diet.

515
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:11,000
And this seemed to pass on this type of exposure, seemed to pass on a greater risk of metabolic disease later in life to the opposite.

516
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:23,540
So in these studies, you can show now you potentially have greater control in terms of being able to show cause and effect

517
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:28,940
relationships between these early life exposures and what happens to the offspring later in life.

518
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:43,830
So there is finally another set of experiments that were done in a colony of these non-human primates that were exposed to a Western style diet.

519
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:48,820
And these are a colony of Japanese macaques.

520
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:53,790
They're fed a Western style diet for 3 to 4 years, 3 to 8 years before mating.

521
01:09:54,840 --> 01:10:05,340
And the offspring were studied to assess whether or not there was a change in this developmental programing that was observed in human cohort studies,

522
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:09,900
in mouse studies. And they looked at different outcomes.

523
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:19,329
They looked at whether or not the. You don't have there's not a cutoff for obesity in nonhuman primates.

524
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:26,610
So they're looking at levels of adiposity. You can measure blood glucose levels, so you can look at whether or not they go on to develop diabetes.

525
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:34,050
And then you also can measure the amount of lipids and liver to determine whether or not this is an outcome.

526
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:41,850
And then there are some has used to examine the offspring in terms of their other mental health.

527
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:49,920
So in this study done with the Japanese macaques, they fed them these different diets.

528
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:59,370
And for these studies they looked at area under the curve for insulin to kind

529
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:08,549
of looked at looking at how responsive the offspring were to the mothers,

530
01:11:08,550 --> 01:11:12,900
I should say, works with the different types of diets. So this is a really complicated study design.

531
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:23,580
So you have a Western diet and a controlled diet or a high fat diet in this case represents the Western diet, which is 30%, 36% fat.

532
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:28,800
The control diet in this case is 14% fat. This is the maternal diet.

533
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:34,950
And then you have the maternal diet after conception and birth.

534
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:42,870
And there here's where you divide up your groups of macaques into these different treatment groups,

535
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:47,040
those that are in the high fat diet but are insulin sensitive.

536
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:50,040
This week they would have a lower end of the curve here.

537
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:57,960
Those that were given the high fat diet, their insulin resistance, that would be the cats in this group here.

538
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:13,820
And then we had a weaning and then the cats are fed a post, a diet, have maternal and post weaning, diet control, diet control, high fat diet.

539
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:17,940
And then you have the high fat diet.

540
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:22,650
Insulin sensitive, then a control diet. High fat diet.

541
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:30,570
Insulin sensitive and high fat diet. And then the high fat diet, insulin resistant control diet.

542
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:34,860
And then the high fat diet. Insulin resistant high fat diet.

543
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:38,490
So lots of different groups, six different groups in this particular study.

544
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:46,379
But what they find well, here is the very top of this graph.

545
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:53,970
And we're just looking at a liver biopsy here. We're looking at the amount of triglycerides here, comparing the control.

546
01:12:55,010 --> 01:13:03,050
With those who are fed a high fat diet, but we're insulin sensitive and actually they have a little bit less of this.

547
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:14,449
They have a little bit less of the adipose lipids within their biopsy and the those that were insulin resistant,

548
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:21,050
they had a little bit more fat within their livers.

549
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:33,229
When you look at genes that affect look at Genesis, you see this trend where those who are insulin resistant had a higher level of genes that affect

550
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:39,590
or transcripts that affect enzymes involved within the genesis pathways within the liver.

551
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:48,380
And when you take the cells out of these animals, the liver cells and you culture the hundred different conditions,

552
01:13:49,340 --> 01:14:01,100
you find that there's greater ability of these cells to produce transcripts that are involved in lipid biosynthesis within the liver cells,

553
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:11,510
isolated in the culture. And again, it depends on whether or not those that were fed a high fat diet are insulin resistant or insulin sensitive.

554
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:16,640
And the black and white bars refer to these different conditions here.

555
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:27,140
Right. I'm just wondering, like, how are you getting the Western style diet, this high fat diet?

556
01:14:27,150 --> 01:14:33,110
Because like in the piece I looked at the paper and they don't describe any change besides just the fat.

557
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:45,419
They don't say specific. And the Western style diet, like as defined by people defined it is more like fatty acid profile and refined carbohydrates.

558
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:48,540
Like it includes a lot more than just absolute. Absolutely.

559
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:57,659
It's not it's not clearly defined. There's not a there's not a fixed definition of Western style diet.

560
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:05,580
In this study, they used the high fat diet to mimic what one might experience if they were consuming a Western style diet.

561
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:11,730
Is that was that the purpose of the high fat diet, though? Because in the paper, they don't reference the Western diet at all.

562
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:15,959
Right. The purpose was to show what high fat diet,

563
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:26,190
what effect it had in utero and stuff and an on the F one generation of of offspring born to those mothers was a purpose of the high fat diet.

564
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:31,440
Yeah. Whether or not that fits strictly with the definition of a western style diet.

565
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:39,060
Yeah, I'm just. I guess my point kind of is the only conclusion you can draw from this is that a high fat diet,

566
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:44,040
you can't draw the conclusion that a Western style diet, you'd have to do a different study in order to look at that.

567
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:49,950
And then, I mean, there have been human cohort studies that have assessed the inflammatory profile of it Western diet.

568
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:54,070
But, but, I mean, it's just. I don't know.

569
01:15:54,270 --> 01:16:00,100
It's it troubles me to draw the conclusion from this study in particular,

570
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:10,419
because I feel like there's so much mis portrayal of nutrition studies in the media anyways.

571
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:17,770
I think we need to be really cautious about how we what conclusions we draw from which start you write so that the designation

572
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:27,940
of what is what what's the definition of Western style diet in terms of how you would mimic that exposure to animal models?

573
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:38,980
It depends on the species that you're working with and it depends on the phenotype that you're trying to get.

574
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:53,020
So and in a model where you're looking to produce reproducible results in order to get a high level of adiposity.

575
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:57,400
The new road model would be a 60% of that time.

576
01:16:59,110 --> 01:17:13,180
You could make that diet more similar to a Western style knife by adding more Cigarets to that would be more of a Western style,

577
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:22,150
but you wouldn't see the same level of adiposity in animals that consume the Western style stuff the high fat plus sugar,

578
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:27,190
the 45% fat plus more sucrose versus 60% fat.

579
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:30,550
So you're going to get a different result. That phenotype would be a bit different.

580
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:44,640
I don't know if these macaques now are sensitive to or would even consume a 60% fat diet or a 45% fat diet plus super.

581
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:51,550
So perhaps that's why they didn't use I don't know. So that's another detail, a level of detail that can complicate.

582
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:57,210
Conducting one of these studies and, as you said, interpreting the results of these types of sites.

583
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:04,500
Is there a low showing your exposure, high fat diet?

584
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:10,680
This is what happens. We get more liver lipids and we get more inflammatory markers.

585
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:16,110
What's the next slide? So I'm going to end.

586
01:18:16,110 --> 01:18:21,600
We're past pass up. It's a good time to end right here because we're getting close to the end.

587
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:27,600
I'll go over these next two slides because there's not going to be enough time

588
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:33,690
to completely discuss the results specifically with this particular paper.

589
01:18:36,030 --> 01:18:43,830
Within the next 2 minutes. So I'm going to stop right here and we'll return to this when we meet again on Wednesday.

590
01:18:45,030 --> 01:19:00,300
Thank you. Thank you. I am so glad to hear about that.

591
01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:12,660
I was basically going to say something like access to basically word for word.

592
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:19,310
I just uninterested in contact with the stranger.

593
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:29,240
I just don't feel like I know we don't have like that.

594
01:19:31,650 --> 01:19:35,460
I think so. Yeah, I think so.

595
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:42,410
Really? I mean, yeah.

596
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:50,010
So I was like, oh, he's like my friend.

597
01:19:52,110 --> 01:19:55,300
I don't like questions. I feel like talking like that again.

598
01:19:56,130 --> 01:19:57,770
I was not the cartographer.
