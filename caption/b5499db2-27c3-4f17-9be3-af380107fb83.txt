1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:14,130
I hope you all had a marvelous fall study break, and I hope you've also had a chance to get out and enjoy these unseasonably warm temperatures.

2
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,310
We've got to make the most of them while they last because they won't last long and up.

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,160
I assure you, an opportunity to go out and get a little bit of heat stress, perhaps our last of the year.

4
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,179
So I know we haven't been together for the past couple of weeks,

5
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,770
but hopefully we can kind of solidly emerge ourselves or immerse ourselves back into the realm of noise here.

6
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,469
We've got several more noise lectures left after this,

7
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:43,650
and then we'll have a lab session where we're going to get a chance to do some hands on activities with some noise measurement instruments.

8
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,899
I think we'll also loop back around and do some radiation measurements as well as long as we're in lab mode.

9
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:56,070
So that's a few weeks out yet. Today, though, I want to talk to you about standards and regulations.

10
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:03,200
And I'll say in occupational health and environmental health, these terms get used pretty interchangeably.

11
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,240
Technically, I think a regulation is a subset of a type of standard.

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,890
So a standard is just some sort of guideline or recommendation out there.

13
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,150
And a regulation is essentially a standard that has the force of law behind it.

14
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,720
So we're going to focus today first on occupational regulations and standards related to noise.

15
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,860
Then we're going to switch to community and then we'll wrap up today's session talking about

16
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,390
some considerations for noise in the workplace if you're working in an office setting.

17
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,090
And really my primary competency for you today is just to understand what are the criteria and

18
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,040
the considerations that go into standards and regulations that are designed to protect us.

19
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:47,280
So in terms of occupational noise exposure, we've already touched on these to some extent.

20
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:55,709
We'll go back into them in more detail today. So again, coming to the point of regulations, we've got two agencies here in the U.S., OSHA,

21
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:01,050
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and MSHA, the Mine Safety and Health Administration.

22
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:08,970
And both of these agencies have legally enforceable limits for noise exposure that are called pells permissible exposure limits.

23
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:14,490
We also have a couple of groups that put out recommendations or more best practice guidelines.

24
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:22,060
That's the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, with their recommended exposure limit for noise and then HGH.

25
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:28,650
The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists has told us are threshold limit values for noise.

26
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:36,749
When we look at community settings, there really are very few enforceable regulations, at least at the national level.

27
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,989
There are noise ordinances that exist in in some places,

28
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:46,920
but they tend to be inconsistent at the national level for community is basically what we have our recommendations for,

29
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,649
what we should keep the public under. And then when we zoom in specifically to offices and indoor environments,

30
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:59,550
there are again recommended limits designed not so much to protect our health, but to make sure we can hear in certain environments.

31
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:06,780
So before we start talking about these different sound levels, I'll just pull up this Nayak Web page here.

32
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,130
So Nyasha has built this, you know, I'll put it interactive in quotes.

33
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:19,440
It's a little bit interactive, but just in terms of kind of, let's see, calibrating ourselves to noise levels that we might find out there.

34
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:28,049
So if I click on these various links, a whisper might be 30 decibels, normal conversation might be around 60.

35
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,150
Probably a little quieter than how I'm speaking right now.

36
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:38,130
Now a ringing telephone. If you've ever seen an actual landline, telephone typically rings at about 80 decibels.

37
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,510
Hairdryers and lawnmowers tend to be, say, about 90 decibels.

38
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,260
And of course, there's lots and lots of sources that are louder than that.

39
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:52,560
So a belt sander might be 93 all the way up to, you know, potentially a jet engine at takeoff.

40
00:03:53,070 --> 00:04:01,590
That might be 140 decibels or more. So it's typically not the levels up here, 140 or 160 or 180 that we're concerned about,

41
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:07,170
because those don't typically happen in most occupational settings, maybe with the exception of the military.

42
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,299
For the most part, we're worried about levels down, say, between 70 and 90 decibels.

43
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,280
So somewhere between a little louder than normal conversation and maybe a gas powered lawnmower.

44
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,729
So I've already sort of introduced you to the notion here that you've got a

45
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,480
number of different agencies that actually regulate noise in the workplace.

46
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,870
In the US. We've talked about OSHA, we've talked about MSHA.

47
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,229
I think I'd mentioned previously in class that when OSHA was established in 1970,

48
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:48,420
Congress gave each of our 50 states the right to create their own state specific OSHA, and about half the states did that.

49
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:53,670
So in about 25 of our states, federal OSHA doesn't have jurisdiction there.

50
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,770
It's a local state, OSHA. So, for instance, here in Michigan, we have Miyoshi Michigan OSHA,

51
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:05,849
which focuses only on workplace exposures that occur in Michigan and again in about 24 other states.

52
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:13,889
We have that option, too. So we don't even have a uniform U.S. standard because OSHA and Congress have given states

53
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:19,230
the right to make a regulation for noise that's at least as protective as the federal one,

54
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,910
but it could be even more protective.

55
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:28,290
So there are some states out there that have regulations for their workers that are more protective than what the federal standard requires.

56
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:35,700
And that is totally bonkers, if you think about it, given this example, maybe in other classes of opinion,

57
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,629
you know, if you look at the intersection on the West Coast of the states of Washington,

58
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,890
Oregon and Idaho,

59
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:49,080
Washington and Oregon each have their own state OSHA plans with protection that is better than what the federal government requires for noise.

60
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:54,480
And Idaho just, you know, a few feet across the border, goes with the federal OSHA regulation.

61
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,219
So if you're an employer that has people in Washington and Idaho and Oregon,

62
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,450
it can be quite confusing to figure out, well, what is the actual regulation they're covered by?

63
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,510
So this is kind of a patchwork.

64
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,450
I means some of our workers, a few of our workers get better protection than than the vast majority that are covered by the federal government.

65
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:16,950
Also, if you work for a railroad, you're actually covered by the Federal Railroad Administration.

66
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:22,380
And if you work in the Department of Defense, each of the service branches has their own noise regulation.

67
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:29,400
So it's a pretty confusing patchwork we have here. And then we've talked about and HGH in their recommendations.

68
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:39,450
So for the purposes of simplification here, I'm really just going to compare OSHA, which is almost completely consistent with the MSHA rule.

69
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:45,989
That's a regulation. And then I'll contrast that to Nayak, which is almost identical to what HGH recommends.

70
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:51,090
So when we think about a noise exposure limit, there's a number of things we have to kind of agree on.

71
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:56,190
So one is the weighting both of these sets of agencies agree.

72
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:02,700
A weighting DBA is what we want to use. Every limit is going to have a criterion level.

73
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,719
So that's the amount of sound that you can be exposed to at exactly that level

74
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,310
for exactly 8 hours to come up with your full allowable dose for the day.

75
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,230
That's 90 decibels for OSHA and 85 for Nye Ash.

76
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:22,110
Every limit is going to have its own criterion time again. That's kind of how long is this exposure expected to occur over.

77
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,150
We talked about response time in the past, how quickly the instrument reacts to noise.

78
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:33,450
You're always safe going with slow there. Every limit is going to have its own measurement range too.

79
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:39,720
So historically, instruments just weren't capable of measuring very wide ranges of decibel levels.

80
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:47,520
So the OSHA limit, which was set back in the 1980s, says you have to measure at least 80 to 130 decibels.

81
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,240
And Nilesh, in virtually every other agency in the world says you're good, you should go at least 80 to 140 and more is better.

82
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,910
There's this concept of an exchange rate which we'll go into in more detail as we go.

83
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:07,380
But essentially, the bigger this number, the less protective the limit is at higher levels of exposure.

84
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:12,550
So OSHA uses five. Virtually every other agency in the world uses three.

85
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:19,780
OSHA specifies a ceiling, a ceiling meaning you can never exceed that level without hearing protection.

86
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:27,310
So OSHA says you can spend 15 minutes at exactly 115 decibels, basically like standing next to an ambulance siren.

87
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:35,170
But you can't spend even a fraction of a second at 115.1 or greater than that, a very kind of artificial truncation there.

88
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,480
I doesn't specify a ceiling.

89
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:47,110
And then both these sets of agencies think that 140 decibels is a meaningful level in terms of an impulsive or a very brief but very loud sound.

90
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:52,090
However, OSHA, as you see here, says you should not exceed in any time.

91
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:56,370
You're talking about a law that says you should do something that's really just a recommendation.

92
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:02,230
There's no kind of teeth behind it. They're not ash, which doesn't set laws, says you shall not exceed that.

93
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,040
So any time in a law you see the word shall, that means you have to do it this way.

94
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:13,150
So it's a little bit confusing with those two words coming from a regulator in a best practices scientific group.

95
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,010
So what else do we have to talk about when we think about a noise exposure, when?

96
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,790
Well, for the workplace, we often think about what is the percent of the allowable dose that someone got, and we'll talk about that more.

97
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:31,090
We could also talk about sort of what was their average noise level over whatever period of time we measured a person,

98
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:35,890
let's say we put an instrument on them for an hour. We might say, well, here is the average for that hour.

99
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,330
Maybe that's of interest.

100
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:46,120
But typically in a workplace, we're more interested in a a time weighted average, which is essentially however long that noise exposure was.

101
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,930
We treat it as though the exposure happened over exactly 8 hours.

102
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:56,619
And so in doing so, we can compare work shifts that might be 16 hours in length to ones that might be 4 hours in length.

103
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:02,290
And we're comparing apples to apples. I've already talked about weighting and response time.

104
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:08,050
Every occupational exposure limit in the world also has something called a threshold level,

105
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:15,940
and so the threshold is essentially the level above which we start to get concerned about this sound and below which we kind of throw it out.

106
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:22,059
And going back to my earlier comments about technological limitations, so back in the 1970s,

107
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,830
when emotion was established and instrumentation really started to get developed seriously,

108
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:36,910
industry manufacturers said, we can only measure so many or so large a range of decibels, and 60 to 70 is about the biggest range we can measure.

109
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:43,270
So if you're interested in going all the way up to 140, the lowest level we can really measure is about eight reliably.

110
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,889
And so OSHA and other agencies said, okay, if it's less than 80,

111
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,970
we're just not going to care because effectively we can't measure it and still measure the high levels.

112
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,210
So we have a situation today where if you have a sound level with 79.99 decibels,

113
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:03,429
it gets counted as zero because it's below the threshold, it's below where we care.

114
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,419
Whereas if you have an exposure of 80.000 decibels, that counts.

115
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,200
We care about that.

116
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:17,980
So you can get the sense that's totally arbitrary and essentially a historical crippling limitation, basically based on the instrumentation.

117
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:27,549
And we talked about these other terms as well. So let's come back to why we set a noise, exposure, regulation or limit in the first place.

118
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:33,129
And historically, the thing we've been most concerned about with noise is noise induced hearing loss.

119
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:33,400
Right.

120
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:41,730
And so there are a number of different groups, the International Standards Organization, the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as nine ash,

121
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:50,290
that have looked at a whole bunch of epidemiological literature studies done on workers who were exposed to noise over extended periods of time,

122
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,390
trying to figure out what the noise level produces, what level of hearing loss.

123
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:03,580
And once you have those data, you can start to look at, okay, what is the so-called excess risk of hearing loss at different levels?

124
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:09,730
Excess risk, meaning if you're exposed or if a group of workers is exposed at these levels or above,

125
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,550
what percent of them are going to get a hearing loss directly due to that noise exposure,

126
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,580
the excess risk on top of people who might get hearing loss for other reasons.

127
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:28,629
So again, we've got these three kind of key groups that have put estimates of excess risk together for three kind of very important noise levels,

128
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:34,930
90 decibels about as loud as a gas powered lawnmower, 85 decibels and 80 decibels,

129
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,790
which might be, again, as loud as a ringing telephone or maybe a blender in the kitchen.

130
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,979
So you'll see. I also looked at those, EPA looked at those, and I looked at those.

131
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,600
And each agency came up with their own estimates of the fraction of workers

132
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,640
exposed to those levels who would expect to have a substantial hearing loss.

133
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:00,620
After a 40 year working lifetime, you'll see the numbers. They don't agree perfectly between the three agencies.

134
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:04,530
We've got three different sets of scientists looking at three kind of different sets of data.

135
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:09,690
So I don't expect them to be the same. But the key takeaway here is that 90 decibels.

136
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:17,759
So if you've got a workforce that's exposed to 90 decibels, the legal limit for a 40 year working lifetime,

137
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:25,079
the excess risk here is somewhere between, say, 20 and 30%, meaning between one in five and almost one in three.

138
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:31,200
Workers exposed at that safe level are going to end up with a substantial hearing loss at the end of their career.

139
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:38,820
And it's not until we get down to about 80 decibels as a whole shift average that you could work in for 40 years straight,

140
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,690
that the risk drops down to somewhere between zero and 5%.

141
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,280
So one key takeaway here. Well, let me put it back on you.

142
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:52,950
So if you were the Environmental Protection Agency and you were regulating a chemical that causes cancer,

143
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:59,309
how many cancers are you okay occurring in a population of, say, a million people?

144
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,640
What would be acceptable to you? 100.

145
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:09,229
Okay. Other suggestions? I believe zero.

146
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,430
But that's a one. Yeah. Zero I think we can all agree is what we to aim for.

147
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,700
And the EPA actually does typically pick one in a million.

148
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,959
They say if it's less than that, that's kind of background. If it's more than that, we're gonna get concerned.

149
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,800
And at 100, they would typically say that that's a problem. We want to do something about that.

150
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,090
So 100 and and 100 and and 100 million.

151
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,530
Okay, so. So one in a million. Got your number. Very good.

152
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:39,649
Um, my point being, so if we're talking about chemicals in the environment, the EPA's like one in a million or more is,

153
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:43,670
is bad here in the workplace with noise, we're like more than one in three.

154
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:52,370
That's probably okay. I mean, it's just grossly different how little protection we extend to the workers compared to how we treat the community.

155
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,790
So this ends up with a situation where, frankly,

156
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:03,380
we've got tons of workers getting a hearing loss because we know our exposure limit is not protective for many, many workers.

157
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:11,350
Now, I was going to play you some sound demonstrations here, but I'm actually not sure I can tweak the NLRB.

158
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:19,729
Let's try this. I was just going to give you a demo here of how loud 80 decibels is so we can pull out our

159
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:25,700
handy smartphone here and open up our Nilesh sound level meter app brought to you by Nash.

160
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,620
Sorry, let me get that open. So this is a free app.

161
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,749
I don't know if it's available in Android, definitely available on iOS devices here.

162
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,390
And you can see with me talking in the room here, the numbers jumping,

163
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,330
let's say a little bit up and down around 70 decibels or so if I crank up the white noise.

164
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:54,770
Not grossly loud up here, but it might adjust the volume.

165
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,280
If I were able to operate a baby demonstration.

166
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,749
That's about 83 decibels right there. So 90 decibels is going to sound a little less than twice as loud as that.

167
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,719
I won't subject you all to that, but you can kind of get a sense of what we're talking about.

168
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,920
Imagine working in that sound level 8 hours a day, every day.

169
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:30,780
It's obnoxious. In addition to potentially harmful, we turn the volume down so our next speaker doesn't blow out their students ears.

170
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:39,150
Sorry. So I mentioned the exchange rate now in in modern times or let's say in sort of industrial times,

171
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:42,629
people tended to work, save, you know, eight, ten, 12 hours a day.

172
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:49,690
Now, at least in the US, as we've shifted more into a service economy, we've got people who work part time and maybe their 4 hours a day.

173
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:53,850
We've got people who I've worked with in the fishing industry who work 16 hour shifts.

174
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,940
So lots of different durations of exposure.

175
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:04,530
We want to be able to compare a four hour shift and a 16 hour shift to a single number and decide are they overexposed or not?

176
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:13,109
And the exchange rate lets us do that. So the exchange rate also is called the time intensity exchange rate or the trade rate or the trading ratio.

177
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,309
It's got lots of different names,

178
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:22,230
but it basically lets us switch between allowing more time and allowing more exposure level or a higher exposure level.

179
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:30,030
And so in noise, the exchange rate is is technically defined as the change in decibels that will allow

180
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:34,719
you to either have or double the amount of time you're allowed to spend in noise.

181
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,500
And I'll show you a figure that'll make that make sense in just a moment.

182
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,240
As I hinted already, though, we've really got two competing schools of thought.

183
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,060
There's OSHA and MSHA.

184
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:53,430
And basically the country of Brazil are the only agencies in the entire world who use what's called a five decibel exchange rate.

185
00:17:53,430 --> 00:18:03,660
Now, this exchange rate is based on data largely collected back in the 1950s and 1960s, data that I would say were never particularly well validated.

186
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:09,600
And even if you believe those data, this exchange rate assumes that if you have a really noisy day,

187
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,840
you have irregularly spaced breaks with no noise in them.

188
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:18,120
So five might be appropriate for some situations, but as I said, we've got lots of people working,

189
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:23,910
lots of different work patterns, many of whom do not get regular breaks from noise during the shift.

190
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,620
So on the flip side, you got ACG, age nine,

191
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:35,180
Ash Nasser and basically every other occupational regulator in the world who used what's called a three decibel exchange rate.

192
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,690
Now, if you recall, back to our earlier lectures, a three deaths, three decibel increase represents a doubling of sound energy.

193
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,930
So this is actually something that's based on real world physics.

194
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:55,190
And again, the data here are, I would say, more recent and more robust than what OSHA based their limit on when they established that limits.

195
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:59,870
Actually, when they adopted that limit back from 1968 recommendations.

196
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:07,400
And so how do we compare these two? So what we're looking at here, we've got a solid blue line here.

197
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:16,100
This is the Nash recommended exposure limit. So this is a three decimal exchange rate which allows you 8 hours that 85 decibels.

198
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:21,320
We've got the OSHA permissible exposure limit. That's kind of the big dashes here.

199
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:27,260
So that allows a five decimal exchange rate and a 90 decibel eight hour average.

200
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:32,510
And then even OSHA has acknowledged that their permissible exposure limit is not protective enough.

201
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:40,070
So they also have something called an action level, and that allows you 85 decibels for 8 hours and also a five decibel exchange rate.

202
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:47,479
And so looking at the graph here, you can see we've got different exposure levels from 75 to 120 on the x axis.

203
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:57,440
And then we have permissible or allowable time somewhere between, say, you know, less than a few minutes all the way up to 20 hours a day.

204
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,040
And so if we focus in on Nyasha for a moment,

205
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:11,149
so Nash says at 8 hours we can be exposed for 85 decibels on average, and then every three decibels we increase.

206
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:17,420
So if we go from 85 to 88, that's going to cut our allowable exposure time in half to 4 hours.

207
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:26,060
And if I go up another three decibels for their three decibel exchange rate, now that 91 and I'm going to be allowed at 2 hours at 91,

208
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:34,219
and if I go down a little bit further to 94 decibels, that's we're going to I'm going to be allowed one hour at 94 with Nash and so forth.

209
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:40,280
So again, every three decibel increase in our average level, we cut our allowable time in half.

210
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:46,400
So by the time I get up to 105 decibels, I'm allowed basically less than a couple of minutes a day at that level.

211
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:50,870
So that's nice. On the flip side, if we look at OSHA, well,

212
00:20:50,870 --> 00:21:03,919
OSHA actually says you can spend 16 hours a day at 85 decibels or 8 hours a day at 90 decibels or 4 hours a day at 95 decibels.

213
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,680
Sorry, me. Let me actually reference the right line here.

214
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:13,910
So every five decibels I go up with my five decibel exchange rate and cutting my allowable exposure time in half.

215
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:19,640
So 8 hours at 94 hours at 95, 2 hours at 100 and so forth.

216
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:28,160
Until by the time I get out to these really high levels, OSHA says, Yeah, you can actually spend 15 minutes a day at 115 decibels.

217
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:33,170
Whereas Nash would say, you know, try like a fraction of a second at that level.

218
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:39,709
So again, the OSHA five decibel exchange rate allows us much longer exposures at much higher

219
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:44,540
exposure levels than the three decibel exchange rate that virtually the whole world uses.

220
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:52,500
So you can take my word for it from that graph and sort of do your own math and figure out, well,

221
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,510
for a given exposure level, how long am I allowed to be exposed according to OSHA or Naish?

222
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:01,200
Or you can actually go to their written standards and check there.

223
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,660
So this is a table directly out of the code of federal regulations.

224
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,530
This is the noise exposure limit.

225
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:16,440
So if you want to look that up via Google, it's the 29th volume of the Code of Federal Regulations and the section is 1910 that 95.

226
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,660
And so here is where OSHA says, okay, you are allowed 8 hours a day at 90 decibels,

227
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:29,879
you're allowed 4 hours a day at nine five, 2 hours a day at 100 and so forth, 15 minutes or less at 115.

228
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,810
And then elsewhere they say you can't go above 115 ever, basically,

229
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:39,770
without hearing protection and oceans given, you know, a few sort of interstitial points here, too.

230
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:46,700
So they say you can spend 6 hours at 92 for 3 hours at 97 or an hour and a half at one or two.

231
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:51,880
So sort of a fairly high range of exposures here.

232
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:57,810
Again, 115 is about as loud as an ambulance siren and 90 is about as loud as a gas lawnmower.

233
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,410
This table comes from the nine ash recommended exposure limit.

234
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:09,180
A little bit more detail here. They go all the way down to 80 decibels and all the way up to 140 decibels here.

235
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:14,400
But it's the same basic idea. So Nash says you can spend 8 hours at 85.

236
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,860
Remember, Nash uses a three decibel exchange rate. So if I add three decibels and go to 88, now I'm down to 4 hours, I add another three decibels.

237
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,479
You go to 91. Now I'm down to 2 hours and so on and so forth until again.

238
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:34,680
By the time we get up to 115 decibels, you know, you can spend 28 seconds at that level that OSHA would be fine with 15 minutes.

239
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:42,540
And so Nash is pretty helpful here again in that they've given us a one decibel increment instead of OSHA's like,

240
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:46,770
Well, sometimes we'll give you a five decibel increment, sometimes too little, a little bit confusing.

241
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:54,990
But these are essentially the basis for how we regulate or how we try to understand noise exposure in the U.S.

242
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,149
Now, historically, if you think back to factory workers, you know,

243
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:06,780
someone might be at a workstation for eight or ten or 12 hours a day and their noise level might have been fairly constant.

244
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,380
So maybe for that whole 8 hours, they're basically exposed at one level.

245
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:15,810
But again, increasingly, especially with our our now service focused economy,

246
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:19,620
we might have people doing different activities during the day and they have different noise levels.

247
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:27,810
So part of the question becomes, well, how do I figure out a person's exposure if they do different things with different noise levels during the day?

248
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,920
And so we can do this with the equation I've shown you here, which lets us also convert noise into a dose.

249
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,559
So when we talk about average levels,

250
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:44,460
we're talking about decibels and I think we can all agree decibels or not maybe the most intuitive unit on earth.

251
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:51,899
On the other hand, dose, if we're talking about, well, hey, I'm allowed up to 100% and if I go more than 100%, I got more than I'm allowed.

252
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:58,049
That's a little more intuitive. So the equation here basically lets us figure out dose.

253
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:03,090
So we always present dose in a scale of 0 to 100. So we've got this 100 multiplier in here.

254
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:10,440
And then basically what we're going to do for each of our time periods during the day that we spend at a different noise level,

255
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:14,909
we're going to put in the amount of time that we spent at a particular noise level,

256
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:19,170
and we're going to divide that by the amount of time we could have spent at that level.

257
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:24,899
So there's actual exposure time for each given level divided by the allowable exposure time

258
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:30,450
and the allowable exposure time we can get from either the NASH table or the OSHA table,

259
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:36,779
depending on what we're looking at. And again, in terms of compliance, typically we want our dose to be less than 100%.

260
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:42,749
So, you know, if you talk about, well, you're at 91 decibels in your loud 90, that doesn't make sense to people.

261
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:49,860
But if you're like you got 300% of your 100% allowable dose, people can figure out, oh, that that seems like a lot more than I should have.

262
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:55,469
So, so dose is pretty handy. We can use this equation will deploy this in a moment.

263
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:00,240
We can also compute the actual time allowed mathematically.

264
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,520
So if I didn't have access to those tables that we looked at, I can actually directly compute this.

265
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:12,060
So we've got an equation here that lets us say, I want to know how much time can I spend at noise level I?

266
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:16,440
And the way I'm going to figure that out is by this equation here.

267
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,780
So I'm going to take the criterion time, which basically for every standard in the world is 8 hours.

268
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,720
That's how long we consider to be kind of a standard work shift.

269
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:32,670
I'm going to divide that by two to the power of LCA by as else I've seen so l so by is the actual

270
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:39,209
exposure limit that my worker is spending time in and some see is the allowable exposure limit.

271
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:42,600
So for OSHA, that's typically going to be 90 decibels.

272
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,700
And for Nash, it's going to be 85.

273
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:52,880
And then I divide here by the exchange rate, five decibels for OSHA, three decibels for Nye Ash and basically everybody else.

274
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,570
So let's just run through a quick example here.

275
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:02,719
Let's say I've got a worker and their job is mostly just standing around at two different workstations.

276
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,970
So they stand at one workstation for 3 hours in the morning and it's 105 decibels.

277
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:14,110
And the other 5 hours of their day in the afternoon, they stand at a place where it's 95 decibels.

278
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:20,990
And so the question here is, what is the dose this worker got for this eight hour work shift, according to OSHA?

279
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:25,249
And so the answer here, I whip out that same equation.

280
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:33,200
So I want to get my dose here. And so that's the time spent at the first sound level, divided by the allowable time at that level,

281
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:37,850
plus the time spent at the second minus, excuse me, divided by the allowable time.

282
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:44,270
So I've got my worker who spent 3 hours at 105 and they spent 5 hours at 95.

283
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,450
But how long were they allowed to spend at 105? Well, I can go right back to the OSHA table and figure it out.

284
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,600
At 105 decibels, they were allowed only one hour.

285
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:59,810
And just so we don't have to flip back again at 95 decibels, they were allowed 4 hours.

286
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,660
So I just do some simple fractional math here.

287
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:09,170
So they spent 3 hours at a time, excuse me, on a level that they shouldn't have spent more than an hour in,

288
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,010
and they spent 5 hours at a level that they should have only spent 4 hours.

289
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:16,370
And so even without doing the math, you can figure out this person's over.

290
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,060
You know, these these fractions are top heavy, let's say.

291
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:30,590
And so doing the math and then multiplying by 100%, we figure out that this worker with this day got 425% of their allowable dose allowable being 100.

292
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:38,089
So this person is way over exposed. And again, with dose, we can kind of talk to them and explain, you know, every time your dose doubles,

293
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:42,190
your risk doubles to where we're out of the logarithmic scale, which is pretty nice.

294
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:47,570
But we could also deploy the equation that I showed you a moment ago and figure out,

295
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:52,430
well, how long could a worker spend at exactly 105 decibels, according to OSHA.

296
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:58,850
So, again, I want to figure out the time they're allowed to span that 8 hours is the criterion time.

297
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:05,450
The level of interest here is 105. The criterion level is 90, according to OSHA.

298
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:13,669
And I'm going to divide by OSHA's five decibel exchange rate. So if I do that math here, I get the very same answer that was in the ocean table.

299
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:20,510
So that's sort of reaffirming. And so people are allowed to spend one hour at 105 decibels.

300
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:24,440
And the key thing to keep in mind here is that's one hour.

301
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,830
And then this person has gotten their entire noise dose for the whole day.

302
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:32,780
So if you want to work in 105 decibels, you can do that for one hour a day.

303
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:36,050
And for the rest of the day, you need to be somewhere quiet, not getting exposed.

304
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,290
And I will say, believe it or not,

305
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:45,590
there are companies that say we've got a job that is so loud and we've been unable to sort of reduce the noise level

306
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:53,990
that what we do is we limit the amount of time a person can do this job that can be very effective sometimes.

307
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:01,129
Actually, often we will want to convert a dose that we've estimated for a worker into a time

308
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:04,400
weighted average and a time weighted average is going to be back in the decibels scale.

309
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:11,430
And so we've got an equation here that lets us do that. So we're going to take our exchange rate again, five for OSHA, three for Nilesh.

310
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:18,290
We're going to divide by the log of two and then we are going to take the log ten of whatever our computed dose was.

311
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:23,629
And then we're going to add in the criterion level again, 90 for OSHA, 85 for Nash.

312
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,160
So let's look an example here.

313
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:34,160
So let's say I've made a measurement according to the way OSHA tells us to measure noise and the dose on the worker is 55%.

314
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,270
What would their corresponding eight hour time weighted average be?

315
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:44,780
I can just plug in my equation here. So I have a five decimal exchange rate divided by the log of two.

316
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:50,930
I've got a dose here of 0.55 55% and I've got a 90 decibel criterion level.

317
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:54,889
Again, I would run through this on your calculator just to make sure you get the same numbers.

318
00:30:54,890 --> 00:31:04,550
So for this person, an OSHA dose of 55% is equivalent to an eight hour average exposure of 85.7 decibels.

319
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:14,209
And if I run the same numbers using the NASH criteria, so that would be a three decimal exchange rate and an 85 decibels criterion level.

320
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:18,170
I come up with a different way of 82.4.

321
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,630
We can also think about computing.

322
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:30,920
Average exposure is across the different measurements that we make over the course of a day using a three decimal exchange rate.

323
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:35,690
So back in our our first lecture where we talked about noise calculations,

324
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,900
I showed you this equation that lets us say, hey, I want to put a bunch of different pieces of machinery into a room.

325
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,820
All have different noise levels. And how do I estimate what the. Total will be.

326
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,470
We're doing something very similar when we average across a day with this person.

327
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,340
But here we want to account for the fact that we get different amounts of time.

328
00:31:54,790 --> 00:32:01,989
So my worker might spend a few hours at one sound pressure level and several more hours at a different sound pressure level.

329
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:10,330
And I can average all those up and then divide by my total duration that I measured them and call that we call that the LCU,

330
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,420
which is the equivalent continuous average exposure.

331
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:19,060
So we'll look at a slightly different example here. Now, let's say I've got my worker there.

332
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:26,620
Shift has changed a little bit. Now they're spending 2 hours at 105 decibels and 6 hours at 95 decibels.

333
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:33,670
And my question is, what was the average exposure over, as it happens, the 8 hours that I measured this person for?

334
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:41,470
So I've got my LSU equation here. Again, I've got two different time periods, one for 2 hours and the other for 6 hours.

335
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:51,040
And then I've got a sound pressure level of 105 and then a second, some pressure level of 95 and then a total duration here of 8 hours.

336
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,900
2 hours plus 6 hours is eight.

337
00:32:53,260 --> 00:33:01,120
And so if we run through that math there, we can figure out that the average exposure over this eight hour work shift was 100.1 DBA,

338
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:07,330
which again is well in excess of any of the recommended limits in place basically around the world today.

339
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:17,510
So I will say the L.A. Q is inherently assuming that we have a three decimal exchange rate.

340
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:25,700
So the L.A. Q is the principle that's used in virtually every other country on the planet, and it's used by Nyasha and Nasser and Dodd,

341
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:33,920
etc. But we still have OSHA and Maisha and the regulator in Brazil that use this five decimal exchange rate.

342
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:39,230
So we have a slightly different looking equation if we want to compute the average level,

343
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,410
if it's measured according to how ocean tells us to measurement.

344
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:49,040
And in that case, instead of calling it an L q, we call it an L average, or you can also call it an L Asia.

345
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:55,729
Either of those is acceptable. So the equation is similar looking, except we have a slightly different modifier here.

346
00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:03,860
Instead of ten we have 16.61 and instead of dividing by ten here for the sound pressure level, we divide by 16.61.

347
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:08,210
And mathematically that's just the way that we account for the five decimal exchange rate.

348
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:18,640
Okay. I think that's it for equations today and on my end, and I'm fairly sure it probably is on all of your parts too.

349
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,350
So what I'd love to do now is, well, we'll break things up a little bit and I want to start to talk about how we might employ

350
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:30,460
different measures in the workplace to actually prevent hearing loss among workers.

351
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:38,260
So let me have you just group. I've been in groups of two or three and I want you to think broadly here about what kinds of

352
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:43,660
things might you want to do in a workplace to actually prevent hearing loss among workers.

353
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:48,190
So let's spend a couple of minutes together again, come up with some examples and we'll come back together.

354
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:53,860
And I'd love to hear what you all talk about. So again, take a few minutes and then we'll come back together.

355
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:07,687
And so people like you saying, why aren't you?

356
00:35:10,585 --> 00:35:17,935
Let's go ahead and come back together here. And I'm hearing some very, very lively conversation, which is good.

357
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:22,914
So I'm just curious the sorts of things you were all coming up with.

358
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:26,065
I heard snippets of them. Yeah. All and hire deaf people.

359
00:35:26,485 --> 00:35:33,024
Only hire deaf people. Interesting. So I think that just sort of I'll take you one further.

360
00:35:33,025 --> 00:35:37,795
Only hire robots and then there are no occupational hazards at all.

361
00:35:38,155 --> 00:35:42,264
Well, it's like the nuclear option. So you bring up an interesting point.

362
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:48,415
I mean, if if you hire deaf people, presumably the risk of hearing loss is is minimal.

363
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:57,325
The question is, are there other health outcomes that deaf workers might be vulnerable to vibration?

364
00:35:57,565 --> 00:36:03,894
Absolutely so. So we always want to be, you know, considerate of anyone we bring in to a workplace who has a disability.

365
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:07,615
We don't want to put them in a position where they're, you know, at risk of other things.

366
00:36:07,825 --> 00:36:12,405
But, yes, as a a broad approach that might reduce the risk of those use hearing loss.

367
00:36:12,425 --> 00:36:18,925
Very good. What else? So I guess it depends on what type of work they were doing.

368
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:24,774
If you're if your work is quite near the source or if it's beside a source like during the office that's beside a source,

369
00:36:24,775 --> 00:36:35,785
then that's a whole different type of, um, that's more of like a design type of element that you have to input in what are applied.

370
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:42,415
Okay. So you want to consider certainly a worker's proximity to the types of sources that might expose them?

371
00:36:42,685 --> 00:36:48,775
Absolutely. Yeah. I was thinking like decreasing their exposure time possible.

372
00:36:48,775 --> 00:36:51,505
So if you can like rotate workers out, that would be a good idea.

373
00:36:51,595 --> 00:36:57,235
Okay, so Hayley's describing an administrative control, but we might say it's so, so loud in here.

374
00:36:57,235 --> 00:37:02,874
It's dangerous. We only spend 4 hours a day, and it's noise level, and then you need to go someplace quieter,

375
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:06,285
and another worker will come in and get their 4 hours of exposure.

376
00:37:06,295 --> 00:37:17,725
Could really ask the manufacturers of the equipment to to manufacture the equipment less noisy so they can protect their workers.

377
00:37:18,025 --> 00:37:23,785
Yeah, absolutely. So there is a concept called the Buy Quiet Program, which we'll talk about a couple lectures from now,

378
00:37:24,115 --> 00:37:29,305
which is where employers, you know, people who run the workplace will selectively buy the quietest,

379
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:37,705
quietest types of equipment available to them to gradually sort of, you know, eliminate noise from their workplace, one piece of equipment at a time.

380
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:43,735
There are other manufacturers, Ford comes to mind that say, if you're going to sell us machinery for our factory,

381
00:37:43,735 --> 00:37:46,764
it can't be louder than 80 decibels and we're going to test it.

382
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:52,165
And if it is, you're out of here and we're not paying for your machinery. So a couple of ways to go about that good engineer.

383
00:37:52,325 --> 00:37:58,915
Another thing we've done in a hearing called up observation program and what would entail

384
00:37:59,665 --> 00:38:07,674
of that would entail stuff like more indication on what type of Hollywood reporter can

385
00:38:07,675 --> 00:38:13,825
affect them so that workers can have a better understanding on hold out as to how them and

386
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:20,925
when they need to have a proper needed force on operations that they have to do that.

387
00:38:21,295 --> 00:38:30,595
And that involves high noise, even if it's through the operation itself or through handmade objects that can make the noise itself good.

388
00:38:30,835 --> 00:38:33,594
Actually, I'll stop you right there, because others may have additional ideas.

389
00:38:33,595 --> 00:38:41,004
But just to kind of reiterate what Andrew said, so worker training to make sure they understand what the risk is, maybe the use of PPE,

390
00:38:41,005 --> 00:38:47,305
personal protective equipment, which in this case would probably be earplugs or earmuffs, anything else we might want to do?

391
00:38:47,305 --> 00:38:49,794
Again, very much testing. How do you measure for testing?

392
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:57,025
So testing workers hearing to see how well they hear, hopefully documenting that they hear well and that they're hearing doesn't degrade over time.

393
00:38:57,985 --> 00:39:07,204
Great other ideas anyone had. When more enter personal monitoring annual personal.

394
00:39:07,205 --> 00:39:13,684
Yeah. So, you know, we don't even know if there's a problem unless we actually do some measurements in the workplace and see,

395
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:18,035
well, how loud is this actual facility? Great. So let me pause you there.

396
00:39:18,035 --> 00:39:24,364
And if if those of you who have a laptop or a device with you, I just want to do a quick poll everywhere.

397
00:39:24,365 --> 00:39:29,645
These are kind of default results here that will change as soon as you all start to put in your your thoughts here.

398
00:39:30,305 --> 00:39:39,275
My question for you, I've listed kind of the five key requirements which you both touched on in your answers here for a hearing conservation program.

399
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:48,935
And I am interested in your ideas in terms of how you would rank these in terms of effectiveness at actually preventing hearing loss.

400
00:39:49,265 --> 00:39:53,465
So of these five elements of a hearing conservation program,

401
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:59,915
the one at the top should be the one you think is most effective and the one at the bottom should be the one that you think is least effective.

402
00:39:59,915 --> 00:40:07,984
And of course, we'll see what's in between. Now, I'm hoping this is going to actually update here, but it's it's always a crapshoot with actually.

403
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:11,255
Let's try this. There we go. Yeah.

404
00:40:11,265 --> 00:40:14,435
Patrick, is there a correct answer? There is a correct answer.

405
00:40:14,735 --> 00:40:20,254
According to me. The caveat we've got instructor's prerogative here.

406
00:40:20,255 --> 00:40:23,555
Yeah, I think we can certainly talk about the results here.

407
00:40:23,585 --> 00:40:28,324
If if what you guys think doesn't agree with what I think, we'll we'll talk about the differences there.

408
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:33,055
But yeah, I am looking for a particular ranking here. Yeah.

409
00:41:13,585 --> 00:41:29,545
Okay, folks. A few more seconds to finish up here. All right.

410
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:33,504
Looks like Mosley is able to take that, as most folks are done.

411
00:41:33,505 --> 00:41:42,475
So. So the order that the class, you know, agreed on kind of through consensus here is noise controls is most effective,

412
00:41:42,895 --> 00:41:46,704
followed by noise measurements, followed by work or training, followed by hearing protection.

413
00:41:46,705 --> 00:41:49,495
And last but not least, audio metric testing.

414
00:41:49,945 --> 00:41:58,345
And to come back to Patrick's question, this is very close to how I envision this being ranked in terms of effectiveness.

415
00:41:58,705 --> 00:42:03,835
The only thing I might suggest is we can even put noise measurements up top and noise controls as number two,

416
00:42:03,835 --> 00:42:09,504
because we might do noise measurements and figure out we don't even have a noise exposure problem.

417
00:42:09,505 --> 00:42:17,345
We don't even need a hearing conservation program. Yeah. So I know this happens in the real world and it works in a factory worker training.

418
00:42:17,485 --> 00:42:24,835
Like, the training is optional, but like, it's also another step for them to actually do it based on the training.

419
00:42:24,835 --> 00:42:31,215
And so there's many people that still can just ignore the training, don't do them protective equipment.

420
00:42:31,225 --> 00:42:35,485
And so I was thinking that worker training would be less as far as preventing.

421
00:42:35,575 --> 00:42:39,864
Sure. Because a lot of people just like sit through the training, they don't even care.

422
00:42:39,865 --> 00:42:43,075
And I mean, just go back to work. They just want to get the job done and get to go home.

423
00:42:43,885 --> 00:42:47,515
And so to me, I don't see how little training it.

424
00:42:47,525 --> 00:42:54,985
Like obviously it's required by law in some circumstances, but like as far as the like being effective,

425
00:42:55,225 --> 00:43:01,345
to me this like translates to forces in like population regardless of human inputs.

426
00:43:01,525 --> 00:43:07,545
SHORTEN That would be like preventative measures like the controls and probably the measurements as well.

427
00:43:07,555 --> 00:43:11,555
But I feel like maybe adding like what you said about, for example,

428
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:16,254
of just buying machines that impossible to do to damage would be the most effective.

429
00:43:16,255 --> 00:43:20,185
Absolutely. Is that assessment accurate?

430
00:43:20,545 --> 00:43:24,385
Well, let me run you through my reasoning here and we'll come back to that. And Andrew, you had a question, too.

431
00:43:24,715 --> 00:43:29,514
I guess I look at that for not strictly well, in that case,

432
00:43:29,515 --> 00:43:34,195
the company's liability is gone because it's not really there because they've already paid the training.

433
00:43:34,495 --> 00:43:39,975
And if they're not paid by the training that you can give and the company can say that we gave to training the workers,

434
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:43,105
it's not our fault you're not listening to our advice.

435
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:47,184
Sure. So I mean, you've both made good points here.

436
00:43:47,185 --> 00:43:53,575
I will say, and again, I think we can quibble on which one of these I could go either way and which one of these might be number one.

437
00:43:53,575 --> 00:43:57,474
And number two, I put training third here, not because training is magical.

438
00:43:57,475 --> 00:44:03,265
There are plenty of utterly crappy training programs out there that accomplish nothing except wasting time and money.

439
00:44:03,745 --> 00:44:08,904
But a good training program and ideally all training programs should be good is absolutely

440
00:44:08,905 --> 00:44:13,195
critical if you want people to actually be able to wear hearing protectors correctly.

441
00:44:13,555 --> 00:44:17,665
So I put this one necessarily under worker training because if you don't have training,

442
00:44:17,665 --> 00:44:24,804
the hearing protectors are off the table as a viable solution to noise control and my rationale for having audio metric testing.

443
00:44:24,805 --> 00:44:30,265
Fifth, it's not that it's not important, but what does hearing testing do to prevent hearing loss?

444
00:44:30,925 --> 00:44:34,165
Absolutely nothing. It documents hearing loss. That's all it does.

445
00:44:34,495 --> 00:44:38,064
Best case scenario, you test people year after year. They're hearing doesn't change.

446
00:44:38,065 --> 00:44:44,364
That means your program is working. Worst case scenario, you test your hearing year after year and people's hearing gets worse.

447
00:44:44,365 --> 00:44:50,155
And that means your program's not working. So in terms of prevention, volumetric testing offers nothing there.

448
00:44:50,155 --> 00:44:52,345
It's more of a validation or an evaluation.

449
00:44:52,975 --> 00:44:58,765
Again, hearing protector devices can be effective, but they're only going to be effective if you have worker training in place.

450
00:44:59,245 --> 00:45:04,704
Now, as I said, kind of in response to you, Patrick, you know, not all training programs are good.

451
00:45:04,705 --> 00:45:11,455
I've sat through many trainings that were just a horrible waste of time, but a good and sort of repetitive training program.

452
00:45:11,455 --> 00:45:15,475
Repetitive, not in that it's watching the same video every year, but repetitive.

453
00:45:15,475 --> 00:45:22,315
And there's reminders, sort of boosters of information over the course of the year can be really effective at motivating change.

454
00:45:22,645 --> 00:45:26,094
Now, workers will readily pick up if management is delivering training.

455
00:45:26,095 --> 00:45:30,355
That's not good. And as you said, they're largely going to ignore the training because they're going to say,

456
00:45:30,355 --> 00:45:34,135
well, this is the same video I've watched for 20 years every year while I worked here.

457
00:45:34,135 --> 00:45:38,575
There's there's nothing for me here. This is not beneficial. But a good program is going to mix things up.

458
00:45:38,575 --> 00:45:42,715
It's not going to be the same video every time. It's going to be delivered multiple times across the year.

459
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:49,915
And it can be very compelling and it's critical in order to let the workers understand what's expected of them as part of this program.

460
00:45:49,915 --> 00:45:56,124
Yeah. Wouldn't the same reasoning for the parametric testing being last be applied to noise measurements?

461
00:45:56,125 --> 00:45:59,485
Because it's not really preventing anything. It's just measuring well.

462
00:45:59,605 --> 00:46:05,424
So yeah. And again, with noise measurements, I think we can we can definitely discuss its location here.

463
00:46:05,425 --> 00:46:10,885
So in my mind, noise measurements are the foundation of any hearing conservation program.

464
00:46:10,885 --> 00:46:13,975
You cannot have a good program if you don't know how noisy it is.

465
00:46:14,695 --> 00:46:19,495
And so spending a little bit of money up front on noise measurements might let you determine we don't have a problem,

466
00:46:20,095 --> 00:46:23,395
or it might trigger you there to realize, Oh my God, we have a huge problem.

467
00:46:23,395 --> 00:46:28,015
And then I can start to implement all these other things. So if you consider them to be kind of the foundation of approach.

468
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:37,514
They need to be towards the top in my mind of other thoughts or any disagreements with my rationale here.

469
00:46:37,515 --> 00:46:42,195
I mean, we've we've heard some good competing thoughts. These are, you know, my opinions here is the instructor.

470
00:46:43,095 --> 00:46:47,085
I think you've raised good points that we're going to talk about actually as we go through the lecture.

471
00:46:47,085 --> 00:46:56,025
But does that make sense to everybody? And I think the appropriate device is a bit higher for me.

472
00:46:56,325 --> 00:47:01,365
Okay. Because of because of usually how the place is set up.

473
00:47:01,755 --> 00:47:11,325
Most operations like here are just prefabricated before the understanding of noise intrusion is not as good as it is.

474
00:47:12,825 --> 00:47:18,255
Sometimes there's just not enough space or just not enough controls that can be done.

475
00:47:20,355 --> 00:47:27,945
So visual. I had a few things that have required the Air Force and the hold together in order to be more.

476
00:47:28,995 --> 00:47:32,385
And that's not because even from very.

477
00:47:34,725 --> 00:47:39,145
But that's because that's the only way they could reduce the numbers for sure.

478
00:47:39,985 --> 00:47:45,475
Well, let me tell you, you know, from a from a regulatory perspective, hearing hearing protectors are a Band-Aid.

479
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:47,964
They are a temporary fix. They're always intended to be that.

480
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:51,475
So if you have a company that's relying on hearing protectors, they're not doing it right.

481
00:47:51,475 --> 00:47:55,674
That is not where they should be emphasizing. They should always be trying noise controls.

482
00:47:55,675 --> 00:48:00,775
They should be cutting down on exposure duration before they ever consider putting people in any kind of PPE.

483
00:48:00,775 --> 00:48:05,245
This isn't specific to noise. So. So I put hearing protectors second to last.

484
00:48:05,275 --> 00:48:09,115
Not because they don't work. They can work quite well. But again, they're not going to work.

485
00:48:09,235 --> 00:48:15,354
They have no chance of success without training. You need to tie your hearing protectors to whatever the noise levels are in the facility.

486
00:48:15,355 --> 00:48:18,895
And ideally you're implementing noise controls before you ever go to HPD's,

487
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:23,635
which is why they kind of get pushed down to the bottom here and order and explore all these things as we continue on.

488
00:48:24,265 --> 00:48:27,625
Maybe give you a little more rationale. Great thoughts, though.

489
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:35,364
I mean, this is this is good stuff. So these are, you know, the virtually the same results that you all put in.

490
00:48:35,365 --> 00:48:40,105
And again, I can be convinced that noise controls or noise measurement could have the first slot.

491
00:48:40,525 --> 00:48:44,455
Noise controls are important enough that we're actually going to spend the entire next lecture on that topic.

492
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:46,014
So we're not going to delve into those today,

493
00:48:46,015 --> 00:48:54,055
but we are going to talk about all the rest of these in some detail and the other thing that I'll throw out here so I've been doing this a while.

494
00:48:54,775 --> 00:49:01,405
I've talked to probably many dozens of companies at this point trying to help them with their programs.

495
00:49:01,885 --> 00:49:06,775
And one of the things I am interested in is how much they think the hearing conservation program costs.

496
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:16,524
And so if if as I've done, you talk to managers, they'll say, well, we spend like $13.12 on every hearing test and I've got 100 workers.

497
00:49:16,525 --> 00:49:19,855
So it's 13, 12 times 100. That's the cost of my program.

498
00:49:20,665 --> 00:49:23,425
And that is almost without fail to respond to again.

499
00:49:23,815 --> 00:49:31,644
So we actually published a study a few years ago where we surveyed 14 different plants, kind of wall to wall, getting it to different costs.

500
00:49:31,645 --> 00:49:36,565
And when you factor in the fact that it's not just a hearing test, you might be getting hearing protectors.

501
00:49:36,985 --> 00:49:41,005
The worker is off the lie. They're losing money when they're in their hearing test.

502
00:49:41,015 --> 00:49:44,305
You've got to hire a trainer. You have to have a nurse to do the audio meter test.

503
00:49:44,305 --> 00:49:46,075
They're off the line for documentary tests.

504
00:49:46,465 --> 00:49:52,555
You've got to do noise measurements and calibrate your instruments, etc. When you ramp all that up, depending on the plant we looked at,

505
00:49:52,555 --> 00:49:59,424
the cost was somewhere between 300 and $600 a year per worker in the hearing conservation program.

506
00:49:59,425 --> 00:50:01,405
And so, Andrew, to come back to your earlier comment,

507
00:50:02,245 --> 00:50:07,314
it's quite routine for companies to say we don't possibly have enough money to afford a noise control,

508
00:50:07,315 --> 00:50:12,145
but if you can show them you're actually just shoveling money out the door with this hearing conservation program.

509
00:50:12,505 --> 00:50:16,915
If you took a one time hit and developed a noise control and got some of these people out of that program,

510
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:20,185
the return on investment can be pretty rapid, actually.

511
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:29,575
So in terms of hearing loss prevention program or hearing conservation program, we kind of use those terms interchangeably.

512
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:35,485
I'll say I actually prefer hearing loss prevention because hearing conservation sounds like one that's like tree conservation.

513
00:50:35,485 --> 00:50:41,875
Like we'll cut down some of them local plants more. It doesn't work that we're hearing we really want to protect and prevent against hearing loss.

514
00:50:42,535 --> 00:50:49,375
And so as we sort of talked about in our discussion already, noise measurement is really the start of the whole process.

515
00:50:50,275 --> 00:50:58,315
If we've got problems. So if we've got noise that's above the limit, then we need to consider other aspects of the program.

516
00:50:58,315 --> 00:51:03,985
But if we do measurements and we figure out nobody in this plant or this facility is over the limit, we don't have a problem.

517
00:51:04,465 --> 00:51:07,405
That's good news. And that's what we should always be working towards,

518
00:51:07,405 --> 00:51:13,315
is let's get the number of people overexposed down to zero and we eliminate our program altogether.

519
00:51:13,495 --> 00:51:24,935
Sorry from the discussion, but even though the limits that were given were like 1994 permissible exposure level and that 85 word action level of what

520
00:51:24,985 --> 00:51:31,795
it still be wise to advise and we're doing it just because at lower level there could still be some helping back filter.

521
00:51:32,065 --> 00:51:38,514
Yeah. So 85 to be clear if you take nothing else away from these series of lectures

522
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:42,844
here 85 like the Naish recommended exposure limit is what you should be using.

523
00:51:42,845 --> 00:51:45,625
The PL is terribly out of date and not protective.

524
00:51:46,195 --> 00:51:52,015
I have worked with many plants who say we put everybody in the hearing loss prevention program, even our office staff,

525
00:51:52,315 --> 00:51:56,304
because it means they get a hearing test every year and sometimes through screening we can catch

526
00:51:56,305 --> 00:52:01,464
things like acoustic neuroma or other types of cancers that could turn up on a hearing test.

527
00:52:01,465 --> 00:52:04,794
So it's like a benefit to their employees. That's an upshot.

528
00:52:04,795 --> 00:52:11,785
The downside is sometimes if workers are in a program, they assume blind must be at risk, or otherwise they wouldn't be at the program.

529
00:52:12,235 --> 00:52:18,264
And they may actually be more inclined to file a worker's compensation case even when they really weren't overexposed.

530
00:52:18,265 --> 00:52:22,045
So there's kind of pros and cons to each. I would say.

531
00:52:22,195 --> 00:52:28,405
Again, I just throw 90 out the window. That's kind of the bare minimum we need to do just to not get a ticket from OSHA.

532
00:52:28,855 --> 00:52:33,355
If we're protecting down to 85 where we're protecting against certainly hearing.

533
00:52:33,755 --> 00:52:41,695
And there's some evidence that we're protecting against these other conditions in the workplace to things like heart disease and stroke and so forth.

534
00:52:41,705 --> 00:52:48,004
So. So 85 is a good number. The European Union has gone so far as to say at eight decibels, it's an eight hour average.

535
00:52:48,005 --> 00:52:51,045
You have to at least offer people hearing protection and training.

536
00:52:51,075 --> 00:52:54,874
And that's, you know, an even more protective level.

537
00:52:54,875 --> 00:53:01,925
It's a better plan. The downside is the employers in the U.S. would push back tremendously.

538
00:53:01,955 --> 00:53:05,945
I mean, they fought 90. They fought 85. They would fight again about 80.

539
00:53:06,365 --> 00:53:12,335
And I feel like there would be so much headwind that that's unlikely to become a like an adopted standard.

540
00:53:12,335 --> 00:53:15,005
But it's certainly something to strive for. Good question.

541
00:53:16,535 --> 00:53:22,685
So if we make measurements and our folks are actually over the limit, then we need to ask ourselves about noise controls.

542
00:53:23,105 --> 00:53:27,015
I wouldn't even say. Are they feasible? I would say what noise controls are feasible.

543
00:53:27,035 --> 00:53:29,345
Let's let's sort of spin this in a positive light.

544
00:53:29,885 --> 00:53:34,354
If we put in noise controls and we fix the noise problem again, we've kind of kicked ourselves into this.

545
00:53:34,355 --> 00:53:40,205
We don't need to do anymore. If the noise controls don't quite fix the problem, then we need to think about hearing protection.

546
00:53:40,205 --> 00:53:44,345
We need to think about audio metrics, surveillance. We absolutely need to train the workers.

547
00:53:44,795 --> 00:53:48,995
And in all of these cases, at the end of the day, we need to maintain records showing what we did,

548
00:53:49,235 --> 00:53:52,775
because especially for those of you who go out and become practicing ages,

549
00:53:53,255 --> 00:53:56,735
you know, you could have the best program in the world on paper,

550
00:53:57,635 --> 00:54:02,165
but if what you do doesn't actually make it into that paper record, you don't really have much of a program at all.

551
00:54:02,165 --> 00:54:03,845
It's not going to stand up in a court of law.

552
00:54:05,225 --> 00:54:13,145
So just coming back to this point that Andrew just raised, you know, we've got multiple different kind of targets out there that we can choose from.

553
00:54:13,145 --> 00:54:15,935
We've got OSHA and they're 90 decibel people.

554
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:23,315
And as I said, even OSHA has acknowledged, you know, maybe letting one out of three workers get a hearing loss at the safe level was not acceptable.

555
00:54:23,645 --> 00:54:27,095
So they recommended the action level since 1983.

556
00:54:27,725 --> 00:54:35,015
It's a little confusing, though, because between this action level of 85 and the P l of 90, there's a bunch of program elements that are optional.

557
00:54:35,525 --> 00:54:38,855
Like you have to offer workers hearing protection, but they don't have to wear them.

558
00:54:38,945 --> 00:54:41,575
You have to offer them hearing testing, but they don't have to do it.

559
00:54:42,665 --> 00:54:48,165
So it can create a gray area where it's like, I'm not sure if you have to wear hearing protection or not based on your exposure.

560
00:54:48,175 --> 00:54:56,105
That's that's confusing. And OSHA, in their original premise of exposure limit said noise controls have to be implemented where

561
00:54:56,105 --> 00:55:01,805
feasible above 90 decibels as a t a but then about ten years later wrote a memo that said,

562
00:55:01,805 --> 00:55:05,075
just kidding. If you can show us that the workers are in a hearing conservation program,

563
00:55:05,075 --> 00:55:09,964
we're going to bump that number up to 100, which is back slapping is a motorcycle, very, very loud.

564
00:55:09,965 --> 00:55:15,124
So OSHA little bit confusing, not especially protective near ECJ age.

565
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:19,415
The rest of the world basically say if you're above 85 is an eight hour average,

566
00:55:19,415 --> 00:55:22,925
you need to be in a hearing loss prevention program and you need to do noise controls.

567
00:55:23,285 --> 00:55:29,944
It's a much simpler approach. We've got just the one criteria to work off of no gray areas, and frankly,

568
00:55:29,945 --> 00:55:38,105
it's been shown to work where it's been implemented compared to what we continue to suffer with here in the US now.

569
00:55:38,225 --> 00:55:42,934
So I've thrown out this term feasibility here. So what's a feasible engineering control?

570
00:55:42,935 --> 00:55:47,285
Well, OSHA says it has to be effective, efficient and economical.

571
00:55:47,915 --> 00:55:53,524
So in terms of effectiveness, they've said if if a noise control isn't going to reduce noise by at least three decibels,

572
00:55:53,525 --> 00:55:57,155
so cutting the sound energy in half, it's not effective.

573
00:55:57,155 --> 00:56:05,255
So that's one criteria. Efficient means if you put this noise control in, we don't want to make another hazard that's going to harm the worker.

574
00:56:05,265 --> 00:56:10,115
So we want to not create new hazards, but just fix the existing hazard.

575
00:56:10,115 --> 00:56:17,825
It also can't produce so-called intolerable production, maintenance and sanitation problems, so we don't make it impossible to do the job anymore.

576
00:56:18,215 --> 00:56:25,805
And then they have been totally silent on the economical aspect. So there's no kind of hard guidance out there about how much do you have to spend or

577
00:56:26,105 --> 00:56:30,005
how expensive does a control have to be before it's no longer economically feasible.

578
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:36,635
So kind of diving back in to our hearing loss prevention program elements here.

579
00:56:36,635 --> 00:56:39,905
We'll take a break in a couple of minutes. I said and again,

580
00:56:39,905 --> 00:56:43,594
my my personal thought is noise measurements at the foundation really are kind

581
00:56:43,595 --> 00:56:47,995
of right up there at the top in terms of being able to prevent over exposures.

582
00:56:48,485 --> 00:56:52,714
So one of the things we want to do is just go out and do monitoring in our facility.

583
00:56:52,715 --> 00:56:57,185
And really we want to find, well, who is it? Potential risk of too much noise exposure.

584
00:56:57,785 --> 00:57:04,655
We could also walk around and identify what zones of our facility are loud enough to sort of warrant extra attention.

585
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:12,305
We definitely need to tie the hearing protection that's being used to the noise levels in the facility because not all hearing

586
00:57:12,305 --> 00:57:19,594
protectors block the same amount of sound and we can sort of wander around a plant with the sound of a meter and identify,

587
00:57:19,595 --> 00:57:23,825
you know, what are the highest sources here? What should I be focused on in terms of noise controls?

588
00:57:24,575 --> 00:57:28,504
And so we've talked previously about the different kinds of instruments we could use.

589
00:57:28,505 --> 00:57:32,615
There's a basic sound level meter, a dosimeter, a frequency analyzer.

590
00:57:33,155 --> 00:57:38,944
The. The short answer is you can essentially always use a dosimeter for any purpose that you're trying to do in the workplace,

591
00:57:38,945 --> 00:57:44,405
except trying to design and engineering control. And that's the one place where you really need to have the frequency analyzer.

592
00:57:45,365 --> 00:57:49,354
You know, the more sort of variable the sounds are, the more they go up and down,

593
00:57:49,355 --> 00:57:53,195
the better and better it becomes to use a dosimeter instead of a sound level meter.

594
00:57:53,615 --> 00:57:55,174
But if the noise levels are pretty constant,

595
00:57:55,175 --> 00:58:01,445
you could just walk around with a sound level meter and take measurements in terms of how often we monitor.

596
00:58:01,475 --> 00:58:07,415
So OSHA, again, the bare minimum we have to do to not get busted by the the occupational health cops here.

597
00:58:07,955 --> 00:58:11,614
They say you need to monitor initially to figure out how bad your situation is.

598
00:58:11,615 --> 00:58:18,245
And then you only need to repeat if there's changes like the facility changed or you start to see that lots of people are using hearing.

599
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:22,474
So, you know, by this definition, maybe you monitor once and you never monitor again.

600
00:58:22,475 --> 00:58:30,604
That's not very satisfying to the hygienist, to me. Now, Ash says you still have to do that initial monitoring if your levels are really, really high.

601
00:58:30,605 --> 00:58:33,905
So let's say you've got two ways that are more than 95 decibels.

602
00:58:33,905 --> 00:58:40,295
That's a huge amount of exposure. If you've got those kinds of exposures, you should probably re monitor every two years.

603
00:58:40,565 --> 00:58:43,895
And if it's less than that, you should probably do it every five years.

604
00:58:44,195 --> 00:58:48,155
But it's not just a blanket like, Oh, you can just do it once and you're done if nothing else changes.

605
00:58:48,155 --> 00:58:54,695
Because trust me, having worked with many facilities, there's changes that happen that people don't consider changes.

606
00:58:54,905 --> 00:59:00,724
You know, I've walked into businesses where it's like, Oh yeah, we used to produce this one product and now we produce something completely different.

607
00:59:00,725 --> 00:59:05,995
We're in a new industry, but we're still relying on that initial measurement with old equipment that's not here anymore.

608
00:59:06,005 --> 00:59:10,625
So that's not a very good program. And then again, in terms of making measurements,

609
00:59:10,715 --> 00:59:15,694
we always want to kind of default to personal measurements rather than area measurements where possible.

610
00:59:15,695 --> 00:59:21,604
We always want to calibrate our instruments and then we have a legal as well as an ethical obligation to inform people.

611
00:59:21,605 --> 00:59:25,025
If we measure them and they're overexposed, we have to tell them about that.

612
00:59:25,025 --> 00:59:33,005
That's not something we want to hide from them in any way. We'll finish up with worker training here and then take our break.

613
00:59:33,035 --> 00:59:38,585
So in terms of training, as I said, you know, we've got noise measurements and noise control is like most protective.

614
00:59:38,885 --> 00:59:46,204
And then I'm arguing that training when done right is kind of the third most effective thing at preventing hearing loss.

615
00:59:46,205 --> 00:59:53,075
And so requirements here. Most agencies agree we want to train workers before they ever set foot in high noise.

616
00:59:53,075 --> 00:59:56,435
So before their first day on the job in noise,

617
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:59,735
we want to get them trained and then we train them once a year afterwards

618
00:59:59,885 --> 01:00:03,485
because people forget and they need to be reminded and we want to train them.

619
01:00:03,485 --> 01:00:07,415
On why noise is bad Some common noise levels in the facility.

620
01:00:07,415 --> 01:00:12,754
I'll say a best practice here is also to talk about noise off the job because some people

621
01:00:12,755 --> 01:00:17,225
may have a relatively loud job and the hobbies they do are way worse for their hearing.

622
01:00:17,225 --> 01:00:19,835
This is our opportunity to educate them on that too.

623
01:00:20,585 --> 01:00:28,535
We want to talk about ways to reduce noise like reducing exposure, duration like Hailey mentioned, or implementing noise controls of some fashion.

624
01:00:29,715 --> 01:00:32,735
Talk to them about what we're trying to prevent hearing loss.

625
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:40,055
Talk about how and why we do automatic testing and then teach them how to take care and use their hearing protectors.

626
01:00:41,915 --> 01:00:45,154
So for hearing protectors specifically, we need to train them on.

627
01:00:45,155 --> 01:00:49,954
Well, what are the types that are available to you? Not in the whole universe, but what do we give you in this plan?

628
01:00:49,955 --> 01:00:51,845
Let's train you on what you're actually going to be wearing.

629
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:57,725
Let's teach you how you actually pick one for yourself, and we'll go through this exercise for you all in two lectures.

630
01:00:58,205 --> 01:01:01,205
Let's teach you how to use this properly and then critically.

631
01:01:01,355 --> 01:01:09,035
You want to show the workers Here's how you wear this properly, and then you want them to show you how they can wear it properly in that same session.

632
01:01:09,035 --> 01:01:12,424
Ideally, I don't have to tell you this, but I will anyway.

633
01:01:12,425 --> 01:01:16,925
You know, when it comes to training, there's the video that gets plugged in once a year every year.

634
01:01:16,925 --> 01:01:20,945
And it's been the same video since 1950 and no one cares about that training.

635
01:01:20,945 --> 01:01:25,625
It is 0% effective. The best kind of training is one on one small groups.

636
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:31,805
You know, the more interactive, the better, giving people a chance to try on the hearing protectors play around the stuff again,

637
01:01:31,805 --> 01:01:36,844
things we're going to do in a couple of lectures. And then just one other note on worker training.

638
01:01:36,845 --> 01:01:43,625
This is super bizarre, but OSHA requires that the hearing conservation regulation has to be posted in the workplace.

639
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:48,965
And so most any noisy workplace you walk into, you're going to see a poster that looks something like this.

640
01:01:48,965 --> 01:01:53,465
It has, to my knowledge, never, ever in the history of the world been read by a worker, but it's there.

641
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:57,845
So that's just kind of a quirk of the OSHA regulation.

642
01:01:58,355 --> 01:02:06,125
All right. Let's take 5 minutes right now and come back at 12 after, and we will continue on hearing loss prevention programs.

643
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:18,035
I'm just looking at the clock, and I. I may pick up my pace a little bit because I don't want to.

644
01:02:18,155 --> 01:02:26,614
We're running out of time. So we've we've talked already about a couple of requirements for hearing loss prevention and noise measurements,

645
01:02:26,615 --> 01:02:29,825
worker training, automatic testing is absolutely another one.

646
01:02:30,975 --> 01:02:34,175
Couple of things on hearing testing. So, one, this has to be free to employees.

647
01:02:34,175 --> 01:02:37,505
I've worked especially with construction contractors who were like, oh yeah,

648
01:02:37,715 --> 01:02:41,944
we tell people to go get a hearing test and then come back and bring us the results, you know, on their dime.

649
01:02:41,945 --> 01:02:44,165
That is not legal, actually. So don't do that.

650
01:02:45,455 --> 01:02:51,905
OSHA requires and pretty much everyone else agrees that the tests should ideally be given by an audiologist.

651
01:02:51,905 --> 01:02:59,645
Someone who's licensed and certified could also be given by an OTOLARYNGOLOGIST or an EMT who also is an expert in ears.

652
01:03:00,365 --> 01:03:04,715
You know, OSHA says any other M.D. could also administer your tests.

653
01:03:04,715 --> 01:03:11,045
I don't want like a proctologist running my audio metric testing program, but I guess according to OSHA, it's just another hole.

654
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:18,215
Anyway, the best bang for the buck here is a trained technician.

655
01:03:18,215 --> 01:03:21,965
And so there's a group, an accreditation body called and this is a mouthful.

656
01:03:22,295 --> 01:03:26,375
So it's the Council for Accreditation in Occupational Hearing Conservation.

657
01:03:26,585 --> 01:03:28,595
They go by kapok for obvious reasons,

658
01:03:29,015 --> 01:03:35,344
and so they act as a 40 hour training that trains technicians specifically to collect these tests in the workplace.

659
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:41,854
So they're well trained, they're very narrow. They're way cheaper than an audiologist, and they're trained if they flag a problem,

660
01:03:41,855 --> 01:03:46,295
they then report that to the audiologist who can who can interpret and make a decision.

661
01:03:46,805 --> 01:03:52,175
So context for my mind are, again, kind of the best investment to actually do these tests.

662
01:03:53,465 --> 01:03:58,055
Now, when we do a hearing test, there's a baseline test. So that's the very first one we do.

663
01:03:58,505 --> 01:04:02,795
Now, every other agency in the world says we really well,

664
01:04:02,915 --> 01:04:07,265
I should say every agency agrees this is the most important hearing test you'll give someone.

665
01:04:07,265 --> 01:04:11,705
It's the first one they get and it's the one we're going to come back and compare to every year.

666
01:04:12,245 --> 01:04:14,704
Now, every other agency in the world says, Well,

667
01:04:14,705 --> 01:04:22,055
of course you're going to do this hearing test before the worker ever has any noise exposure because duh, you want to get their baseline.

668
01:04:22,055 --> 01:04:29,105
OSHA says, you know, it'd be great if you do it in the first six months unless you're using a mobile test ban and then feel free to take up to a year.

669
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:35,135
So that's a year of essentially undocumented exposure a person gets before you get your baseline.

670
01:04:35,135 --> 01:04:41,435
That's that's not the good practice. So again, ideally, you do this before the worker ever has any workplace exposure.

671
01:04:42,515 --> 01:04:48,295
Now we talked previously in class about the possibility of getting a temporary threshold shift,

672
01:04:48,305 --> 01:04:53,975
a temporary change in your hearing if you go shooting or to a concert or something and you're hearing sounds muffled ringing.

673
01:04:54,425 --> 01:04:57,845
We don't want to do a test when somebody has got that temporary threshold shift.

674
01:04:57,845 --> 01:05:03,665
So we don't pull someone out of a rock concert and say, Hey, we're doing your baseline right now because we're not going to get a good number.

675
01:05:04,085 --> 01:05:08,015
So the best practice here is you want to make sure the person has been totally out of noise for at least

676
01:05:08,015 --> 01:05:13,655
14 hours before the test to give their hearing a chance to recover if they have a temporary loss.

677
01:05:15,065 --> 01:05:20,915
And that baseline is super important. But we do this again every year afterwards and we compare back to that baseline to see,

678
01:05:20,915 --> 01:05:27,994
is this worker's hearing changing now for the baseline, we want them to be out of noise for 14 hours.

679
01:05:27,995 --> 01:05:32,194
So typically we do that test at the start of a work shift for the annual.

680
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:38,675
We actually have an option here and the best practice is actually not to do the test at the start of the shift,

681
01:05:38,675 --> 01:05:42,635
but rather pull the worker off the line during the shift or even doing it afterwards.

682
01:05:43,235 --> 01:05:48,625
And the reason for this is if you pull a worker off a shift or, you know,

683
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:51,305
out in the middle of the day or at the end of the shift and you give them their

684
01:05:51,305 --> 01:05:54,575
annual hearing test and they've got a hearing loss compared to baseline,

685
01:05:54,905 --> 01:06:00,335
you can always retest them. And on that second test, you can make sure they don't have any noise exposure.

686
01:06:00,635 --> 01:06:06,095
What that means, though, is if you do that second test and they're hearing loss goes away, you caught them with the temporary threshold shift.

687
01:06:06,455 --> 01:06:10,055
That means they were getting too much noise that day in the workplace.

688
01:06:10,055 --> 01:06:14,555
So you've now just flagged a problem. Maybe they're not wearing their hearing protectors correctly.

689
01:06:14,555 --> 01:06:17,635
Maybe they're exposed. Sure is way higher than you think it is.

690
01:06:17,845 --> 01:06:21,804
At any rate, it's a way for you to catch that. And then again, you can always retest them.

691
01:06:21,805 --> 01:06:25,495
You want to get an actual kind of valid annual audiogram.

692
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:33,385
But catching those tests is catching, you know, unexplained overexposure is a great kind of quality control measure.

693
01:06:34,525 --> 01:06:37,795
And again, we're always going to come back to the baseline and we're going to say,

694
01:06:37,795 --> 01:06:40,885
like, you know, how were the results this year compared to baseline?

695
01:06:41,095 --> 01:06:45,684
Ideally, every year they'll have the same hearing, meaning that you've protected their hearing.

696
01:06:45,685 --> 01:06:53,785
They're not losing it as a part of their job. Now, we talked previously about biometric testing and the fact that we hear at different frequencies.

697
01:06:53,785 --> 01:07:01,495
So OSHA requires that we test at frequencies between 500 hertz, pretty low frequency, up to 6000 hertz, which is pretty high frequency.

698
01:07:02,215 --> 01:07:09,805
You may recall in our first noise lecture, I mentioned that a key distinction between so-called age related hearing loss and noise induced

699
01:07:09,805 --> 01:07:15,385
hearing loss is with noise we get a notch at 4000 hertz that that recovers at higher frequencies.

700
01:07:15,835 --> 01:07:20,005
And with, again, so-called age related loss, the understanding is it just kind of slopes off.

701
01:07:20,005 --> 01:07:21,895
And the higher the frequency, the worse the hearing.

702
01:07:22,465 --> 01:07:29,635
Well, if you stop testing at six, you don't really have a chance to see how well that noise notch recovers.

703
01:07:30,085 --> 01:07:34,525
And so the rest of the world, other than OSHA, says you ought to test at least up to eight.

704
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:41,215
And again, that's going to help you differentiate between a hearing loss from noise two or one that might be more due to aging.

705
01:07:42,505 --> 01:07:48,864
This is not you and me or the clock tech making this determination. So once the automatic results come in, if there's a change in hearing,

706
01:07:48,865 --> 01:07:53,215
that's when the audiologist steps in and they're going to look for something called a standard threshold shift.

707
01:07:54,475 --> 01:08:00,565
So an SGS is defined by OSHA as at the frequencies of two, three and 4000 hertz.

708
01:08:00,565 --> 01:08:06,775
You had a change compared to your last test of at least ten decibels on average,

709
01:08:06,895 --> 01:08:12,895
and you're hearing that those frequencies on average has to be at least 25 decibels.

710
01:08:13,195 --> 01:08:16,045
So kind of the I won't say it's an international agreement,

711
01:08:16,045 --> 01:08:21,895
but there's pretty good consensus that if you're hearing thresholds are 25 decibels or less, that's within the normal range.

712
01:08:22,255 --> 01:08:26,664
So this is basically saying you're hearing is changed from last year and it's bad enough that

713
01:08:26,665 --> 01:08:34,494
we we now consider it to be potentially a mild hearing loss if the worker does have an stress.

714
01:08:34,495 --> 01:08:38,365
As I said, we always have the option to retest them within 30 days.

715
01:08:38,905 --> 01:08:46,825
If the second test shield still shows that we have to inform the worker in writing again, that's a legal but also an ethical obligation.

716
01:08:47,515 --> 01:08:50,515
Some states will allow you to age adjust,

717
01:08:50,695 --> 01:08:56,125
meaning you kind of account for the fact that an older worker might have worse hearing just because they're older.

718
01:08:56,125 --> 01:09:03,385
I'll talk about that more in a moment. If we do get an employee who has a standard threshold shift, well, if they come to you and they're like,

719
01:09:03,385 --> 01:09:06,685
yeah, my job is pretty noisy and I'm supposed to wear hearing protectors, but I don't.

720
01:09:06,765 --> 01:09:11,005
It's like, well, duh, that's why you have a hearing loss. Let's get you in the hearing protectors.

721
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:15,925
If a worker comes to you and they're doing everything right, you know, I wear my hearing protectors.

722
01:09:15,925 --> 01:09:18,984
I've been trained. I'm worried about noise. My hearing is still changed.

723
01:09:18,985 --> 01:09:20,515
That's kind of the worst case scenario.

724
01:09:20,515 --> 01:09:26,995
So there we want to at least retrain them on hearing protectors, maybe put them into a different, better type of protector,

725
01:09:27,295 --> 01:09:32,575
maybe even think about changing their job a little bit to protect them against any further loss.

726
01:09:34,285 --> 01:09:38,845
Now, I mentioned age adjustment, so this is straight out of that OSHA standard.

727
01:09:38,845 --> 01:09:43,825
This is appendix F in the noise exposure or the permissible exposure limit document.

728
01:09:44,245 --> 01:09:50,425
And so you can see we've got five frequencies here between 1006 thousand hertz and you probably can't read it on the screen.

729
01:09:50,425 --> 01:09:54,655
But these are ages and we've got males on the left and females on the right.

730
01:09:55,285 --> 01:10:02,364
So OSHA back in 1978 looked at the available data and said, here are the thresholds,

731
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:08,155
at least five frequencies that we think people on average lose hearing at at these different ages.

732
01:10:08,155 --> 01:10:10,195
And you'll see the numbers are very small at the start.

733
01:10:10,675 --> 01:10:15,595
So sort of you're most of you were up here at the top, you know, very little age related hearing loss,

734
01:10:15,925 --> 01:10:20,605
whereas by the time you get down to 60, you might have a pretty substantial age related hearing loss.

735
01:10:21,355 --> 01:10:24,505
And again, there's a differentiation here between males and females.

736
01:10:25,225 --> 01:10:30,804
I am not a fan of age related or age adjustment for hearing loss for this very reason.

737
01:10:30,805 --> 01:10:35,274
All of you are unique individuals. None of you is average, right?

738
01:10:35,275 --> 01:10:39,115
And so for us to assume that those of you who are extremely healthy and have

739
01:10:39,115 --> 01:10:42,295
all had a really good hearing are going to lose the same amount of hearing.

740
01:10:42,295 --> 01:10:47,604
Who's someone whose hearing might have been decrepit from the start and who has other health conditions?

741
01:10:47,605 --> 01:10:51,955
It's again, none of us are the average, so why are we having an average applied to us?

742
01:10:52,555 --> 01:10:56,905
So there are some states that don't allow for age adjustment and some states that do.

743
01:10:56,905 --> 01:11:00,805
Again, I'm not a fan of it because I think it may overly penalize workers.

744
01:11:01,225 --> 01:11:08,335
Like if you imagine, for example, firefighters who tend to be in better health than the general population do I assume that they lose their

745
01:11:08,335 --> 01:11:14,544
hearing at the same rate as a sedentary office worker or someone who otherwise is just not as healthy?

746
01:11:14,545 --> 01:11:17,685
It's just not a very good. Foundation or assumption.

747
01:11:18,225 --> 01:11:22,305
And so I'm not a fan of this, but again, it is legal in some states to do that.

748
01:11:23,805 --> 01:11:29,954
And then we come to hearing protection devices. This is another case where you can't charge workers for hearing protectors.

749
01:11:29,955 --> 01:11:32,145
You have to provide them for free as part of the job.

750
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:40,965
We, in terms of OSHA, have to absolutely make sure that workers are wearing them anytime they're above 85 DBA,

751
01:11:41,445 --> 01:11:45,975
if they haven't had that baseline audiogram yet. And so that could be up to a year, according to OSHA.

752
01:11:46,545 --> 01:11:50,985
Or if they've already experienced a standard threshold shift, those workers are at increased risk.

753
01:11:50,985 --> 01:11:55,545
We want to do the best we possibly can to protect them and otherwise.

754
01:11:55,605 --> 01:12:00,225
According to OSHA, hearing protection uses the optional between 85 and 90 decibels,

755
01:12:01,125 --> 01:12:05,835
according to national ACG age and the rest of the world, everybody should be using them over 85.

756
01:12:05,835 --> 01:12:09,465
And again, I fall on that side of the spectrum myself.

757
01:12:10,425 --> 01:12:19,364
It's the employer's obligation to provide a selection of hearing protectors and train workers in the use and care and and selection at a

758
01:12:19,365 --> 01:12:26,835
bare minimum according to OSHA is to my ash would suggest a selection is more like for you know think of hearing protectors like shoes.

759
01:12:26,835 --> 01:12:29,955
The more you have available to you, the more likely you are to find one that works.

760
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:36,645
A selection is also like an earplug in an ear. If it's not a yellow earplug and a green earplug, the same type.

761
01:12:36,915 --> 01:12:37,965
That is not the selection.

762
01:12:38,865 --> 01:12:45,435
It's also the employer's obligation to make sure that the workers know how to use these and to make sure they actually wear them.

763
01:12:46,425 --> 01:12:50,415
And we're going to talk about hearing protectors much more in our For Fifth Noise lecture.

764
01:12:51,825 --> 01:12:56,684
So with that, I'd love to wrap up occupational noise and transition on the community noise.

765
01:12:56,685 --> 01:13:01,095
But before we do that, any lingering questions about occupational hearing conservation?

766
01:13:01,095 --> 01:13:08,295
Well, as I said, next lecture, we're going to focus a lot on noise controls especially, but any any burning questions before we move on.

767
01:13:10,975 --> 01:13:15,475
All right. Hearing none. So let's look now outside the workplace, at the community.

768
01:13:15,475 --> 01:13:21,715
And you all know you live in a community. Noise can be a huge problem in some communities, in neighborhoods.

769
01:13:22,105 --> 01:13:27,085
Now, when we think about noise from a public health perspective and trying to limit noise,

770
01:13:27,265 --> 01:13:30,535
typically our goals are we want to make sure people aren't losing their hearing.

771
01:13:30,835 --> 01:13:34,165
We also want to make sure that they can communicate clearly.

772
01:13:34,555 --> 01:13:40,785
You know, for instance, people can sit in their backyards and enjoy talking to each other without having to scream over some background noise.

773
01:13:40,795 --> 01:13:45,235
So limiting annoyance is another kind of critical aspect here.

774
01:13:45,865 --> 01:13:52,855
And community noise, of course, just like occupational noise is going to vary depending on the conditions, but also the expectations of the community.

775
01:13:53,515 --> 01:14:01,945
And so I can't tell you how many cases have been filed where there's an existing noise source, often an airport or a shooting range.

776
01:14:02,335 --> 01:14:06,624
And it used to be that this was way out of town, out in the country, not bothering anybody.

777
01:14:06,625 --> 01:14:12,805
And then a suburb kind of grows up around this source and suddenly people are irritated by the source that was there when they moved in.

778
01:14:13,225 --> 01:14:18,055
That's a classic tale, and there's lots of lawsuits that have been filed to try to shut these things down.

779
01:14:19,315 --> 01:14:24,294
Interestingly, they don't always succeed because often, again, the industry can say, well, we were here first.

780
01:14:24,295 --> 01:14:31,465
These people knew we were here when they moved in. So it's kind of unreasonable for them to move in and then kind of demand that we we shut down.

781
01:14:31,465 --> 01:14:38,245
But that's a common source of tension in communities. Let me just have you all pop into poll everywhere again, if you would.

782
01:14:38,245 --> 01:14:45,324
And I'm just kind of curious when you think about your own community, your neighborhood, what are some sources of noise that come to mind?

783
01:14:45,325 --> 01:15:01,145
Or maybe they're especially annoying to people. Yes.

784
01:15:01,835 --> 01:15:08,135
The whole lawn care industry. You can just like a blanket statement that frat parties.

785
01:15:08,255 --> 01:15:11,405
Yeah. We're in a college community. Absolutely.

786
01:15:12,575 --> 01:15:15,995
So construction and trains. I'm not surprised to see those both.

787
01:15:16,235 --> 01:15:19,985
I mean, those are like classic points of tension in communities.

788
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:23,525
You know, anything with traffic and transportation,

789
01:15:23,615 --> 01:15:32,345
it's a little tough when pull everywhere breaks these things up and think we've got garbage trucks and this is screaming children or what else?

790
01:15:32,645 --> 01:15:37,975
I guess it's screen to children are extremely annoying and you totally say that as a parent.

791
01:15:39,245 --> 01:15:43,085
Things like airports, your neighbors barking dog. My neighbors barking dog.

792
01:15:44,585 --> 01:15:48,184
Trucks, machines of all types. Yeah, parties.

793
01:15:48,185 --> 01:15:52,175
So all of these things are very sort of common offenders.

794
01:15:52,625 --> 01:15:57,215
But I would say, you know, the couple that are highlighted here, construction and trains,

795
01:15:57,215 --> 01:16:01,955
I don't know if you're thinking of the trains that blew in 3 a.m. as they rolled through downtown Ann Arbor.

796
01:16:02,315 --> 01:16:11,224
That annoys me as well. Skateboarders, not such a common one but you know you do you and so yeah, just lots of sources.

797
01:16:11,225 --> 01:16:14,885
There's kind of an endless variety of irritating noise sources in the community,

798
01:16:15,515 --> 01:16:21,004
the ones you name, construction, road traffic, rail traffic and air traffic.

799
01:16:21,005 --> 01:16:27,545
Those tend to be like the big four that most people identify as like, yeah, these are the noise issues in my community.

800
01:16:28,505 --> 01:16:32,404
Now with regards to community noise, I'll use this word pollution here.

801
01:16:32,405 --> 01:16:40,625
It's very interesting. It's only been in the last year that if you go to the CDC, National Environmental Health Public Tracking Page,

802
01:16:41,015 --> 01:16:43,774
where they have information on lots of public health threats,

803
01:16:43,775 --> 01:16:51,125
you know, air pollution, water pollution, nutrition, etc., noise has only it actually quite recently appeared there.

804
01:16:51,125 --> 01:16:52,295
It was just ignored.

805
01:16:52,685 --> 01:17:01,015
And historically in this country, you know, for the past 60 or 70 years, we've been making improvements in air pollution and water pollution.

806
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:05,285
We've been steadily ratcheting down the amounts of this stuff that's allowed in the environment.

807
01:17:05,705 --> 01:17:12,995
And we have, for the most part, just ignored noise. And so it's it's very unfortunate because it is absolutely a pollutant like these other things,

808
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:17,855
but we've treated it as though it was kind of a different and less harmful contaminant.

809
01:17:18,605 --> 01:17:26,245
So in terms of how we understand exposures in the community as opposed to the workplace where we can actually go out and make measurements,

810
01:17:26,265 --> 01:17:33,454
people are here. We can come up with an instrument that's a condition of their job, very relatively easy to get data in the community.

811
01:17:33,455 --> 01:17:38,735
It's less hard to get people to, you know, we knock on their door and say, can we put this noise monitor in your house?

812
01:17:38,735 --> 01:17:43,175
And they're like, Get off my property. And you I live in Michigan, you know, not so easy.

813
01:17:43,175 --> 01:17:48,364
And so in communities, we have tended to rely much more on noise mapping.

814
01:17:48,365 --> 01:17:56,045
So we'll have a statistical estimation package where we say, let me plug in the map here with roads and houses and factories.

815
01:17:56,435 --> 01:18:04,145
And then I can statistically predict what would the noise levels be at these homes that are located close to a factory or an airport or railroad,

816
01:18:04,145 --> 01:18:09,874
etc.? And so that's been done for 20 plus years now in the European Union.

817
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:18,274
And so their European Union Noise Observatory here, you can't see it on the projector, but hopefully you can see it on your slides.

818
01:18:18,275 --> 01:18:24,425
This is actually a map of Europe and the circles here are cities and the size of the circle indicates the number of

819
01:18:24,425 --> 01:18:33,425
people exposed to in blue is road noise greater than 75 decibels and red is road noise greater than 65 decibels.

820
01:18:33,725 --> 01:18:38,645
The cool thing about this map is it's like Google Maps. You can zoom in on a specific city and look at neighborhoods.

821
01:18:38,645 --> 01:18:40,415
You can zoom out and look at the whole continent.

822
01:18:41,015 --> 01:18:47,285
So the Europeans have a much better handle on how many people are exposed to harmful levels of noise.

823
01:18:47,645 --> 01:18:55,835
But it's all based on statistics and not so much on measurements, so that there's definitely benefits to predictive modeling.

824
01:18:56,315 --> 01:19:01,804
But it doesn't necessarily guarantee that the levels that they estimate are right now.

825
01:19:01,805 --> 01:19:09,725
More recently, in about 2016, we here in the U.S. essentially stole some of the models that the Europeans built to predict noise levels.

826
01:19:09,725 --> 01:19:12,785
And we said, well, let's use those here in the U.S. for the first time.

827
01:19:13,235 --> 01:19:20,505
So this is the national transportation noise map, all of these yellow sort of springy figures you see on here,

828
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:25,565
our roadways in the U.S., the red dots are airports that we have here.

829
01:19:25,955 --> 01:19:32,705
So, again, this is kind of our first foray into estimating noise levels in different areas of the country.

830
01:19:32,705 --> 01:19:38,434
You can also zoom in and out on this. The distinction between this and the European map is the Europeans have gone

831
01:19:38,435 --> 01:19:42,245
kind of a step further and said how many people are exposed to too much noise?

832
01:19:42,485 --> 01:19:45,485
Whereas we're just saying, what are the noise levels in the environment still?

833
01:19:45,485 --> 01:19:54,365
This is a huge leap forward for us. And so, for instance, if we zoom in on Atlanta, the home of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,

834
01:19:54,815 --> 01:19:59,765
you can start to see on this noise map, well, there's like very clear patterns here, purple here.

835
01:19:59,765 --> 01:20:04,835
It's kind of. The highest levels we experience. So ideas as to what this noise source is.

836
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:11,784
Do your work? Yeah, absolutely. It's Atlanta Hartsfield Airport.

837
01:20:11,785 --> 01:20:16,945
So these are the flight paths. So the planes take off and if you're off one direction or another or they go straight.

838
01:20:17,335 --> 01:20:25,464
This is the primary airport. This is another airport that's located essentially right next to the CDC headquarters, which is quite strange.

839
01:20:25,465 --> 01:20:29,034
And so you've got, you know, people whose job it is to prevent noise, you know,

840
01:20:29,035 --> 01:20:32,305
right next to this major noise source that they're exposed to every day.

841
01:20:33,985 --> 01:20:38,575
We have four different parts of the country, a little bit more detailed information.

842
01:20:38,575 --> 01:20:44,065
Some New York City, for example, has been measuring noise much longer than the CDC and the D.O.T. have.

843
01:20:44,395 --> 01:20:47,874
And so here we're looking at New York. So you might recognize the island of Manhattan.

844
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:52,555
Here in the center again, we've got JFK Airport, this bright blob here.

845
01:20:52,555 --> 01:20:57,775
We've got the Guardia, we've got Newark, and then we've got road traffic kind of connecting these things.

846
01:20:58,285 --> 01:21:05,245
So this is still a huge leap forward in terms of us being able to say, okay, if you leave, if you live in the area of Jamaica Bay here,

847
01:21:05,575 --> 01:21:10,825
you know, chances are your noise levels at your home are going to be somewhere between 70 and 79 decibels.

848
01:21:10,825 --> 01:21:14,544
That's that's good. But again, these are all statistical predictions.

849
01:21:14,545 --> 01:21:20,454
As a hygienist, I never believe this stuff unless someone has gone out and actually kind of verified some of these points,

850
01:21:20,455 --> 01:21:24,475
like, yeah, here's what the models said. And that's what we actually measured when we went out there.

851
01:21:25,075 --> 01:21:34,944
And what type of testing that would be used for open air, real time, what kind of sorry, I didn't understand what type of testing that was.

852
01:21:34,945 --> 01:21:42,375
What do you use or what have. Devices were used to monitor bandwidth exposure for sure,

853
01:21:42,375 --> 01:21:48,854
so we could take an integrating sound level meter and position it on a street post or out in the middle of a field or,

854
01:21:48,855 --> 01:21:52,905
you know, next to the runway here and actually measure the sound over some period of

855
01:21:52,905 --> 01:21:56,745
time and then compare that to what the model says the sound level should be.

856
01:21:56,955 --> 01:22:02,114
And if those numbers are the same, great, our models are working well. But you guys have taken bio statistics.

857
01:22:02,115 --> 01:22:09,375
You know, all models are wrong. Some models are useful. So if those numbers are far apart, that means the model isn't working as it should.

858
01:22:09,375 --> 01:22:14,835
And that's my suspicion for a lot of these models is they're better than nothing, but they're not perfect for sure.

859
01:22:16,155 --> 01:22:21,585
Now, the National Park Service, not to be outdone, actually released their own map in 2016.

860
01:22:21,585 --> 01:22:25,484
And so, you know, the Department of Transportation is focused on transportation.

861
01:22:25,485 --> 01:22:28,215
So they're modeling like road and rail and air traffic noise.

862
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:34,874
The National Park Service is more interested in how noisy is it in our national parks and national monuments,

863
01:22:34,875 --> 01:22:42,705
etc. But they took their model and they applied it to human cities as well, or urban conglomerations.

864
01:22:43,065 --> 01:22:46,964
And so it's quite interesting, their model is still a statistical model,

865
01:22:46,965 --> 01:22:50,565
but it was developed differently and it performs quite differently than the DOT map.

866
01:22:50,575 --> 01:22:55,545
So again, with models we always have to be a little skeptical. They're very useful, but they're not always right.

867
01:22:55,635 --> 01:22:59,534
I guess this is what I'm trying to get across. There's other cities.

868
01:22:59,535 --> 01:23:06,075
This is San Francisco, for instance, that has looked at mapping out the city of San Francisco to figure out which homes

869
01:23:06,075 --> 01:23:10,634
in here might be eligible to get more noise insulation from the Oakland Bay Bridge,

870
01:23:10,635 --> 01:23:15,465
for example, or from the Golden Gate Bridge. So this isn't all happening at the national level.

871
01:23:16,545 --> 01:23:18,285
There's also studies that have been done.

872
01:23:18,405 --> 01:23:27,075
So this is an example out of Boston where a researcher essentially had people contribute smartphone noise measurements and started to create a map.

873
01:23:27,075 --> 01:23:30,465
Now, not on statistical models, but on actual measurements.

874
01:23:30,885 --> 01:23:33,405
I've done the same in New York City and in Singapore.

875
01:23:34,095 --> 01:23:41,024
You know, these data are also not perfect because we're depending on people to make measurements and make them correctly and consistently.

876
01:23:41,025 --> 01:23:44,625
And that doesn't always happen, but it's just a different way to collect data.

877
01:23:45,195 --> 01:23:48,675
And it can tell us something about where people are getting more or less noise.

878
01:23:49,755 --> 01:23:54,494
Now, as I've hinted, noise maps are great, but they really are never going to be enough.

879
01:23:54,495 --> 01:24:00,045
So even if I have a super detailed noise map of Singapore, for instance,

880
01:24:00,585 --> 01:24:08,415
that map is based on some measurements or some predictions on a typically a kind of a spatial basis.

881
01:24:08,895 --> 01:24:13,395
What it doesn't tell me is, you know, what are the people actually do for work in this map?

882
01:24:13,425 --> 01:24:17,954
Because we might have two people who live in a quiet area of Singapore here,

883
01:24:17,955 --> 01:24:21,735
but one of them is a construction worker and the other one's an office worker, we might say,

884
01:24:21,735 --> 01:24:23,714
well, both of those people don't have any noise,

885
01:24:23,715 --> 01:24:28,515
but the construction worker might have a whopping amount of noise during the day when they're not at home.

886
01:24:28,515 --> 01:24:35,384
So the maps can never tell us anything about that. The other issue with maps is they're often, you know, we might just say, well,

887
01:24:35,385 --> 01:24:42,374
this is the map of this is what noise looks like in Singapore, failing to realize maybe in Singapore it's not such a big deal.

888
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:47,684
But like in Michigan, we might say, well, the noise levels outside are the same regardless of the time of year.

889
01:24:47,685 --> 01:24:53,465
But my windows are open in the summer and they're closed in the winter, and when they're open, they're letting all that sound in.

890
01:24:53,475 --> 01:24:56,835
I'm getting a much bigger exposure and that's totally missed by the map.

891
01:24:57,645 --> 01:25:01,515
So my argument here is for community noise, we need maps.

892
01:25:01,515 --> 01:25:06,255
They're very useful, but we also need measurements to kind of confirm that those maps are accurate.

893
01:25:07,695 --> 01:25:12,104
And I'll give you an example here. So this is a measurement to come back to your point, Andrew.

894
01:25:12,105 --> 01:25:16,725
So it's a fixed measurement location in a city,

895
01:25:17,145 --> 01:25:23,175
and someone's basically sat around all day and watched this monitoring station and watched what was going on around it.

896
01:25:23,505 --> 01:25:26,834
And you can start to see like, okay, there was a dog barking at this point here.

897
01:25:26,835 --> 01:25:30,885
There was a plane flying over. There was a train that went by.

898
01:25:31,425 --> 01:25:33,795
You know, the dog came back later and barked some more.

899
01:25:34,425 --> 01:25:40,214
And so just like in the workplace where I said, with a service economy, our levels have gotten more variable.

900
01:25:40,215 --> 01:25:44,085
The same is true of the community where you are and what time of day you're there

901
01:25:44,355 --> 01:25:50,115
can have a huge influence on how stable or how loud noise is those noise levels are.

902
01:25:50,115 --> 01:25:54,285
Excuse me. I lied to you earlier.

903
01:25:54,285 --> 01:26:01,935
There's one more equation in here. So we talked about the Lee queue as a measure of kind of the average sound in a typical workday.

904
01:26:02,445 --> 01:26:11,205
When we're looking at communities, we use a slight variation on the elec hue and it's called the day night sound level or two LDN or the TNL.

905
01:26:11,205 --> 01:26:14,445
It's referred to lots of different ways, all meaning the same thing.

906
01:26:15,105 --> 01:26:20,355
Basically, this is an Ellie. Q So an equivalent continuous average over a 24 hour period.

907
01:26:20,655 --> 01:26:24,375
You know, we're not interested in 8 hours at work now. We're interested in the whole day.

908
01:26:25,065 --> 01:26:31,635
But unlike in a cue, there's an artificial penalty that's applied between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.

909
01:26:32,055 --> 01:26:36,345
So what are most people doing between 10 p.m. and 7 p.m. sleep?

910
01:26:36,345 --> 01:26:43,714
Yeah, obviously. Hi grad students. But, you know. And so the idea here is when you're sleeping, you're more sensitive to noise.

911
01:26:43,715 --> 01:26:47,945
It's going to wake you up. It's been disruptive. And so we're going to treat those hours as kind of sensitive.

912
01:26:48,605 --> 01:26:51,365
And so if you remember back to our Elly Cue equation,

913
01:26:51,365 --> 01:27:00,005
we had ten times the log of ten and we were divided by one over the duration of our measurement, let's say 8 hours in the workday.

914
01:27:00,335 --> 01:27:04,595
And then we were just taking an average of all the different measurements we made during the day.

915
01:27:04,985 --> 01:27:08,104
So this part of the equation on the left side is just the same as in Ellie.

916
01:27:08,105 --> 01:27:14,885
Q And that applies to the hours of 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. of normal waking hours.

917
01:27:15,335 --> 01:27:19,234
And then on the right side here we have the penalty periods,

918
01:27:19,235 --> 01:27:26,704
your 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. and here you can see we take whatever level was measured during that period and we add ten decibels to it artificially.

919
01:27:26,705 --> 01:27:34,985
So we're just saying that period is sensitive. So we're going to penalize any sounds that occur during sort of traditional sleeping hours.

920
01:27:35,585 --> 01:27:42,095
And so the LDN is something that's been used for 50 years now to assess noise in communities,

921
01:27:42,095 --> 01:27:49,835
and there have been tons of studies that have connected different eldon's to the percent of the community that's annoyed.

922
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:57,335
So back in the sixties and seventies when jet aircraft and air traffic was really increasing rapidly,

923
01:27:57,905 --> 01:28:04,864
communities started to get really annoyed because these planes were exceedingly loud and the FAA started to sponsor studies to figure out like,

924
01:28:04,865 --> 01:28:08,495
Well, how loud can it be before some fraction of the community is pissed off?

925
01:28:08,495 --> 01:28:10,324
And so there are again,

926
01:28:10,325 --> 01:28:20,645
just scads of these studies more recently going beyond airplanes to other types of noise like road noise or noise from industry or even wind turbines.

927
01:28:21,305 --> 01:28:27,845
And so they've said, well, let's look at the the day night noise level and we'll look at what that level is

928
01:28:27,845 --> 01:28:31,475
and we'll look at the fraction of the community that's like seriously annoyed.

929
01:28:31,835 --> 01:28:32,944
And so aircraft again,

930
01:28:32,945 --> 01:28:38,795
here is kind of the gold standard where there's tons of studies that say if you're at a day night noise level of about 60 decibels,

931
01:28:39,095 --> 01:28:42,875
about 35% of the community is going to be really angry about that.

932
01:28:43,265 --> 01:28:47,765
And if you get up to 75 decibels, like 80% of the community is going to be mad.

933
01:28:48,245 --> 01:28:51,095
You can see for road traffic, it's not quite as bad.

934
01:28:51,095 --> 01:28:57,155
So if we get up to 75 decibels for the road traffic, it's only about 40% of people are seriously annoyed.

935
01:28:57,455 --> 01:28:58,655
And if you think about it, you know,

936
01:28:58,685 --> 01:29:05,105
kind of the background noise from a roadway nearby is much different than a plane loudly going overhead, very unpredictable.

937
01:29:05,105 --> 01:29:09,525
Yet at alternating intervals, the same for rail noise.

938
01:29:09,525 --> 01:29:15,005
So rail noise is less annoying at a given noise level than either road or air traffic noise.

939
01:29:15,425 --> 01:29:20,554
And I will say these studies don't tease out like is it the train horn tooting

940
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:24,545
at 3 a.m. or is it just the background noise of a train rumbling through town?

941
01:29:25,085 --> 01:29:31,145
The noise from trains is much more low frequency. It tends not to be as irritating, even though it can still be quite loud.

942
01:29:31,715 --> 01:29:37,715
And then like wind turbines here. So this is a new addition we can see wind turbine noise tends to be much more annoying

943
01:29:37,715 --> 01:29:42,035
at lower levels than some of these other types of more traditional noise sources.

944
01:29:42,635 --> 01:29:48,725
So when these noise maps are created, it's often to figure out where are the people in the community going to be annoyed and

945
01:29:48,725 --> 01:29:52,655
how do we kind of make those people happier so they'll reelect us as politicians?

946
01:29:54,575 --> 01:30:00,755
So in the cabinet or excuse me, in the workplace, we have hearing loss prevention programs which are designed to help us protect workers,

947
01:30:00,755 --> 01:30:03,845
hearing there's not really an equivalent program for the community.

948
01:30:03,845 --> 01:30:07,505
With one exception, there's this danger of a dangerous decibels program.

949
01:30:08,165 --> 01:30:14,015
And so this is an NIH funded outreach effort, for lack of a better word,

950
01:30:14,015 --> 01:30:20,735
that has included things like museum exhibits and training for educators and training for schoolchildren.

951
01:30:21,095 --> 01:30:26,135
And it's really focused on three things. It's trying to get the public to realize, like, what is noisy around us?

952
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:31,144
Why might that be bad for me and what can I do to protect myself?

953
01:30:31,145 --> 01:30:36,215
And they've kind of converted the whole hearing conservation program into walk away,

954
01:30:36,245 --> 01:30:44,285
turn it down and protect your ears and sort of engineering controls and then more of a personal protective equipment flavor.

955
01:30:45,455 --> 01:30:51,395
Now, when it comes to regulation of community noise, back in 1972, Congress actually told the EPA,

956
01:30:51,395 --> 01:30:55,295
we are giving you the power to regulate noise from construction equipment,

957
01:30:55,805 --> 01:31:01,625
transportation equipment, actually, basically anything with a motor or an engine or anything that's electric or electronic.

958
01:31:02,045 --> 01:31:04,595
So that's a very powerful mandate.

959
01:31:05,285 --> 01:31:14,434
And for about ten years, the EPA Office of Noise Making and Control was the world leader in understanding and controlling noise in the community.

960
01:31:14,435 --> 01:31:20,255
So during that period they came up with limits that are actually still enforced for air compressors,

961
01:31:20,255 --> 01:31:25,685
for motorcycles, for medium and heavy duty trucks, basically for garbage trucks as well.

962
01:31:26,165 --> 01:31:29,524
So they were doing great work on kind of a shoestring budget.

963
01:31:29,525 --> 01:31:37,055
And then the Reagan administration came into power in 1981 and at the time EPA was thinking about regulating noise for.

964
01:31:37,115 --> 01:31:43,774
Lawnmowers and Ronald Reagan. You know, a conservative president said that is a gross example of government overreach.

965
01:31:43,775 --> 01:31:47,075
What business is of the government to tell me how loud my lawn mower is.

966
01:31:47,705 --> 01:31:52,705
And so the Reagan administration couldn't take the law off the books.

967
01:31:52,715 --> 01:31:59,625
That's Congress's job. But they zeroed out the budget for the Office of Noise Abatement Control, and it has never had a budget ever since.

968
01:31:59,645 --> 01:32:04,235
So all these rules are still on the books, but there's nobody at the EPA to actually enforce them,

969
01:32:04,235 --> 01:32:09,185
and there's nobody there to continue the great work that they did, which is very unfortunate.

970
01:32:09,195 --> 01:32:13,925
So essentially everything we know about noise in this country basically stopped in 1981.

971
01:32:14,225 --> 01:32:18,755
And since then we've been looking mostly to Western Europe to kind of figure

972
01:32:18,755 --> 01:32:22,655
out what what should we be doing and what should the concerns be around noise.

973
01:32:23,735 --> 01:32:29,715
So while the EPA was in the noise business for that ten year period, they came up with a couple of different exposure limits.

974
01:32:29,735 --> 01:32:34,745
Again, EPA's job is to protect people from environmental health hazards.

975
01:32:35,315 --> 01:32:41,465
So they started thinking about, well, what would a safe noise level be if someone was exposed for 40 years?

976
01:32:41,675 --> 01:32:46,195
That number, of course, relevant for the workplace, not so much for people today.

977
01:32:46,205 --> 01:32:49,645
What's the average lifespan of an American today? Anybody know?

978
01:32:50,285 --> 01:32:57,005
It depends on the gender. Also, it's gone down since COVID, which is most unfortunate, but let's say it's about 78 years.

979
01:32:57,005 --> 01:33:03,305
So the EPA is only assuming about half of that is going to have noise exposure, which is a gross miss assumption.

980
01:33:03,755 --> 01:33:06,544
Nevertheless, they came out with science in 1974.

981
01:33:06,545 --> 01:33:14,075
That still is the state of the art today that says if we can keep people below a 70 decibel average on a 24 hour period,

982
01:33:14,075 --> 01:33:17,974
we have eliminated any risk of any noise induced hearing loss.

983
01:33:17,975 --> 01:33:26,105
So that's a truly protective number, as opposed to OSHA 90 decibels for 8 hours where one in three workers might get a hearing loss.

984
01:33:28,505 --> 01:33:31,895
So just in the interest of time here, because we've only got a few minutes left,

985
01:33:32,315 --> 01:33:37,714
I'll mention the EPA and others have also come up with recommendations on noise,

986
01:33:37,715 --> 01:33:44,945
not just to prevent hearing loss, but to prevent annoyance to make sure people can use their yards in residential areas.

987
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:52,204
The W.H.O., the World Health Organization, came up with an update in 1999 that kept that same EPA recommendation.

988
01:33:52,205 --> 01:33:58,024
That's still valid, but added on to it and started to say, like, if you're in a school room, you need quiet.

989
01:33:58,025 --> 01:34:01,295
If you're in a hospital ward, you need lots of quiet.

990
01:34:01,295 --> 01:34:05,104
And if you think about a hospital, that's typically not a very quiet environment,

991
01:34:05,105 --> 01:34:12,005
and now there's a pretty strong literature that links higher noise in hospitals to worse health care outcomes and slower patient recovery.

992
01:34:13,805 --> 01:34:18,305
Since the federal government's basically been out of business since 1981, the cities have kind of stepped up.

993
01:34:18,305 --> 01:34:25,775
So New York City has a great kind of exemplary noise ordinance that they actually enforce that covers a whole bunch of potential sources of noise.

994
01:34:27,245 --> 01:34:33,454
And then just in kind of conclusion here, I'll transition to two offices and other environments.

995
01:34:33,455 --> 01:34:39,425
So similar to communities in offices, we often want to make sure while people can talk to each other and they can understand they're intelligible,

996
01:34:39,785 --> 01:34:42,965
it's not so noisy that their performance is being degraded.

997
01:34:43,475 --> 01:34:50,125
And of course, with office workers, we're always trying to cut down on annoyance and complaints, which especially for those of you who go on to H,

998
01:34:50,435 --> 01:34:55,235
if you have office workers, they can be the noisiest bunch of all in terms of complaining about their working conditions.

999
01:34:56,285 --> 01:35:02,495
And I say that as an office worker, of course. So one of the things we're interested in is speech intelligibility.

1000
01:35:02,495 --> 01:35:06,275
I want to be in an office where if someone says something, I can understand it clearly.

1001
01:35:06,935 --> 01:35:10,055
Noise as well as hearing loss are going to interfere with that.

1002
01:35:10,565 --> 01:35:17,944
And so there's something called a preferred speech interference level or PCL that's designed to ensure that if different noise levels,

1003
01:35:17,945 --> 01:35:22,385
people are going to be able to communicate clearly. And in this case, it's the PSA, Al.

1004
01:35:22,385 --> 01:35:28,835
It's just an actual arithmetic average of the levels at 500,002 thousand hertz.

1005
01:35:29,585 --> 01:35:33,604
And so I'll talk about application of that in a moment.

1006
01:35:33,605 --> 01:35:38,975
But as we start to think about who's in office environments, well, it's often males and females, of course,

1007
01:35:39,335 --> 01:35:45,005
and we can think about sort of, well, how loud do people speak in a normal noise free background environment?

1008
01:35:45,005 --> 01:35:48,935
And it turns out that there are different speaking levels between males and females.

1009
01:35:49,415 --> 01:35:55,415
So when they're speaking just sort of casually, their noise, their speaking levels in terms of decibels are pretty similar.

1010
01:35:56,195 --> 01:36:00,185
But as they start to get more and more vocal effort, by the time we get up to a shower,

1011
01:36:00,245 --> 01:36:06,215
males are about seven decibels louder on average than females, and maybe the females in the room will agree with that.

1012
01:36:07,265 --> 01:36:09,875
So one of the things we have to be concerned about is, well,

1013
01:36:10,565 --> 01:36:14,884
if people need to understand each other in a workplace and they speak at different levels,

1014
01:36:14,885 --> 01:36:19,805
kind of how far apart can we put them and still expect them to be communicating clearly?

1015
01:36:20,255 --> 01:36:25,144
And so this is a graph here that shows, depending on different kinds of speaking efforts,

1016
01:36:25,145 --> 01:36:34,355
a sort of normal voice or shout or the loudest you could possibly scream like, how far apart can people be and understand each other?

1017
01:36:34,835 --> 01:36:43,704
And we can start to consider how noisy it is. In the background, so I might be as much as 30 feet from someone if the background noise is quite low

1018
01:36:43,705 --> 01:36:47,515
and 40 decibels and I'll be able to be heard quite clearly in that environment.

1019
01:36:47,935 --> 01:36:54,145
On the other hand, if the background is 70 decibels, then I might only be about five feet away.

1020
01:36:54,145 --> 01:37:00,775
And beyond that, someone's going to have trouble hearing me. So we need to design our workplaces so people are close enough that they can communicate.

1021
01:37:01,165 --> 01:37:08,515
And then the other thing we have to recognize is when the background noise level gets loud enough, when you're up here in the hundred, 110, 120,

1022
01:37:08,965 --> 01:37:15,565
even if I'm standing directly next to somebody shouting in their ear, they are literally not going to be able to hear you with that background noise.

1023
01:37:15,955 --> 01:37:20,515
So this is a kind of graph that people can use to design a workstation and decide like,

1024
01:37:20,515 --> 01:37:25,615
how close do people need to be given the background noise to make sure that they can still communicate with each other?

1025
01:37:27,265 --> 01:37:31,455
I mentioned the PCL there, the preferred speech interference level.

1026
01:37:31,795 --> 01:37:34,704
So there's guidance out there for different kinds of rooms.

1027
01:37:34,705 --> 01:37:43,104
You know, I might want my theater where I'm doing performance to have a different PCL than a room where there's just a bunch of people typing in,

1028
01:37:43,105 --> 01:37:52,405
not talking to each other. So we can have kind of some guidance here for how how much noise we can have those frequencies of 500, 1002 thousand hertz.

1029
01:37:53,515 --> 01:37:58,674
The other thing I'll say, and then we're running out of time, is there are so-called noise criterion curves.

1030
01:37:58,675 --> 01:38:05,275
So these are designed to protect not just our ability to speak, but just kind of a pleasant, audible environment.

1031
01:38:05,725 --> 01:38:11,965
And so to use these curves, we would essentially take active band measurements across all of these frequencies,

1032
01:38:12,535 --> 01:38:14,845
and then we would mark our measurements on the curve here.

1033
01:38:15,115 --> 01:38:21,235
And the highest curve that our are octave band measurements touch then becomes our noise criterion curve.

1034
01:38:21,865 --> 01:38:28,345
And just like with the PSA. Al So I might take some measurements, I sort of record them and we'll actually do this in our lab session.

1035
01:38:29,125 --> 01:38:32,694
And then there's guidance for, well, okay, you have an ANC of 55.

1036
01:38:32,695 --> 01:38:36,175
What kind of environment might that be appropriate for actually?

1037
01:38:36,205 --> 01:38:37,435
None. That's really loud.

1038
01:38:37,795 --> 01:38:44,185
If we went to a concert hall, for instance, we want our octave band levels to be way down here at the bottom because concert halls need to be quiet.

1039
01:38:45,715 --> 01:38:52,044
Okay, so that's it. We're out of time. So in our next class section, we'll talk more about propagation and control of noise.

1040
01:38:52,045 --> 01:38:53,034
And then the one after that,

1041
01:38:53,035 --> 01:38:58,135
we're going to have a fun session where you're all going to try and let your hearing protectors and we'll we'll see how those work for you.

1042
01:38:58,585 --> 01:39:03,984
So thanks so much, everybody. Also, while you're packing up, hopefully everybody saw their grades on the radiation case study.

1043
01:39:03,985 --> 01:39:07,015
And so sorry, they've been sitting in there and I just never released them.

1044
01:39:07,015 --> 01:39:12,594
So if anyone ever gets irritated at how long it's taking me to grade, please send me an email because chances are it's done.

1045
01:39:12,595 --> 01:39:15,984
But I just have forgotten to unhide the grades. So thanks everybody.

1046
01:39:15,985 --> 01:39:16,915
Have a great rest of the week.
