1
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,100
All right, guys, let's get started. So this is not.

2
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,230
This is wrong. I'm sorry. This is a second exam. It's not cumulative and.

3
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:31,270
It is not. I mean, it's not you won't be directly asked about material from the first half.

4
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,309
It is hard to avoid things like the incidence rate and more, you know what I mean?

5
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,250
Like stuff like that. That was kind of foundational that we talk about throughout.

6
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:48,450
So obviously that will exist on the test, but it's not like the material won't be directly asked about from the first part.

7
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,510
Does that make sense? Okay. So this is a lie.

8
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,339
I apologize. In the past, I have had it be an actual final like during finals week,

9
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:07,570
and I decided that that was a lot and we should just go ahead and have it be a second exam during class time.

10
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,780
Yes. Thank you. Okay, good. We all agree this was better.

11
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:23,250
All right. So that said, we'll start with these are the lectures that were in the second half of.

12
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:35,790
So genetic counseling. Any questions on this? Oh, yes.

13
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,550
Sorry. So. The panel's looking for your markers.

14
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,030
More. More or fewer.

15
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,670
Right. So remember she was talking about kind of. Sorry.

16
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,440
I'm wearing a flowy thing today, and this really wants to grab it every time I move.

17
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,460
So she was talking about the two, like the pros and cons, right?

18
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,790
It's a tradeoff. So if you it seems like more markers would always be better.

19
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,890
Right. But does anybody remember some reasons why fewer markers might actually have been better?

20
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:21,189
Like, what are the pros of doing a panel with fewer markers? Yeah, that's exactly right.

21
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:26,980
Particularly for people who aren't white. Right. So like nonwhite, I think Asian now has the highest rates of the US.

22
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,960
So people who are nonwhite are more likely to get a very important significance.

23
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:38,740
The more things you test, the more likely you are to get one of those. Like also, if you're going for a smaller panel,

24
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:46,330
you're usually testing for genes that are well-characterized for which there are clinical recommendations if you test positive.

25
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:54,310
A lot of these like 30, 40, 60 gene panels are including things where there's kind of a moderate level of increased risk.

26
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:59,230
Not like not like your BRCA1 and two very, very high increased risks,

27
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,060
but like sort of somewhere in the middle and nobody's studied like what to do about it.

28
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,730
So like if you were if you're a breast cancer, if you have a strong family history of breast cancer,

29
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:17,010
you go get one of these big panels and you find that you have a variant in one of these genes for which there's not really any clinical guidance.

30
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,070
Do you get prophylactic mastectomy? I don't know.

31
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,950
I mean, that's it. No one knows, right? That's the point. You're like, no, I'm like, maybe.

32
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,190
I don't know. They can't really guide you on that very well.

33
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,320
So you get more actionable.

34
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,260
It's kind of about the patient's tolerance for uncertainty and.

35
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:48,350
You know, I mean and so that's a very that's why we have genetic counselors is because these are difficult conversations, difficult to explain.

36
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,819
But the concept of a variant of unknown significance to somebody who doesn't

37
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:59,360
have a huge degree of health literacy and then to also expect them to like.

38
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,570
Deal with making the decisions that come from that. When the answers are very clear, it can be very hard, right?

39
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:10,290
Especially if you have someone who isn't white and is more likely to get the US right.

40
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:13,590
So it's it's not a yes or no question. Right.

41
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:20,820
It's not a this is better. That is better. You know, I would like you to be able to describe to me kind of the pros and cons of that,

42
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,300
maybe in a slightly longer answer format, possibly for like five ish points, maybe.

43
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,930
There. It seems that that could be a good question for that kind of thing.

44
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:43,770
Maybe I'll. Other genetic counseling questions.

45
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:57,410
Yeah. Should we know specific conditions like we talked about it before the end of the before the midterm?

46
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:04,100
Yeah. I mean, I'm not going to ask you the same way I did before, but, you know,

47
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,120
have that to the degree that it came up in the genetic counseling match lecture, perhaps.

48
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:21,849
Cancer prevention. So we had kind of an overview lecture about it.

49
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:29,560
And then we talked about specific primary prevention, you know, specific risk factors that are right for primary prevention, for multiple cancers.

50
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:35,440
We talked about screening and we talked about tertiary prevention in the context of treatment for head and neck cancer mostly.

51
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,340
Yes. I understand one concern for women in those trends.

52
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,620
Yeah. Like big difference between women and men.

53
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,910
Advertise me later. I would not say so, no.

54
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:57,290
So, um. So earlier studies.

55
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:03,490
So remember, this is about that. Let me see if I can pull it up. Okay.

56
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,440
So remember, we saw this tuna study. Here.

57
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:16,710
It's this. So remember, we have this earlier quote,

58
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:26,500
this is one where they found that the the risk of lung cancer for a current smoker who was a man was 12.2, but it was only 2.73 for women.

59
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,390
And then if you go all the way to the contemporary cohort, it's basically exactly the same, more or less.

60
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,729
And the reason for this is that smoking is a dose response relationship.

61
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:46,690
And when you say current smoker, you could have people who are smoking when they go out drinking on the weekends and having two cigarets a week.

62
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:52,240
And you could have people who are smoking two packs a day and not know the difference between those people.

63
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,010
Right. If I say I'm a current smoker, maybe I started last year.

64
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,430
And if you say you're a current smoker, maybe you started when you were 12. Right.

65
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:06,110
And that's a very different dose of exposure and therefore a different relative risk of lung cancer.

66
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:14,050
Right. So part of the issue here is recognizing this strong dose response relationship between

67
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:22,510
tobacco exposure and lung cancer risk and then recognizing this birth cohort issue.

68
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:31,580
Right. That women who were born earlier in the 1900s and 19 tens, who would have been those one participants?

69
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:39,579
Right. Because remember, they recruited them in 1959 to 1965 and they were like in their fifties and sixties.

70
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,970
So they would have been born in the 1900s and 19 tens.

71
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:51,010
Women who were born then tended not to start until later in life, and they never smoked as much.

72
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:59,980
They were much more likely to start later and smoke smoke socially rather than like on a regular basis than men in the same era.

73
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:06,370
In later eras, men and women both started smoking kind of in the same way, starting earlier and smoking every day.

74
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,930
Is that so? In this picture here,

75
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:20,379
current smoking is a very different exposure to cigaret smoke for women in the one cohort than it was for men in the KPS one cohort.

76
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,810
But by the time you get to the contemporary cohort,

77
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,850
the dose of exposure is basically the same for it because they kind of started smoking at the same age.

78
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:35,380
They smoke in the same way. Yes. So the first cohort, if they were to ask more specifically if cigarets per day, probably do the exact same.

79
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,100
Yes. If they were able to do a better job.

80
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:45,879
It's almost like you have a misclassification issue or a missed measurement issue here because you're counting

81
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,860
people as the same exposure level when they really aren't like how we're going current smokers the same thing.

82
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:59,710
So yes, you would probably see very similar things between men and women if you had accurately counted for like intensity and duration of smoking.

83
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:10,030
One common thing that people say wrong about this is that women didn't start smoking until later in time.

84
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,930
And so, like the prevalence of smoking in women has always been lower in the population.

85
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,999
That doesn't matter. For this, we're looking here at the relative risk.

86
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,730
If you smoke, what is your risk of lung cancer compared to a person who doesn't smoke?

87
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,610
Right. Does it matter how many people smoke?

88
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:33,940
In the population of ten women smoked, you can compare their risk of lung cancer to the people who didn't.

89
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,910
Right. So this isn't about when in time at a population level women started smoking.

90
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:46,180
It's not about how much they ever smoked in terms of like how many women smoked in the population.

91
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,700
That's why lung cancer at a population level has always been more common in men than women.

92
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:59,860
Right. But the relative risk is if you have this risk factor, what is your risk compared to someone who does not?

93
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:05,260
It doesn't matter how many people have that risk factor. Right. That's a different question.

94
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:14,390
Does that make sense to everybody? Yeah.

95
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:21,680
So this difference is really about demonstrating that smoke exposure, smoke and smoke exposure.

96
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,860
And lung cancer is a very strong dose response relationship.

97
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,820
Okay. Yes. You asked us to understand this.

98
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:46,140
Yes. Yes. So where do I say that?

99
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:55,930
I know. I say it. You're right. I do have a strong dose response and that explains these y earlier studies found much

100
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,829
lower associations because the smoking patterns were such that in earlier birth cohorts,

101
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:07,670
women had a lower dose of exposure. For being a current smoker compared to people, compared to men in those earlier cohorts.

102
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:13,069
A current smoker who was a man in an earlier birth cohort had a much higher dose of

103
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:17,960
exposure to smoke than a woman who was a current current smoker in those earlier public.

104
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,959
And I think the line from that paper that is like, you know, everyone wishes they wrote that line.

105
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:32,110
You know, if women smoke like men, they die like men. I think that's actually in the paper like, oh.

106
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:39,820
Wow. Yes.

107
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:55,280
It is the exact size. If you smoke regularly, your risk of lung cancer is about 25 to 50 times that of a nonsmoker.

108
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:04,390
And of course, again, that number depends on dose, right?

109
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:14,080
But generally speaking, now, people who smoke tend to start in their teens, smoke every day, smoke half a day or so.

110
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:20,270
Right. Most people are not. I would venture to say that most people who smoke cigarets are not social smokers.

111
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:25,569
Right. So this is kind of the general.

112
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,290
This feels like a current. Longer term smoker.

113
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:37,210
Yes. I'm you. Yeah.

114
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,590
You know, are you going to. Not necessarily.

115
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,470
I mean, there's other things that cause lung cancer, right? There's radon exposure.

116
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,960
There's people who never smoked and never appeared to be strongly, strongly exposed to secondhand smoke and they still get lung cancer.

117
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:58,809
Right. So I guess my point is that we think of lung cancer as being entirely caused by smoking,

118
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,920
but there are a proportion of lung cancers that occur at never smokers.

119
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,020
It's small, but like it's not 1%. It's also not 50%.

120
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,990
That's about 10%. Right.

121
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:15,460
So being calibrated to that idea, I think, is important, recognizing that about 10% of lung cancer cases happen in people who never smoked.

122
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,139
And whether it's because they have a genetic predisposition or because they were exposed to radon or

123
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,660
because they were exposed to something at their job or because they were exposed to secondhand smoke.

124
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,950
Hard to say. It's much more difficult to say for sure.

125
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,630
If someone's a lifelong smoker and they get lung cancer, you're kind of like, I think I know why.

126
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:37,460
Right. I think I got a clue. But if someone is a never smoker and they get lung cancer, it's much less clear.

127
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:43,960
Right. But about 10% of lung cancer cases do happen in never smokers.

128
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:57,840
Obesity, obesity and diet. And this is why I wanted to point out like the relative risk, right?

129
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:03,630
So in for smoking it's like 25 to 50, which is, you should know, enormous.

130
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:10,800
Like you will almost you will probably never in your lifetimes conducted epidemiologic study and find a relative risk of 25 to 50 like.

131
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,440
That's. It's just. That's astronomical, right?

132
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:27,969
But like so for the relative risk of like obesity and cancer is around too little more for some cancers, a little less for some cancers.

133
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:32,720
But generally it's about two, right. And like two is a fairly strong risk factor.

134
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,430
Right. Like if you find something with the relative risk of two. That's pretty good.

135
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:42,640
That's pretty good. A risk. Like twice the risk. That's pretty you know, that's pretty decent risk factor.

136
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:51,639
So just understanding, like when we're talking about smoking and lung cancer, we're talking 25 to 50, which is like bonkers.

137
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:57,130
Huge. Right. Obesity, which is this. You know, everyone talks about obesity, cancer, obesity and cancer.

138
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:04,420
The relative risk is like two. Right. Just that's kind of why I want you to know in the ballpark of those just to be calibrated.

139
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:11,850
So like what we're talking about in terms of risk factors. Other obesity questions.

140
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:22,390
Conversely, the pros and cons of each. Yeah.

141
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,290
So food frequency questionnaire.

142
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:31,780
I would say the pros are it. Guess at like usual average diet.

143
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,100
Right. Um.

144
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,260
But people are really bad at being very specific about that.

145
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:47,260
The 24 hour recall helps people be a little bit more specific about what they ate.

146
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,669
Right. Because you're just remembering, oh, okay, yesterday or even just keeping a food diary as you eat.

147
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,890
Right. Like it's going to be more accurate, probably.

148
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:02,440
But if you ask somebody on a weekday, it might be very different than what they eat on the weekend.

149
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,320
If you ask somebody in the summertime, it might be very different than in the wintertime.

150
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:15,309
Right? Like, I'm not making a lot of stew in the summer, but, you know, a nice super stew in the wintertime.

151
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:20,580
Sounds lovely. Right. And I'm not I do not eat pale pink, mealy dried tomatoes.

152
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:26,470
I refuse. I will pick that up and put it over here and I will not eat it on my sandwich because it's gross.

153
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,270
But in the summertime, I'll eat all the raw tomatoes I can find out of my garden.

154
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,540
Right? So like just examples, right?

155
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,569
So if you ask somebody about on average over the year, how much of this do you eat?

156
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:42,850
You might catch more of those seasonal differences in like weekend weekday differences, right?

157
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:48,940
You're trying to ask them to kind of like aggregate over their experience of a year about how much they eat these things, but.

158
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:56,360
It's hard to be accurate. And then for the biomarkers, I would say that I see I'll get to one second.

159
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,960
The biomarkers, I would say, are not measuring diet as a whole.

160
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,250
Right. We do not really have biomarkers for the totality of a person's diet.

161
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,140
We can measure like how much vitamin D you eat, how much fat you need, how much.

162
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:16,760
Right. But they're not long term. They're usually some sort of recent measure.

163
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:23,450
And they're not they're not getting at your diet as a whole.

164
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,630
They're like looking at some little piece of it. Does that make sense? Yeah. So they can all give you information, but it's like.

165
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:34,879
It's like the blind people in the elephant, right? Like if you touch the ear, you're going to think it's a one flat.

166
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,160
Flat. If you touch the tail, you're gonna think it's like a snake. You know what I mean?

167
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,739
Like, so it's it's difficult for you, and it's kind of recency bias.

168
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:48,410
Like, when you take the edge in the winter, you're more vulnerable, as do the past few months.

169
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,800
So you maybe think more often. Sure, possibly.

170
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,250
I mean, it's it's it's it's flawed.

171
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,440
There's all kinds of potential flaws. Right.

172
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:05,509
But what we hope is that by using any of these methods, the food frequency questionnaire or the food diary,

173
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:10,460
you can probably separate people who eat a lot of something from people who eat very little of it.

174
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:21,260
Right. So we're not good at measuring absolute amounts of intake, but you're probably decent at categorizing people as a lot versus a very little.

175
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,250
But there's a lot of this measurement that it's my friends.

176
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:33,379
And with all of those you guys notice when you took them issues with like the food frequency questionnaires

177
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:42,770
that we have that are validated in the US are really geared toward like the average American person's diet.

178
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:47,870
Right. I know many of you were like when I eat with my family, we eat very different food.

179
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,410
You know, my parents are not from this country. We we make other things that aren't on this list.

180
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,680
Right? Like and so I have had multiple students in my class make that observation.

181
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:02,090
Absolutely true. A lot of those questionnaires are not.

182
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,270
They're older, especially the one I gave you was from like 20 years ago.

183
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:10,549
They're not including like nut milks and you know,

184
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:17,300
some of these newer they a lot of the vegan and vegetarian options beyond burgers and all this kind of stuff that people are eating a lot more now.

185
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:24,230
So I think if you were going to try to, you know, that was for a population of older people in the nineties that was 90 something percent white.

186
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:33,200
If I was going to accurately do some sort of food frequency questionnaire situation with you guys, I would probably do something different.

187
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:45,139
Right. So but the existing validated food frequency questionnaires for like the US population tend toward that type of diet.

188
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,530
Right. You're going to miss people who have.

189
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:54,680
Specific different diets. Does that make sense?

190
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,379
So, I mean, this is, again,

191
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:05,840
one of those questions like I might ask you to kind of expound on and being able to make some of those points would be good.

192
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:11,270
Does that help? Yeah. We just.

193
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:18,630
Yes, that was.

194
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:28,900
Put it like this, right?

195
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,830
So asking people, what is your height and weight?

196
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,760
And then from that calculating BMI. Super simple.

197
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:44,580
Really easy. That's why we have it for, like, every single epidemiologic study.

198
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,350
Right? Very easy to get. Then you can go a little further down.

199
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,850
So we're able to see what they actually said. Yeah.

200
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:01,130
And so. Right. So you're going to get super easy low cost, right?

201
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:06,649
Then you can ask people maybe to measure their waist or hip circumference or measure their

202
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:11,389
thighs circumference or something from which you can get some some measure of central obesity.

203
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:19,610
Right. Like waist circumference gets out, like do you have central adiposity that might be more like that, metabolically active, visceral, fat.

204
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,510
And then you can also do some of these other measurements like bio impedance scaffolds or DEXA scans, right?

205
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:37,310
That can help you get at, um, you know, there's always the argument about BMI that like bodybuilders, you're going to have a very big thing, right?

206
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:41,480
They're not fat. There's obviously that's an extreme example.

207
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:48,740
There are plenty of people kind of in the middle who might have more lean mass but therefore have a larger BMI.

208
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,880
Right, which is not really what we care about. So that lean mass is actually protective.

209
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:59,659
So. Then why do some of these other things to try to get differentiate fat from the mouth?

210
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:06,530
Right. My own penis was the one with like a little you hold it along the scale with the little bottle pads.

211
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,450
Right that runs this current through you it,

212
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:18,880
it measures the resistance um skin folds and the I told you about the traumatize me as a child and Texas guys are like this is exactly like what?

213
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:26,930
So you can see that the burden, like a participant has to go somewhere to get it back to somewhere.

214
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:36,330
Right. Like you're probably if you're going to have Texas can be a major part of your exposure measurement.

215
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:42,030
You're probably doing a smaller study where people are coming to a clinic for other things to write.

216
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:52,040
Whereas if you're giving out questionnaires on 100,000 people, you're probably doing something like asking them about their.

217
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:06,240
So this is the always that seesaw.

218
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,510
With epidemiologic studies, you can have a huge sample size,

219
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:16,740
but kind of the specificity of the quality of the exposure measurements that you get are probably going to be lower.

220
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,570
If you do a smaller sample, you can probably get really detailed exposure information.

221
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:27,410
We need both. Right. It's really, really hard to do a huge study.

222
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:33,350
I can't imagine how much it would cost and the logistical nightmare of trying to do that system.

223
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,830
If you have like a huge cohort of 200,000 people across the U.S.

224
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,190
That makes sense. Yes.

225
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,810
Yeah. Waist to hip ratio and waist size ratio.

226
00:23:53,830 --> 00:24:00,640
So a larger weight. With a large.

227
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:06,400
Yes, large. I'm like, wait a minute. Yeah. Larger waist to hip ratio indicates a more apple shape.

228
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:09,700
Right. And then perhaps a.

229
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:14,700
More visceral, fat deposition a.

230
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,299
Smaller ways to fire ratio indicates more like a pear shaped right?

231
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,950
So you can have someone with a large BMI, but then if you try to adjust for these things,

232
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,079
you there have been a lot of studies have actually found that waist circumference

233
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,600
is more strongly associated with risk of cancer and things like that, diabetes and all that compared to just.

234
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,350
Because subcutaneous fat is not metabolically the same as visceral fat.

235
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:55,460
Does that make sense? All right.

236
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:05,720
Anything else on this? Yes.

237
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,540
The slogan Burton and Burton. About.

238
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:16,240
Yeah. But again, like I said, in the obesity election, this gets at this one.

239
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,580
But what is that 30% and how about 30% of cancer is due to obesity?

240
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:28,810
How would you actually change that? Do you try to make people better or do you try to raise some of the stigma?

241
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,740
Do you try to make people who are fat have a better access to health care?

242
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,070
Do you try to get people who are fat to work out?

243
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,679
Right. I mean, so there's all of these pieces that might be associated with and then that weight

244
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,339
cycling that people who are obese generally go through in their lifetime.

245
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:52,659
Right. Maybe that's bad. So there's a lot about I feel like we take a simplistic approach to BMI.

246
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:56,920
Like, well, high BMI is bad, so we should be leaner.

247
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:05,760
But that doesn't work very well for anybody. And there's all these other very plausible potential explanations.

248
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:09,850
So like, how do you address that? 30%? That's one of the things that.

249
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,790
So it's not a 2%, it's two, right?

250
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:24,180
So it's relative risk of two means that if you were obese, your risk of whatever cancer is about two times that of someone who is normal weight.

251
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:34,800
Right. So this gets at the thing from the first one, which is that idea of the relative risk versus the population attributable less so for smoking.

252
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,420
The relative risk is very, very large. Right.

253
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:48,270
So if you smoke, your individual risk of lung cancer is quite large, but fewer people smoke, right?

254
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:58,919
So the proportion of cancer caused by smoking is about 30%, whereas for obesity, the relative risk is to 2 to 3, depending on the cancer.

255
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:07,200
Right. So your individual risk, if you're obese, is 2 to 3, but a large proportion of the population falls into that category.

256
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,100
And so the overall proportion of cancer that is caused by it is about 30%.

257
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:21,160
Does that make sense? So there's there's a couple of ways to get at a bigger population attributable risk.

258
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,919
You can have a higher relative risk for something that's less common or a lower relative risk for something that's very

259
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:31,380
common and doesn't get you to kind of the same place in terms of the proportion of other disease caused by that risk factor.

260
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:39,490
Yeah. Infection.

261
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:43,110
I mean, we can still ask questions about anything before, but let's open up infection.

262
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:09,670
All right. We all feel good about infection. Okay. Screening.

263
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:16,840
Yeah. Oh. Go through the difference between.

264
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:21,590
Total. Yes.

265
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:31,450
I'm going to get my pretty pictures. The. Okay.

266
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:42,670
So the total pre-clinical phase is this like from the moment that you have cancer biologically until the moment you have symptoms,

267
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:48,010
is the total preclinical phase. Do we ever know when this is?

268
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,540
I mean, it exists, I guess right at the moment you don't have cancer and then at the next moment you do.

269
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:59,379
But we never know when that happens. It's sort of a it's a construct, right?

270
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:05,800
It's an idea rather than something we can ever actually know. I mean, maybe someday in like three years, what you're going to have.

271
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,969
But for right now, the preclinical, the total preclinical phases from this like magical moment,

272
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:17,320
like suddenly you have cancer to the point where you start having symptoms that are pretty much the same.

273
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:22,509
Now, there's some point in here where you don't have symptoms yet,

274
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:29,350
but you could detect it by screening right from that point to symptoms of being detectable and things.

275
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:36,150
Does that make sense? Yes. Detective.

276
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:44,380
You can't. Great, because you have to have enough. Like, give me an example of this really test.

277
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:58,330
He isn't sure. So the cancer has to be big enough to be causing some disruption of the prostate tissue for it to be leaking into circulation.

278
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:06,100
Now, that's pretty small, but if you can't feel it with your finger on a digital rectal exam when it's about little,

279
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:15,070
but there's some point at which it's just like two cells, which is after the biological separate, you've got two cells of cancer there.

280
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:22,600
You technically have cancer, you're biological. That does happen, but it's not large enough that your screening test is going to be okay.

281
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,250
Does that make sense? Same thing with the mammogram.

282
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:32,469
By grade, I mean, you can find a spot of cancer in a breast that is bigger than two cells with a mammogram.

283
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,879
Right. But probably there's a point in which it's small enough and it's really not even a mass yet.

284
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,890
It's just this. Very beginnings.

285
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,690
We're biologically I suppose technically you have cancer, but you can't find it yet.

286
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:50,130
Does that make sense? Yeah. Yes.

287
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:55,600
Yes. The critical point is.

288
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,120
Where are you? Okay.

289
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:07,480
So the critical point is the point in the natural history of the disease before which treatment may be less difficult or more effective.

290
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:12,939
Right. So if you imagine that there's some point you're going long, your biological onset, blah, blah, blah,

291
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:17,440
at some point you're going to pass beyond the critical point where if you even if you do treatment at that point,

292
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:21,460
it's not going to impact your outcome. Right. That's the critical point.

293
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:30,400
Now. Diseases that are amenable to screening where screening will actually help.

294
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:40,600
The critical point is somewhere between this beginning of the detectable preclinical phase and symptoms,

295
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,500
because if the critical point is after symptoms, there's no point in screenings.

296
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,890
We're already catching it in time without screening.

297
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:53,709
Right. People are exhibiting symptoms then like, oh, they have something wrong, let's treat it and that's fine.

298
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:59,320
We don't need to find it earlier, right? If it's here, you know,

299
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,280
if the critical point is back here where you've got four cells of cancer and you can't

300
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,600
find it with your screening test yet even once you find it with the screening test,

301
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:11,050
you're still beyond that critical point. And it won't help. Right.

302
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,840
But you want the critical point to be in here.

303
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:21,880
And that's sort of what we're assuming is happening when we try for a screening test, is that there's some critical point.

304
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:26,590
It's before symptoms, which is basically always true with cancer.

305
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:32,799
Right. But what almost, almost always, once somebody has symptoms of cancer,

306
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,720
it's pretty advanced and treatment is not going to be as effective as it would have been earlier.

307
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:45,610
Right. The question is whether whatever screening test you're trying to use will actually catch it before the critical point.

308
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:07,070
That makes sense. Does a help. There's a couple of a couple of cancers where we're this might be true, right?

309
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:15,170
Where the critical point is somewhere after some testicular, sometimes some kinds of testicular cancer that the chemo works so well for.

310
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:22,220
I mean, even people who have had like Lance Armstrong, who had the metastatic cancer to the brain, they gave him chemo and he was fine.

311
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:28,900
Right. So there's a couple of examples. Thyroid cancer, some of the thyroid cancers are another one, right?

312
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:32,690
Where like once even after your diagnosis, treatment can be very, very effective.

313
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:41,240
Right. But for most of the especially the most common cancers, once you've got symptoms, it's it's bad.

314
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:49,270
Right and treatment is much less effective. Okay.

315
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:57,620
More about screening? Yes. Can you go over me again?

316
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:03,000
Yes. Family pictures.

317
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:19,420
Figure. All right.

318
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:26,390
Lead time bias happens. None of these biases will occur if you use what as your measure of effectiveness.

319
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:35,600
Differences in what? What kind of mortality?

320
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:45,480
Cause specific. Yeah. So if you're trying to screen for prostate cancer, you want to look at prostate cancer mortality.

321
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:51,150
If you're trying to screen for the liver cancer, you want to look at liver cancer, mortality rates of cause, specific mortality.

322
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:58,980
None of these biases will happen if you use that measure in comparing people who got the screening test and those who did not.

323
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:07,350
Okay. You will get lead time bias if you try to say the survival time is longer in the people who got the screening

324
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:14,010
than in the people who didn't and try to use that as a as a measure of effectiveness of your screening program.

325
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,180
If you try to say, hey, look, we screened these people, we randomized them, right?

326
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:23,010
And these people got our screening test and these people didn't. And these people lived longer after they were diagnosed.

327
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:32,010
That is a huge red flag and lead time bias because even if you have an ineffective screening program that did nothing.

328
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:36,480
Imagine this is the same person into like multiverse timelines.

329
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,750
We could imagine exactly what happened to each of them.

330
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:44,730
We could see, you know, we could do it one way and then rewind and do it a different way and see the counterfactual.

331
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,590
Right. If they didn't get screened, they would die of the disease here.

332
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,520
If they did get screened, they died of the disease at the exact same time.

333
00:35:53,520 --> 00:36:00,030
So screening did nothing. However, you will always diagnose someone earlier with these screening test.

334
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:12,450
So if you count up the time that they survived, this guy who got screened survived longer, but only because you added time at the front.

335
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:22,590
An effective screening program will also diagnose somebody earlier.

336
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:31,000
So even in an effective screening program, counting up the survival time is a little bit misleading because it will always include some lead time.

337
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:42,360
Right. So what you want?

338
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:50,480
Is for your survival. Time to be longer. Not only because you have the time, but also because you had some gained time.

339
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:58,220
But you can't know that, right? We're showing you this picture, comparing someone who didn't get screened to that same person who did get screened.

340
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:02,000
You can't ever do that. Right. You have different people. Some of them got screened.

341
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:05,540
Some of them didn't. All you know is the total survival time.

342
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:09,380
You cannot pass that into lead time, gain of time.

343
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,490
Do you see what I'm saying? That's that's a construct.

344
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,280
Again, you can never know how much of the survival time is lead time,

345
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:25,759
because you never know for an individual when would they have been diagnosed if they did not get sick, if they did not get screened?

346
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,040
We don't know that. Right. We assume it is later.

347
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:41,170
So the answer is you always use what is your mother in effectiveness?

348
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,550
There you go. Someone you've.

349
00:37:54,830 --> 00:38:03,070
Ideally you will have this right. You will always, no matter whether your screening program is effective or not, your survival depends on the people.

350
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,820
And that's great. Right. You.

351
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,510
You should see longer survival time in people who got screened,

352
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:15,340
even if your screening test is doing nothing because you'll always be diagnosing them earlier.

353
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,690
You just have no idea if their outcome is being improved with that measure.

354
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:25,849
If you say, hey, my screening test that I might survive two times longer in my screening group,

355
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:30,800
people are going to be like, Yeah, because you should be because you're diagnosing early.

356
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,210
You may have only days of worry about having cancer for three years long.

357
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:40,220
You may have given them nothing, right? You'll never know. All you know is this number.

358
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:48,740
You can never pass it out until that's in your life. This is an illustration of how things can go right or wrong.

359
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:55,580
To help you understand why surviving time is the wrong measure for this.

360
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:00,470
But you will never. This is like you can't ever pass that out in your life.

361
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:05,630
You will only know the total survival time. And if it's longer in your screened group, that means nothing.

362
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:11,570
Does that make sense? It means you scream. Congratulations.

363
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:17,700
You have screened people just like you said you did. Yes.

364
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:28,450
Yes. Cause specific mortality. Your denominator for cause specific mortality is the total population.

365
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:37,000
So if you screened 100 people and three of them died of your cancer of interest, your cause specific mortality is 3%.

366
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:50,960
Okay. If. So you screened 100 people total and three died of your cancer.

367
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,170
So specific mortality is 3%, three divided by 100.

368
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,630
Right. But how many people got cancer in this group?

369
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:11,410
Say ten got sick. So our case fatality proportion.

370
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,680
Is three over ten 30%.

371
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:26,260
30% of people with cancer died. The case fatality proportion is the proportion of people with the disease who died of the disease.

372
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:31,180
So your denominator here is people with cancer, not the total number of people that you screened.

373
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:35,430
Or didn't scream. Does that make sense?

374
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:45,700
And we can see that if we go to my slide about overdiagnosis bias.

375
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:58,390
Which is here. Remember here we have on top, we have our screening group and our bottom we have our control group.

376
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:02,440
So imagine in both cases we have three people who have the cancer.

377
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:15,160
And among our five total population in our control group, one of those people develop symptoms, has their diagnosis confirmed and dies.

378
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,809
So here, tell me what the case fatality proportion is.

379
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:35,560
How many people got the cancer? Only one was diagnosed, though, remember, because they're not getting screened.

380
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,590
So only one person developed symptoms and was diagnosed.

381
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,450
So how many people were diagnosed with the cancer here?

382
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:52,530
Only one, right? And then how many people died? Not one person.

383
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,450
So the case fatality proportion is 100% right.

384
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:04,480
All of the people who got the cancer died. But your cause specific mortality rate is one out of five.

385
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,590
Yeah. Up here, though, when you screen now, we found these three people.

386
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:21,250
So now we have three people diagnosed with cancer, but the same one dies because your screening test didn't really do anything.

387
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,140
So now what is your case? Fatality proportion. Three people got the cancer and one died.

388
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:33,450
So it is. One third.

389
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:39,930
But you're. You still have a total of five people in your group, and one of them died.

390
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:45,000
So your cause specific mortality rate is one of five. Yeah.

391
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:48,390
Does that help?

392
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:57,870
That is why you use the specific mortality rate as your measure of association when you're determining whether your screening test works,

393
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:03,840
not case fatality proportion. The denominator of reconstituting mortality in our population who died?

394
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:08,490
Not like the entire population. Who was anybody in the study?

395
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,770
Or in the population. Right. So like in the U.S.,

396
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:19,770
you can calculate the lung cancer specific mortality rate as the number of people who died of lung cancer over the whole population of the U.S.

397
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:25,180
In this case, you're comparing a group of people who got screened in a group of people who didn't get screened in the first study.

398
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:31,250
So it's however many people you randomized to your screening group is your denominator versus however many people you randomized to.

399
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:33,240
Your non screened group is your denominator.

400
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:38,580
And you're looking at whether the number of people who died of the cancer is different in those two groups.

401
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,850
After. Does that make sense?

402
00:43:53,880 --> 00:44:02,550
Okay. And what about screening?

403
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:14,600
Any more about the cancer treatment stuff? A lot of that lecture was for you to hear about some cool stuff that's going on.

404
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:20,410
I know a lot of you want to go med school. A lot of you were interested in kind of physician, researcher, clinician, researcher kind of stuff.

405
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:27,700
So I wanted you to kind of hear from Dr. Chen about what he does and some of his core take home points that I think are.

406
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:37,990
Um, testable from that lecture. Ah, understand the challenges of the bench to bedside pipeline.

407
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:44,680
A lot of you guys, I always, I think that this is an important point to make and I think his research makes it in that.

408
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:50,390
You guys always like I always see this in the in the news articles.

409
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:53,569
You guys get very excited, like, oh, there's this new treatment that is,

410
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:57,620
you know, showing promise in animals and and people are going to start doing it.

411
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,900
People are going to start doing a trial of it.

412
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:08,690
And you literally never hear anything about it ever again, because we're so good at curing cancer in mice and like so bad at it and people.

413
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:18,320
So this idea that very few, about 5% of the drugs that are developed make it to FDA approval and into patient care,

414
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,620
and that that is lower for cancer than it is for other conditions.

415
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:29,960
Right. And then this other idea is this concept of tumor heterogeneity and how it relates to cancer outcomes.

416
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:43,180
Yes. Um, can you go over there to 172?

417
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:53,410
No, no, that's just really cool surgery. But it was more like if you look at the genetic changes that occur inside the tumor.

418
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:58,270
One of the challenges with her net cancer is that the genetic changes are different across.

419
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:04,390
If you look across people's tumors, the genetic changes in all of their tumors are very different from one another.

420
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:10,420
Also within a tumor having lots of different genetic changes.

421
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:17,500
Even if you target one, it's almost like. To me, I think of it almost like the antibiotic resistance problem.

422
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:25,870
Like if you kill off a tumor with some drug that attacks a particular mutation, it will kill the cells with that mutation.

423
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:28,130
But then the cells with the other mutations are still there.

424
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:37,180
Remember his pictures where he he from a from a paper where they they treated cancer and then the recurrence had much less heterogeneity.

425
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:42,009
So the tumors with a lot of heterogeneity, even if you hit them with one treatment,

426
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:47,590
they're very likely to come back because you can't really hit all of those genetic differences.

427
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:54,100
Right. So greater tumor heterogeneity makes it more difficult to treat cancers.

428
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:18,100
I think that's why it's been a real challenge to find treatments that work like systemic or drug treatments that work

429
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:22,450
really well because they'll work for some of them and not others because there's all of these different mutations.

430
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:28,669
Right. And they'll work to kill off most of the tumor.

431
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:32,570
But then the ones that are left are resistant to that drug and they grow back.

432
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:47,700
Yes. Are you going to ask us about specific challenges that the FDA gives or just

433
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:51,580
understanding that a lot of times just understand that a lot don't make it?

434
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,240
I don't understand all the different challenges that the FDA gives you.

435
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:06,330
I have actively avoided having to fill out any paperwork for the FDA in my career.

436
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:12,540
I have seen it happen. I've been like, No, I'm good, thank you.

437
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:18,210
I'm okay. I'm going to go over here and work on observational studies where I don't have to do that.

438
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:24,960
Even I tried to put together a trial just to do vitamin D in cancer patients.

439
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:29,909
And the paperwork was ridiculous. I mean, not ridiculous.

440
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:36,180
I don't mean to say that it's unimportant. Right. I totally understand why you have to jump through all of these hoops,

441
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,270
because if you're going to be administering something to a group of sick people like,

442
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:45,479
you have to prove that you have all of your ducks in a row and that you're really, you know, following all of these rules to keep people safe.

443
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:53,250
And I agree that that is super important. It's just that when you actually sit down to fill out the papers, it's like, oh my God, so much.

444
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:59,570
Even for something as benign as vitamin D. Yes.

445
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:23,230
Whatever that. It's think about it.

446
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:29,890
Like antibiotic resistance and resistance.

447
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:35,490
Correct. But then it's a similar. What's left is hard.

448
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:42,500
You know, we don't have a drug for it. But then it it's not something you buy less than 30 different things.

449
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,610
So. There's two pieces.

450
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:56,600
So remember his little pictures where you have a tumor that's like a little dot, and then he got all the different colors of cells.

451
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:01,100
And so say you have, and then you'll give a treatment and it'll go away.

452
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:09,049
And then when it comes back, it's like, all right, because you killed off the orange and the reds.

453
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:10,580
But then when it grew back, it was all blue.

454
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:17,000
So indicating that there is this issue of like the treatment is only affecting a subset of the cells in the tumor.

455
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,050
And so it's not really killing the tumor. And now when it grows back, we don't have a drug to address, but.

456
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:29,300
It is. But I guess we're talking about heterogeneity on the original two.

457
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:34,370
Yes. The other issue is that that across people,

458
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:39,499
you might have this person and this person and this person and this person and they all have this person has red,

459
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:44,659
orange and blue or this person has green purple and this person has yellow and pink.

460
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:47,690
And you know what I mean? So they all have different mutations.

461
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:57,970
And so developing a single drug that can treat head and neck cancer is almost impossible, because if you develop a drug that that kills red,

462
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:04,550
blue or red, whatever, red and orange, you've been able to help this person until the blue grows back.

463
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:10,460
But you can't help any of these people because they've all got other colors, other mutations.

464
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:18,260
Does that make sense? So heterogeneity across patients makes it very difficult to develop drugs that target cancer as a whole.

465
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:27,709
And heterogeneity within a person means that even if you are able to address target drugs to some of their mutations, it's likely to come back.

466
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:34,790
And then you've got a tumor that doesn't have any susceptible to your therapy.

467
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:44,200
Yeah. Does that make sense? So it's just it's a it's a problem in a couple of different ways.

468
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:48,840
But I see what you're saying when it comes back. It's not heterogeneous anymore.

469
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,240
But the the original heterogeneity made it possible for it to come back.

470
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:59,850
Yes. Yeah.

471
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:08,639
Why? It exists in other cancers.

472
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:14,250
But for whatever reason, head and neck cancer is very heterogeneous compared to 100 genes than other cancers.

473
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:20,940
I don't know that we know why specifically. I mean.

474
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:29,250
When Dr. Chen was talking, a lot of what he was talking about was oral cavity cancer specifically.

475
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:33,290
Right. But there's a lot of different subtypes within the oral cavity itself.

476
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:36,769
It can be tongue, it can be group of mouth. It can be passive mouth.

477
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:42,040
It can be. So I think part of it is.

478
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:48,760
I would guess if you're looking to just put it back as a whole.

479
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:54,849
I don't know. Because already heterogeneous, right? Because it includes your list, your everything all the way down into the throat.

480
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:56,830
And obviously those are very different tissues.

481
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:02,710
There's a couple of different causes of having that kind of this kind of a smoking drinking related ones of HPV related ones.

482
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,250
And so there's definitely heterogeneity all the way through.

483
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:12,549
The reason we lump them together in like the registry and stuff and historically for studies,

484
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:20,980
I think, I think I'm guessing is because been treated by the same surgeon and they're rare.

485
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:28,510
So when a surgeon would write or a doctor would write a paper about their cancer patients, they would put them all together.

486
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:33,580
And it's only more recently that we recognize they're actually very different diseases, all of these different anatomic sites.

487
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:40,810
And but there's still so few of them that a lot of times when people write a paper, they'll put them together.

488
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:45,580
Right. Because you need a lot of cases to look at something. But if you're mixing apples and oranges, that's not helpful.

489
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:52,810
So it's a it's a problem, right? I think it's a problem that arose because of how they were treated and that they all got kind of lumped together.

490
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:59,400
But even within and from a site, because his was oral cavity, even within that site, he's seeing a lot of heterogeneity.

491
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:04,820
So I don't know why it's different. For that statement and others.

492
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:11,370
But it is. But there is heterogeneity in other sites.

493
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:15,880
I don't want you to think that there isn't in other sites. It's just that there's more, in fact, than other sites.

494
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:22,880
But this heterogeneity problem. While it is an extra problem for head and neck cancer, it is a problem for all cancers.

495
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:41,339
Yeah. Yeah.

496
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:45,749
So the idea is, remember, if you use a player with a whole lot of markers,

497
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:49,800
you're more likely to get a variant of unknown significance, particularly for a patient who is nonwhite.

498
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:59,810
You also are including genes for which there may not be very well defined clinical guidelines for what to do if they are positive.

499
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:06,920
Like if you get it, you have a family history of breast cancer and you get BRCA1 or two screening only and you're positive.

500
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:10,750
It is very clear what your next steps are recommended to be.

501
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:16,010
Right. You can do prophylactic mastectomy and incorrectly you can take tamoxifen during your life.

502
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:20,810
There are things that have been studied that are preventive to reduce your risk of getting breasts.

503
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:30,110
But if you take do a 60 gene panel and there's a gene on there that is newer and the risk is more moderate,

504
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:34,770
and no one's really studied what to do about it if you're positive. What do you tell a patient?

505
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:38,239
You're like, okay, well, you're positive for this now.

506
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:45,830
We don't know what to do about it. Right. So it's you get more information with more genes, but you get.

507
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:51,859
More nuance and uncertainty to write.

508
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:58,130
More likely you get a boost, more likely to get a positive result for something. There's not very clear clinical guidelines on what to do about it.

509
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:02,390
So that's the conversation that happens between a patient and the genetic counselor.

510
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:07,930
Like, what are your goals like? Which one is best for you?

511
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:14,080
What is your tolerance of, you know? Unclear answers.

512
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:22,500
Let me sense. So it's not a this one's better. That one's worse. It's a pros and cons kind of discussion.

513
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:32,110
Variants of unknown. And we're not.

514
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:40,770
Yes, we're probably people we're not white because the genetic architecture of a lot of this work has been done in white populations.

515
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:49,780
Right. So the range of differences that can be seen in a gene is more well characterized in a white population than in nonwhite populations.

516
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:54,870
I think if I remember her slides correctly, it was the Asian population that actually has the highest rates of us now.

517
00:56:55,650 --> 00:57:05,360
But black, Hispanic, other races also do. So your conversation might be a bit different if your patient were genetic counselor.

518
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:12,700
Education patient. Yes.

519
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,980
Yeah. It is better.

520
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,519
And white people. Right. Because you're less likely to get a use.

521
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:30,709
You're more likely to get a definitive answer. That's not to say that you won't get into the US if you're white.

522
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:39,030
You can, certainly. But very well characterized in some of their very well characterized like Ashkenazi Jewish populations,

523
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:43,170
because that was one of the first places that they identified with the BRCA1 or two genes.

524
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:48,150
So those changes are like really well, well characterized.

525
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:52,950
I would say White is next. They've gotten better with black.

526
00:57:52,950 --> 00:58:00,510
Asian is still lagging. But, you know, it's just just recognize that because a lot of the initial work was done on white people,

527
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:05,670
the answers for white people are more definitive. You're more likely to get to the US if you're not white.

528
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:25,710
What you guys are thinking up. Additional questions if you have any format and length are very similar.

529
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:34,020
The first test. You have the same kind of like a little bit you fast a little bit of short answer a little bit of

530
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:40,770
MultiChoice and then a few of those longer half page kind of think it through with me sort of questions.

531
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:53,260
Yes. So my question is actually about this. Oh, yes, please.

532
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:58,510
So is this one thing and then it doesn't have to be single spaced.

533
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:03,700
Okay. This is not meant to be burdensome or like really long.

534
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:08,170
I want you to kind of think about how your cancer was different than the others.

535
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,100
Like, just show me you paid attention to the other people's presentations, right?

536
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:16,650
So that's like just comparing contracts. Yeah.

537
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:23,700
I mean, you could I mean, I seen people do like a very specific comparison, like, oh, I thought ours was really I've noticed a big difference.

538
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:27,239
But this one, ah, ours was really different than all the others in this way.

539
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:34,930
Or like something like that. Yeah. It's not meant to be.

540
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:43,800
It's like a half hour kind of assignment. Not like a burdensome long thing.

541
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:50,610
Yeah. Yeah.

542
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:00,240
I don't think there are any others. Am I missing one?

543
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:05,569
Is there something I don't know that tells me? No.

544
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:15,469
I think really the only like established pathogens that cause cancer for which there are vaccines are HPV and hepatitis B virus,

545
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:20,510
but not C, as we learned from the liver cancer. Am I being stupid or missing something?

546
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:24,470
Because it's early on a Thursday? I think that's it, right?

547
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:31,760
HPV, which will prevent cervical and other HPV related cancers and HPV.

548
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:37,460
Hepatitis B virus, which is the one of the two viruses that causes hepatitis.

549
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:41,690
Yes, but also, therefore, liver cancer.

550
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:51,520
Yeah. Okay.

551
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:58,900
If that's it, then you guys are free to go. I probably won't get a chance to address you like this again for a while.

552
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:02,470
Me being quiet in the test. But I really enjoyed having you on on class.

553
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:08,549
And I hope you will all fill out the. Of course.

554
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:18,000
Evaluation, that's all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You know.
