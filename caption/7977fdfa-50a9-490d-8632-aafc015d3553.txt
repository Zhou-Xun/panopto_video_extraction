1
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,300
All right. Welcome back. The same as pretty much everything else.

2
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:23,600
Human resources management is evolving, and it should be because of the speed and degree of change in the economy,

3
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,500
in industries, and specifically in the health field.

4
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:35,060
In this second segment of the module, we'll discuss the new role of human resources management.

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,040
To begin. Let's talk about the video clip you just watched.

6
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:48,050
The clip shows the stereotype or the general public's perception of human resources management.

7
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,840
As a matter of fact, human resource management has gotten a bad rap.

8
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,730
Well, you tell your coworker I'm going to your char, your reaction may be, oh, I'm so sorry.

9
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:10,920
What happened? Because there's a general perception that human resources is a place you go only when something goes wrong or when you are in trouble,

10
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,460
or when you are on the elimination list to be fired.

11
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:23,540
Human resources also has the reputation that they make, the rules, and that they do everything by the rules.

12
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:33,320
It is also thought of as a black hole. Things only going and never come out and there is a perception that they are slow in response.

13
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:40,670
When you do need h.r. Or human resources and coming to them with questions, suggestions and complaints,

14
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,980
they rarely respond because your hands are tied and there is not much they could do.

15
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:56,330
So as a result of all this reasons, human resources is perceived to be a department to work around or to avoid at all cost.

16
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:09,020
In fact, there are actually some truth to those perceptions because human resources management in many organizations are still stuck in the past.

17
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,620
When the focus was solely on selecting and controlling and letting go people,

18
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,720
and when human resource management was actually called personnel management.

19
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:26,350
In many organizations, including health organizations, the change from personnel to human resources.

20
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:33,850
It's only there. Substantively, the nature and the scope of activity have remained the same.

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:44,090
However, this old personal model is no longer sufficient today to fully support an organization making it not only a good,

22
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,070
but really a great organization.

23
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:56,180
A transformation is much needed, and human resources management has the responsibility of contributing to creating an organizational culture,

24
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:02,540
an environment where people have an opportunity to be heard and for the tools to be heard.

25
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:10,580
Which means human resources is not just a management function or tool to get personnel in line.

26
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:17,870
It needs to be, as we discussed the piece being a puzzle that brings everything together.

27
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:25,270
The diagram on this slide shows four quadrants that are organized according to two dimensions.

28
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:33,280
The first dimension is operational costs, operational focus versus future and strategic focus.

29
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:37,330
And the second dimension is process versus people.

30
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:46,090
Traditionally, human resources is in the lower left hand column called Administrative Expert.

31
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:57,580
As a measured expert, everything human resources does is operational administrative activities and is focused on the processes rather than people.

32
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,490
This traditional rule was useful because they served two primary purposes.

33
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:09,340
First, it freed managers from personally having to fire workers.

34
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:17,710
And second, it was able to establish consistency in hiring, firing and compensation practices.

35
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:28,710
In this traditional role, human resources serve primarily the executive agenda, but was viewed as a roadblock by the rest of organizations.

36
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,969
Therefore, the bad reputation that we discussed to help organization,

37
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:38,520
to adjust in a dynamic world and make the transformation from good to great human

38
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,670
resources needs to move towards the other three quadrants by becoming a strategic partner,

39
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:51,450
by being an employee advocate, and by serving as a change agent, as a strategic partner.

40
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:59,069
Human resources need forward thinking and contribute to the development and accomplishment of organization,

41
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,060
wide strategic plans and objectives to fulfill the role.

42
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:10,380
Human resources need to modify its mindset from being a top management servant to being a partner.

43
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:21,510
What it means is that human resources needs to adjust its practices to help organizations become more adaptive and resilient.

44
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:29,480
Second, Human resources management in today's organizations needs to be an employee advocate.

45
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:37,790
It means that they need to have a customer oriented mindset and treat employees as their primary customers.

46
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:44,460
In this advocate role. Human resources and management is not just an administrative function.

47
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,900
It should represent employees concerns to the top management.

48
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:56,340
Also, their responsibility should be to create a work environment and a culture that empowers

49
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:02,760
employees to have a sense of ownership of the organization and are motivated to contribute.

50
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:10,100
Finally, human resources management today needs to become a change champion.

51
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:16,590
By offering and promoting continuous learning throughout an organization,

52
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:26,280
by promoting employees identification as well as their commitment to organization's mission values, strategic goals and action plans.

53
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:36,570
Human resources should also involve in using appropriate metrics to assess organization's effectiveness in meeting its mission and goals.

54
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:45,030
At the same time, human resources so evaluates functions in relation to the strategic needs of the organization.

55
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:56,730
So to summarize, successful organizations are becoming more adaptive, resilient, quick to change attraction and customer oriented.

56
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:02,670
In this environment, much of the human resources role should be transforming.
