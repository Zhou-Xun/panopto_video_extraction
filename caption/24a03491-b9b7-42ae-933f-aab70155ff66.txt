00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,440
Hello, welcome to this lecture on

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,240
sampling concepts in which we

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,375
discuss the standard
error of the mean.

4
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:18,030
This module has three
learning objectives.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,350
The first is to understand how to

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,815
compute the standard error
of the mean from data,

7
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:24,240
the second is to understand
the difference between

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,405
the sample variance and
sampling variability,

9
00:00:27,405 --> 00:00:29,340
and the third is to
realize that the sample

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,335
mean and the standard
error of the mean

11
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:35,685
can approximate the distribution
of all sample means.

12
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:40,130
Now the skepticism or the
uncertainty that you have with

13
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,395
your data is quantified by

14
00:00:42,395 --> 00:00:45,080
the population variance
and the sample size,

15
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,170
the two components of
sampling variability.

16
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,690
The amount of skepticism
is measured by

17
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,425
the ratio of the population
variance to the sample size.

18
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:56,795
Now the sample size
is a known value.

19
00:00:56,795 --> 00:00:58,640
It is the number of observations

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,785
that you have in your data.

21
00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:03,230
Unfortunately, the
population variance

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,210
is a quantity that is not known,

23
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,315
It is a parameter for the
population that could be

24
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:09,860
estimated from the sample but

25
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,680
its exact value is not known.

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,340
However, the population
variance can be estimated quite

27
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,790
well by the sample
variance, and therefore,

28
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,100
the amount of skepticism
measured by the ratio

29
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,755
of the population variance
and the sample size,

30
00:01:24,755 --> 00:01:26,465
can be represented by

31
00:01:26,465 --> 00:01:29,300
the ratio of the sample
variance represented

32
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,950
by the equation in
the numerator to

33
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,010
the sample size n
in the denominator.

34
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,305
The ratio of these two values is

35
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:39,155
the amount of skepticism
you have with your results.

36
00:01:39,155 --> 00:01:41,075
However, this number is based

37
00:01:41,075 --> 00:01:43,235
on squared units of the data.

38
00:01:43,235 --> 00:01:46,190
We would rather have an
interpretation that is on

39
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,170
the original uses in the data and

40
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,915
therefore we take the square
root of the entire quantity,

41
00:01:50,915 --> 00:01:52,640
and it is this value that is

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,460
known as the standard
error of the mean.

43
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,760
This quantity tells you
how much variability there

44
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,470
is from sample to sample with

45
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,810
regard to their sample means.

46
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,740
Now recall that the sample
variance is an average of

47
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,350
the squared deviations
of each observation from

48
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,799
the sample mean sampling
variability however,

49
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,450
is represented by the ratio

50
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,010
of that number to
the sample size,

51
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,380
and then the square
root of that ratio.

52
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,720
So that although
these two terms look

53
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,050
similar in terms of
what words we use,

54
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,865
they are distinctly
different quantities.

55
00:02:25,865 --> 00:02:27,950
The sampling variability is based

56
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,140
upon the sample
variance but it is

57
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,850
the sample variance divided by

58
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,890
the sample size and then take

59
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,530
the square root of
the entire quantity.

60
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,525
Now this last result

61
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,395
underlies the elegance
of statistics.

62
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,610
We can use our single sample of

63
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,740
data represented by
this sample that

64
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:50,215
produced a sample mean of
30.1 and as I said earlier,

65
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:52,565
we want to know
how it varies from

66
00:02:52,565 --> 00:02:54,800
all the other possible
sample means that

67
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,050
could be derived
from the population.

68
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,790
However, we do not need

69
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,045
these other samples to answer
that question any longer.

70
00:03:02,045 --> 00:03:03,830
My single sample mean of

71
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,800
30.1 combined with
the standard error

72
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,820
of the mean that would be

73
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,540
computed from my data
can be used together to

74
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,180
approximate the histogram
that would have

75
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,150
been produced from
many samples of data.

76
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,880
We now have nearly every
tool that we need to

77
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,045
start making decisions
with the data we collect.

78
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:25,370
For example is a
new treatment more

79
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,560
effective than
existing treatments,

80
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,705
or does a new public policy

81
00:03:29,705 --> 00:03:32,285
have the desired impact
in the population,

82
00:03:32,285 --> 00:03:34,430
or can we determine
risk factors that are

83
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,965
associated with a
specific risky behavior?

84
00:03:36,965 --> 00:03:38,420
To answer this question

85
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,610
the one remaining tool
we have to discuss is

86
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,010
probability and the
role it plays in

87
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,625
summarizing a population
distribution.
