1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,740
This video is on an introduction to health-related quality of life.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,136
So when we're measuring cost effectiveness, effectiveness is

3
00:00:10,136 --> 00:00:15,440
generally measured in terms of this health-related quality of life.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,527
These health utilities is a measure of quality of life, and

5
00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:24,202
we use that to translate into these quality-adjusted life years.

6
00:00:24,202 --> 00:00:28,181
There's a couple different methods for valuing health utilities which we'll talk

7
00:00:28,181 --> 00:00:32,240
about in the next video here in direct and indirect methods.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,043
Just a few definitions here, there're health status measures, which summarize

9
00:00:37,043 --> 00:00:41,775
whether you have some sort of disability or impairment or specific symptoms, and

10
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:45,493
the severity and frequency of those symptoms or disabilities.

11
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:49,633
But what we're focused on really in cost effectiveness analysis in the end is this

12
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,995
preference-based measure of health-related quality of life.

13
00:00:52,995 --> 00:00:56,081
So it's a summary value incorporating all the positive and

14
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:59,301
negative aspects of some sort of health into a single number.

15
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:03,695
So sometimes you can take those health status measures and

16
00:01:03,695 --> 00:01:08,456
turn them into this health-related quality of life measure.

17
00:01:08,456 --> 00:01:11,796
So in cost effectiveness analysis, we have these health state utilities.

18
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:16,251
It's an economic concept of how we value health states.

19
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:20,226
We're measuring this on a scale of 0-1, 0 is equivalent to health,

20
00:01:20,226 --> 00:01:23,040
1 is equivalent to perfect health.

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,343
And the key thing here is, relative to each other,

22
00:01:27,343 --> 00:01:33,340
how do these qualities of life or utilities rank?

23
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,240
A quality-adjusted life year is equivalent to a one year in perfect health.

24
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,894
And the way we calculate it is multiplying a period of time in a health

25
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:47,483
state by this health utility for the corresponding health state.

26
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:50,711
So here we can show the quality of life.

27
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:55,339
For example, 0 is death, 1 is perfect health and some example,

28
00:01:55,339 --> 00:01:59,886
quality- adjustments might be .92 for moderate chest pain,

29
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:03,441
going all the way down to things like severe chronic

30
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:08,840
schizophrenia here with the quality of life of .29.

31
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,983
So let's walk through how we translate that utility or

32
00:02:11,983 --> 00:02:15,080
quality of life into a quality-adjusted life year.

33
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,048
So this is an example of cancer, and maybe here's the life course of

34
00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:26,040
someone over several months as they are facing end stage cancer.

35
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,208
And so here, we might have the utility on the vertical axis and

36
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,974
we start off at a utility 0f 0.8 for the first month,

37
00:02:33,974 --> 00:02:39,985
then things get much worse and the utility is 0.3 for a month, then better to 0.7 for

38
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:45,034
a month, then 0.6 for a month, then 0.5 for a month, then 2.5 for

39
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:49,812
a month and 0.1 in the last month, and then death occurs at the end.

40
00:02:49,812 --> 00:02:56,564
So we just add up the utilities here, so in this example, 0.8 plus 0.3 is 1.1,

41
00:02:56,564 --> 00:03:01,586
add another 0.7, 1.8, add another 0.6, get 2.4,

42
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:06,152
add another 0.5, get 2.9, add another 2.5, and

43
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:11,209
we get 3.15, and then add another 0.1, we get 3.25.

44
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:16,425
So the overall total area under here is 3.25.

45
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:21,613
Now in this case, these are months, so 3.25 quality-adjusted life,

46
00:03:21,613 --> 00:03:26,965
these would be quality-adjusted life months, 3.25 quality-adjusted

47
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:32,253
life months would be equivalent to 0.27 quality-adjusted life years.

48
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:35,749
So this is an example where we added things up in months, and so

49
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:39,602
we need to just divide by 12 to get quality-adjusted life years.

50
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:43,859
The area under this curve here is really the quality-adjusted life years.

51
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:47,837
And again it's a multiplication basically of the quality of life,

52
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:53,027
the vertical dimension and length of life, the time here in the horizontal dimension.

53
00:03:53,027 --> 00:03:56,266
And what we're concerned about is how it is quality of life,

54
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:59,568
the overall quality of life and qualities change over time and

55
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:04,019
compare between different interventions because remember, cost effectiveness

56
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,238
analysis is comparative, so how is this better or worse than something else?

57
00:04:08,238 --> 00:04:11,682
So here's an example of that, yellow area is the status quo,

58
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:14,862
maybe someone has an acute phase and then they recover and

59
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:19,056
get better than they decline in health and they have some sort of end stage.

60
00:04:19,056 --> 00:04:21,565
And so we have quality of life in the vertical axis, time, and so

61
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:23,477
this person is going through those four stages.

62
00:04:23,477 --> 00:04:24,621
This is the status quo.

63
00:04:24,621 --> 00:04:28,543
Let's imagine a new intervention where there's an acute phase and

64
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:31,638
maybe this person is getting some sort of procedure,

65
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:36,521
some sort of intervention during the acute phase, but now their recovery is a little

66
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:40,166
bit higher and lasts longer, their declined last longer, and

67
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:44,831
the end stage lasts longer, so here we can superimpose the two over each other.

68
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:48,717
And we can see that with the intervention, the light blue,

69
00:04:48,717 --> 00:04:53,614
is a little bit longer length of life, a little bit better quality of life,

70
00:04:53,614 --> 00:04:58,593
except for the initial acute phase because maybe this person is getting some

71
00:04:58,593 --> 00:05:03,675
sort of invasive surgery or treatment that is hurting their quality of life.

72
00:05:03,675 --> 00:05:06,317
In the end, we were interested in where are we gaining and

73
00:05:06,317 --> 00:05:08,693
losing quality of life with our new intervention.

74
00:05:08,693 --> 00:05:12,189
So here we can graph it in terms of our gain, is the green area, we've gained

75
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:15,796
quality of life, maybe we lost a little bit of quality life at the beginning and

76
00:05:15,796 --> 00:05:17,729
we wanna think about those trade-offs.

77
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:20,465
So in the end, we're interested in how are we kind of gaining and

78
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:21,539
losing quality of life?

79
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:25,994
And if we can sum up these areas, here for the yellow and the blue,

80
00:05:25,994 --> 00:05:29,977
then we can calculate the gain and loss in quality of life.

81
00:05:29,977 --> 00:05:30,813
And that's it,

82
00:05:30,813 --> 00:05:34,801
in our next video, we'll talk about how do we measure that quality of life?
