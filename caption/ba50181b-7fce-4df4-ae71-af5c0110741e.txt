1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:11,610
I guess we were right about everybody.

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,680
Well, let's get started. You guys are supposed to take 10 minutes, pass this around.

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:25,350
Okay, so I know some of you already, but I'm Jackie Goodrich.

4
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,659
I'm a research faculty in this department.

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:36,420
And today we'll be talking mostly about collaboration and of any type of research, but also especially global research.

6
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,120
And I've been involved in a lot of that over the years. So you can ask big question.

7
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,310
We can hopefully have a good discussion about some of the challenges.

8
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,100
But first, since I don't know everybody.

9
00:00:47,220 --> 00:01:00,040
So how many of you are I'm a student and MPH and then I think do you think do you think you like your employee?

10
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,790
Okay. Oh, yes, I know people. Let's take this class to certain physics of their lives.

11
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,940
Okay, perfect. So we have a good range of folks.

12
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:15,740
And some of you, all the students I know will be directly involved in research, obviously sources and research in place.

13
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,219
So this is all very applicable.

14
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:24,170
And then for the students, some of this will be very applicable probably when you go on to your internships this summer,

15
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:31,530
whatever you do in your future job too. So this is from funny strip called comics.

16
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,780
You know, it's different grad students all over the world taking up.

17
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:41,880
I have this feeling all the world is under the grad students, just like me working on the same research problem as I am.

18
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:52,440
And so in this, you know, in this field, in the work that we do, you know, there is this collaboration with there can also be competition.

19
00:01:52,440 --> 00:02:00,179
And that's something I know. And one of the articles that was in there on the canvas that it talked about how collaboration can turn into competition.

20
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,970
And, you know, something you have to watch out for in the sciences and even in the workplace to assist in research.

21
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:16,290
So hopefully today we'll talk about how to have successful collaborations and not be afraid of, you know, instead of competition.

22
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:25,889
So just give us some basic definitions of those things you can make a collaboration of as the act of working together to create something,

23
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:31,170
you know, in research, of course, it's to create, you know, to work on studies, to produce results and things like that.

24
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:37,200
But sometimes it's also creating, you know, products or creating public health programs together.

25
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:44,820
And then competition, of course, is when you have a rivalry between two groups or two people trying to achieve the same thing first.

26
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:51,899
So, of course, we have we have that in in sports, but you can have that in in science, too, if, you know,

27
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:59,130
people are competing for the same grants or trying to submit the same new results, you know, be the first person to ever show something or not.

28
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:08,100
I see in my years in public health, the good news is I think we're less of a competitive field in general than some of the other sciences because,

29
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:14,129
you know, recently people in this field, like all of you, are here for mostly for the greater good.

30
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:20,370
And we want to the more knowledge we create, even if I study cuts, toxic chemicals, for instance.

31
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:29,760
So if I put out a paper that says perfluorinated chemicals cause, you know, birth defects and then another group puts out a paper on that too,

32
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:38,190
I don't really mind because regulators can use that, can find evidence to decide if that chemical is is dangerous or not.

33
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,719
So I think sometimes for us it's okay to have people working on similar things,

34
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,270
but we do still compete for grant funding and you know, of course we'll compete for jobs and stuff like that too.

35
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,330
And you go on to the workplace. So some competition is inevitable even in public health.

36
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,880
So this is just a scenario, I guess a big scenario about collaboration.

37
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:08,070
So this is they're three professionals sharing volunteer to meet and they have a common interest in learning disorders,

38
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:12,210
figuring out what, you know, maybe what environmental factors underlie learning disorders.

39
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,459
So they decide they want to work together.

40
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:22,950
They start putting together a grant proposal so that they can fund this research and then they start putting together their scientific ideas.

41
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:30,030
And that's that's no problem. But then how they're going to work it out is the part that becomes more challenging.

42
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,669
So some of the questions that come up and we'll discuss some of these things later, too,

43
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:43,559
is for grants or in the sentence for papers to who should submit it if they're from three different schools, which one which one will be the main one?

44
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,690
The main one in charge? Do they all need to get RV approval to work on the project?

45
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:54,360
So I think in a previous section of human subjects and I have to get RV approvals for studies.

46
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,810
So yeah, I'm actually in this case, typically you have to get some form of.

47
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,650
The approval at all of the institutions.

48
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:10,060
Sometimes like one is the primary one or the other to kind of wave and say, okay, we've deferred to the other university.

49
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:15,010
But that's something that has to be worked out before you're allowed to do anything. And that can take that can take time.

50
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,110
And then what will happen if their work produces a product?

51
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,889
Obviously papers. Who's going to be on the paper? Who's going to get to be first?

52
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,890
And they'll have, you know, the coolest position on the paper.

53
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,540
Who is. What happens if they invent something in this project?

54
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,100
Will there be a pattern? Have they worked that out? Who owns that university?

55
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,919
Will they do the legal work through? So there there are a lot of things to work out.

56
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:51,880
And I think in some of that, in the papers on a canvas, kind of discussed how working these things out sooner rather than later is always better.

57
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,200
And I've worked on many projects and many collaborations and I've actually been really,

58
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:04,850
really lucky because I don't think I've had any really bad experiences where, you know, we had a big conflict and had to get arbitrated.

59
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,620
So I've been lucky so far. We'll see what happens in the future.

60
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,429
But I know some projects we've been like, Oh, we trust each other, let's just work together.

61
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,430
And we didn't make all of these plans right away at the beginning.

62
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:23,709
But, you know, obviously projects were a lot more productive where we kind of set standards at the beginning about who's going to write the papers,

63
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:28,780
who's going to manage the data, who's going to do this and like spelled it all out in writing and protocols before we started.

64
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:41,340
So in practice, there is a lot that stems from collaborative relationships.

65
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:50,489
There's different roles and responsibilities. So a lot of you are maybe, I guess earlier career scientists and public health professionals.

66
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:57,990
So if you this summer, if you work on a research project, you go to an internship, you'll hopefully have a very defined role.

67
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:06,090
Maybe your analyst, maybe you're in charge of collecting data carefully and keeping track of it or something like that, doing some lab work.

68
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:12,330
But you know, as you get further into your career, you might have a lot more responsibilities.

69
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:20,070
You know, you might be in charge of managing funding or, you know, managing health ethics for the study and things like that.

70
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,530
So defining all of this, who does what it, especially in big collaborations, is really,

71
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,489
really important because you don't want important things to fall through the cracks.

72
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:36,120
Otherwise, your your research or your projects will not work out or they won't be as productive as they could be.

73
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,300
You have to think about different people on the team often have different goals.

74
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,240
So I work on a lot of teams where my specialty is in epigenetics.

75
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,540
So I like to study how epigenetics is,

76
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:59,609
is basically a biomarker of of health effects from exposures that could underlie a lot of different diseases and so on.

77
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:04,829
A lot of teams, I'm like really only care about the epigenetics getting down to the paper, it's getting done.

78
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:12,299
But obviously there's other people at the team that want to look at how the exposures we're studying affects neurodevelopment and things like that.

79
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:21,570
So we want to make sure each team member is pushing forward, you know, the part that that they're in charge of or that's meaningful to them.

80
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,470
Otherwise, you know, only certain parts of the project obviously will get done.

81
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,889
There's actually in science, there's surprises, especially as you get higher up.

82
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:36,510
There's surprisingly a lot of, you know, in some ways kind of like business skills that you need.

83
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,960
You know, at some point you need to learn how to manage and work with people of the people.

84
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,259
You have to learn how to work with budgets because we get these these big grants.

85
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,690
And there's some people even here at the university that can help budgeting and management for a lot of it,

86
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:58,919
you know, kind of still do keep track of that. So there's a lot of things to to work with.

87
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:06,209
And then in collaborative teams, you know, you're often giving some of the budget and some of the tasks to different people at different

88
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:12,330
institutions to keep up with everybody and make sure they're each kind of managing their own part.

89
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:19,979
But then there's cultural differences and we'll talk I think we'll focus most of our discussion at the end in global research,

90
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,490
because I think that's a lot more more interesting in some ways to talk about.

91
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:32,129
But you have to work through cultural differences across countries, across even universities, within the US, across disciplines.

92
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:37,650
You know, I've worked with engineers and people in anthropology that work a lot differently than people in public health,

93
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:45,780
in deciding, you know, what best practices are for the whole team, not just doing things the way you always do it in your field.

94
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:58,440
So there's some very simple best tips there if you're in a collaboration, working on some kind of project in this could even apply.

95
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:04,740
Sometimes that's projects to collaborators should share findings with other people in the team.

96
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,960
You know, don't hide your part, update people on what you're doing and check in on what everyone else is doing too.

97
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:15,690
If you have any problems, you know, don't hide them. Because a lot of times it's like, okay,

98
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:21,150
I really messed up all these samples and I don't want anyone to know something to fix it first and then tell the team,

99
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,510
you know, eventually if there's a big problem, you're going to have to tell everybody and it's better to work on it sooner than later.

100
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,960
And other people in the team can help you to work out issues.

101
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,200
If there's anything big that changes, like some, you're going to you're going to move.

102
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,120
Some of the team is going to move your hiring something new. You know, you want to keep everybody up to date.

103
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:52,170
You want to keep you know, always keep the team like notified of all big things like that and then make sure it's the part you think,

104
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,639
you know, my epigenetics part. I think nobody maybe other people don't care about it.

105
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,230
Maybe engineers don't care about it.

106
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:05,010
You know, if I'm about to write a paper on that, make sure you tell everybody, even if they've agreed they're not on it or something like that,

107
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:09,299
you know, they'll start seeing news about it if you don't tell them and they'll want to know.

108
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,110
Like our overall project is being corrupted and people get excited about that.

109
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:19,560
It increases your team's morale, I think, too, and it's just important to know what's going on.

110
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:30,570
So if we get to more fun part research, stop talking so much, these I think these slides should be on the campus.

111
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,140
These are just some policies that fund these flights for many years.

112
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,969
But I was surprised.

113
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:46,420
I don't think there's anything updated beyond these official federal policies kind of on especially on best practices for collaborations, on grants.

114
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:53,200
And these are in some ways, I won't say these are exactly laws, but, you know,

115
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:00,280
very well approved policies that were put out years ago, over 20 years ago, that are still in place now.

116
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:06,999
But I'd say there's a lot more recommendations beyond this very legalistic language to if anyone ever

117
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,719
wants to look at those that are out there that describe in more layman's terms how to work with teams.

118
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,830
Well, especially as they get bigger and bigger and bigger, because even 20 years ago when this came out,

119
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,320
interdisciplinary research was starting to become the thing.

120
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:29,430
But now it's a lot bigger and a lot more common that you're going to go to a job or a

121
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,240
project where you're working with people across many fields or even across many countries.

122
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,230
That's becoming more common over time and becoming more value to.

123
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:50,440
So we'll start first before we get into more global specific talking about just any kind of collaboration.

124
00:12:50,740 --> 00:13:01,900
So thinking about research specifically why, you know, there can be problems and competition and more logistical complications.

125
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,970
Why is collaboration a good thing? Why do we want to collaborate on research or other projects?

126
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:18,500
Yeah. It's just different perspectives that come in when you have the knowledge of things.

127
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:32,960
Yeah, definitely. Different perspectives lead to better interpretation methods, all those sorts of things, always to two things.

128
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:40,540
So there are more ideas or some chance or wishes that might be submitted.

129
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:48,280
Research. Maybe some shows that can reach two or three persons in person?

130
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:52,550
Yeah, definitely. A lot better work comes out.

131
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,010
It saves time. Yes. I just think we do it right.

132
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:08,420
So I guess for many of you, this is this is your first year assignment here for most of you.

133
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:14,899
But even just in in class, have you been in collaborative projects?

134
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:19,850
And what were some of your maybe the benefits and challenges of those that you've experienced so far?

135
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:38,120
Homes are equally distributed, especially in first class projects.

136
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:46,100
Just like they like to target some type of scheduling.

137
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:57,560
Definitely want happened to. Now some of my collaborations of people most of them have people at least all over the US time zones.

138
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,760
And then sometimes they're people in other countries.

139
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:09,520
Like, it's interesting. What's.

140
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,790
So I know in class, you know, your your collaboration is very short.

141
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,000
You know, your project has to be done.

142
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:34,610
I probably two weeks from now, if any of you are working on it now and you know what you have to turn in, it's fairly somewhat formalized in that way.

143
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:44,360
But um, based on if any of you read the Without Good Intentions paper, when do you think,

144
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,640
you know, bigger or maybe longer research collaborations should be formalized.

145
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:05,220
I think that's where we share. Research works well between two scientists.

146
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,870
I don't know. It's very important to verbalize with papers.

147
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:18,930
I think they have to know which I going to be their responsibilities in every aspect of the research.

148
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,740
So it is not going to be an issue.

149
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:32,790
Sometimes they should do that or shouldn't they always have their their their options

150
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:40,410
or their positions and all these things that they have to just write it down so that.

151
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:58,130
It is understood. And for every part of the research scene, since you are getting all the data and having all the research and everything,

152
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:07,340
it has to look like did everything what today researchers have to do.

153
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:12,980
So it will be an hour. Yeah.

154
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:16,790
So basically early before any action is done.

155
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:21,500
Spell out what what steps you're going to get, who's doing what and when.

156
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:26,870
And I would say that is when that is when things work the best.

157
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,380
When you do that, sometimes it can be it can be challenging.

158
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:40,610
When you have when if you work on a project that's funded by a grant, basically, then you have to do a lot of this,

159
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:46,219
this planning and these very detailed plans and who's doing what and even who's

160
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,050
getting what part of the money to do what to get the funding for a project.

161
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,310
So I always find that that's that's really helpful for a lot of the research that I do.

162
00:17:55,310 --> 00:18:00,830
You know, we have this whole plan and then if we get the grant, we pull it out and we say, okay, we wrote this plan, now let's follow it.

163
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,479
And it was it was done in advance. But sometimes I find in real life it gets more challenging.

164
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:14,810
So work on a project that wasn't funded by a grant or proposal like that where two people got together and we just said,

165
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,010
look, we have this data from the study and no one's used this part of it.

166
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:25,999
And let's just, you know, write a paper and do something with it. And then sometimes if you don't carefully plan, okay, well, what do we mean by that?

167
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,560
Who's really going to write it is really going to analyze it. Who else needs to be involved?

168
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:35,299
If you don't plan that advance, then sometimes at the very end, you know, we're like, we're done.

169
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,180
And there's a few other people that say like, Hey, I was supposed to be on this project.

170
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,620
You left me out or you left out this really important variable or something like that.

171
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:48,949
So now all this planning and advances is really helpful and for great, you know,

172
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:54,019
for a lot of you about to do your MSC thesis projects or internships and all those things,

173
00:18:54,020 --> 00:19:00,739
you know, right now you're probably all in some kind of formal to informal agreement with

174
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:06,020
maybe a research mentor and even research methods and teams operate differently.

175
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,090
So don't be afraid also to start asking more questions and say, you know,

176
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:15,170
we can we talk about exactly what I'm going to do and when you want me to do it,

177
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:20,299
and if I can be an author on the paper and help me, you know, if your mentor doesn't bring up those questions,

178
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:25,310
feel free to to plan some of those details out as early as you can.

179
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:33,260
And for internships, too, you know, you can talk about a lot of times there's some things set with that that's already plan the goal.

180
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:40,909
And sometimes it changes when you're actually there. But if you want to have a continued collaboration, especially with that organization,

181
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:47,030
you might talk with your bosses early on about if there's a way you can stay involved,

182
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:50,300
you know, if your work turns into something more, something like that.

183
00:19:51,050 --> 00:20:03,320
So so we kind of talked about some drawbacks of collaborative research and class projects.

184
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:12,920
And of course, in this with all good intentions paper, you see, you know, kind of a really bad situation where there is, you know,

185
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:18,860
I guess they felt like they were stealing from each other and ended up one of them ended up suing, suing the other person.

186
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,239
And I think that this can happen, too, especially more where patents are involved,

187
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:29,000
which a lot of times, you know, in public health we're not always working in that realm,

188
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:37,910
but we still have, you know, research or even self-help programs that we designed and stuff like that that you don't want people to just steal.

189
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:46,399
So as anyone else, can you think of any other challenges in collaborative research?

190
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,520
You forget your own experience or things you've heard about.

191
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:57,780
Maybe ways to manage them look like people say they're going to do something like that all the time to do something else they don't end up doing.

192
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,440
I grew up.

193
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:17,280
It's one of the people I get to say health, but but I'm trying to involve them.

194
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:27,760
But they also get published about me. You know, like, listen, I'm a big fan, but yeah, yeah,

195
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:37,020
sometimes people don't pull their weight or you're just this, that kind of thing just drop off sports.

196
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:42,240
And nice people have a big situation that comes up, maybe like leave their job or university or whatever.

197
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,700
But in like the economy class projects do I know when that happens?

198
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:52,410
Then whoever's in the group, it's like, I still want to get an X, so you start doing all the extra work.

199
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,160
But um, yeah.

200
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:03,420
So what, what would be a way to, I guess if you're in a situation like that where you have, you know, a group,

201
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:13,709
a collaborator who's not doing their role, how do you think you might try to approach that that way as a veteran?

202
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:23,270
Fix that, because I'm sure that's going to happen to everybody in some way. Yeah, obviously.

203
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:35,000
But just let them talk about what I think five find out.

204
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:39,380
Great stuff.

205
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:45,620
Yeah, definitely. And sort of have people hide that they're having this issue.

206
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:57,940
Well, to be honest, we work everything. And they would also have a handle on these situations before you do.

207
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:17,010
I think in some way, even in some of my grant teams, actually, this also happens with medical people.

208
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:24,450
So we have you know, sometimes I've had some projects where it's very important.

209
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:32,129
We're working with some you know, basically some professors at Michigan Medicine who spent most of their time really with patients,

210
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,460
which is not and that's what they should be doing.

211
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:40,500
But they have this little bit of time for research and there's like a piece like really only they can do.

212
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,370
I mean, I can't I can't talk to their patients. I can't access their patients.

213
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:48,000
We can't get into medical records. That's something only they're allowed to do.

214
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:52,709
So I think there's I've had a couple of collaborators where they just didn't have

215
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:56,760
time to do that piece of the study and pull the data for us that we needed.

216
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:03,020
And we almost think we're running out of time on our funded timeline or something like that.

217
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:07,350
And so I think in that case, since it couldn't be delegated,

218
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:17,830
I just had to keep bothering them until eventually they recruited somebody else from their unit who was also allowed to access that data to do it.

219
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:22,169
But yeah, but yeah, it is it's ideal.

220
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:27,989
Sometimes if you have more control over it, you can be like, okay, you can't do that for you right now.

221
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:38,430
I know I going to do it myself, but sometimes when you can you to be very persistent, you know, like what?

222
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,640
Like if it's your best or you're not doing it.

223
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:48,929
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Part of what's going to be big too because yeah.

224
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,550
A lot of times if yeah.

225
00:24:51,590 --> 00:25:00,090
Sometimes you, especially if you need to graduate with your thesis to be on paper to be published so that you can have it on your CV and get a job.

226
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:05,120
And because it's important you want it to be way you want your resources to be out there,

227
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:10,890
then sometimes if you have higher ups, they should be responding to you.

228
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:16,230
But if they're not, you might feel like you have to just take them into your own hands and do as much as you can,

229
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:23,490
or make it make it easy for that person. Feel like, okay, it's almost fine, let's just get over right and then we'll turn to them.

230
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,770
Yeah, but obviously in an ideal scenario, everyone does, does their part.

231
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:34,149
But these are just things that are realistically happening in the workplace sometimes.

232
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:41,370
So things like keep in mind and strategies to handle it better when possible.

233
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:50,310
You know, I think even with higher ups, I think most people would be very open even if they don't change to a conversation saying,

234
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:55,470
you know, okay, I really need this done, you know, never go in, like sounding like blame me.

235
00:25:55,830 --> 00:26:01,140
But, you know, I really need this done to do on this day. If you don't help me with this, this is not gonna work out, you know?

236
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:12,340
And I think a lot of people are responsive to that. So let's talk about some global work.

237
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:22,570
And I think I think yesterday when I first went on 60 Minutes and I was like 5 minutes, but there is there's a two pager on there.

238
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:29,770
If anyone is interested in global health stuff, that's pretty useful when you think about how to work with partners.

239
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,200
So we're lucky here in our School of Public Health. Actually, a lot of people are helping global health.

240
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:42,040
You know, there was a time even not that long ago when it was really hard to get any funding or support to do global health work,

241
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:56,050
at least if you're a researcher in the U.S. So I think that it was like that, that you updated them, but it was not okay.

242
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,210
Oh, no, but I'm sorry for the other one. So it was a guideline for responsible.

243
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,850
Okay. Oh, would you put that on the email? Yeah. Okay. I'm sorry about that.

244
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:10,210
That one that one is still useful if you're going to do like global internship or something.

245
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:19,930
That's still, I think, a very useful piece, but it's much longer and it's kind of more of a like a research study of those kind of things.

246
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,129
But this is if anyone wants to do is interested in global,

247
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:29,350
this is just like a two page thing if you want to look it over at some point, it's also on the campus now.

248
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,760
But I have a figure from it we can talk about in a minute.

249
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:38,229
But so there's a lot of people here that you will research.

250
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:44,170
So if you work on a master's project here, chances are it might be global involved a global partner.

251
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:48,790
And then a lot of our students actually like to go global.

252
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:54,850
So overseas for their internships, too. So I don't know if anyone here is is in that position.

253
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:59,200
But, you know, really, this is it's with technology and stuff like that, too.

254
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,819
It's it's becoming much more possible to to have these global partnerships and

255
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:07,180
to work together whether or not you actually work together in person or not.

256
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:11,020
You know, something is working together virtually with people from other countries.

257
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:20,920
So there's even more, you know, you can have even more fruit and a lot more meaningful and really important work done in this realm.

258
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:26,140
But the collaboration has to be handled very carefully for them to work out well.

259
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:38,860
And so what are just some things you can think of with that that might be a problem specifically in global collaboration?

260
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,240
Most revolutions are just a different thing.

261
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:55,020
They have different level significance. Yeah. Regulations and rules or, you know, research ethics and how other things work to.

262
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:08,280
You have to come to overturn the culture, how things are done, how people communicate.

263
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:14,550
To scheduling is an issue, again, a big issue.

264
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,840
Pandemics cause problems in global research as well.

265
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:24,150
Travel restrictions sometimes blame translation.

266
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:33,940
Yeah. Translation. Translation is a big thing I work on.

267
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:40,360
Actually, one of my global projects is with researchers in Mexico.

268
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:50,950
And yeah, and it's I would say there's, there's a lot of differences in regulations and a lot of translation that has to happen all the time.

269
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:57,910
So basically, we have this this very large human study that's been going on for 25 years, and I haven't been helped the whole time.

270
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:07,960
But there's a team of people that's changed over time that's studied the same cohort of basically moms and their kids, and their kids are now adults.

271
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:13,720
And we've looked at how different and representative that's affected their health and development over time.

272
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:20,740
Now we're going to even look at the next generation. So it's been like a really fruitful collaboration that has over 100 publications.

273
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,430
And it's it's informed environmental policy involves Mexico and the US.

274
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:34,860
So it's been amazing. But there's a lot of commitment that goes in and a lot of being really, really, really careful with regulations especially.

275
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:41,170
It's actually that that the Mexican overseeing our review so we always have to get everything the

276
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:48,100
same exact protocol approved here and there and the IAB in Mexico is actually much more strict.

277
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:53,410
So I think ours is really good. I was like, Yeah, this is like, okay, check these boxes.

278
00:30:53,410 --> 00:31:00,010
You're protecting human subjects. That's good. There's this even more protective of human subjects, which is great, but it's just, you know,

279
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:05,590
well, we'll write something up in English and then our our partners will translate it.

280
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:10,090
And then, you know, they'll say, you don't know, like either.

281
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:13,120
Sometimes the translation doesn't work out. You can read more details.

282
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,809
Or sometimes I'll be like, Now this is enough details for us.

283
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:19,870
Like we need to know why. Why are you doing that blood sample?

284
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,570
What are you gonna do that we're going to do every last drop, you know,

285
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:28,569
which is their government wants to take a lot more work here and make it more attuned to those details.

286
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:38,290
So we usually write things up so that it can get approved there first, and then usually that protocol can easily get approved here.

287
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:47,230
But because they have more checks and balances in their system, in our system as well, there's just, you know, wants more details, which is also fine.

288
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:56,290
And they've actually said we so yeah then that's the thing to basically to both of them,

289
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:02,980
we submit everything in English and Spanish, but then each country only evaluates the one in their language.

290
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:08,380
And yet technically no one rejects the translation.

291
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:14,460
But you know, but they're obviously that their government is reading in Spanish and ours is in English and all checks out then,

292
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,340
you know, I guess they assume that's how that works out.

293
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:23,800
But um, and there's also been regulations there with shipping.

294
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:31,149
So we've had, you know, for 25 years we've, we had to click bloodline because we measure blood and blood, things like that.

295
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:36,760
Now genetics and you standing in their stuff and a lot of time that's collected there.

296
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:45,370
But we do some of the analysis here. And so over 25 years, the shipping international shipping regulations have changed many times.

297
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,680
And right now it's actually very challenging to get blood from Mexico to here.

298
00:32:51,070 --> 00:33:01,750
They have a lot of really complicated paperwork, I guess like a prevent that you have to use to get it shipped out.

299
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:08,259
And that's been, you know, some that's we're waiting like two years to get samples and our team down there is working like super,

300
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:18,159
super, super hard on this really complicated paperwork. But it's a lot of our research can be very, very fruitful, but it can be a lot going on.

301
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:24,850
The team must be really committed to what you're doing, and you want to make sure that the research that you're doing is benefiting everybody.

302
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:32,019
Of course, your study participants and the local community, but also the, you know, both research teams,

303
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:39,520
too, because otherwise, you know, why should people be putting in so much work and and stuff?

304
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,150
And that's not what they want to get out of the project. What's important to them?

305
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:58,820
So what are some other complications that you could see in any type of global work and ways maybe to improve them?

306
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:26,760
The other, but the perception.

307
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:40,270
Looks like you might have been arrogant, but.

308
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:44,530
They might not have connected.

309
00:34:48,520 --> 00:35:05,530
Yeah. Yeah. Perceptions you may think and only that's another thing too, that historically a lot of research for my research was very restrictive.

310
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:13,150
You know, researchers kind of went in and we know we've got something we want learn here or this is what the people here need,

311
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,000
you know, and we're just going to give this thing. It'll be good.

312
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,700
And obviously that's caused a lot of damage in a lot of countries and communities over the years.

313
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:27,290
And now people in medical and health research are finally realizing, you know,

314
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:33,299
and promoting some of these better practices, you know, equitable, equitable partnerships, global health research.

315
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:41,740
You're not just going there to extract knowledge in a in a cheap setting at the worst or at the best.

316
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:47,220
The best case scenario is thinking, you know the answer. You're going to give them this intervention.

317
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:51,799
You can be helpful, but you really have to actually,

318
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:59,560
if you can figure out you really need to define what you're doing, either your program, your intervention program,

319
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:06,610
your research questions, what you want to collect with the people that you're actually working with,

320
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,080
the research population, the researchers in that area.

321
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,740
But sometimes even your actual research population, you know,

322
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:21,870
so some of your classes you might have heard of community based participatory research, CPR.

323
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:28,959
So that's one way to even not even just little even here in the U.S. work with, you know,

324
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:35,440
basically the people that you're you're trying to study to make sure what you're collecting is data that will benefit

325
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:44,500
them or an intervention you're trying to give out is something that will benefit them and seems reasonable to them.

326
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,860
And there is you know, there's kind of a range if you're trying to do this right,

327
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:56,890
having a natural, equitable global partnership that benefits everyone involved.

328
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:06,610
You know, at the at the most extreme, you can kind of you can co-create everything like every research protocol and stuff that you're going to do.

329
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:15,150
And, you know, the maybe the other end of things, you could at least design something and then get, you know,

330
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,989
full approval from a focus group of, you know, participants and community members and stuff like that.

331
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:25,180
There's a range of between how much you kind of design you can do.

332
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:35,800
But so with that in mind, what are some so this, this is from the research paper, but it basically had these, these principles.

333
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:43,689
So it's supposed to be based on the experience, respect and odyssey principles that are from a different global framework.

334
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:52,210
But, you know, it's basically talking about research or know program implementation for the way that you want to co-create,

335
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:57,070
communicate, commit and also have a continuous review of what you're doing.

336
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:08,860
So in in a project, what are some of the things that you think you might you could co-create with your team, with your global partners?

337
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,640
Do they research researchers or even community members?

338
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:40,200
Yes, it is. But it's been phenomenal, especially with all that time that you're working with.

339
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,890
You lose sight of what actually matters.

340
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:50,730
But I think kind of setting that up.

341
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,670
Yeah, yeah, definitely. What would they actually need?

342
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:08,120
They want to address? It.

343
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:25,450
You're not having a good time for the other people.

344
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:31,380
Whole other. Yeah, but.

345
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:37,560
Oh yeah. I've heard of it.

346
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:49,130
When you have a lot of different viewpoints to reach. Yeah yeah.

347
00:39:49,170 --> 00:40:02,350
Definitely having you know that that commitment to a long a long partnership there are and it can be and sometimes it's so you can even co-create the

348
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:12,840
strategy how you're going to sustainably keep this program going because funding is actually for global health can be really challenging to get.

349
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:20,370
You know, that is you're working on one of the key areas like the Bill Gates Foundation funds or something that maybe you can get by.

350
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:23,399
But there is, you know, especially in environmental health, you know,

351
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:31,140
there's only certain sources of money that you can even apply to that will fund global word of things.

352
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:38,280
And so I think you really got to commit with the team to this long term plan and try to keep it going and even have a plan.

353
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,510
When you don't have funding, you know, how can you somehow still support each other?

354
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:47,700
Maybe use dating or have maybe share some equipment that you have so that the group,

355
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,050
you know, and the other country can keep going with some of the work.

356
00:40:52,470 --> 00:41:02,070
I know. Um, I have some, I work with some researchers in Nigeria at actually like, like a top university in their country.

357
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:07,100
And they've, they've had, you know, similar, similar problems where, you know, they work with some team,

358
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:13,469
you know, in the US and the projects we've worked on together have been really tiny grants,

359
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:21,540
but they've worked with bigger teams and maybe they're well funded for three years and they had all the supplies needed to do now to do that.

360
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:29,850
Then when that was done, you know, they had a machine, but then they couldn't even buy the the supplies to run the machine anymore and carry out,

361
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:35,130
carry out any other research until they got more funding again.

362
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:47,580
And so I think having now with the availability of big data, that's like a in some ways a really great way to keep some partnerships going too,

363
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:53,850
because, you know, in theory, there's a lot of existing data out there now that is free to use.

364
00:41:53,850 --> 00:42:01,049
So even if you have a down period where you don't have money to maybe do analysis and collect new samples and stuff like that,

365
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:08,730
maybe you can kind of work with your global partners to create evidence for the questions you're both interested in.

366
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,610
I'm using something that's already out there to.

367
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:20,950
Yeah commitment and sustainability is can be very challenging I think for our our study in Mexico has been

368
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:31,090
so has been lucky to be so successful they've been funded basically almost continuously for about 25 years.

369
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,959
But, you know, really it's it's it's been lucky.

370
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,120
You know, they've been focused on something that basically our and I h here is willing to fund.

371
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,980
That's where most of the funding has come from.

372
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:50,620
But and we can say the research that we do applies to populations here and there that are exposed to the same things.

373
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:58,570
But even so, you know, the research team also puts in a lot of time commitment to to keep that process going.

374
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:05,559
For instance, the the leader of the study in Mexico is is pretty high up in the equivalent up there.

375
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:12,700
And I h and then the leader here is Karen Peterson, who runs the nutrition department in the school.

376
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:14,350
And so they're very busy people,

377
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:19,900
but they drop they put in a lot of time to work on these grants and keep this collaboration going because they know that,

378
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:23,229
you know, it's the only way to keep it going is if it's resourced.

379
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:30,060
And so because of that, we're able to fund, continuously fund, you know, the full time people that work on the research in Mexico as well.

380
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:34,810
Some people that work out here, too. But, yes, it's a big a big commitment.

381
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:40,240
Both you have to everyone has to be invested on both sides for that to work.

382
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:47,850
So what about communication? What are some challenges with communication?

383
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:53,979
Well, teams, you talk about translation. What are some other ways to do that?

384
00:43:53,980 --> 00:44:01,480
You might need to work on communication beyond what you normally do with your classmates to make these kind of projects successful.

385
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:30,500
Yeah. I guess now we turn to another partner in another country that they are in the same project.

386
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:37,159
For example, at the beginning or in the or something, they,

387
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:44,920
they meet there and they do something in the same place, but they are doing two separate works.

388
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:51,080
But their research, I think, is easy to communicate because we have been trained.

389
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:57,020
We have we have many researchers to share the information,

390
00:44:57,350 --> 00:45:04,960
sharing documents and working the same documents at the same time, doing all the of the job together.

391
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:08,920
So I think it's easy to it now.

392
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:20,030
And also, it's is very important to have all the means, all the everything right written down,

393
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:34,100
because especially when there is differences in language, sometimes you think that you understood or the other person didn't even get the idea.

394
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:43,460
So, yes, it's very important to have it to be sure that everything is correct in numbers.

395
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:56,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You just have to have patience that it sometimes just takes longer to be invested in the time it takes to communicate effectively.

396
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,740
Because sometimes there's different language, different cultures, the same.

397
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:05,760
You may be able to say an expression like, Oh, come out of the woodwork or something.

398
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:13,280
Like, I have no idea what that is. That means it's just being committed to maybe speaking more formally,

399
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:23,300
I guess is as good as investing in the time it takes to be more effective versus like maybe with your peers sometimes.

400
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:31,400
Yeah, yeah, definitely. So I'm hearing make use of the technology that's available now.

401
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:39,290
I don't know how people did all this global research that we are communicating now, being able to do work without always traveling to see each other.

402
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:48,499
It's is amazing how you can even train each other on methods and stuff like over video calls, which is nobody knew of five years ago.

403
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:55,069
So like using the technology we have then also taking the time to to listen and be patient.

404
00:46:55,070 --> 00:47:00,800
I think that's something I have to work on a lot. I can be find a kind of a fast talkers one in Zoom calls.

405
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:09,169
We have once a week with you know ten of our research partners like before you say something quick for say something that's people that are you know,

406
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:12,739
you're having a conversation. People are translating at their head and then they're responding.

407
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:16,850
And you need to give people time, you people time to say what they want to say.

408
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:23,030
And so even, you know, things like have people raise their hands on Zoom calls and stuff and help help with that.

409
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:32,509
And people interrupt each other and writing everything out for sure is is very important and having very detailed protocols of,

410
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:39,230
you know, which person on which team, which institute is doing what is is even more important and having report back to you.

411
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:46,850
I like to just think everything's going fine. You know, we'll we'll check in in a couple of months and I'm sure everyone's doing their job.

412
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:51,620
But I've I've been on some teams that are really organized and have really inspired me.

413
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:56,630
What you really should do where they have meetings and we send people report back, you know,

414
00:47:56,690 --> 00:48:01,340
it's like a spreadsheet or a slide or something that shows every week, you know, this is how many samples we collected.

415
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:07,880
This is the challenges we came across. And, you know, their information, it's it's kind of boring.

416
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:12,710
It's not exciting, but it's so important. It's been so helpful. Like everyone on the team knows what's going on.

417
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:17,780
So we tell them we've analyzed data, why it's delayed and stuff like that.

418
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:24,080
And even though it seems, you know, just very logistical, it's it's so important and helpful.

419
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:27,709
People can say, like what we're doing, what we're supposed to do, so are you.

420
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,750
But here are the challenges. Let's work together.

421
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:51,780
The company is important, but a lot of other companies that like their office, have great on like, oh yeah, they didn't have to do it.

422
00:48:53,150 --> 00:49:02,750
So we have to deal with recording video.

423
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:22,959
Yeah. That was like the only thing that kept happening was that a lot of schools we were producing were not working perfectly well,

424
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,930
believing a different type of paper or something like that.

425
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:37,540
And I think it's a little bit like little things like if you like, I think you're right.

426
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:42,970
There was like, I think like video.

427
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:50,290
There might be something completely different for them.

428
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:58,120
Yeah. So it's, it's very important to be culturally attuned and to think about what?

429
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:07,540
Yeah. Even connectivity, you can't take anything for granted. So, you know, you can always just ask, you know, it's better just to ask about things.

430
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:13,360
And I guess that's well, I know class is supposed to be done now, but it's kind of a continuous rule review comes into play.

431
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:16,990
I can try to talk to your partners and pay what's working out, what's not working out?

432
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:20,230
What can we do? The things you might have expected, you know, that could come on.

433
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:28,300
But with that. Well, thanks for talking with me today about global research.

434
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:35,850
And if you want to do global research. Feel free to nominate for us.
