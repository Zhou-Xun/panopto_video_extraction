1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:14,650
Oh. Your. I could get it done by today.

2
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,990
Isn't that right? Is that fine?

3
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,950
I mean, you can still edit it yourself to submit it. I guess they don't.

4
00:00:28,060 --> 00:01:28,800
I guess we still need to get a. She was my.

5
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:13,650
Can anyone go into canvas and see if the recording is showing up?

6
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,959
Because last week that's not a recorded ID and to show up and seven and it wasn't your couldn't see it.

7
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,720
I have it turned on but I can't tell if it's recording me.

8
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:36,400
And I may not be there until after the class, and they may have to save it.

9
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,780
Is there any sign that it's recorded? Is it for you know, it's there?

10
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,380
Yeah. So there's three of them there. But they're all of us because.

11
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,970
Right. That's what happened last week. All right. All right.

12
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:14,870
I'm going to have to wind up. Well, there's one in Paris right now.

13
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:21,800
Yeah, that's good. Right now. Okay. I feel bad for the students who missed it.

14
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:57,880
Sometimes. Good.

15
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,240
Yeah. So I was like, okay.

16
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:49,390
Yeah. I like I to work with her.

17
00:04:49,450 --> 00:05:08,210
I would have low. Nothing like.

18
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:17,430
Got. Yeah.

19
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,930
Yeah. I'm sorry. I didn't hear.

20
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,330
I'm doing it. So this time I'm doing it from their computer.

21
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,930
And it says about a saw. It says it's recording.

22
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,550
Okay, but you. I think you did something wrong.

23
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:50,690
Apparently, I recorded it on my laptop. It says it works, but it has 3 seconds and maybe that's it.

24
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,910
So you can. You can look at the best 3 seconds of last time.

25
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,900
Yeah. So sorry. I have notes I can give you that I had me go.

26
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,360
Oh, they're a little bit jumbled, but I did. And actually, we appreciate it.

27
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,380
And I can, like, set up a zoom or something. Just.

28
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:23,080
Just remind me. Okay. And I was like, Yeah, yeah.

29
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:30,070
No, that's great. So things are all right?

30
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just got.

31
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:45,270
I hear you very much, Ambassador.

32
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:57,070
Yes, I'm very glad I made a face for sure.

33
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:10,000
All right. We're going to start now. So there's a very rare event that the school is giving you free food today.

34
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:15,220
So during the break, hopefully there still be donuts and muffins.

35
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:20,740
It's like once a year. So act fast. All right.

36
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:30,609
I want to make sure everyone's on the same page about the first assignment and your term project.

37
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,390
So the first assignment is on the screen.

38
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,740
Most of you have submitted it says 1159 is supposed to be 1159 last night.

39
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:44,470
But because it's vague, it can be 1159 tonight in case you are a last minute person.

40
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,720
So just have it posted by midnight tonight given it was a little vague.

41
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,600
Who is Amber Abraham? But she's still in the course.

42
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:02,500
I think I've seen her for a while. Okay. I'm not trying to out anyone, but for the people who you see your name.

43
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:08,890
So, Bridgette, she's been coming, so I think she's still on the course.

44
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,290
Mikayla, is that you? Yes. Okay. So you're aware you haven't posted?

45
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,660
Yes. Okay. And you'll do it by midnight tonight. Okay.

46
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,180
Not trying to embarrass you. Not tonight. Jacqueline, worry about that.

47
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:47,169
Is that Jacqui? How does this look like it's just going to be out of your control because I like, you know, Amy look just like she's been coming.

48
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:57,430
Amy, move. Anyone know Amy? It's like, okay, powers, I have the video.

49
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,760
It's like, okay, just. It's okay.

50
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:07,930
When do you want around the rankings? I'll tell you that in a minute, but it's coming.

51
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,860
I think there was Kalita. Yeah.

52
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,830
Are you aware that you haven't posted by midnight tonight? All right.

53
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,660
Just to make sure. Rita, she's not in the chorus anymore.

54
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:38,170
Oh, yeah, that's right. And the lead columns and let me move her.

55
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:45,930
She did withdraw. Like to shoot. Basically there's like a person who just.

56
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:51,160
Is this her? This is her, right, Rita?

57
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,140
Oh, yeah. Oh, okay.

58
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,920
Hold on. There's still one or two more. Helen. Yeah.

59
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:06,220
Yeah. I'll get it done by tonight. Okay. And that's it.

60
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,900
All right. So. So we're all on the same page.

61
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:16,000
Everyone by midnight tonight will submit their two videos between tonight and next Sunday night.

62
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:22,480
Reagan have the money? Well, you have to rank them, okay?

63
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,459
You have to rank that member. There's a score sheet. You score every video.

64
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,900
It's going to take time. All right. Each one is 60, 30 to 60 seconds.

65
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,380
So it's going to take you a good hour plus.

66
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:43,459
Then on Monday of next week, I will show you the ten that you hated the most,

67
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:48,790
the means you gave it the lowest score and sorry, the five you hated the most and the five you liked the most.

68
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:53,320
Okay, so I'm not going to show you all 50 videos.

69
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,720
I'm going to show you ten. Otherwise, it takes up an entire class.

70
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:02,950
Okay. So I can you know, you did it by next Sunday night.

71
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,490
It would be great because I can do it Monday morning.

72
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:12,219
All right. Or late Sunday. To be clear, the written assignment is due by midnight tonight.

73
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,500
Unless I tell you something different, if you have an extenuating circumstance, illness, stress, tell me.

74
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:22,059
And I'm happy to give you an extension if you have any legitimate reason.

75
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:30,330
But for vanilla students tonight by midnight is the due date for the little written document.

76
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:36,970
I'm going to grade it pass fail. So I hope that lowers your anxiety versus raising it.

77
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,920
All right. So either you get all credit or none. All right.

78
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:45,610
Any questions about assignment one? There will be fun next week.

79
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:53,380
It always works because usually guys uncover some really horrible ones or some really novel ones.

80
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:59,140
I hope we have a few from international agencies that anyone picks something not in English.

81
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,030
Good. It's in English, but Australia. Yeah, it's good.

82
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,690
And it's got together. Good luck.

83
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,190
All righty. Now I want to talk about your your term project.

84
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:17,850
I didn't see any shift in anyone. And I know, Kelly, we have to make sure you're somewhere.

85
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,160
Did anyone go in and change this? Yeah. Okay.

86
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,790
Is it reflected in this version? Yes. Just tell me what you did.

87
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,930
Just so I know we move from mental health.

88
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:34,970
Yeah. In adolescents. Yes. To vaping and adolescents.

89
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,130
Yeah. I had a I think it was empty.

90
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:47,410
Good. I'm happy. Vaping is really good because it has a lot of very interesting challenges because it is healthier than tobacco

91
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:53,350
cigarets but it's also horrible for you and leads to tobacco Cigarets It really isn't easy to message.

92
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,860
Tony I'm glad someone's tackling vaping. Did you move around?

93
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,400
I just added my name into the maternal number. Okay.

94
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,250
Say hi to your colleagues. I was here last week, so I didn't know that.

95
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:11,800
Yes. So even though I said four is the maximum of what group do you want to go to?

96
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:18,200
And you don't have to answer in public as long as you fill this out. I don't know.

97
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,770
But there's a way to do this.

98
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:28,000
You have to go into the announcements and the announcements have the link to this file.

99
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:34,840
Got it. Same. Kelly, did you early decide myself to exercise college age?

100
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:41,290
Uh huh. That would be you.

101
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:48,500
Yeah. Okay. Welcome to your say hi to your teammates. Former teammates, because I don't know if you know initials.

102
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,850
Okay. All right. This now. I won't get serious for a second.

103
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,380
Is there anyone besides Mikaela who is not in a group?

104
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,120
Because we did have a few undecideds. Okay.

105
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,920
So you'll do. You'll do it quietly on your own in the next 24 to 48.

106
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:16,120
My strong recommendation is you guys meet in the next week to start mapping out what you want to do.

107
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,250
You do not have to meet with me, but if you want to meet with me, I can give you ideas.

108
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,710
Okay. So usually as it says on the handout, it's usually a couple of videos.

109
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:33,730
A very basic website or maybe some text messages you have to decide given your population and your health issue.

110
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,839
What is the content you want to create? Typically there's video.

111
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:45,910
You can talk me out of it if course, saying I'm working in this very low tech developing economy that doesn't have access.

112
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:53,380
Sure, we'll make an exception, but the default is a couple of videos and something that's either web, SMS or app.

113
00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:01,660
If you're doing web or app, and that's something that has to be on your take up the technical capabilities, you can fake it.

114
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:06,400
You could use one of these power markup apps. I put some on the assignment.

115
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,850
There's a whole bunch of things you can download that make it look like an app.

116
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,510
Okay, even though it's just a series of screenshots in effect.

117
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,670
So if you're not skilled, programing wise, you could dummy up an app.

118
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,030
Okay, there's a whole bunch of really good software that's free out there to do that.

119
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:28,240
So please meet in the next week or two to start to map out what you want to do.

120
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:37,150
Then meeting with me is recommended, but if you really have your stuff together, you're welcome to go ahead and on your own.

121
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:46,780
Typically what we do is I come in at 830 and we give you guys about 20 minute chunks from 830 till about 10 to 10.

122
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:54,850
So basically you can assume, although I want you to reserve time from 830 to about quarter to ten on Mondays,

123
00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:00,280
I can meet with your groups but reserve it so we don't have two groups coming at the exact same time.

124
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:07,090
I will help you design conceptually what you want to do, and I'll review your scripts if you would like.

125
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:13,570
If you need equipment, it's less than it used to be, dude, or that we'll rent it for free.

126
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:17,470
I just send them an email saying, Yes, I know this student.

127
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:25,809
Give her the camera. So if you don't want to use your iPhone camera or you want more professional sound or lighting or editing software, tell me.

128
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:29,890
And the school does have really good resources up on North Campus.

129
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:34,870
That's the downside. You need a car to get up there or a bus.

130
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:42,280
All right. I want to make sure you're clear. I feel this is the go switch I have, basically giving you my blessing.

131
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,880
These groups are fine. You'll be the last one to join in and may be one of the three or four aren't here, aren't in,

132
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,200
will have to check with them, but basically go ahead and start meeting and planning.

133
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,590
And as you feel you need my input schedule with me. All right.

134
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:02,190
Don't shoot it in the last week because you want time to edit it.

135
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,490
You want time to clean it up. Of course, you technical, you can you can do it the night before.

136
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,560
But when students do it at the last minute, they end up not enjoying the process at all.

137
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:17,740
So try to think about doing it with two weeks to go or something like that would be a really smart time frame.

138
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:22,540
So you have plenty of time to edit it, make it attractive, and do your pre-testing.

139
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:29,320
Okay. The pre-testing is out is required.

140
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,530
It can be by Zoom. It could be, you know, completely remote.

141
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:42,160
But you do want to show your products to your audience, as it says in the written document.

142
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:48,700
If you can't find your exact audience. You may have to go a little bit broader.

143
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:58,870
So I'm hoping the Who's mental health and immigrant groups, whose aides and do you know immigrant groups are thinking about working with?

144
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,230
I think I'm going to take you to this group. Okay.

145
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,520
But I know this kind of thing. So you guys.

146
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,730
Oh, you want to stick with other lesson and you want to talk about?

147
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:18,220
I talked about it. So let's say you wanted for Korean immigrants, but you couldn't find enough.

148
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:23,649
You may have to change that. Okay. It's okay to pretest with your relatives.

149
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,639
So this has happened for the last 20 years. They needed someone who speaks a different language.

150
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:34,540
They went to Grandma. That's fine. So if you have to use a completely convenient sample, it can be your brother's.

151
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,049
Your. That happens. But you need five at least.

152
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:43,780
So you may have to be creative. All right. Now, I give you a little bit of a budget.

153
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,160
I still don't have an admin, but Jenny will get you your $50,

154
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,800
so all you have to do to use your production budget is email Jenny and just tell her what you need to buy.

155
00:18:53,860 --> 00:19:00,460
She can't give you cash, but if you want $50 for food because you're meeting to shoot, you want to pay $50 for props.

156
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:06,910
That's my present to you guys. Jenny will buy it for you, but she can't.

157
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,670
Don't. Don't buy it on your credit card and get reimbursed. Will take six weeks.

158
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,990
It's a pain. All right. Just have Jenny buy it.

159
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:21,510
All right. And if that doesn't work out, email me and I will put it on my cue card.

160
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,640
Jenny is very good at helping out. All right. Any questions about your big project?

161
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,210
I said this the first week.

162
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:39,400
My goal for you is to have this something you want on your resume, that you are so happy with it that you're going to show your first job interview.

163
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,910
Hey, look what I did when I was in Michigan. Okay?

164
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,270
If you're not proud enough to put in your resume, I want to see it.

165
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,050
Okay. Well, I really want you to be proud of what you're doing. All right?

166
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:58,270
I'm not seeing any questions. All right. I'm looking forward to seeing your videos.

167
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:11,659
Okay. So this unit actually turns out to be a lot of fun because either at the end of today or beginning of next week,

168
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:16,100
you're going to run a mini focus group, and I'm going to give you the skills necessary to do it.

169
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:23,030
So that's the culminating exercise here, but it's going to take us a full class to get to that.

170
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:32,000
And I'll give you an opportunity to practice open ended questions and reflective responses.

171
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:43,249
So formative research by now, you all know about it, but you may not think about it in this framework.

172
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:51,370
The way we think about it is there's three stages the formative research, the exploratory or what we sometimes call the tabula rasa phase.

173
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,940
I'm just what the commercial people sometimes say. I'm doing my diagnostic work.

174
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:00,200
You're finding out what are the determinants, what are the barriers, do they like this product?

175
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:07,460
How do they feel when they drive this car, eat this food, wear this shirt?

176
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:13,700
So when you really want to drill down into the experience of that service,

177
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:23,420
product or behavior, the next phase is pre-testing and draft messages and graphics.

178
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:27,890
And if it's a tailored intervention, you actually map out either what you're going to do.

179
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,310
Most of your fake tailoring, that's going to be basically PowerPoint tailoring.

180
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:39,530
But eventually for some of you who have mad skills, trying to make a real app and let them test the actual usability of the app,

181
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,790
and then finally, the one that is neglected but is so important is post implementation process,

182
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,560
formative research and sounds weird because formative sounds like it happens before,

183
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:56,870
but technically we considered still forming your intervention and this is critical.

184
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,909
The insight you'll get from this is gold.

185
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:07,819
And typically, as I'll talk about in about 15, 20 minutes, the post implementation process is divided into two groups responders and non-responders.

186
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:16,010
So people who lost weight, quit smoking, started wearing condoms, and people who completely were on impacted by the intervention.

187
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,309
Obviously, the last groups are harder to find because they generally have dropped out, but they're golden.

188
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:27,140
You really want to find out about your failures.

189
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,680
What happened was that on our end, your end is I think we could have done.

190
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:42,139
Now there's another type of formative research which technically fits an exploratory and that is using existing databases.

191
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:52,400
This is a wonderful way to do your formative research. There are existing, for example, commercial databases out there.

192
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,020
I'm going to show you one in about three weeks called PRISM. That is really cool.

193
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:04,190
So you could buy a PRISM report if you're creating a new product, smoking cessation product,

194
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,850
you could ask it to say, well, tell me about everything you know about people who quit smoking.

195
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,740
What music do they listen to? Where do they go on vacation? What colors do they like?

196
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,469
What music do they like? What sports teams do they watch?

197
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:25,220
And you could get this data and it's golden because now I know for my smoking cessation product,

198
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:32,270
what's the background music, what colors, where would it take place? What sports legend should I pay to be the spokesperson?

199
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,279
And you can get this from prison. It's very expensive.

200
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,669
I think it starts at $25,000 to like peek into their data.

201
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:48,980
But you should know, particularly if you're going to be in the world that is well funded, that you can buy your formative research, a lot of it.

202
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,790
Then there is a specific one called Health Styles that we'll talk about under audience definition.

203
00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:05,540
That is a government paid for private partnership with Porter Novelli, that does audience segmentation for health.

204
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,690
And you can download their data sets for the most part.

205
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:15,160
And so, for example, you want to know what personality attributes are associated with getting your cancer screening important.

206
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:19,640
A valid data set can answer that if you want to know how many times a year they go on vacation.

207
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,910
So it has some of the PRISM type consumer variables,

208
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:32,540
but not quite as purchasing Bayes PRISM tells you what they buy the health files on tells you more about their other health related attitudes.

209
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,910
But it's good to know, are people who smoke? Do they eat spicy food?

210
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:44,090
That's good to know, believe it or not. And those are the sort of questions that we're going to hopefully see the results.

211
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,410
Did you all get that link to do the segmentation survey? Okay.

212
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,170
Obviously, because some of you started it, I'm going to show you it will be the highlight of the semester.

213
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,240
I'm going to show you your audience segmentation.

214
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,880
I'm going to show you how in your group eating spicy food, foreign travel and owning your garden and related.

215
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,290
Okay. And I'll show you how to use that to do formative research.

216
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:13,940
So don't be shy. There's tremendous resources out there to start your formative research.

217
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,060
Even before you start your own de novo research.

218
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,890
There's some really great resources. Now there's some quantitative resources.

219
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:26,750
These are not quite as sort of funky, but these are the usual suspects.

220
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,839
How many of you have heard of Heinz? It's an amazing dataset.

221
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,990
20,000 people answer an hour questionnaire.

222
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:38,969
They give you their blood work. And because of that, we know all this amazing stuff about them.

223
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:43,780
Not so much psychological, although they have some, but like they don't have discrimination.

224
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:49,340
I'm very interested in discrimination and how that's not well done in these data sets.

225
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:54,000
Although I'm honored to be future has a little bit of it. So purpose is statewide.

226
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,070
That's done in collaboration with CDC. Michigan participates via best is every two years.

227
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:04,649
It is golden wire bias is the high school survey done across the entire country?

228
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:09,330
Almost every state participates and it gives you great behavioral data,

229
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:16,739
not great psychologic data monitoring features done it is are right here right down the street on Thomson and it's got an amazing

230
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:26,520
data set and there it's mostly drug related but it's got some very cool political and some social variables in there again.

231
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:32,579
So if you were doing a study of college teenage substance use and depression and you go into monitoring their future,

232
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:38,100
you could start to answer a lot of your initial question. So are African-American kids more or less likely to smoke?

233
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,130
But it turns out they're 50% less likely to smoke.

234
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:45,000
That's good to know. They're 70% less likely to vape. Who's the vapors?

235
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,920
Vaping is not a black thing, at least in the United States. It's very rare.

236
00:26:50,340 --> 00:27:00,090
You should know that. Monitor the future tells you that. And I'm a big believer in hence if you do cancer research NCI National Cancer

237
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:05,010
does every three or four years the hidden survey and it's very psychologic so

238
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,549
it asks them not just about their cancer attitudes and behavior and ask them

239
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,850
about their Internet consumption and ask them about their social networks.

240
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:23,430
It's golden. I always tell people there's a lot to be embarrassed about of being American, but our national surveillance data is really topnotch.

241
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:34,260
We really have very good national behavioral and psychological data that is generally available to you guys within a year or two.

242
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:40,140
So take advantage of this, I think for your projects, although you don't have to between these,

243
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,790
you're not going to pay for a prison molester, independently wealthy, but health styles and more important,

244
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:50,249
these data sets definitely I would, you know, peek around and if you meet with me, I can say, well,

245
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:59,070
given your question, I would really encourage you to go all of these you can download into SPSS or Excel.

246
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:09,739
Okay. Any questions about the sort of the ones you have to pay for or that are owned by someone versus the public data sets.

247
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,850
Any questions? Okay.

248
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:25,050
So I think you've had this before. But I still think it's worth reviewing the differences between qualitative and quantitative.

249
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:29,670
So, first of all, I'm going to jump to the bottom. You really you need both.

250
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,780
There are some things that quantitative do well and some things qualitative do well.

251
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:40,250
And when you're designing your intervention, General, you plan to do both types of formative research.

252
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:51,870
So let's start with what is qualitative get you. So qualitative data gets you the language and the narrative around something,

253
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,159
whereas quantitative data gives you the numbers around something, the confidence intervals.

254
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:01,229
The frequency is in general qualitative data.

255
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:08,040
It generates your hypothesis. You know, I was talking to these ten people and five of them mentioned they do it for this interesting reason.

256
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:13,130
Well, that then generates a survey question that you will test in the quantitative follow up.

257
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,750
So in general, there are exceptions.

258
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:24,720
The sequence is qualitative, generates the hypothesis and quantitative verifies it and puts confidence intervals around it.

259
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:31,770
There are times where quantitative happens first, but that would be the exception.

260
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,030
The major sort of classic differences, depth versus breadth.

261
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,070
Although if you're really good at survey development, you can have a pretty deep quantitative survey.

262
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:50,450
But in general, the beauty of qualitative is you can drill down into the person's experience and say, what did it feel like when you did that?

263
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:55,610
How do you feel when you see this message that are just harder to do in a survey?

264
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:05,860
The interpretation of qualitative data. Although we have created rigor around it by inter rater reliability,

265
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:14,260
it is still has a more subjective tone, although interpretation of objective data is still subjective.

266
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:20,860
So if you consider a p value point of six depending on your orientation, some of you say, well, it was borderline significant.

267
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,790
Well, that's true. And some of you are going to be really rigorous and say it's not significant.

268
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:30,790
So there's still a subjectivity around quantitative data, particularly around P values and things like that.

269
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:37,750
So I think maybe the most important distinction is the one that's here, which is right here,

270
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:46,570
that in qualitative data you're trying to figure out why does it happen in quantitative data, trying to quantify if it happens and among whom?

271
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:56,860
For Fidelity Assessment, which is a particular intervention related construct.

272
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,920
You want to know, did they do the intervention as I hope they would? Fidelity, in a qualitative sense, says, How well do they do it?

273
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:09,110
You will observe your facilitators or your counselors or the docs that you train,

274
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:13,490
and you'll rate them, although with a quantitative scale on their quality.

275
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:17,930
That's qualitative fidelity. And then there's quantitative fidelity.

276
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,360
What percent of the units that I put in the six session curriculum do they do okay?

277
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:32,470
So I want to take the three formative points, exploratory pretest and post.

278
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:39,010
I'm taking these three here and I'm putting around it the other stages of intervention development.

279
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,850
So you you have a sense of what the process is like.

280
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:51,910
So typically we would start with secondary data, particularly remember I showed you those either proprietary data sets or the free public ones.

281
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:58,359
And from that, if you're good at data analysis, you could start already to divide your audience into second thoughts.

282
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,679
We're going to have to do with the data that I'm taking from the survey that you're doing right now.

283
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,089
I'm going to make segments out of you.

284
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:13,030
There's going to be two or three given I've done this for 20 years, then it typically is beneficial to talk to opinion leaders.

285
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,600
You have to be careful not to overinterpret their expertize.

286
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:24,429
Just because someone works in the community doesn't mean they necessarily are giving you the right perspective,

287
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:27,100
but nonetheless, they still give you a valuable perspective.

288
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,400
Typically, increasingly, this is a very Barbara Israel thing and I mean it as a compliment.

289
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:37,690
She has really powerful use of steering committees and other similar boards.

290
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:42,040
I've watched her do it in the last few years and it's good.

291
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:51,430
It's another form of this in effect, but it's a very structured process that I think she works perfectly, so she has input from the get go.

292
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:57,580
And then typically we do our first focus group. So often we do this background prep work.

293
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:04,120
Okay, then you have to develop the messages and the materials, then we pretest them.

294
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:11,300
Now we'll talk about apps in particular and websites. So digital interventions have a particular aspect.

295
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,979
A commercial that you make doesn't have a usability assessment.

296
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:18,580
And we don't usually say, how hard was it to click on that YouTube link?

297
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,680
Although I guess that might be of some value.

298
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:31,360
But apps and websites, we do add this whole other dimension of usability, which we'll get to that typically you revise those messages.

299
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:39,430
If it's a video, you go back and reedit it, then you pilot it usually with depending on what your goal is,

300
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:47,650
10 to 20 people, revise it again, do it and then do the post process evaluation.

301
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,520
Almost never do people follow this order.

302
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:59,950
It's very interesting that most people have to skip several of these steps because of time and money to do this right.

303
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:10,420
It's six months sort of minimum and that's if you've got your staff and your ideas really well organized to do it slowly.

304
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:21,970
It's a year or two too. And so I hope when you start in your first jobs and you work in a health organization or for the government,

305
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:27,940
you try to do as much of this as possible. This is sort of an idealized version.

306
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:32,530
It's hard to do it exactly like this. And these have some redundancy.

307
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:37,659
So this is kind of an walk right here from here to here. But still, this is the normal process.

308
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:43,420
This is how it should play out. But in the real world, you're going to have to cut corners because of time and money.

309
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,450
I'm curious, some of you have actually had work experience, some of you over the summer.

310
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:53,680
You did because most of your second year, some of you worked before you came.

311
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,649
Did any of you ever develop an intervention?

312
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:04,390
And I'm curious, which of these stages were you able to use and which did you because of time and money have to cut?

313
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:14,590
So who has any experience designing an intervention or working as a team member designing an intervention anyway?

314
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,370
Almost a little of it, yeah. We definitely did the literature review.

315
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:26,350
Okay. And we already had a specific population, so we kind of skipped.

316
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,920
I feel like talking to opinion leaders and stuff like that. Yeah.

317
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,870
Attracted to the for the module. Yeah.

318
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:42,310
You know and it's very common that I don't find personally this has yielded that much but just enough, it's barely worth it.

319
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:46,150
It's like right on the margins. This is important.

320
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:52,000
And again, this could be doesn't have to be group focus groups, it can be individual, but this is absolutely essential.

321
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:02,110
So talking to your audience and finding out so I always like to use the example of now if you are trying to sell some of the BMW or Mercedes,

322
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:08,439
you want them to drive it. And I want you to tell me, what did it feel like now that you own a mercedes?

323
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,370
What do you feel like when you pull up in the parking lot at work? What is that like?

324
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,030
Or you have a particular a bag you sell.

325
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:26,080
Like, I'm not into fashion, as you can probably tell, but the Fendi bag or a Louis Vuitton, I want to know, what do you feel like when you walk in?

326
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:32,090
To a room and you have your. What is that like? That's the sort of thing that is absolutely gold.

327
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:37,400
And you find all these really weird things, like after people at fast food, they feel disgusting.

328
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,280
Okay. I like to know that as, as someone who does health communications, I that's good.

329
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:47,600
You've given me a leverage point that you feel disgusting after eating fast food.

330
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,709
My kids love Taco Bell, but they say afterwards they feel like killing themselves.

331
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,860
They're exaggerating, but there's a point there.

332
00:36:55,820 --> 00:37:03,170
So this idea and I'm being serious here of really getting to talk to the experience, what was it like for you to quit smoking?

333
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:07,200
How did you feel? What were the thoughts going through your head that first day?

334
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:13,790
How did you get through it? Yeah, you can make a survey about that, but that is best found through qualitative research.

335
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,370
So we have to not oversell qualitative research.

336
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:27,480
You don't use it to ever establish prevalence. Most people you should never have in a qualitative report.

337
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:37,280
Most people or the frequency of a behavior generally, unless you did a lot of it, you did like 100 interviews,

338
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:43,349
but if you just did 20 interviews, the word sort of most or frequent should not occur.

339
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:48,569
And because it's not meant for that, it's not meant to establish the confidence intervals around.

340
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:55,140
If you have to be careful in qualitative research not to generalize beyond the type of people you interviewed.

341
00:37:55,150 --> 00:38:03,510
So if you only interview 20 to 40 year olds, don't start telling about how it works for adolescents or how it works for middle aged folks.

342
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:08,730
And it's really easy to get caught into overgeneralization.

343
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:13,409
And my pet peeve is that so I hope if nothing else, you'll take this from that course.

344
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:21,719
Don't ever rely on the following. If we were to develop a group health education class that met at a time that was convenient for you,

345
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:26,850
that was free, that provided really good food and had an expert moderator, would you show up?

346
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:31,030
That is an absolutely useless exercise.

347
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:37,890
You get a blue sky golden response that has nothing to do with how they will react in the real world.

348
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:45,840
So if you can't show them that seminar, if you can't say, Here's our moderator, here's 5 minutes of your spiel, here's the food we're going to serve.

349
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,650
If you can't have them, taste it. And that's what quotes around it.

350
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,250
Don't ask about hypotheticals. Generally, they just tell you nothing.

351
00:38:54,540 --> 00:39:00,329
It has killed many products, like I told you. Coke Classic and new Coke.

352
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:06,480
New Coke did really well in focus groups and no one bought it, even though in the focus, oh, this is really good.

353
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:16,890
So it's very tempting to do this, but in general, it just doesn't tell you how the actual situation is going to play out.

354
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:24,330
So, you know, the primary ways we get our qualitative data, we either talk to groups of people or one on one.

355
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:31,709
Real quick, what are the reasons you would do a group versus one on one?

356
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:36,540
What are some of the reasons? And it can include the logistics.

357
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:45,609
But conceptually, why would you maybe prefer for some things group and for some things individual and it can include the practical aspect.

358
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:49,140
What what are some considerations?

359
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:59,180
Maybe like protecting privacy of individuals that we talk about on sensitive subjects

360
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:06,130
like okay folks may vary your answers based on sex and drugs and and hidden spanking,

361
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:11,420
corporal punishment and guns, all that stuff that lends itself to individual people are worried about disclosure.

362
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:15,260
Now, the group think, is that a reason to do or not to do focus groups?

363
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:27,360
Right. Good. What else? So you want to do focus groups if you care about interaction.

364
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:34,170
Okay. You care about watching people respond to competing opinions.

365
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:44,850
In general, I don't like them because I think this group think I'm going to add to what she just said.

366
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,270
There's other problems in focus groups of the dominant speaker.

367
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,510
There's other folks who are shy and don't want to express divergent beliefs because they don't want to be criticized.

368
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:01,380
There's other people who just like to fit in that suppresses the real data.

369
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,730
So in general, I don't those group dynamics are not why you're doing it.

370
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,300
I mean, if you're studying group dynamics, great. Create a group dynamic and study it.

371
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:13,440
But if you want to get each individual to contribute their most best data.

372
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:19,020
I prefer one on one interviews now. It adds a lot of time and cost.

373
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,710
You can do one focus group of 12 people in 2 hours.

374
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,120
Maybe you can interview four people in 2 hours. Okay.

375
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:38,890
Now I just want to touch on Parry data. It's going to come up later.

376
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:51,549
But parody, it is a term I think we coined it a few years back in an article that our data is when you collect data naturally in E health programs.

377
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:57,129
So websites you can count how many unique IP addresses logged into the website.

378
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:00,460
You could count a lot of events.

379
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:12,520
You could count on. Which containers did they click on? You can time how long they were on that box until they clicked on another you can for

380
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:19,270
apps count how often they open the app and how long did it last till they close the app.

381
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:24,400
You could count how many times that they respond to certain types of messages.

382
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:35,320
So what their data is generally is background collection of user data, and Google Analytics does it for free.

383
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,070
Does anyone ever has anyone ever looked at a Google Analytics for their website?

384
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:44,060
What is it report? Do you remember? Are reports like.

385
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:52,940
Yeah. And I think how many unique IP addresses maybe that you have to pay extra for now,

386
00:42:53,570 --> 00:43:00,620
but you can get all this really cool process data, which you could argue is quantitative, by the way.

387
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,890
So we so that's fine where you put it is up to you,

388
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:11,570
but it's used data that is naturally collected in websites and apps and other similar digital environments and it's really golden.

389
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:15,620
So from that we can create a dose and exposure variable. It's imperfect.

390
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:20,419
So we don't know if someone leaves their screen open for 2 hours and then their phone battery

391
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:25,280
runs out where they on that for 2 hours or with an hour for 30 seconds and just left it open.

392
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,090
So because of that, you have to come up with all these cutoff rules that the maximum will count is 20 minutes.

393
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:36,590
And it's not perfect, but it's pretty good stuff.

394
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:50,430
Okay. So I want to get into a little bit more depth some traps that qualitative data offers.

395
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:54,630
And I already talked about three big ones and I won't repeat them.

396
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:57,480
So first of all, this is one we didn't talk about.

397
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:11,130
If you're designing an intervention, why is it a [INAUDIBLE] idea for you to run the formative or pre-testing focus groups?

398
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:15,880
If you are running an intervention, you're the driver.

399
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:21,270
It's your foundation, it's your ground, it's your PhD dissertation.

400
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:27,840
Why? Ideally, now, in the real world, it happens all the time. But why ideally should you not run the formative research?

401
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:32,640
I don't like confirmation bias, maybe. Yeah, that's a very pithy way to say it.

402
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,310
You have hopes and expectations.

403
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:41,760
You have theories that you're trying to test and you have if they're if you're doing pretest, then you want them to like your thing.

404
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:47,600
You are not neutral when you're showing them your messages. You're not a scientist asking.

405
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:52,250
I'm really curious how they like it. You're actually a vested interest thing.

406
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,700
I really hope they like it. And that's a really strong bias.

407
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:03,180
And the same on the formative and you have theories. I think the reason people are doing this is because of discrimination.

408
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:09,030
I think they're doing this because of gender models and you have a very well-developed hypothesis.

409
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:17,550
You can't be tabula rasa. You are trying, as confirmation bias implies, to prove you're right.

410
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:24,720
So there's a whole bunch of reasons why you should not be doing your own formative research either at that first stage,

411
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:28,410
which is the tabula rasa stage or the pre-testing stage.

412
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:34,380
Because of those biases in practice, it happens all the time.

413
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:39,780
Doctoral students have no money. They will do their own formative work, their own pre-testing work,

414
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:47,820
and hopefully their advisors and their team helps them do what you can to limit that bias to try and keep it from being insidious.

415
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:59,750
Any questions and thoughts about that? About why it's risky and it can cloud you.

416
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:04,940
My first boss, he created a different type of bias. It's not in the textbooks.

417
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:09,710
It doesn't exist. But I still like it. He calls it wish bias, how you wish they answered.

418
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:13,910
And so that always stuck with me since my twenties that I had push buttons.

419
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:17,900
All right. I'm going to jump over the third one because we did the second one.

420
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:21,230
I touched on this, but I want to get into it for a second.

421
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:26,570
When you do qualitative research in focus groups a little bit, individual interviews were more in focus groups.

422
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:35,480
It is really common to take the loud, confident, highly verbally skilled person who overrepresented their comments in your report.

423
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:43,910
So if someone gives you this beautiful thing, well, I believe it's because of discrimination and structural racism and intersectionality.

424
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:47,630
And it's the connection between race and sex and gender.

425
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:56,360
You're got a generally way that I'm subconsciously more than someone who says that's just that's [INAUDIBLE].

426
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:06,290
It's because the people are [INAUDIBLE] racist and they may be equally valid, but you have a potential if you're not careful to say,

427
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:12,380
look at this really articulate, well-designed one and take that other one and your brain discount it.

428
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:19,160
And so we have to be very careful, as we said in the next poll, it don't confuse eloquence with validity.

429
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:27,469
Some of the best things we ever heard were from people who were not particularly articulate, but they still gave us their insight.

430
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:30,260
And your audience is going to be equally a mix.

431
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,020
But there's this tendency if someone gives you this perfect soundbite, Oh, I got the perfect quote for my report.

432
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:42,799
That's an ass backwards way of doing qualitative research, but it's really tempting.

433
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,830
I know I'm Captain Obvious here in a classroom, you would say?

434
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:50,300
Of course not. But in practice, we see it all the time. Kellyanne, is that a hand or an inch?

435
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:59,300
Okay. We touched on this and Michaela pointed it out very nicely that we unless we're studying group response,

436
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:06,649
that isn't usually too much of what we're trying to focus on that, oh, so-and-so got angry at so-and-so because they disagree.

437
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,990
That's generally unless we were studying.

438
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:15,890
How did divergence of opinions co-mingle in the marketplace, which is an interesting question, but that's generally not what we're doing this for.

439
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:27,290
Finally, and I think the single most important thing is enter your qualitative research with the assumption you're going to get a mixed signal.

440
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,810
They're not going to love or hate your app.

441
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:35,480
Four people are going to really like it, two are going to hate it, and six are going to be like, It's all right.

442
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:41,360
Yet there's a tendency to want to write your conclusions in a binary format.

443
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:49,850
They loved it or they hated it. And that's a very dangerous bias to try to oversimplify.

444
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,320
Oh, my hypothesis was completely confirmed or rejected. It's almost always going to be something in the middle.

445
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:59,480
Okay, so almost write your report saying there was a mix of opinions, right?

446
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:05,630
That before you collect your data. And if you have to remove it because it was it was completely clear and clean, fine.

447
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:11,720
But start your process assuming you're going to get embedded ambiguity.

448
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:17,959
All right. How many of you have ever gotten any in your coursework here?

449
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:22,790
Any discussion of how to do a focus group? Okay, good.

450
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:29,210
Because I'm going to give you more detail. Okay. So I've been doing them for a long time and we still do them.

451
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:33,950
And we still although we've changed a little bit of how we do them, still benefit from them.

452
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:39,079
So first of all, you want to train facilitator I'm going to give you some basic skills today and

453
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:42,950
next week about asking effective open questions and doing reflective responses.

454
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:51,590
I have always been shocked about some of these very high end moderator companies, these market research companies.

455
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:56,749
Their moderators are not that skilled. If we ask them, Do you do reflections in your focus groups?

456
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:00,190
They don't know if they do them or not. And do you ask this type of question?

457
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:00,739
They won't know.

458
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:13,190
I've been generally, except for one or two exceptions, not impressed with what you get when you pay these companies 15 $20,000 for one focus group.

459
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:17,270
On the other hand, you have to balance it with that bias issue.

460
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:22,610
So although I think you guys are going to have good skills after a week of this training, you're still going to be biased.

461
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:25,280
If you're doing it for your own research, you have to balance those two.

462
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:30,110
So generally of 8 to 12 homogeneous people in a group, homogeneous is important.

463
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:33,110
So for example, for studying smoking cessation,

464
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:40,459
I don't want quitters and smokers in the same room unless I want to study the process of the quitters telling those smokers,

465
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:45,110
Oh, it's easier than you think. And to watch the smokers respond to those messages.

466
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:51,649
But that's usually not why we do it. If I want to talk about smoking cessation, I want to have the smokers in a separate group.

467
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:53,660
And the non. And the quitters in a separate group.

468
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:02,159
If you're talking about condom use, I don't want non condom users and condom users in the same group unless I want to observe.

469
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:07,489
What does that look like when someone tries to persuade someone? Now.

470
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:15,980
Do you need homogeneity with regard to gender and race? We're going to talk about in a few minutes.

471
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:19,640
Very good question. Okay. We're going to hold off on it for a second.

472
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:23,490
So try to segment your focus groups.

473
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:31,760
And even if you're doing individual interviews, segment your sampling so that you have people who are a mix of doing it and not doing it,

474
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:35,150
people who are converted and unconverted, so to speak.

475
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:42,880
We're going to teach you two skills over the next week of open ended questions and good basic reflections.

476
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:47,140
Now, if, you know, motivational interviewing, because I know there's who is in basics, someone here with some basics.

477
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:50,899
Kelly, you're in basics to go away.

478
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:59,350
I took your with your class. Okay. That's right. Anyway, so we're not going to use the reflections like we used that in my in my museum to persuade.

479
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:04,640
So it sounds like you're you're really starting to want to lose weight.

480
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:09,100
It sounds like he's been fixing all these great benefits of quitting smoking in mind.

481
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:14,829
We're doing it strategically to encourage them to move in a certain path in qualitative research.

482
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:22,330
We're simply doing it to confirm, I hear you and I understand that that might be emotional for you, but we're not doing it to persuade.

483
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:30,940
So make sure throughout our discussion probably next week when we talk about reflections in focus groups or in qualitative interviewing,

484
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:36,780
we're not doing it to persuade. Okay. Yeah, I knew that.

485
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:42,570
They said, like in your research, you documented that you used that I would some people review that and maybe be hesitant.

486
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:45,930
Yeah, I would never use a I would never in qualitative reports that I use them.

487
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:50,940
Okay. So I would say I used reflective responses to affirm the participants beliefs.

488
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:57,959
You're right because my is a persuasive intervention. If I put that in a report, just your I'm agreeing with what your insight is.

489
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:02,670
Yes. You would now pissed off your client if I didn't tell you to persuade them.

490
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,670
All right. There's a joke in focus groups, but it's like I choose and feed them really well.

491
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:13,790
And when I was coming up, it was always Eminem.

492
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:17,010
For some reason, every focus group had lots of Eminem.

493
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,730
I don't know if they're still using Eminem, so they progressed to something fancier.

494
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:32,560
You want to videotape it because those clips audio is okay but videos gold and now it's wonderful what Zoom can do it has to be one of the small,

495
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:44,979
tiny silver linings to COVID is you can just just record so simply, but the video clips are much more powerful.

496
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:49,180
So if you're presenting it to the principal investigator or if you're doing this as contract work,

497
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:53,350
showing the actual clips is so much more powerful than a textual quote.

498
00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:01,250
All right. One of the roles is for every segment.

499
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,559
Let's say you did men and women. Let's say you did Hispanic and black. Let's say that HIV positive and HIV not positive.

500
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:14,660
Let's say you do quitters and smokers, whatever. The segmentation is usually down to less than two, and usually you go no more than four.

501
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:21,920
But of course there's a comma here or until saturation occurs and typically 2 to 4, it gets you to saturation.

502
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,840
And saturation simply means I'm not hearing enough new information that this is worth it.

503
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:30,260
Sure, there'll always be one or two more tidbits. Okay.

504
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:56,330
But is that enough to keep going? Probably not. So I want to talk about whether or not we need gender or sex or race homogeneity.

505
00:54:57,590 --> 00:55:01,220
So any thoughts? So let's talk first about the focus group environment.

506
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:06,080
Do we want black and white people in there together? Do we want men and women in there together?

507
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:11,090
Do we want straight and gay people in there together, etc., etc.

508
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:16,910
So the answer is I'll just help you with. It depends, but that's all I'm going to tell you.

509
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,660
So what do you think is the general guidance here?

510
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:29,600
Do we want different races, different genders, different political parties, different regions of the country?

511
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:40,150
Different heights, different weights? What's the guidance here?

512
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:47,320
So let me put up we have an answer. I would say it depends on what response you're looking to get from the firm to.

513
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:52,520
And it's your stroke, as we say in sports now. Yeah.

514
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:57,250
Uh, can I help you? Yeah.

515
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:03,430
I'm studying racial discrimination. Yeah. Do I want white and black people in the room together?

516
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,740
Why not? Not everybody.

517
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:14,920
They don't have experiences, or they do in such a different way that you have people who are trying to educate and and be worried about offending.

518
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:18,190
You don't want that dynamic unless you're studying that dynamic. Okay.

519
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:29,170
If I am studying gay marriage and whatever aspects I'm political, do I want gay and straight people in that room together?

520
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:40,330
Probably not. Okay. From studying sexual assault of men to women.

521
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:44,320
Do I want men and women in the room together? Probably not.

522
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:48,230
All right. So what is it? You think I've given you a few examples.

523
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:52,450
What is the common denominator? Why wouldn't we mix?

524
00:56:52,450 --> 00:57:07,780
Or when don't we mix? It seems like when the characteristic is relevant to the kinds of responses or experiences, right, when the identity matters.

525
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:14,160
So if you're studying something about identity, then in general we're tighter on homogeneity.

526
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:19,110
Now, if I want to ask, do you did you have a good experience?

527
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:23,690
You went to the Detroit Tigers game this year and I recruited people into the Tigers game.

528
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:27,420
Can I have black and white people in that focus group? Absolutely.

529
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:34,050
Okay. If I want to study, do you like the new design of the Ford Mustang?

530
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:39,659
Can I have men and women in that group together? You can argue no if you want to get into it, but probably.

531
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:44,450
Okay if I want to study. Do you like this new wrapper on the new candy bar?

532
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:47,550
Can I have Hispanic and black people in that room together?

533
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:58,230
Probably, yes. So in general, you have to ask, is identity a driver of response or is it the core topic?

534
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:01,380
And if so, homogeneous don't mix.

535
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:06,660
But for things that are not identity driven, it's fine to have a mix.

536
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:19,120
Okay. All right.

537
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:27,460
I want to move on to go through the three steps a little bit exploratory, the pre-testing and post implementation, just a little bit more depth.

538
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:37,870
So for exploratory focus groups, which is sometimes called tabula rasa, a blank slate, ideally not being led by the developer because of that bias,

539
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:43,750
you want to get into the description of the experience when the person does the

540
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:48,610
behavior or when they stop doing the behavior or if it's towards a political attitude.

541
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:54,550
Why do they think that way? How does it make them feel? The part I just want to add here is this.

542
00:58:58,090 --> 00:59:02,620
Particularly for those of you going to go on to do doctor work or going to academia.

543
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:07,299
Typically when we do our interviewing, we have theory that drives our question.

544
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:17,170
So we have a theory that racial identity protects you from discrimination, your specifically right questions around your theory.

545
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:21,309
So if you are based on self-determination theory, which we touched on up two weeks ago,

546
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:25,900
remember that you're going to have questions about autonomous versus controlled motivation.

547
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:31,510
If you're a social cognitive theory person, you're going to ask more about their efficacy and where do they get their efficacy.

548
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:37,890
So as you become more sophisticated in your sort of academic, theoretical perspectives,

549
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:47,620
it should show up in your focus group and individual interviewer scripts that you're specifically asked, questions that are based on theory.

550
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:55,709
So pre-testing is the step that is almost mandatory.

551
00:59:55,710 --> 01:00:03,690
It's very, very risky to develop something based on form research and then launch it without pre-testing.

552
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:07,050
And I say three or four examples where we really messed up.

553
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:11,180
Okay. Make sure I have those.

554
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:11,460
Yeah.

555
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:38,530
So one way to protest print video web based content is to do it in a laboratory approach, which is you bring people in and you say, watch this video.

556
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:48,620
What do you think? Okay. And it turns out that's a horrible way to test something, because in the real world,

557
01:00:49,610 --> 01:01:00,380
they're doing it on their back slightly drunk at 3 a.m. after a long day's work and the context of doing it in a clean,

558
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:07,160
you know, come into our lab, we're going to pay you dress up we're going to give you my names doesn't generalize

559
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:11,690
to 3 a.m. slightly drunk on your back in your bed on your little screen.

560
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:17,750
And so when you do your pre-testing, it is really important to contextualize that.

561
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:22,190
It's close to the actual way they will see it in the real world.

562
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:32,299
So some very expensive ways to do it. I'm not thinking you'll end up doing this, but I want you to know is it's sometimes called embedded pre-testing.

563
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:36,170
So what you do is you send people a link. Okay.

564
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:41,300
And you want to test 2/32 anti-smoking ads, right?

565
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:53,629
You might send them an hour long TV show with four commercial breaks and two of those commercial breaks have your two smoking videos.

566
01:01:53,630 --> 01:02:00,050
And to have car videos and you don't tell them, pay attention to the ads.

567
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:08,140
You say watch the 62nd, 60 minute clip and then afterwards you say, oh, what did you just watch?

568
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:13,070
And I'll tell you about you put it inside an episode of Saturday Night Live or something, right?

569
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:19,330
And you say, okay, what did you remember about the last hour? And then you say, By the way, did you notice any smoking ads?

570
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:28,190
And they say, No, not at all. So the power of embedded testing is it gets closer to the way they observe it in the real world.

571
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:36,829
Laboratory pre-testing is really risky because it's in pristine conditions with high attention in the real world.

572
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:39,830
You don't you you put a lot of effort into watching ads.

573
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:44,110
By definition, you're almost perfectly processing that. You're.

574
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:48,590
I am. I'm barely paying attention. Well, you want them to watch the ads in that mindset.

575
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:57,740
So what in vivo or embedded testing does is it lets you get a much more realistic exposure and therefore a much more realistic response.

576
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:11,679
So you can pretest in a group, so you can bring a focus group in or do a zoom focus group to say,

577
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:26,080
here's our here's our as we typically have them watch multiple versions of ads so that they're not just watching the one you want them to like.

578
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,740
So typically we have them watch someone else's as well.

579
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:34,750
So they don't know that this is the one you're trying to get a positive response for.

580
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:42,940
So typically, if you're going to pretest a spot harder with apps and websites, but if you're testing a specific chunk,

581
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:51,490
make sure they see something else as well, that it's not just reviewing yours because they'll know that you're hoping for a positive response.

582
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:55,150
And that's a very risky bias. All right.

583
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:06,690
So when you pretest, there's a variety of things you want to ask about and if anyone's interested, we have standard questionnaires around these.

584
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:15,870
So we usually create quantitative data, offer pre-testing, which may sound like a contradiction, but we ask about salience.

585
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:21,840
Salience is a great term. Now the average person won't think of the word, so you don't use that word.

586
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:25,229
How salient were these ads? But what's salience is trying to get into?

587
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:29,460
How much did this move you? How much did this persuade you? How much did you find this compelling?

588
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:35,309
And we typically get that by asking to rate how persuasive it was.

589
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:38,670
But also, what do you remember most about that ad?

590
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:49,530
What is the storyline of that ad? I mentioned this to you guys, and it's a really interesting dilemma for the Super Bowl ads,

591
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:56,159
which are the highlight of the marketing year, like all the agencies can't wait to see, why did you guys create them?

592
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:04,320
Number one problem with those ads is people remember the celebrity, the goofy hook, but they don't remember what the message was about the product.

593
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:09,570
Sometimes you make it too memorable to have something extraneous.

594
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:18,210
So we ask also about comprehension and complexity. Okay, complexity is more for things like how hard does it seem to do this?

595
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:23,190
So if we say we want you to register to vote, then we would talk about how complex did it seem?

596
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:27,089
We made that process. We ask a lot about personal relevance.

597
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:31,410
There's a variety of ways to ask it. Was this message written for someone like you?

598
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:36,900
Was this message written for someone like you in mind? Those are the ways we ask it.

599
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:44,190
There are many other ways, but that's how we ask it. And then particularly if we're talking about identity issues, gender, race.

600
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:49,990
Sex. We asked directly about offensiveness. Now it will generally come up already.

601
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:52,210
If you've really [INAUDIBLE] up, they'll tell you.

602
01:05:52,750 --> 01:06:01,570
But even if not, towards the end of the interview, we ask, Was there anything in here that you found stereotype being stereotypical or offensive?

603
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:07,930
And we will often get things there that they didn't offer because they were trying not to be mean.

604
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:13,830
They're trying to be nice. They didn't want to bring up race or sex or gender, and therefore you have to ask about it.

605
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:21,310
And you'll get from this question some very useful data that, yes, you probably did make some stereotypical assumptions.

606
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:28,810
Even though your heart's in the right place. So to clarify, we do this both qualitative and quantitative.

607
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:34,120
So usually we have them fill out surveys with these as Likert scales there to seven 0 to 10.

608
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:37,659
But if for whatever reason, that's not important to you, you're welcome.

609
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,900
Just to ask them how salient are moving? How moving was this?

610
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:52,950
And just discuss it without a027 0 to 10 ranking, as I mentioned, for apps and websites and games, there's a specific task of usability.

611
01:06:52,960 --> 01:07:00,880
Now there's a whole profession called UX, and I'm not going to say it's can be reduced to two bullets.

612
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:08,980
It's actually a whole science. But in general, if you're developing a website or an app or a game, you want to watch them use it.

613
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:15,820
You want to sit there over their shoulder or immediately after they're done and say, What was it like?

614
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,379
Was this engaging? Was this complicated? Do you wish there was a back button there?

615
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:22,840
Did you wish there was that power up button there?

616
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:29,020
And that is best done by actually have them play with it and then respond immediately to an interview.

617
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:39,730
All right. So I'm going to show you some pre-testing mistakes we made and hopefully you'll find this interesting.

618
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:46,389
My first project out of grad school was the Harlem Health Connection.

619
01:07:46,390 --> 01:07:49,510
We got a very large grant to reduce smoking in Harlem, New York.

620
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:56,649
That's 110 Street, about 145th Street at the time.

621
01:07:56,650 --> 01:08:04,420
It is predominantly black. It has changed. And we hired a African-American ad agency.

622
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:10,660
We had an almost all-Black scientific team, I other than myself and my buddy, and we [INAUDIBLE] up.

623
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:16,780
This was the original logo. Anyone want to guess why?

624
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:21,130
Thank goodness we protested this. What did in the audience like about this?

625
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:32,430
And we paid a lot of money for it. So there are a couple of things even no one wants to guess.

626
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:35,580
I don't want you to feel like I'm going to I'm not going to jump on your phone call. You racist.

627
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:40,770
Go ahead. I feel like the female figure is pretty overly voluptuous.

628
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:44,910
No reason she needed such prominent breasts.

629
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:49,740
Some of whom they don't use. Right.

630
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:55,800
So there's another problem with what kick it is. They don't think about this was kicking smoking out of Harlem.

631
01:08:56,130 --> 01:09:01,620
That was the goal, right? Exactly. What is kick it use for what?

632
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:06,360
What might it mean outside of the smoking realm? Because someone's kicking it.

633
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:10,080
Hey. Oh, yeah. Anyone else?

634
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:12,980
Yes. I think it's appropriate. Advertised as a light.

635
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:21,060
Like the stereotypes of, like, women, like sexualization of women, of, like, masculinity, and, like, encouraging them to smoke.

636
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:25,200
Make it more. Okay. Couple of things that they criticize.

637
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:29,490
Like it's not super clear that it's personal. Correct.

638
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:34,490
And you'll see how we try to fix it. This was supposed to be kicking tobacco out of Harlem.

639
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:39,690
It was supposed to be getting activism to get rid of smoking, billboards to make selling single,

640
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:46,890
single cigarets called loosies illegal, and for the communities to not allow menthol cigarets being promoted in the black community.

641
01:09:47,610 --> 01:09:50,700
Now also, he has what they felt were bellbottoms, so they were selling.

642
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:54,740
Why does the guy need bellbottom pants? That wasn't intentional. It's just an artistic mistake.

643
01:09:54,750 --> 01:10:00,840
I don't see it. Okay. No self-respecting brothers wearing bellbottoms at this point.

644
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:06,450
Okay. Someone else had their hand up as it was with the color scheme.

645
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:13,350
Yeah, exactly. So that is supposed to be. What do any African country come to mind?

646
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:17,930
You can see red and green. Does it ring a bell? That was supposed to be intentional.

647
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:24,810
Anything? Look at. Liberia.

648
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:28,380
Look at. Might be. Kenya is like three countries that have these cultures.

649
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:36,420
They were trying to be slick, didn't work. So this was we brought them in so they got to do better.

650
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:41,099
So they got rid of the voluptuous woman. They got rid of the bellbottoms.

651
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:44,850
And they clearly were kicking something out of Harlem.

652
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:48,200
But unfortunate they thought it was matches, not cigarets. Why?

653
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:57,310
What do you have against matches? Now the fancy shoe and the suit was very interesting.

654
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:03,460
There is this idea in socioeconomic tailoring that you always market one notch above.

655
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:09,940
So if someone, your audience earns 25,000, make your image as if you knew how someone earns 50,000.

656
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,990
Our artists intentionally said, I'm trying to do that.

657
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:19,250
I am punching up. Okay. Harlem at the time was not yet fully pushed out.

658
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:24,190
Now it's very expensive. Not all of it, but most of it. Not in 1991.

659
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:29,260
That wasn't the case. So this was punching up. But he punched up too high.

660
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:35,890
So we paid another round of focus groups. And they then it like this is a now we just doesn't resonate.

661
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:41,500
So we had to fire the guy and we brought in another guy and he came in.

662
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:47,010
He happened to be Nigerian. It doesn't affect too much other than we felt he got it better.

663
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:51,430
So you can see all the things to try to fix. And this is the one we went with.

664
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:56,150
They didn't love this one, but then hate it. So there are a couple of things he did really well.

665
01:11:56,170 --> 01:12:01,870
What is the green stripe on the cigaret butt communicating? Very subtle, but very important.

666
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:08,110
80% of African-Americans smoke menthol. It's the black cigaret.

667
01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:11,980
So that green strike is a very subtle cue.

668
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:17,380
Notice the business. The Wall Street guy was replaced by Nike guy.

669
01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:22,000
Okay. And the suit was replaced by jeans.

670
01:12:22,930 --> 01:12:28,210
Now, it's pretty gender neutral, although most people think that's a man, which wasn't our intent.

671
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:34,660
But we had run out of time and money. So this was like six months to get this.

672
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:38,560
Now, my message to you is how humbling it was for us.

673
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:46,960
These predominantly black staff, black artists, marketing firm, still came up with something the audience didn't like.

674
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:50,350
And it took three rounds to get it right. All right.

675
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:59,650
So hopefully it will remind you how important it is to don't assume you know what your audience likes, even if you live there, so to speak.

676
01:13:00,430 --> 01:13:03,700
Any questions or comments about our humbling experience? This is all true.

677
01:13:03,730 --> 01:13:07,700
That was number one. Number two, this is actually number six.

678
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,810
Honestly, there was a gap in between them, but this is where we landed.

679
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:15,340
Any thoughts? Questions. All right.

680
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:28,360
So that project also had a video, and then we did a subsequent project around fruits and vegetables and that had a video.

681
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:31,910
I'm going to show you the rough cut of the video.

682
01:13:31,930 --> 01:13:36,550
Now, this one, I'm not going to say it's triggering, but there's a huge [INAUDIBLE] up in here.

683
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:39,840
Okay. And thank God we pre tested it.

684
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:49,150
And to see if you figure it out, it's kind of obvious. So this is meant for black churches in Atlanta in what we call the eat for life.

685
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:58,520
That's Emory where I used to be. I don't want to turn the lights off.

686
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:06,090
Do you want the dark one? A darker. No, there ain't no baby.

687
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:12,280
It's a little slow. This was to get people to eat more fruits and vegetables through black churches.

688
01:14:31,520 --> 01:15:19,450
And. Steven Chu.

689
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:23,260
Well, you guys hurry up before you make us like a jerk.

690
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:28,170
Anyone recognize her? You didn't watch The Jeffersons, did you?

691
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:40,220
Good morning to you. Great.

692
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:44,300
Great. Bravo. You ready?

693
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:47,910
20 minutes to. You still want to be here? Let's have a moment.

694
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:52,589
Hey. Hey. Yeah, fine, baby.

695
01:15:52,590 --> 01:16:02,820
Kind of gave you this boy. Yes.

696
01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:08,180
What did you. Did you notice anything there?

697
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:12,240
Very subtle. I should forget something.

698
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:18,040
That's better. What? A banana.

699
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:28,830
I was going to say. All right.

700
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:37,440
So there's two things we have to change. This is supposed to be a positive promotion of healthy eating and African American black turkeys.

701
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:42,810
Anyone want to guess the two mistakes that were picked up by the testing?

702
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:51,050
When you made this. But that kid is way too young to be sitting in a friend's, okay?

703
01:16:52,880 --> 01:17:00,350
And neither kid is wearing a seatbelt. And Marla Gibbs, who we got through.

704
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:05,030
A friend of a friend. These are two kids who went to Morehouse where filmmakers made this.

705
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:09,439
And luckily someone's cousin was related to him. So she did it for her, the free.

706
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:16,550
But they didn't like it. But there was another scene that people hate. It is very quick clip and it had to be pulled.

707
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:24,320
Does anyone remember the women farming? What do you think it evoked in some people?

708
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:29,300
We showed this to about 20 people, about a little vague memory, but I think about half hated it.

709
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,350
Why? What did it trigger?

710
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:40,530
What did it remind them of? Yeah, it was meant to be empowering.

711
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:44,399
So the two African-American filmmakers,

712
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:52,830
highly educated young men and his girlfriend at the time were trying to make an inspirational video about self-reliance in the black community.

713
01:17:52,830 --> 01:18:01,470
We take care of our own. We handled our 40 acres, you know, productively, but it got executed poorly.

714
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:11,639
We had to remove that scene, and that cost us about $20,000 because that was the most expensive single minute in the whole thing,

715
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:19,320
because they brought a whole crew down to a farm in southern Georgia and brought four cast members with us.

716
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:26,190
And we cut it out. But we're happy because we have a role.

717
01:18:26,190 --> 01:18:28,440
And if you want to use this, I think you'll be in good stead.

718
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:41,490
If 5% or more of your pre-testing audience find something offensive, remove it you can tolerate if one or two people hate it.

719
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:47,639
But this was not one or two people were like, you know, after one person said, Oh, please be an outlier, please just be you.

720
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:51,690
And then another and another. So 5% is a good rule of offensiveness.

721
01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:56,610
Okay? So you can tolerate a little bit, but getting over 5%.

722
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:03,090
And the reason is it's not just that you might if 5% is such a terrible thing like that, one out of 20, they may tell people.

723
01:19:03,450 --> 01:19:08,130
So they may say those Emory people are [INAUDIBLE] racist, like don't don't go to their program.

724
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:13,950
So you can't afford that negative energy around the project, even if it's only one or two people anyway.

725
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:17,850
So that was another humbling experience of us pre-testing.

726
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:25,140
So we reshot it with that scene and not with that re-edited.

727
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:29,220
We didn't reshoot it. It's too expensive. So it happened again.

728
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:37,830
So I have been working now for the last five years and we call our mental health initiative Middle Eastern, North African.

729
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:52,800
We have the largest and most concentrated population of Muslim and Chaldean Americans in the Dearborn and Troy and other parts of the metro area,

730
01:19:53,520 --> 01:20:02,579
and we've been working with them. It's been a wonderful experience and one of the things they asked for was a smoking cessation project in Arabic.

731
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:07,049
So we did one and it took us two years and we did a lot of work to get the messages right.

732
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:11,760
We launched it around Ramadan. You're already not smoking sunup to sundown.

733
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:15,149
Why not continue after eat and just continue not smoking?

734
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:22,920
It's a really nice message. So our first version, I couldn't find it, so you're going to have to take my word for it.

735
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:28,860
Had a little apostrophe here and if you put an apostrophe there anywhere, speak Arabic.

736
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:33,780
Okay? If you put in a pastor there, it's Allah Quinn.

737
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:38,700
Which means God, stop it, not get up and quit.

738
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:46,770
So that little apostrophe which we removed changed the message we don't get Yalla means that get up, come on, get up and quit.

739
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:50,670
Which is a really good message. But unfortunately, with an apostrophe there, it's God, stop it.

740
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:57,660
So luckily we caught it right before we launched our website and our text messaging program.

741
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:03,959
And again, we had Arabic speaking consultants and team members and one of them caught it,

742
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:09,600
but it took him about four or five times till they actually noticed it because he does not looking for that.

743
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,380
So again, best of intentions, multicultural team,

744
01:21:14,190 --> 01:21:21,930
you got to make sure you pretest anyway so that's we went just from that to that and saved us a pretty big embarrassment.

745
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:31,300
And this is actually what it looks like. It's a pretty cool thing. We had to learn how to go right to left with our tax, our first for our program.

746
01:21:31,310 --> 01:21:35,960
I said, I don't think we can do that in our software and it turns out you can do it.

747
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:39,830
So we're now equipped to handle right to left languages.

748
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:46,850
All right. Any questions about pre-testing?

749
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:52,100
I hope with those three embarrassing examples, I have convinced you why,

750
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:56,750
no matter how much your heart is in the right place, you can still [INAUDIBLE] up.

751
01:21:58,370 --> 01:22:01,910
All right. Let's talk about the third one, which is post implementation.

752
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:06,439
I've already given you most of what you need. I just want to review it so we get it again.

753
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:10,320
And these are the types of questions we ask. Okay.

754
01:22:10,370 --> 01:22:13,880
Like, what was your reaction to the intervention? Okay.

755
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:24,900
Purposeful sampling. We'll get into a little bit more as we do our practice.

756
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:31,170
But this this idea of successes and failures, users and non-users are talked to separately.

757
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:36,479
I to talk about this. I maybe should move this slide up earlier.

758
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:40,620
But this is the power of data that you typically can get for things like Google Analytics.

759
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:58,680
All right. So what I want to do is there's some more content I want to get to,

760
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:05,879
but I want to give you some raw skills and I just want to talk about two for today,

761
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:13,380
for the most part is effective questions and selective use of reflections, although different than mine.

762
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:20,219
So let's start with the good questions. Let's start with the basic premise of what is the difference when open and a closed question.

763
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:24,420
This I know you've already got. So what's an example of a closed and an open question?

764
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:31,850
Give us one of each. How close would be?

765
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:37,550
Do you, um. Do you like the Red Wings? Okay.

766
01:23:37,770 --> 01:23:41,900
And what would be an open version would be how do you think the Red Wings played last season?

767
01:23:42,110 --> 01:23:45,340
Right. If you wanted it to be exactly parallel to.

768
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:49,010
Do you like the Red Wings? What are your thoughts about the Red Wings or what's your favorite team?

769
01:23:49,790 --> 01:23:52,910
I'll give you the classic distinction is, are you very depressed today?

770
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:56,300
Closed. How are you feeling today? Open. Okay.

771
01:23:57,050 --> 01:24:06,170
The essence is closed. Questions create a binary response framework that you're encouraging the person to say yes or no.

772
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:14,780
Now, sometimes that's what you need and we'll get into a few minutes, but it's pretty rare that all you care about is yes or no.

773
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:20,000
Now, keep in mind, most closed ended questions will get you more than a yes no.

774
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:24,450
So there is a myth that just because they're structured yes no, that's how people answer.

775
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:35,430
Most people do not answer yes. No questions with the smile, however, you still get better, more rich, deeper narrative from open questions.

776
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:40,610
So we want to use questions to elicit someone's story, memory and formative research.

777
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:44,300
We're interested in experience, not occurrence, and that's very important.

778
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:47,550
So if we're interested in occurrence, have you ever used our product?

779
01:24:47,570 --> 01:24:52,480
Sure. Ask a closed ended question. But if you want to know, how did you feel when you used our product?

780
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:55,910
You really want to ask that open ended. Okay.

781
01:24:57,530 --> 01:25:00,890
Everything on the left guarantees an open question, so take a look.

782
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:14,490
Everything on the right guarantees a closed question. Did you will you can you is it okay?

783
01:25:15,870 --> 01:25:18,989
Now, I want to pay attention to these three kickers.

784
01:25:18,990 --> 01:25:27,420
So this is something that I want you to leave this class forever installing into your repertoire, if any, if ever, if at all.

785
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:33,270
Why do we use those kickers, if any, if ever, if at all?

786
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,990
There's a very intentional message, you remember.

787
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:41,370
Yeah, it's to make sure if they don't have anything, that's okay. They don't feel correct.

788
01:25:41,730 --> 01:25:44,910
I'll just put some different words around it. We're normalizing. Never.

789
01:25:44,910 --> 01:25:49,890
Not at all. Making them feel that's in the range of normal.

790
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:57,120
What do we mean? So watch this. Right. When do you exercise?

791
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:02,060
What is the subtle bias in that question? Everyone does.

792
01:26:02,430 --> 01:26:09,360
Yeah. Or I'm expecting you to not give me zero. But if someone is completely sedentary, how do they feel?

793
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:12,570
If I ask how often or when do you exercise?

794
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:25,319
How do they feel perhaps emotionally about their zero? This they feel they're somehow bad, they're somehow a failure and they may feel discouraged.

795
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:30,840
I'm telling you their story. So a very subtle fix is just to ask it like this.

796
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:36,500
It's a very nice way to communicate.

797
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:42,020
The range of expected response is broader than you might think.

798
01:26:42,950 --> 01:26:48,800
How do you lower your stress? What is the assumption? Now let's assume you know they're stressed, so don't get hung up on that.

799
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:55,610
They filled out a stress questionnaire. They're really stressed. What's still an assumption in this question that we could to fix?

800
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:02,680
What's the assumption of how do you lower your stress that you're stressed?

801
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:06,880
Now, we heard that's true, but there's another assumption inside of that, Isabelle,

802
01:27:07,090 --> 01:27:11,550
that they can lower the stress or that they do they're doing something to lower their stress.

803
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:15,730
That's implicit in the question. So simple to fix that is this.

804
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:23,550
You got it. Or this that the same thing.

805
01:27:25,530 --> 01:27:29,090
How much? I'm going to skip this one because this is from our particular project.

806
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:36,030
How much support you get to eat healthier? What is the assumption of that?

807
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:40,580
By asking how much? It's sort of not including zero.

808
01:27:40,590 --> 01:27:45,420
So how do you fix that someone? Do you get support?

809
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:53,280
So that's closed. So use an open one using one of these little kickers.

810
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:59,320
How much if. Yeah. There you go. Thank you.

811
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:05,150
Okay, let's do a couple more.

812
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:11,200
Got up. You're going to see the answer. Okay. When do you use drugs?

813
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:19,420
Do you see how there's a little bit of assumption in there that could particularly if you're not using be a little weird.

814
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:24,820
Okay. When do you steal from plum market?

815
01:28:24,970 --> 01:28:28,930
That's a little odd question. All right.

816
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:37,420
Let's get someone else to try this. Kira, um, I want to say thank you.

817
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:42,520
Thank you. When did you last try to get clean?

818
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:50,860
Let's see. Um, Caitlin Murphy.

819
01:28:52,150 --> 01:29:00,640
She's not. Yeah, that's my daughter, right? That's good. Hannah when, if ever, try to get perfect.

820
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:04,310
Okay. Excellent.

821
01:29:04,330 --> 01:29:12,670
So the point of this is you have some little techniques you could do, if any, if ever, if at all, that allows your questions to be more inclusive.

822
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:20,020
The other technique that is a cousin of that is what we call the goalpost question.

823
01:29:20,950 --> 01:29:25,540
And it is golden. And it's one of these things you will be able to use the rest of your career.

824
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:33,490
We don't do it for very simple surface questions, like, did you have breakfast this morning?

825
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:39,580
But for complex, controversial, socially charged topics,

826
01:29:40,090 --> 01:29:45,250
we recommend the goalpost and let me demonstrate it twice and then we'll see if you guys can come up with one.

827
01:29:46,090 --> 01:29:53,050
Now, I'm not assuming that these topics are controversial for you, but I'm saying across America, these are controversial topics.

828
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:59,590
So if you did not know someone really well and you didn't know their political beliefs and you wanted to know what are your thoughts on gay marriage?

829
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:04,180
We would recommend you ask it with the long form goalpost and it goes like this.

830
01:30:04,180 --> 01:30:08,499
Some people feel gay marriage is horrible for society.

831
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:11,770
It's an abomination, as it says a lot of it, because society should stop it.

832
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:15,190
Other people feel, no, it's a completely normal part of human sexuality.

833
01:30:15,190 --> 01:30:19,990
It's how people are born. We must protect that natural identity and all their rights.

834
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:24,040
What are your thoughts? Okay, let's do another one.

835
01:30:25,450 --> 01:30:30,969
We could ask what are your thoughts on abortion? But we wouldn't ask it that way if we didn't know the audience.

836
01:30:30,970 --> 01:30:35,020
We would say, some people feel that abortion is murder. It's killing innocent children.

837
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:37,060
The society must stop it entirely.

838
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:45,490
Other people feel no abortion as a medical procedure or should be left up to a woman and her loved ones so she can decide when and how she reproduces.

839
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:51,220
What are your thoughts on that? What is it trying to accomplish?

840
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:57,960
What is the goal that the goal posts? Question. Positivity.

841
01:30:58,030 --> 01:31:01,390
Like, I like some people. So I guess like.

842
01:31:02,350 --> 01:31:05,590
I know that may be a polarizing issue.

843
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:13,570
Yeah. So inclusive is, I think a really good term for just like if any if at all, are trying to insert zero as an option.

844
01:31:13,570 --> 01:31:18,490
This is in effect doing the same thing. It's normalizing everything from there to there.

845
01:31:19,150 --> 01:31:23,320
That's why the two polls are pretty strongly opposite.

846
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:28,030
Okay. Now some people feel it's dangerous because you're giving them new reasons.

847
01:31:28,030 --> 01:31:35,320
I didn't know Leviticus called it an abomination. Thank you. Okay, so some people are worried that it's leading and it could be.

848
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:45,040
But more often than not, what it does is it communicates to the interviewee that they shouldn't be scared to express their true opinion.

849
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:48,819
And in focus groups and in qualitative research, that's like the golden rule.

850
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:52,000
If you've inhibited their response, you've blown it.

851
01:31:52,900 --> 01:32:02,200
And these questions are really good at saying That's normal, that's fine, but doesn't mean I approve, doesn't mean they're right.

852
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:06,220
But a lot of people see that. And it's almost like Donald Trump does that a lot.

853
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:12,040
A lot of people are saying and it's actually a really smart rhetorical question because,

854
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:16,090
yeah, there are a lot of people agreeing with him, like because we don't know what a lot is.

855
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:23,110
So there's at least a thousand people agreeing with them. So he can say a lot of people and it's a brilliant rhetorical device, even if it's sleazy.

856
01:32:23,980 --> 01:32:28,600
Okay, now let's think of in health. Where might we use this goalpost question?

857
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:34,960
Where in an interview? What type of health behavior might you want to use this for?

858
01:32:44,410 --> 01:32:52,560
Trying to get everyone. Sophia.

859
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:58,960
Very. Ah, I guess you could use it for a while. Okay.

860
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:06,760
To make healthy food think some people think the fast food. For your health.

861
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:10,900
But if you eat in moderation, some people think that it is okay.

862
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:18,040
So the question is fast food sensitive enough like abortion and gay rights stuff?

863
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:22,330
Does it need that extra coddling and kid gloves?

864
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:25,610
No, I guess not. Maybe. I mean, I'll give you an example.

865
01:33:25,630 --> 01:33:29,250
Maybe parents are ashamed that they let their kids eat McDonald's.

866
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:32,770
So I'm not saying clearly. No, but it's that's the bar.

867
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:40,270
You have to get over and see it for really controversial topics that kind of open up the discussion.

868
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:44,140
Yeah. Can you come up with one? I was thinking, like.

869
01:33:47,510 --> 01:33:52,400
Other countries. I mean how we use this time is like the spell maybe previous.

870
01:33:53,230 --> 01:34:00,920
Like I really like to really push back on his awareness. I would say like some head believes that this was the cause that his mother to believe this.

871
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:04,760
But now with new science, this is what we believe could be a cause of autism.

872
01:34:05,060 --> 01:34:08,360
That's more of a persuasive that is not a neutral question.

873
01:34:08,360 --> 01:34:13,250
So it's a very good persuasive technique. But it's not this. Okay, this is a neutral fact finding.

874
01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:18,130
Could you use it for coding? Yes. So that's a go ahead.

875
01:34:18,170 --> 01:34:22,190
So that's a perfect example. You have to do the whole thing. Oh, you just volunteer yourself.

876
01:34:23,030 --> 01:34:37,459
Some people feel some people feel that they have the personal choice of whether they should get vaccinated or not based on their personal

877
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:44,760
autonomy in the government and others feel like vaccination should be an automatic thing to do again to protect those around you.

878
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:49,149
Okay. Should someone I was going to say investigation.

879
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:52,280
Yes. Another example, again, it's a very delicate topic.

880
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:57,080
And some of you might have refused to ask it. It might be physical punishment of children.

881
01:34:57,770 --> 01:35:04,700
Okay. If you wanted to know and you're a pediatrician or whatever and you wanted to know, what is that family do?

882
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:07,150
You might want to use it. So how would that sound?

883
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:14,660
I know it's an icky topic, but how would you might want to ask it using this approach around corporal punishment or physical punishment?

884
01:35:20,830 --> 01:35:29,050
It's tough. So some families are completely against ever spanking or hitting a child for discipline.

885
01:35:29,950 --> 01:35:36,280
Others feel no. That can be a very effective way to shape their behavior and they use it strategically.

886
01:35:36,490 --> 01:35:43,020
What are your thoughts? Okay. So sometimes it's issues that you are not neutral on.

887
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:46,770
Okay. I don't think you guys are neutral on gay marriage. I don't think you're neutral on abortion.

888
01:35:47,370 --> 01:35:56,280
So it's not about you. It's about how to present this to your interviewee so they're willing to be open and honest with you.

889
01:35:56,310 --> 01:35:59,730
Now, the way the goalposts are set up here, it's two points.

890
01:35:59,730 --> 01:36:05,070
Sort of strong. Yes, strong. No. Right. But there's actually another strategy which uses three.

891
01:36:05,790 --> 01:36:11,549
And it can be something like this, you know, and I'm now a pediatrician interviewing a 14 year old patient.

892
01:36:11,550 --> 01:36:17,310
You ready? Some of my patients around their age don't touch drugs at all.

893
01:36:17,310 --> 01:36:22,139
They don't drink. They don't smoke weed. Some are really into trying as much as they can.

894
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:28,030
They try ecstasy, they try opiates, and they really want to have experience with every drug possible.

895
01:36:28,050 --> 01:36:31,260
Somewhere like in the middle, they might drink a little and smoke a little weed.

896
01:36:31,710 --> 01:36:40,080
What's it like for you? Okay, that has three points, a little more non medium and a lot.

897
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:45,780
So I hope you can see how it's trying to communicate to the interviewee.

898
01:36:46,350 --> 01:36:49,560
You're not going to freak me out, okay? I just want the truth.

899
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:56,550
I can handle the truth. If you know that famous scene with Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise, you haven't thought.

900
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:03,290
So where else could we use the long form, either the 2.0 or the three point?

901
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:08,010
Where else? Let's try and get some other.

902
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:14,260
Yeah, but you still use it for good. To gauge just where, let's say your patients.

903
01:37:16,230 --> 01:37:20,670
I wrote this. Can you use it basically to gauge how much they can do to change their behavior?

904
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:25,700
So ask it. Let's see how it sounds. So like let's go back to the first book.

905
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:32,339
Yeah. Looks like some people don't have that food available to them or do not have the finances to seek out healthier options.

906
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:41,760
And so some people have the option but may not have knowledge on what's best for the nutrition or something like that.

907
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:44,460
Yeah, so this is a good question. I'll ask what I asked.

908
01:37:44,490 --> 01:37:49,440
I think Sofia, is that delicate enough that I can't just ask what makes it hard or easy for me?

909
01:37:49,470 --> 01:37:53,700
Fruits and vegetables. Does it need that extra kid gloves?

910
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:58,950
Because I think that sometimes there are parents who don't have the option to give their kids something healthier.

911
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:01,030
But they wish they could, but they wish they shouldn't.

912
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:06,900
So if you feel structural barriers are delicate and other, and you might end up blaming the victim.

913
01:38:07,170 --> 01:38:10,710
Sure. Absolutely. Yeah. Maybe.

914
01:38:10,770 --> 01:38:14,130
Maybe breastfeeding could be one. Let's hear it. And it's funny because that.

915
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:17,940
Have you taken, like, training before? Because that's the one we were going to get to.

916
01:38:18,030 --> 01:38:23,640
No. Yeah. So let me just give you a hint. The breastfeeding one works best with three.

917
01:38:23,910 --> 01:38:33,750
Yeah. Okay. So some some women choose to breastfeed because they feel it's more nutritious or child free or that

918
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:38,880
some women choose not to breastfeed because it's more convenience and it's more flexible for them.

919
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:44,110
And some women choose after the baby is born with intentions of.

920
01:38:45,370 --> 01:38:49,270
Give formula because it's not working out for them. Not really good.

921
01:38:49,630 --> 01:38:54,210
So here's how we do it. That was very good. Some women are going to breastfeed.

922
01:38:54,610 --> 01:38:57,550
Not at all. From the day they get the baby, they're going to be in the bottle.

923
01:38:58,150 --> 01:39:02,440
Some are going to breastfeed for a while, 3 to 6 months, and some go as long as two years.

924
01:39:02,450 --> 01:39:08,560
So that's our three points. Yours were fine, but it is a very good one because it is definitely a charged issue.

925
01:39:09,340 --> 01:39:15,340
I don't know if any of you might not have kids yet, but having gone through that, even from the male perspective,

926
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:20,700
it's a it's delicate to ask because there's a bias that you should and not all women want to name.

927
01:39:20,710 --> 01:39:25,270
So that's a very good example. Anyone else think of any other two or three point questions?

928
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:29,620
They're actually hundreds of them, potentially. So. Anything else?

929
01:39:29,620 --> 01:39:37,389
Anything to do with sex? Okay. If you want to talk to a patient, some of my patients have are not having sex at all.

930
01:39:37,390 --> 01:39:43,660
Some have one or two dedicated partners and some are out there having a lot of partners.

931
01:39:44,260 --> 01:39:47,770
That's a nice way to communicate. You're not going to freak me out.

932
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:52,629
Okay, so anyone else think of sex, drugs that those.

933
01:39:52,630 --> 01:39:59,210
What else? Nathan, go ahead.

934
01:39:59,390 --> 01:40:03,290
I was thinking, like, condom use. Yeah, it's a good one.

935
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:06,620
Now, do you want two points or three? Probably. All right, let's hear it.

936
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:14,870
I agree. So some folks feel like Congress should always be used to contracting sexual acts.

937
01:40:15,770 --> 01:40:20,810
Others feel that they use condoms, sometimes not use them.

938
01:40:21,020 --> 01:40:25,760
Not at all. Perfect. That's. It really is a really classic three pointer.

939
01:40:27,050 --> 01:40:31,460
There's never. Yes. Selectively or always.

940
01:40:31,910 --> 01:40:32,810
Good. All right.

941
01:40:35,150 --> 01:40:43,070
So now I want to teach you a counterintuitive way to view closed questions, which I hope when you're done, will start to feel intuitive.

942
01:40:44,150 --> 01:40:51,500
You have been told and we have told people for years closed, any questions are bad and you should do open questions, not pose.

943
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:54,800
That is simply not true. It's a mistake. We were wrong.

944
01:40:55,340 --> 01:41:00,830
There are three types of closed ended questions. One type is discouraged.

945
01:41:01,550 --> 01:41:12,360
This. It is not the closed end bidness.

946
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:21,210
That's the problem. What's the problem with these questions? Amy, what's the problem with these?

947
01:41:21,220 --> 01:41:27,710
How do they make you feel when you read them? No, it's not here.

948
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:34,170
All right, someone else.

949
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:41,400
Bridget, you do this one. They make you feel uncomfortable, I guess.

950
01:41:41,730 --> 01:41:45,930
Yeah, it's accusatory. They're accusatory, they're obnoxious.

951
01:41:46,590 --> 01:41:50,670
They're revolting. This is what gave us any questions about me.

952
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:57,809
Okay. It is more of the tone and the assumptions than the actual yes.

953
01:41:57,810 --> 01:42:05,800
No miss of it. And let me prove that point to you. These are called closed preferred.

954
01:42:12,370 --> 01:42:17,050
Yes, it is like the previous one.

955
01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:26,409
Yeah. I guess. Is there a way to, like, objectively observe that it was like, God, you know, you try to, for example, if you watch a lot of TV,

956
01:42:26,410 --> 01:42:35,950
like I don't necessarily find that people think other people were either it was around a certain like or survey that they had done.

957
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:45,640
I think like, you know, that it was like nothing as wide as. Yes, most of these we have tested and we know they don't work.

958
01:42:46,420 --> 01:42:50,860
And there's better ways to ask, how much TV do you watch compared to other people?

959
01:42:50,860 --> 01:42:54,520
Would you say you watch? More or less. They're about the same. There's better ways to ask it.

960
01:42:56,080 --> 01:43:00,220
All right. These are closed preferred. I want us before we take our break to figure it out.

961
01:43:00,670 --> 01:43:05,200
We want you to use closed ended questions in these circumstances.

962
01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:09,970
But we have to figure out what is it that makes these best closed?

963
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:30,310
Trying to get someone who who hasn't spoken up, not that you're going to volunteer, but I can't tell who you are because your mask made them.

964
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:37,950
Uh, you know, you're Zapata. All right, I guess these questions are just not assuming things.

965
01:43:38,130 --> 01:43:42,510
You're like, they're really asking about something.

966
01:43:42,670 --> 01:43:45,960
Okay, good. So I'm going to help you.

967
01:43:46,710 --> 01:43:54,480
You're right. One of the reasons these meet the criteria is they are asking about the occurrence of something, not the perception.

968
01:43:55,290 --> 01:44:00,060
They're asking about the occurrence, not the perception. That's one of the three things we have to get.

969
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:09,710
There's two other things about this we have to get. Notice something?

970
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:13,760
I'm going to help you. We ask here. Did you vote in last year's election?

971
01:44:14,570 --> 01:44:18,820
What about. Are you a voter? Is that a good, close question?

972
01:44:18,830 --> 01:44:22,040
Are you a voter? Now, why?

973
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:26,530
What is different between are you a voter? And did you vote in last year's election?

974
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:38,700
This should be closed ended. Are you a voter? Should not be. Why Sarah McCain?

975
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:46,709
Well, it's subjective and it's not a single event.

976
01:44:46,710 --> 01:44:51,870
So those are two things. It has to be the occurrence and has to be one time.

977
01:44:53,430 --> 01:44:57,600
Or it has to be a binary phenomena. Is there a TV in your child's room is not an occurrence.

978
01:44:57,930 --> 01:45:06,090
It's the existence. Okay, so we don't ask going forward, are you going to vote?

979
01:45:06,270 --> 01:45:10,230
That's a terrible close question. Why is that? We would not recommend are you going to vote?

980
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:16,050
And the reason is intention is not binary. Intention is gray.

981
01:45:16,290 --> 01:45:20,999
Well, it depends if it's raining out. No, if. And I'm in Atlanta, Georgia, and they can't give out water.

982
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:31,020
I'm not going to go depends of the candidate is if it's by then everything going forward is not binary we consider everything going forward great.

983
01:45:32,010 --> 01:45:35,129
But if it's already happened, then you can ask if there's any question.

984
01:45:35,130 --> 01:45:39,390
But it only is relevant to a single event. Okay.

985
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:51,770
So if we understand it has to be a binary phenomena, has to be an occurrence and it has to have happened already, then closed, then it is better.

986
01:45:51,780 --> 01:45:57,700
Now, let me prove a point to you before you take your break. Did you take the garbage out, honey, this morning?

987
01:45:57,710 --> 01:46:04,610
Did you take the garbage out, honey, this morning? Make that open ended and make it better than the closed ended version.

988
01:46:04,610 --> 01:46:07,610
Go ahead. Make that open ended and make it better.

989
01:46:11,870 --> 01:46:20,800
Again, someone who hasn't spoken up. Kalita that you.

990
01:46:21,070 --> 01:46:24,780
Yeah. Okay, make that and it's a trick question.

991
01:46:24,790 --> 01:46:29,050
Make that better by making it open ended. Did you take out the garbage, dear, this morning.

992
01:46:35,020 --> 01:46:39,670
The correct answer is I can't. Okay. So that was a very manipulative, cruel thing to do to her.

993
01:46:40,450 --> 01:46:48,430
You could try you could say, honey, what is the status of the green container that was at the top of the driveway this morning?

994
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:53,860
What, if anything, did you do to move the green container? You can technically.

995
01:46:54,190 --> 01:46:59,070
But my point is and this is serious, this is more efficient for a single binary event.

996
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:04,630
Now, who takes out the garbage in your household? That probably should be open.

997
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:11,500
But did you take it down this morning? Should be closed. Single pass binary events are best ask to close the questions.

998
01:47:12,310 --> 01:47:16,060
That is not how you were trained. You were trained that open is better than closed.

999
01:47:16,070 --> 01:47:20,670
Well, turns out it depends what you're asking, Miss McNally.

1000
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:24,340
Oh. So, like, for example, did you vote in last year's election?

1001
01:47:24,370 --> 01:47:29,169
Question I see that as being useful for like setting a standard of figuring out, right.

1002
01:47:29,170 --> 01:47:37,720
So if you want to quantify frequency. Yeah, but outside of that, I'm still having trouble figuring out how else would I want to use this information.

1003
01:47:38,110 --> 01:47:43,659
We never use clothes for emotions. We don't use it for intentions, which is most of what we do.

1004
01:47:43,660 --> 01:47:50,830
We don't use it for experiences. It's really only the occurrence. So this is in terms of 100% of the real estate of questioning, it's like 2%.

1005
01:47:51,700 --> 01:47:56,829
It is a very rare. But my point is it's not the closeness that is the problem.

1006
01:47:56,830 --> 01:48:01,960
It's the tone. And the thing you're asking about that determines the question.

1007
01:48:02,410 --> 01:48:08,410
So what I want you to leave this class with is, yes, open ended questions are generally preferred, but there are exceptions.

1008
01:48:08,410 --> 01:48:12,790
There are times when closed is better. They are not inherently evil.

1009
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:19,270
Okay, now here comes the last one before your break. It's this in-between category of benign.

1010
01:48:19,270 --> 01:48:22,660
Why do you think we call this benign? Closed? Anyone want to guess?

1011
01:48:23,980 --> 01:48:34,560
I think everyone has spoken up by now, but. What is the thing going on here?

1012
01:48:34,590 --> 01:48:42,480
Are these good, bad or. It depends. Answer it with binary answer.

1013
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:49,230
Right. So let me elaborate on what you said. These function is open ended.

1014
01:48:49,770 --> 01:48:52,950
The computer biblical rules would call these closed.

1015
01:48:53,490 --> 01:48:56,490
But in practice, they're open. So if I with empathy, that's the key.

1016
01:48:56,490 --> 01:49:02,190
The tone has to be right. Hey, it's win. When are things any better with your parents at home?

1017
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:07,650
You're going to get more than a yes no, because I'm empathetic and it's an evocative question.

1018
01:49:08,430 --> 01:49:14,190
All right. So almost all of these, if the tone is right, are actually going to function open.

1019
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:17,939
This is important because you're going to do a lot of mistakes.

1020
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:22,169
If you start interviewing, you're going to make a lot of clothes into questions you didn't intend.

1021
01:49:22,170 --> 01:49:26,639
As long as they're in this range, you're fine. Now, all of these could be opened up.

1022
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:31,170
So I'm going to give you, are you still having problems with X?

1023
01:49:31,830 --> 01:49:36,540
Open that up. It can be opened up. My point is it's probably not worried enough to worry about.

1024
01:49:37,110 --> 01:49:40,889
So go ahead, make that open ended because it can be improved slightly.

1025
01:49:40,890 --> 01:49:58,640
It's a marginal benefit. Helen.

1026
01:50:03,510 --> 01:50:09,709
And in fact, I'll make it easier for you. Pick any of these and open them up. I guess for that.

1027
01:50:09,710 --> 01:50:15,620
How did doing that still clause make it open?

1028
01:50:16,590 --> 01:50:20,670
Start with the word. How. How is that?

1029
01:50:22,340 --> 01:50:26,150
Yeah, it's that simple. The point is the marginal benefit isn't worth you worrying about.

1030
01:50:26,540 --> 01:50:32,270
So sure, you could ask these all open ended. So you could say, how do you feel about talking to me now?

1031
01:50:32,630 --> 01:50:36,950
However, how often are things any different at home? How often are you feeling any differently?

1032
01:50:36,950 --> 01:50:43,730
Since we last met, all these could be opened up, but the impact of that on the quality of the response is going to be marginal.

1033
01:50:44,060 --> 01:50:49,760
So what? We want you to leave this class not worrying about these as a problem.

1034
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:54,980
These are fine. These are completely innocuous, benign, closed ended questions.

1035
01:50:55,760 --> 01:51:12,330
Okay, take your break. Come back in 10 minutes. I feel like I know this is like.

1036
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:30,820
He had to fight for 11 years.

1037
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:47,140
Whether. I didn't know it was one of those words, but I think it's changed a little bit.

1038
01:51:52,950 --> 01:51:56,309
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1039
01:51:56,310 --> 01:52:03,990
But yeah, I think. Yeah, I think there's a lot of hard work that's going on.

1040
01:52:03,990 --> 01:52:06,569
I know. I want to get out of this university.

1041
01:52:06,570 --> 01:52:16,320
I think Michigan took off and, you know, it was a pretty much once, you know, like my friends, when they get older,

1042
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:28,590
you know, they don't know anyone in our society that has come into the party that I didn't know.

1043
01:52:28,890 --> 01:52:33,350
Well, I don't think I don't think, you know, if anything, I think you find your best.

1044
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:43,880
Never, ever, ever, ever.

1045
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:55,000
I don't agree with that, which has been something that I didn't know.

1046
01:52:56,260 --> 01:53:06,940
And I feel like if you really don't ask, I'm sorry, but so far, we haven't heard anything on this.

1047
01:53:07,930 --> 01:53:13,930
All right. We're going to talk about something like that.

1048
01:53:14,030 --> 01:53:18,590
I love that. Who are you? We're not.

1049
01:53:18,610 --> 01:53:28,890
I'm. I know it's really important.

1050
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:36,490
If it wasn't, I would do. I would do it.

1051
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:42,640
I want to do everything right now.

1052
01:53:42,790 --> 01:53:53,890
Really important business. This. Yeah.

1053
01:53:59,450 --> 01:54:05,120
Yes. What do you do for a living, Joe?

1054
01:54:05,860 --> 01:54:16,600
Yesterday I got out of your life.

1055
01:54:16,620 --> 01:54:21,720
I think it's better. Bad. I'm worried about, like.

1056
01:54:22,110 --> 01:54:25,260
How do you like it? I don't know.

1057
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:30,770
Rather than I do. I do.

1058
01:54:30,930 --> 01:54:36,190
Yeah. You know, I mean, do that.

1059
01:54:37,150 --> 01:54:41,390
Yeah. Yeah.

1060
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:46,080
I don't know. I don't know. I know.

1061
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:53,190
What are we looking at? Yeah. Yeah, I'm thinking ahead of time.

1062
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:59,190
You have to. It's. There's right next to the syllabus topic for all their first semester.

1063
01:54:59,190 --> 01:55:02,590
I usually like after the lecture is slightly changed.

1064
01:55:03,090 --> 01:55:08,220
There's a version. Right. Right. Yeah. I put it next year there.

1065
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:14,190
Okay. Yeah. Just like just do it a little bit. And then the book, you get it online?

1066
01:55:14,220 --> 01:55:17,840
Yeah, the pink one. You can just download. I feel like that I'm libraries.

1067
01:55:18,330 --> 01:55:22,770
No, it's actually from the NCI website, so there's a link to it if you can't find it.

1068
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:26,010
Yeah. Email me and I'll send you a screenshot of where to click.

1069
01:55:26,160 --> 01:55:30,580
Okay. You also have a hard copy in my office. I saw the hard copy you're going to probably have.

1070
01:55:30,630 --> 01:55:35,360
You know, I don't think it's still out there.

1071
01:55:35,790 --> 01:55:40,140
You guys ready? And then the syllabus.

1072
01:55:40,930 --> 01:55:45,540
Yeah. So it's really, really good.

1073
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:50,010
I guess this is all my questions. Are you on the part of a group for the project?

1074
01:55:50,190 --> 01:55:56,069
I was there for the other Asian countries, which I don't know if that was the Turkmenistan.

1075
01:55:56,070 --> 01:55:59,670
So it's not your HS.

1076
01:55:59,910 --> 01:56:04,410
Yeah, but there's also another way, of course, is I think there's a consensus.

1077
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:08,180
Okay, where do you belong? I really miss me here.

1078
01:56:08,610 --> 01:56:12,240
Okay. So I was previously spoken about. Oh, yeah.

1079
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:18,300
So looks like you have. You are heard of her?

1080
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:28,200
Only perfect. Oh, Anna Snyder. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1081
01:56:28,290 --> 01:56:33,330
Oh, yeah. That's good. I don't go and do it. Yeah, I don't like.

1082
01:56:34,940 --> 01:56:39,170
I know what I did like with the guy.

1083
01:56:40,250 --> 01:56:43,900
Yeah, yeah. That and the other guys.

1084
01:56:43,910 --> 01:56:47,400
Who are you?

1085
01:56:49,460 --> 01:56:52,540
I'm getting everybody. I get excited.

1086
01:56:53,150 --> 01:56:59,560
I love. I'm going to play.

1087
01:57:00,470 --> 01:57:07,870
You know, there's still a lot of drama in programs that.

1088
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:16,000
Yeah, it's a real live action. Yeah.

1089
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:28,640
Yeah. And I was like, Oh, my God, why not just shoot the whole thing in terms of, like, my analysis?

1090
01:57:29,660 --> 01:57:39,750
Are you ready to of this marriage? I want to go underground.

1091
01:57:39,830 --> 01:57:50,600
All this kind of like starting like that and like a lot I feel like, you know, so I didn't I think, oh, yeah.

1092
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:58,840
I don't think anyone writers, I'm sure that they would be worthy.

1093
01:58:02,390 --> 01:58:05,870
Yeah, I was kind of annoyed that announced last year. I was like, Oh.

1094
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:10,640
I'm feeling really tired here.

1095
01:58:10,940 --> 01:58:14,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1096
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:19,630
It's tough as well.

1097
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:25,610
Yeah, I like. I think that's what my.

1098
01:58:27,130 --> 01:58:42,220
I saved my life. I mean, I was really, really close in my class.

1099
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:50,710
I watched the film. It's like how I look after my whole life.

1100
01:58:50,990 --> 01:58:56,800
And that is so that's what I really want to try to do.

1101
01:58:57,860 --> 01:59:02,360
I know he's only 94. Yeah, yeah.

1102
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:08,230
I know. Yeah, we do think that.

1103
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:12,290
I don't know.

1104
01:59:13,820 --> 01:59:19,390
I just. Yeah, I was. I don't know.

1105
01:59:22,070 --> 01:59:34,690
Yeah. Yeah, I was usually for years, cause, I mean, they're doing so much, and it's not the kind of thing that I have always done.

1106
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:47,720
I think. Well, that's what the chances are.

1107
01:59:48,530 --> 01:59:53,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah. They turned the minority.

1108
01:59:56,550 --> 02:00:02,720
There. Is there a crisis?

1109
02:00:07,580 --> 02:00:10,920
I don't know.

1110
02:00:11,350 --> 02:00:15,880
But I mean, I think that's a really good point.

1111
02:00:18,550 --> 02:00:23,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1112
02:00:24,370 --> 02:00:28,300
Right. And then I think what I would say as well.

1113
02:00:29,050 --> 02:00:33,110
Hello? Knocking on your door. Second floor window. Yeah, I know.

1114
02:00:33,190 --> 02:00:38,280
That sounds good. Yeah. Yeah. So the dairy industry.

1115
02:00:41,030 --> 02:00:46,970
You learned that from her in six months. She was great.

1116
02:00:56,630 --> 02:01:06,570
What you tell her is pretty good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1117
02:01:08,790 --> 02:01:16,000
I'm hoping. Yeah.

1118
02:01:16,550 --> 02:01:21,260
I like to be. I don't like her this week.

1119
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:26,580
I can't do right now. But do you mind if I ask?

1120
02:01:28,350 --> 02:01:32,360
Five 3536.

1121
02:01:36,120 --> 02:01:40,600
Yeah. You see, why don't you stay and I'll see you then.

1122
02:01:42,460 --> 02:01:47,580
Oh, yeah. But it's not like that.

1123
02:01:48,610 --> 02:02:00,259
Yeah, I pretty much just like you reckon. And I never thought they were going to be like.

1124
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:11,410
You're already suspicious specialist in this area.

1125
02:02:13,070 --> 02:02:19,490
I think I'm going to have to decide that.

1126
02:02:19,570 --> 02:02:23,320
Like like everything like that. We've been. I've been.

1127
02:02:24,350 --> 02:02:35,230
It's like. Useful because I can actually figure out if they got.

1128
02:02:38,460 --> 02:02:45,090
Some people tell me I was angry and how exactly.

1129
02:02:46,690 --> 02:02:56,480
Yeah. Yeah. You've got to get out of bed later.

1130
02:02:59,820 --> 02:03:10,680
I don't know. So, yeah, I.

1131
02:03:12,160 --> 02:03:20,010
That. I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1132
02:03:20,030 --> 02:03:23,970
So. Yeah, I believe. Yeah. Yeah.

1133
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:29,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I. I know.

1134
02:03:29,860 --> 02:03:34,280
I was wondering about really everything about you.

1135
02:03:34,290 --> 02:03:40,700
You were talking about something like that.

1136
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:46,200
Yeah, exactly. Do like. I just know.

1137
02:03:47,370 --> 02:03:54,930
Privatization. I didn't know if that would have worked.

1138
02:03:56,130 --> 02:04:03,180
All right. I think we're going to start. Yeah, I got.

1139
02:04:11,850 --> 02:04:20,130
Now. I kind of. It's crazy how they react.

1140
02:04:20,380 --> 02:04:32,250
Yeah. So here you can see I'm just about all right, guys.

1141
02:04:33,370 --> 02:04:46,410
I think that this is a system that is pretty good for us in high definition environments.

1142
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:55,330
Right? Right. That's right.

1143
02:04:58,020 --> 02:05:11,250
I would say that's the one that the closest one really is this one game really caught up.

1144
02:05:12,780 --> 02:05:18,480
All right. So let's keep going along some interviewing skills.

1145
02:05:18,820 --> 02:05:24,420
Give me some nice little tricks to have in your arsenal.

1146
02:05:24,420 --> 02:05:32,340
Typical day. So if you want to introduce a topic that you want them to know, I just want your life experience.

1147
02:05:32,370 --> 02:05:37,370
Don't feel embarrassed. Tell me about a typical day of you of exercise. The full day of you and your diabetes.

1148
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:42,780
Typical day about you and your thoughts about life.

1149
02:05:43,230 --> 02:05:49,230
It's just a nice way to elicit narrative that is not intimidating compared to is very good.

1150
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:57,329
If someone says I'm really struggling, my drinking's out of control, you may want to say,

1151
02:05:57,330 --> 02:06:00,330
Well, how does that compare to yourself six months ago or a year ago?

1152
02:06:00,450 --> 02:06:07,819
It's a very nice way to get at sort of the relative meaning of where they are, 0 to 10, 0 to 100.

1153
02:06:07,820 --> 02:06:11,730
Does anyone want to think of how you could use that? There's almost infinite application of that.

1154
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:15,360
Give us an example to 0 to 10, 0 to 100 question.

1155
02:06:21,030 --> 02:06:25,820
I like, like classic paint skills. Yeah. What else could use it for?

1156
02:06:27,590 --> 02:06:30,820
If you did your own magic. I had a Landrover on a scale of 0 to 10.

1157
02:06:30,830 --> 02:06:34,370
How dare you to quit smoking? Yeah. Zero. Not at all. Ten certain.

1158
02:06:34,970 --> 02:06:38,830
How confident are you? How important is this? How happy are you?

1159
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:42,170
How much do you like your MPH degree? You can use it for almost anything.

1160
02:06:42,620 --> 02:06:50,149
Just a couple of rules we'd like to include. 0 to 10, not 1 to 10, because we feel zero tells you more than one, if you know what I mean.

1161
02:06:50,150 --> 02:06:53,660
Yes, one is the lowest number, but zero gives you all. It's really zero.

1162
02:06:54,380 --> 02:06:59,270
Okay. Number two, we usually define the polls with zero being blank and ten being blank.

1163
02:06:59,780 --> 02:07:07,380
Okay. Couple of things about interviewing.

1164
02:07:07,770 --> 02:07:12,750
If you're talking to someone who is, for example, quitting smoking or trying to reduce their drug use or trying to exercise,

1165
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:18,940
you know, really good question is tell me about some days that have gone well for you, some days that have gone poorly for you.

1166
02:07:18,980 --> 02:07:23,240
What what is different about the days that go well for you in the days that you struggle?

1167
02:07:23,250 --> 02:07:26,160
It's a really nice, powerful question for general interviewing.

1168
02:07:28,530 --> 02:07:34,920
And I spend a few minutes, I'm going to give you a bunch of prompts of pretty bad questions that all have at least one major flaw,

1169
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:40,170
and then you guys fix them. So who wants to go first?

1170
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:43,380
Have you always been this big? What?

1171
02:07:49,470 --> 02:07:56,670
Catherine. It's like, how has your body changed over the years?

1172
02:07:56,710 --> 02:08:00,730
Good. So I'm just going to add a little bit compared to.

1173
02:08:00,750 --> 02:08:05,250
Which is kind of what you use. So how does your weight today compare to your weight six months ago?

1174
02:08:05,250 --> 02:08:10,890
A year ago? It's a really nice way to ask about weight status or what do you think about your current weight?

1175
02:08:11,130 --> 02:08:19,410
Do you take your blood pressure medication every day? You know how often, if at all, do you take your blood sugar?

1176
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:24,179
Now I skip this. Now I have to go back. I forgot to teach you this, but for medication we asked.

1177
02:08:24,180 --> 02:08:28,140
Doses missed and then we don't want to guess why. Reframing in the negative.

1178
02:08:28,680 --> 02:08:33,870
How many doses, if any, do you miss in a typical week? Why do we ask it in a negatively framed version?

1179
02:08:38,540 --> 02:08:42,510
What's the matter message. What's the trying to communicate to that.

1180
02:08:42,980 --> 02:08:46,840
Yeah. I think it's a good case in their version kind of.

1181
02:08:46,850 --> 02:08:52,910
Yeah. What else is there trying to communicate? Not to make them feel bad about missing.

1182
02:08:53,090 --> 02:08:56,540
Yeah. It's normalizing in non perfect adherence.

1183
02:08:57,440 --> 02:09:04,250
Okay. So therefore for this, how would you ask it? Yours was fine, but you didn't know about the negative rate.

1184
02:09:08,980 --> 02:09:20,740
How many doses? Go ahead. Come on. How many doses of your blood pressure medicine, if any, do you miss in a typical week?

1185
02:09:20,980 --> 02:09:24,430
That's how we would ask it. Okay. Do you see how it's a little bit better?

1186
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:32,970
When do you take it? Every day. Do you understand your kidney disease?

1187
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:43,650
Let's make that better. Do you understand your kidney disease?

1188
02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:50,910
Questions right now. Yeah.

1189
02:09:51,230 --> 02:09:55,430
Now that's closed ended. But it might be that closed that we're okay with.

1190
02:09:56,510 --> 02:10:01,190
So you could ask it close or you could ask it in the open form if you want to take a look when.

1191
02:10:02,120 --> 02:10:05,590
Okay. But you could say, do you have any questions? That's fine.

1192
02:10:05,600 --> 02:10:11,000
That is the type of closed that is. Okay, this is the opened up version of that.

1193
02:10:11,270 --> 02:10:15,620
Okay. Let's do the next one. All right. You proud of the changes you've made so far?

1194
02:10:21,060 --> 02:10:24,690
Now, just so you know, Marc, my class, this is coded not as a question.

1195
02:10:25,830 --> 02:10:30,510
It's coded as unsolicited advice. It's actually telling them.

1196
02:10:31,770 --> 02:10:41,160
With that in mind, converted to an open question. Delaney.

1197
02:10:42,240 --> 02:10:48,170
I don't know if the cells are close, but I was thinking on a scale of zero, how can you have the changes that would work?

1198
02:10:48,180 --> 02:10:53,180
That is open? Anyone else? Yeah, I feel.

1199
02:10:55,410 --> 02:10:58,750
Yeah. You got it. Very good. Both are fine.

1200
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:07,390
Are you ready to get vaccinated? Finally. How ready are you guys?

1201
02:11:08,290 --> 02:11:12,430
Now, this one also lends itself to the long form. So we did it already.

1202
02:11:13,120 --> 02:11:19,800
Some people feel the vaccines are really unsafe, were created too quickly and are just to make money for the farm industry.

1203
02:11:19,810 --> 02:11:25,270
Other people feel now they've been proven to be safe, they're effective, and that's our best way out of COVID.

1204
02:11:26,140 --> 02:11:32,070
Okay. Will your husband help you get your vaccine?

1205
02:11:38,300 --> 02:11:48,010
Make that open ended. Take your vaccine.

1206
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:52,010
Right. Or if you specifically wanted to ask for help at all.

1207
02:11:52,610 --> 02:11:55,850
Do you expect your husband to your sons go to both of those would get you there?

1208
02:11:56,360 --> 02:12:00,830
Have you learned anything from seeing all those unvaccinated people fall ill and die?

1209
02:12:01,850 --> 02:12:05,350
Is that a question or something else?

1210
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:09,290
Is that a question? Unsolicited advice. It's horrible persuasion.

1211
02:12:10,190 --> 02:12:15,020
So let's make it a question. And it's hard. This one is not easy because you want to stay neutral.

1212
02:12:15,350 --> 02:12:18,500
You don't want to make it persuasive. Good questions are not persuasive.

1213
02:12:20,150 --> 02:12:23,590
How does hearing about the death of unvaccinated people make you feel?

1214
02:12:23,600 --> 02:12:27,780
Yeah, that's that's good. That feels close to neutral. All right.

1215
02:12:29,930 --> 02:12:48,420
Did you eat well last week? Maybe like on a scale of 1 to 10, how do you feel you eat last week?

1216
02:12:48,540 --> 02:12:53,970
Okay. You have to name your polls. Go from 1 to 0 and name zero and ten.

1217
02:12:54,570 --> 02:12:58,620
What are the. Being eating?

1218
02:12:59,430 --> 02:13:08,720
Yeah, eating. Eating well. Okay. Did your husband finally decide to help you with the cooking and shopping?

1219
02:13:16,470 --> 02:13:29,490
We did this one already, basically. What help, if any, did your husband will your husband or did your husband did?

1220
02:13:29,970 --> 02:13:37,250
Will you exercise next week? I think everyone's spoken up.

1221
02:13:37,700 --> 02:13:44,530
I'm terrible with names. Orange. A long sleeved shirt next to Katy.

1222
02:13:45,380 --> 02:13:49,610
Your name is not on here because you signed up. What's your name? Sorry.

1223
02:13:49,700 --> 02:13:52,880
What's it? I know you signed up place. You're not on my sheet.

1224
02:13:55,320 --> 02:13:58,320
What's your first name again? Armstrong. Yeah.

1225
02:13:58,470 --> 02:14:02,370
Okay. Thank you. All right. Can you do this one now that you've been called out?

1226
02:14:04,590 --> 02:14:09,250
Will you exercise next week? Oh, sorry.

1227
02:14:11,250 --> 02:14:15,150
How? They're perfect.

1228
02:14:16,350 --> 02:14:26,030
Yeah. Define the zero on the ten with zero being not and ten being more.

1229
02:14:26,340 --> 02:14:30,330
Yeah. Ah definitely not and definitely but very good. Those are both excellent.

1230
02:14:32,070 --> 02:14:35,820
Did you count your sodium intake as we discussed? Congestive heart failure patient.

1231
02:14:35,820 --> 02:14:42,300
They're supposed to count their sodium, keep it under a thousand milligrams. So we're not asking about intake, we're asking about counting.

1232
02:14:42,900 --> 02:14:47,160
So with that in mind, who would like to try to make this an open question?

1233
02:15:00,900 --> 02:15:05,790
Anyone. Would this be like for like the dose or.

1234
02:15:06,390 --> 02:15:10,260
That's a tough one. I probably say no, but it's a very reasonable question.

1235
02:15:10,260 --> 02:15:13,979
Is this an inherent question? So let's do it.

1236
02:15:13,980 --> 02:15:17,390
Not that way. Even though I could see why you would think so.

1237
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:22,230
So how would you ask it? In a traditional open question? Um.

1238
02:15:28,580 --> 02:15:32,990
How I like, how many times I felt perfect.

1239
02:15:33,470 --> 02:15:36,670
So perfect. How many times, if at all. All right.

1240
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:41,520
All right. I think we're good. Um.

1241
02:15:52,490 --> 02:16:01,140
Couple little things before we move on to reflections. These are little probes that are great for digging yourself out of a closed ended grave.

1242
02:16:01,160 --> 02:16:04,219
So you accidentally ask that close ended question. You got to.

1243
02:16:04,220 --> 02:16:07,310
Yes. Now, even though you said Professor Ken said, I'm not going to get yes.

1244
02:16:07,310 --> 02:16:14,900
No, it doesn't work out. You get a yes. No. Just use these probes to elicit the additional open story.

1245
02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:18,700
In what ways? Tell me more. How so? All those will get out of.

1246
02:16:21,080 --> 02:16:24,140
So the second skill I want to talk about is reflective listening now.

1247
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:33,680
When we do it in my we're doing it either to build rapport and convey understanding or to persuade in formative research.

1248
02:16:33,680 --> 02:16:36,890
We're really only doing it to convey understanding.

1249
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:44,510
We're not doing it to persuade. Okay, so we're lopping off the what we call interventional reflections,

1250
02:16:44,930 --> 02:16:53,990
which is where we selectively focus on the reasons to do it and selectively try to get the patient to attend and expound on their change.

1251
02:16:54,230 --> 02:16:57,920
That is not what we're doing. Informative interviewing.

1252
02:16:58,070 --> 02:17:01,550
We're just simply doing it to convey. I got your story.

1253
02:17:07,210 --> 02:17:12,400
So a couple of rules about good reflections. Good reflections do intensify feelings.

1254
02:17:13,120 --> 02:17:15,459
So if someone says to you, I'm a little upset with my husband,

1255
02:17:15,460 --> 02:17:21,100
and yet you've heard the whole story and you watched her body language and your sense is she hates her husband.

1256
02:17:21,820 --> 02:17:28,559
It's okay to go from a bit upset to not as strong as hey, because that's too much of a leap.

1257
02:17:28,560 --> 02:17:32,170
But to say sounds like you're more than a bit upset with your husband. Okay.

1258
02:17:32,530 --> 02:17:36,339
Or if they say I'm a little disappointed with Michigan medicine, with how they treated me.

1259
02:17:36,340 --> 02:17:39,910
And you're doing a formal study on patient responses to Michigan medicine.

1260
02:17:40,210 --> 02:17:45,430
And some of that is I'm a little upset with my primary care doc. You could say it looks like you're more than a little upset.

1261
02:17:45,550 --> 02:17:52,870
It looks like you're pissed off at you about. So part of the beauty of reflections is it's okay to intensify up.

1262
02:17:54,040 --> 02:18:01,690
We generally don't intensify down because if you go down like on that bottom example, someone says, I hate my boss and you respond,

1263
02:18:01,700 --> 02:18:07,350
Sounds like you're having some small problems at work that actually breaks rapport and shuts the person down.

1264
02:18:07,380 --> 02:18:10,510
Like, why is that a bad idea to do what the bottom one does?

1265
02:18:12,580 --> 02:18:22,050
Why is that? Shut the person down. It takes away the genuine feelings that you're trying to get and collect from people.

1266
02:18:22,590 --> 02:18:28,630
What's the meta message? What does it say back to you? Hate your boss and I come back to say I've my little problems I work on.

1267
02:18:29,130 --> 02:18:33,720
What does it say to you? I think it just minimizes what they're actually told.

1268
02:18:33,750 --> 02:18:39,450
That's the work it minimizes, which is another way to say, I don't think you have the right to feel that way or I don't want to hear about it.

1269
02:18:40,500 --> 02:18:45,120
Huh? What? No, I was just thinking like that happens all the time.

1270
02:18:45,410 --> 02:18:53,610
Yeah, we talk about this a lot, but I just always think about experiences where especially in the medical space, that that will happen.

1271
02:18:53,670 --> 02:18:58,020
Yeah, a lot of physicians tell us when we train them in them. I didn't go into psychology.

1272
02:18:58,020 --> 02:19:02,800
I don't want to deal with emotion. I just want to fix symptoms. All right.

1273
02:19:02,810 --> 02:19:09,830
So the way we generally construct reflections is in the the baby format is it sounds like it's okay to do it,

1274
02:19:09,830 --> 02:19:11,690
but you don't want to be doing that too much.

1275
02:19:11,720 --> 02:19:19,790
It starts to sound a little trite or banal, so it's okay to rely on, it sounds like, but generally just use you or yeah.

1276
02:19:20,030 --> 02:19:29,899
So just jump right in there and say you're upset you didn't like your primary care doc or you feel that Michigan medicine is too hard to schedule.

1277
02:19:29,900 --> 02:19:33,350
Not it sounds like you feel Michigan medicine is too hard to get scheduled.

1278
02:19:33,680 --> 02:19:40,040
You are frustrated. It's too hard to get scheduled. So in general, don't be scared of jumping to you, okay?

1279
02:19:40,130 --> 02:19:51,100
Or it. A particular type of reflection that is going to be very helpful if you're going to do this is what we call affirmation reflections.

1280
02:19:52,750 --> 02:20:00,820
This is important. If someone goes off on a ten minute speech, I have to say, there's one group I did one last week that speaks longer than anyone.

1281
02:20:01,420 --> 02:20:06,390
Does anyone I guess what is? You're probably going to be scared because you're going to sound tolerant.

1282
02:20:06,410 --> 02:20:10,990
But there's one group that goes on longer than anyone ministers.

1283
02:20:11,350 --> 02:20:14,740
So we're doing a lot of work in black churches. I love the work.

1284
02:20:14,800 --> 02:20:21,010
They're fantastic people, but they're high verbal. And so we asked and we were doing a focus group about switching our vaccine

1285
02:20:21,010 --> 02:20:24,820
study from only Sarah and all of this from unvaccinated can lead to partial.

1286
02:20:25,060 --> 02:20:27,730
They loved it, but each answer was 30 minutes.

1287
02:20:28,390 --> 02:20:37,210
In order to keep me from staying there overnight, I used affirmations to say, Pastor McDaniels, you have a lot to say about that.

1288
02:20:37,570 --> 02:20:45,940
That's a very respectful way to ask someone to give up the microphone.

1289
02:20:46,300 --> 02:20:51,610
You've thought about this a lot. It's also a way to bring someone back to their primary topic.

1290
02:20:51,610 --> 02:20:59,830
So if you're here to talk about X and they're talking about why a very powerful way to redirect is, that's really interesting.

1291
02:21:00,610 --> 02:21:03,730
And you have a lot of thoughts about that or have a lot of stress in your life.

1292
02:21:04,120 --> 02:21:06,220
But if okay, I'd like to go back to this question.

1293
02:21:06,580 --> 02:21:12,100
So the positive thing about it is you're telling I take you, you're important, I'm listening to you,

1294
02:21:12,490 --> 02:21:16,630
I care about this, but if it's okay, I want to take the microphone and pass it on.

1295
02:21:18,940 --> 02:21:23,620
So some people want to know when do you ask versus reflect?

1296
02:21:24,310 --> 02:21:27,850
So asking is better for quantifying things? Okay.

1297
02:21:28,630 --> 02:21:36,100
But generally we prefer reflection as a primary way to keep the discussion going and communicates to the interviewee.

1298
02:21:36,460 --> 02:21:47,230
I get you questions, don't communicate that. So if you can reflect, okay, if you can summarize what they've said, affirm what they've said.

1299
02:21:48,700 --> 02:21:53,559
When we say empathize, we don't mean I'm sorry to hear that. That's not how we empathize in this approach.

1300
02:21:53,560 --> 02:21:57,219
We empathize. We're saying you're upset with that. That was frustrating for you.

1301
02:21:57,220 --> 02:22:03,310
That's how we empathize. So we empathize without our statements, but we still do it in focus groups and interviews.

1302
02:22:03,310 --> 02:22:06,610
We still empathize, but with you statements, you're upset with that.

1303
02:22:06,610 --> 02:22:09,790
That was a really horrible experience. Michigan medicine really let you down.

1304
02:22:10,090 --> 02:22:14,320
You're angry at your primary care, doc. You don't trust the vaccine.

1305
02:22:14,620 --> 02:22:18,400
You hate the side effects of your meds. Those are the types of reflections you can use.

1306
02:22:21,170 --> 02:22:32,660
All right. So I'm just going to show you a couple of examples.

1307
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:39,530
I'm going to ask a couple of prompts, and I'm going to ask you guys to give me an answer and reflect it.

1308
02:22:39,800 --> 02:22:45,350
Okay. Overall, after your year plus that being at Michigan.

1309
02:22:46,160 --> 02:22:49,400
What's your general response to your MPH program?

1310
02:22:50,170 --> 02:22:53,090
I know some of you are in nutrition and it doesn't work,

1311
02:22:53,090 --> 02:23:00,230
but for those of you how after a year and a half would you say or a year plus is your general response to this MPH program?

1312
02:23:00,260 --> 02:23:03,800
Be honest with me and then I'll reflect it back to you.

1313
02:23:05,330 --> 02:23:09,070
Don't be shy. Yes.

1314
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:11,830
Holly, I really love the program.

1315
02:23:11,890 --> 02:23:19,240
I just think sometimes it's a little problem with how many requirements there are and there's like 3 to 5 requirements in the training.

1316
02:23:19,240 --> 02:23:25,840
And I just think one plus an internship, I just think one requirement has have been enough, like the physical one.

1317
02:23:27,010 --> 02:23:31,419
So although you're happy with your experience, the obligations and the required things,

1318
02:23:31,420 --> 02:23:36,160
particularly the two apex things, feels like it's over whelming and unnecessary.

1319
02:23:36,580 --> 02:23:40,600
You would appreciate having that response lifted or that requirement just like one.

1320
02:23:41,530 --> 02:23:44,830
Yeah. Not to. To else. You've been here a year.

1321
02:23:44,860 --> 02:23:48,460
Most of you. What is your experience been like? What do you feel? Don't be shy.

1322
02:23:48,490 --> 02:24:05,070
I'm not going to judge it. I cannot believe you have nothing to say that all of a sudden you guys are low verbals.

1323
02:24:05,560 --> 02:24:12,180
I know I've had a very positive experience. I've gotten to meet a lot more people and make a lot of good connections.

1324
02:24:12,650 --> 02:24:19,229
My one piece of criticism is I feel a lot of the HBCU classes have a lot of overlapping information,

1325
02:24:19,230 --> 02:24:26,430
and sometimes I'd like to get a little more involved with different programs across the University of Michigan campus,

1326
02:24:26,430 --> 02:24:31,200
and it's really hard to get in this class or find resources to help you to get into other things.

1327
02:24:31,860 --> 02:24:35,490
So there's sort of you had a generally good experience, but there's two concerns you have.

1328
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:43,020
One is the courses are redundant at times, and then there's this wonderful university with all this breadth of courses,

1329
02:24:43,020 --> 02:24:48,629
but the school doesn't facilitate you to find them and take advantage of that opportunity.

1330
02:24:48,630 --> 02:24:52,170
So it feels like a little bit of a wasted resource for you.

1331
02:24:55,250 --> 02:24:59,240
Okay. So I had a positive experience as well overall.

1332
02:25:00,020 --> 02:25:10,820
And coming into that program we were like primarily remote and I think the second year with the integration back to fully in-person,

1333
02:25:11,090 --> 02:25:14,719
I think that could have been facilitated a little bit better.

1334
02:25:14,720 --> 02:25:24,650
And I guess just maybe with more resources, I think it was pretty sudden to just be like fully back in person from like pretty much primarily remote.

1335
02:25:24,740 --> 02:25:29,000
I operating like a hybrid option would have been nice for students,

1336
02:25:29,570 --> 02:25:34,070
so going back from pure COVID remote to in-person was a little bit of a jolt for you.

1337
02:25:34,490 --> 02:25:38,930
You felt there could have been should have been more hybrid options and more of a gradual process.

1338
02:25:38,960 --> 02:25:44,480
It felt out of the blue. And that's reflecting qualitative research.

1339
02:25:44,540 --> 02:25:47,629
Okay. You don't want to use their exact words.

1340
02:25:47,630 --> 02:25:52,730
You have to slightly rotate it or sounds almost condescending to repeat it verbatim.

1341
02:25:53,900 --> 02:25:57,050
So your job is to what they call paraphrase, but we call it stretch.

1342
02:25:57,500 --> 02:26:03,320
Take what they said and just add something to it, even if it's just a little intensity or just any appearance.

1343
02:26:03,620 --> 02:26:10,160
Okay, hopefully when you do it, what will happen is the person speaking will feel heard, understood, and not judged.

1344
02:26:10,970 --> 02:26:19,430
Okay. I'm going to ask a complex one and then I'll reflect it.

1345
02:26:19,610 --> 02:26:26,120
What do you think about people who refuse to get vaccinated? What do you feel about family members?

1346
02:26:26,390 --> 02:26:31,400
I'll even be more specific. What do you feel about family members that you have that refuse to be vaccinated?

1347
02:26:32,510 --> 02:26:38,989
Anyone? Okay, I feel frustrated, but also really conflicted because I love them as my family members.

1348
02:26:38,990 --> 02:26:42,200
But it's hard that they can't see reasons like me.

1349
02:26:42,830 --> 02:26:47,030
So it's difficult because you don't want to alienate them and you have a very long term relationship.

1350
02:26:47,540 --> 02:26:52,730
But it just it's difficult and almost annoys you that they can't see the facts.

1351
02:26:54,040 --> 02:26:57,129
Slight rotation, nonjudgmental.

1352
02:26:57,130 --> 02:27:02,550
So this is what I want you to do, because we're going to do these many focus groups next Monday.

1353
02:27:02,680 --> 02:27:04,960
I want to hear reflections and open questions.

1354
02:27:06,340 --> 02:27:12,520
Now, sometimes if you want to summarize multiple responses, you might say I let me summarize what I've heard so far.

1355
02:27:13,300 --> 02:27:18,190
You might summarize three or four person's people's ideologies or interest their statements.

1356
02:27:18,190 --> 02:27:25,120
And you want to say, anyone want to correct anyone want to add. That's a very nice way to to follow up with a reflection.

1357
02:27:25,540 --> 02:27:30,040
Okay. Particularly if it's not a very simple one and you're trying to read into things.

1358
02:27:30,670 --> 02:27:40,360
Okay. So just want to give you a couple of ways that will make it good, and I give you a couple of thoughts.

1359
02:27:49,080 --> 02:27:52,510
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. How to handle difficult.

1360
02:27:52,530 --> 02:27:57,720
Focus group participants. There are all these characters out there.

1361
02:27:58,020 --> 02:28:03,060
There's the older talker, which I kind of alluded to in my loving comments about the ministers.

1362
02:28:04,080 --> 02:28:10,290
And then there's the dominator who answers everything and tries to persuade people that he or she is right.

1363
02:28:11,130 --> 02:28:15,670
The distractor who goes off on tangents. That is common.

1364
02:28:15,690 --> 02:28:20,880
The rescuer who feels bad that someone had to reveal something sad.

1365
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:24,810
For most of these, the solution is the same. Okay.

1366
02:28:25,380 --> 02:28:34,890
Generally, what you want to do in almost all of these cases is affirm something positive about the over talker dominator rescuer.

1367
02:28:35,550 --> 02:28:39,390
You really care about other people. You have a lot to say about this.

1368
02:28:39,390 --> 02:28:43,050
You're going through a lot of stress. This is an important topic for you.

1369
02:28:43,080 --> 02:28:47,190
Usually that's enough for you to get the steering wheel back.

1370
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:52,350
Okay, now, once in a while, someone violates the rules. We've had to ask them to leave.

1371
02:28:53,130 --> 02:28:59,250
Twice in 30 years. So it may never happen to you. Usually an affirmation with a redirect.

1372
02:28:59,250 --> 02:29:11,040
And the redirect can be as simple as. Katie, you have a lot to say about COVID vaccines and family members, and you've really thought about it.

1373
02:29:11,370 --> 02:29:14,040
I'm just wondering what you think about it.

1374
02:29:14,040 --> 02:29:22,079
KELLY So you've literally grabbed the microphone on the back end of your affirmation and it works 99% of the time.

1375
02:29:22,080 --> 02:29:27,629
That's all you have to do. Now, if I don't acknowledge that Katie has thought about this and is struggling with this,

1376
02:29:27,630 --> 02:29:33,180
and I simply say, okay, Kelly, what are your thoughts that can be a little off putting to Katie?

1377
02:29:33,180 --> 02:29:35,790
So your job is to make sure you do a little reflection there,

1378
02:29:36,180 --> 02:29:41,580
a firm interest thought that they're going through a lot, depending what the topic is and then say.

1379
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:49,890
But, Kelly, what do you think? All right. So here's some language you could use.

1380
02:29:56,030 --> 02:30:00,770
I think some of these are so obvious. I'm going to skip most of them because I want to get to the activity.

1381
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:14,480
All right. So one trick to use in groups, less so with one on ones is to get everyone to touch the ball, so to speak.

1382
02:30:14,550 --> 02:30:22,590
You want to start? Everyone takes the shot. And the way to do that is to start with a universal question or a polling question.

1383
02:30:23,160 --> 02:30:30,390
So let's say we're talking about COVID vaccine like we just talked about, and we're talking about family members.

1384
02:30:30,870 --> 02:30:33,780
I might say I would like everyone to answer this question.

1385
02:30:34,200 --> 02:30:41,609
How many, what relatives, if any, do you have that haven't been vaccinated and don't go around and you go on a handheld and I go,

1386
02:30:41,610 --> 02:30:48,060
sir, and make sure everyone answers it. Now, of course, with 25 people, it's too much for with ten people, everyone can answer.

1387
02:30:48,360 --> 02:30:53,910
Usually in the first two questions. Our general rule is the first two are polling questions.

1388
02:30:54,750 --> 02:31:03,960
Usually the first one is not on topic. The first one is usually, can you tell me a movie, TV show or video game you've played in the last week?

1389
02:31:04,110 --> 02:31:07,890
Or tell me if you had all the money in the world and all the time, where would you want to travel?

1390
02:31:08,790 --> 02:31:12,689
Those are the sort of completely innocuous polling questions.

1391
02:31:12,690 --> 02:31:19,830
So we usually start the first one is unrelated to the topic, and then the second one is tangentially, broadly related to the topic.

1392
02:31:20,220 --> 02:31:23,880
But the key thing is you want everyone to get their heart going.

1393
02:31:24,330 --> 02:31:30,930
There's an old expression in contact sports for those you play them, you're nervous until you take your first hit.

1394
02:31:31,410 --> 02:31:35,910
And this is the same thing with focus groups until everyone has spoken, they're sitting there nervous.

1395
02:31:36,330 --> 02:31:38,879
Am I not smart enough or do I not know anything about this?

1396
02:31:38,880 --> 02:31:43,290
So, so long as everyone answers to questions, usually that's enough for them all to feel part of the game.

1397
02:31:45,060 --> 02:31:52,050
Any questions about going around the room and using an icebreaker that is unrelated to the primary topic as your first?

1398
02:31:55,020 --> 02:32:04,790
All right. Remember, we've talked about the bottom line of Sue don't usually like to use focus groups for news or hypothetical,

1399
02:32:05,210 --> 02:32:10,340
and we also generally generally try to limit asking people about other people's experience.

1400
02:32:10,370 --> 02:32:15,709
Usually you want to create your focus group questions, so you're only asking about that person's experience.

1401
02:32:15,710 --> 02:32:20,060
Now, it can be different if you're asking like discrimination, which is an interaction.

1402
02:32:20,540 --> 02:32:23,720
Of course you can ask, What was it like when they called you that horrible name?

1403
02:32:24,290 --> 02:32:29,540
But generally you're asking about only the individual's perception, not other people.

1404
02:32:29,960 --> 02:32:41,570
Okay. All right. Just to think about cost to do at retail, you pay about 3000 per focus group, which sounds crazy.

1405
02:32:41,990 --> 02:32:44,660
And for that you're paying for them to recruit for you.

1406
02:32:44,960 --> 02:32:51,440
They usually have a panel people they go to where they might use someone like Dennard out to buy a list of people.

1407
02:32:52,070 --> 02:32:57,170
They will often write the moderator outline, although of course they'll consult you as the client.

1408
02:32:57,650 --> 02:33:02,120
They'll handle the payment and they'll handle the video equipment.

1409
02:33:02,600 --> 02:33:08,630
If it's a high end corporate focus group, they'll find a two way mirror where you could observe it in real time if you would like.

1410
02:33:09,920 --> 02:33:13,010
And that can get as high as I've seen. As high as 6000.

1411
02:33:13,010 --> 02:33:16,969
7000, particularly if they're doing something like physiologic monitoring,

1412
02:33:16,970 --> 02:33:25,820
like measuring heart rate or skin response or temperature or something like that to do it yourself.

1413
02:33:25,820 --> 02:33:35,000
It's still going to cost money, even if you're going to if you're going to do the moderation for free, you still almost always have to pay people.

1414
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:38,690
So it's pretty rare to pay less than 50 bucks for adults.

1415
02:33:39,380 --> 02:33:42,530
So that's my 500 is a lower limit ten times 50.

1416
02:33:42,980 --> 02:33:49,010
And typically you feed them and typically if they have to pay to get there, you reimburse them for gas.

1417
02:33:49,610 --> 02:33:54,320
So it's pretty easy to get to $1,000 even in do it yourself.

1418
02:33:54,920 --> 02:34:02,059
Okay. And that would be do it yourself is you're moderating it, you're recruiting,

1419
02:34:02,060 --> 02:34:06,650
but you're still paying them transportation, food and a stipend of 50 bucks.

1420
02:34:06,650 --> 02:34:13,070
Of course, if you're going to talk to brain surgeons, you may have to pay them $500 for 15 minutes.

1421
02:34:13,070 --> 02:34:18,049
That's what part of summer local companies pay specialists to talk about a drug.

1422
02:34:18,050 --> 02:34:24,680
But you're not going to probably be doing a lot of that. You're going to be more talking to the common woman and man.

1423
02:34:24,800 --> 02:34:31,670
So FIFO is a nice starting point up here and sign up for kids and might go as low as little kids.

1424
02:34:31,670 --> 02:34:36,350
Ten bucks with parents can send teenagers 25 to 50 as well.

1425
02:34:37,190 --> 02:34:40,969
Any questions about the logistics? There's a lot of little things we could get into,

1426
02:34:40,970 --> 02:34:50,030
but any questions about why is it 6000 for a commercial and why is it 500 to 1000 is for do it yourself.

1427
02:34:54,140 --> 02:34:59,360
Okay. One of the downsides of commercial is they often have a list of what we call high verbals.

1428
02:34:59,750 --> 02:35:05,870
You don't want those people. So the problem of using a paid recruiter is they have a panel that they go to.

1429
02:35:06,410 --> 02:35:12,200
You don't really want professional focus group people on your panel because they are sound bite generators.

1430
02:35:12,200 --> 02:35:15,590
They kind of think they know what you want to hear and they come prepared.

1431
02:35:16,160 --> 02:35:21,530
You don't want that. You want the real person. And that usually requires recruiting, not from a panel.

1432
02:35:22,220 --> 02:35:29,660
So keep in mind, when you pay someone, you're often getting less because you're getting professional talkers.

1433
02:35:30,380 --> 02:35:37,850
Okay. All right. All right.

1434
02:35:37,850 --> 02:35:43,940
I think I have other things to share with you, but I want to get to this other thing with 20 minutes today.

1435
02:35:44,150 --> 02:35:50,630
What I want to do is I'm going to put up your topics and we're going to see how well this year it's going to play out.

1436
02:35:51,170 --> 02:35:58,130
Hold on one sec. Okay. Here are your topics and I'll make it bigger because I cannot see it.

1437
02:36:01,780 --> 02:36:07,630
All right. Is there a way to make this full page? There must. There is perfect.

1438
02:36:07,660 --> 02:36:13,740
Okay. So I hope you know which. I know we have a couple of similar initials like H.

1439
02:36:13,750 --> 02:36:17,260
S and KP, so you know which one you are.

1440
02:36:18,070 --> 02:36:28,150
I'd like you to get into your groups, and I want you to come up with five good interview questions.

1441
02:36:28,660 --> 02:36:32,170
You could ask for your formative work. Okay.

1442
02:36:33,100 --> 02:36:36,580
And then we're going to next Monday.

1443
02:36:37,930 --> 02:36:41,440
Convene focus groups. Now.

1444
02:36:44,050 --> 02:36:54,940
It's going to be tricky for who's the two that were immigrant are now doing nonimmigrant rite aid and ask them you moved or you still doing immigrant.

1445
02:36:56,170 --> 02:37:00,430
We're considering okay for this task.

1446
02:37:00,910 --> 02:37:03,910
Don't do immigrant because you're going to interview fellow students.

1447
02:37:04,330 --> 02:37:08,620
Now we have a few, maybe first generation here, so maybe we'll work.

1448
02:37:08,680 --> 02:37:14,950
Okay. But what I want you to do is you're going to interview your classmates next week.

1449
02:37:15,400 --> 02:37:26,420
Okay. Try to take the topic or interested and make it so that you guys are 23 to 35 year olds, roughly.

1450
02:37:26,440 --> 02:37:30,009
Okay. Try to make it relevant to that age group.

1451
02:37:30,010 --> 02:37:35,180
So take your topic and rotate it so that graduate students can answer it.

1452
02:37:36,040 --> 02:37:41,710
Looking at this, it's going to be tough because I don't know.

1453
02:37:42,280 --> 02:37:45,730
Please raise your hand if you vape at least once a month.

1454
02:37:49,180 --> 02:37:55,140
So for vaping, all you could get is non vapers. So that group, we have two options.

1455
02:37:55,150 --> 02:37:55,530
Okay.

1456
02:37:55,540 --> 02:38:08,520
Either you talk about why don't people vape or because you have only non vapers, you can ask them about their non vaping ness like why don't they?

1457
02:38:08,530 --> 02:38:12,969
Or you could ask them about people they know. So for those of you, let's get out.

1458
02:38:12,970 --> 02:38:18,870
How many of you know someone who vapes? Remember I said, you don't ask about other people's experience.

1459
02:38:18,880 --> 02:38:24,790
We're going to break that rule only because we only have 25 people to pick from mental health.

1460
02:38:24,790 --> 02:38:28,450
I think we'll work. Maternal health. I don't know. Okay.

1461
02:38:28,840 --> 02:38:34,330
So all I'm going to say is I'm going to give you 15 minutes now to break into your groups,

1462
02:38:35,710 --> 02:38:40,030
try to ask questions around your topic, but make them relevant to 20.

1463
02:38:41,050 --> 02:38:44,950
You know, this age group, about 23 to 35.

1464
02:38:45,340 --> 02:38:48,999
Okay. Now, if you need a poll, that's okay.

1465
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:53,560
So, for example, the maternal health group, what were you hoping to get at?

1466
02:38:56,410 --> 02:39:00,280
Oh, yeah. What topic around maternal health? Have you focused on that yet?

1467
02:39:00,790 --> 02:39:03,740
You know, we started to discuss. Okay, exactly.

1468
02:39:04,630 --> 02:39:13,120
And what degree of that, you know, for this exercise, ask something about maternal health of this age range.

1469
02:39:13,120 --> 02:39:16,779
Okay. There is another option and some of you may be stuck with it.

1470
02:39:16,780 --> 02:39:22,330
And the option is not great, but it will still work. We could ask the student panel to be actors.

1471
02:39:22,870 --> 02:39:29,409
So let's say you really want to ask about what was it like to give birth or something?

1472
02:39:29,410 --> 02:39:34,870
And we don't have enough moms in the room, we could say who will play the role of a recent mom.

1473
02:39:34,870 --> 02:39:38,259
So I want to you can do that, but that's our last resort.

1474
02:39:38,260 --> 02:39:45,280
So try everything possible to make your questions relevant to this age group and this group of 25 year old.

1475
02:39:45,310 --> 02:39:48,350
25. Students.

1476
02:39:48,770 --> 02:39:52,670
But if you can't, you can ask for actors next week.

1477
02:39:53,120 --> 02:40:02,480
Okay. So with that in mind, get into your groups and come up with about five questions you're going to ask ideally relevant to this student age range.

1478
02:40:03,110 --> 02:40:07,850
But if not, for example, I don't know if low scores will work here.

1479
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:12,559
Okay. A few of you might come from low asks, but play with it in your group.

1480
02:40:12,560 --> 02:40:17,120
See if you want to ask them about their real experience or ask them to act.

1481
02:40:17,240 --> 02:40:24,160
It can go either way. All right. Get into your groups. Come up with five good questions and I will be here to answer your questions.

1482
02:40:24,170 --> 02:40:29,230
One last thing. Stay here. I mean, don't leave yet.

1483
02:40:29,750 --> 02:40:33,500
Try to use as many of the strategies we talk about. Try to use 0 to 10.

1484
02:40:33,500 --> 02:40:41,290
Try to use some people. Some people try to use, if any, but also try in your five questions to implement as many of the steps.

1485
02:40:41,450 --> 02:40:45,260
Go ahead. So we're going to go for about 15 minutes.

1486
02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:51,420
So get into your groups. Yeah.

1487
02:40:53,690 --> 02:41:00,380
Now you step. What do you know? You want to take a group, I guess, to get something and it doesn't commit for you.

1488
02:41:00,650 --> 02:41:05,150
It can just be for this sub exercise. Okay, so just watch yourself.

1489
02:41:05,330 --> 02:41:18,680
Okay. How did you. This is going to be very.

1490
02:41:23,880 --> 02:41:35,050
I'm already retired now that I have tried.

1491
02:41:40,920 --> 02:41:48,000
I come down? How many times have you been looking?

1492
02:41:50,680 --> 02:41:55,730
I think I really got to be honest with you.

1493
02:41:57,410 --> 02:42:02,030
I don't know. Yesterday, I.

1494
02:42:09,020 --> 02:42:34,250
So what happened when you were ready to try to rescue your own son if you want to do anything to support your classmates?

1495
02:42:34,490 --> 02:42:49,420
How did that affect your. I like that you're all here because I got you.

1496
02:42:51,220 --> 02:42:55,490
Okay, that's fine. That's what I'm supposed to do later.

1497
02:42:56,410 --> 02:43:05,240
What's your topic? You know, so in your case, you either asked for 24 year olds or ask them to act.

1498
02:43:06,990 --> 02:43:24,270
Either way. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1499
02:43:26,010 --> 02:43:35,100
Cause, like, I don't think I don't, I don't I don't like it because I, I guess I don't even know how they made that.

1500
02:43:35,790 --> 02:43:42,880
I can I just maybe get in the way. But I think.

1501
02:43:46,290 --> 02:43:49,630
You know, it's easy to forget it.

1502
02:43:52,240 --> 02:43:59,680
Yeah, I don't like it because I'm certain how they it, like.

1503
02:44:02,900 --> 02:44:07,250
I mean, look at what they've come to be like.

1504
02:44:18,760 --> 02:44:21,980
Yeah. Like, I have.

1505
02:44:22,550 --> 02:44:31,940
I have no plans for anything else in terms of, like, suggesting that.

1506
02:44:36,270 --> 02:44:39,320
I think a lot of that would be a transition.

1507
02:44:41,030 --> 02:44:44,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1508
02:44:45,350 --> 02:44:48,780
I think that's a really good quality to buy their like interview and. Yeah.

1509
02:44:52,160 --> 02:45:07,460
But I want to know more about, like, you're looking for a present for them.

1510
02:45:08,210 --> 02:45:19,060
Yeah, I do that. I kind of do. I'd like to that.

1511
02:45:21,510 --> 02:45:38,420
Hold your hand. And I'm not sure if are telling us to prepare for the security of everyone moving.

1512
02:45:43,590 --> 02:45:52,990
Whenever I can get one of those guys to get back to being.

1513
02:45:55,550 --> 02:46:14,350
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know how, how I feel like there's a lot less controversy and stuff like this and, you know, just practices.

1514
02:46:14,770 --> 02:46:20,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't like that.

1515
02:46:22,570 --> 02:46:31,479
I mean. Do you think that you should come out and say you have like maybe one of these against guys in high school,

1516
02:46:31,480 --> 02:46:42,140
so maybe see what some people believe and I'm like, Yeah, yeah.

1517
02:46:42,600 --> 02:46:46,270
Really don't want people to be.

1518
02:46:51,030 --> 02:47:01,440
Just like the medical oncologist in the hospital.

1519
02:47:07,200 --> 02:47:10,400
And how people take away from everything.

1520
02:47:10,840 --> 02:47:16,350
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1521
02:47:17,260 --> 02:47:24,240
Yeah. I see her for his child.

1522
02:47:24,280 --> 02:47:31,180
And I think they have tried to make it very difficult to get sensitive.

1523
02:47:31,290 --> 02:47:42,680
I find myself thinking about it from a different perspective.

1524
02:47:43,020 --> 02:47:50,210
Ever been a teenager? Yes, that's what I think sometimes.

1525
02:47:51,320 --> 02:47:58,970
I don't know. Yeah. Oh.

1526
02:48:01,650 --> 02:48:13,000
Yeah. You know. Oh, you know, right now I just feel even more so.

1527
02:48:14,920 --> 02:48:21,080
Where do you fall? I don't know. I think. What do you to do?

1528
02:48:23,920 --> 02:48:30,670
Okay, so we had this, like, getting in and out of the question, you know, on a scale.

1529
02:48:31,030 --> 02:48:39,330
I think if someone just wants to stay friends or like or something, that's not what I feel.

1530
02:48:39,610 --> 02:48:57,010
Yeah. I don't want that to happen because I don't know how to prevent it, but there's like, I don't know.

1531
02:48:58,090 --> 02:49:02,260
I think that would be nice to have you live longer, healthier lives.

1532
02:49:02,270 --> 02:49:05,890
Like. Yeah, I guess cause.

1533
02:49:08,770 --> 02:49:12,430
Yes. That's why they complain to the baby.

1534
02:49:12,830 --> 02:49:27,450
Yeah. And then they all had a financial accounting, either one or two.

1535
02:49:28,680 --> 02:49:31,800
I'll consider it, if at all.

1536
02:49:34,750 --> 02:49:39,060
But as you point out for yourself.

1537
02:49:43,350 --> 02:49:47,280
Yeah, I know, I know.

1538
02:49:48,910 --> 02:50:00,620
I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1539
02:50:01,350 --> 02:50:10,890
Oh, yeah, yeah. I definitely felt like it was like on the scale or whatever or whatever, you know?

1540
02:50:12,090 --> 02:50:16,200
Right. Yeah. They're much better that way.

1541
02:50:16,260 --> 02:50:25,480
I guess it would be like with little something like this is such a thing.

1542
02:50:25,740 --> 02:50:27,540
I go literally and I was like.
