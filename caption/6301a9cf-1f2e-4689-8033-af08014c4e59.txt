1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,720
Oh. All right.

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:13,590
So today we are going to cover the topics here on the list here where it says Lecture.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,780
I'll go through them then. What I want to do is jump into our current events.

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,219
And then from there, we will get to case analysis, practice.

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,050
We'll take two breaks. We'll take a five minute break and a ten minute break to kind of keep our ourselves moving.

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,520
And we'll manage today's session so that we're not sitting here for too long at one time.

7
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,540
So nonprofits,

8
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:44,459
we talked about them quite a bit last week during our first session and kind of had a chance to think about what they are and what your interests are.

9
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,220
And I appreciate everybody sharing all the different perspectives about what brings you to our course and why you're here,

10
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,840
what you're interested in learning about.

11
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:59,219
But I want to set the table for what these nonprofits are, how many of them there are, what their function is, what their structure is,

12
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,320
and all the different particulars that we can think about related to them so that as we move through the semester,

13
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,400
we're coming in with a kind of a common foundational platform on good.

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,139
So when we think about the nonprofit,

15
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:20,730
we can think about it as set between the government as one entity and the private or for profit space as another.

16
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:31,770
At the population level, the nonprofit really is at the apex of this triangle where we're looking at these two different large entities.

17
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,530
But what's interesting and important to remember about the nonprofit is that it is itself a corporation.

18
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:45,270
It's incorporated. So when you have a startup, or if you're an entrepreneur, you might have an LLC, a limited liability company,

19
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,140
you might have an S Corp, which is also a corporation, you might have a C Corp, another form of a corporation.

20
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:59,490
But a nonprofit is in essence a corporation. It's typically a corporate is a C Corp, but it has a special designation.

21
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,640
And what does it mean to be a nonprofit? It simply just means that it's a501c3 designation.

22
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,219
I, I talk about that here in a moment in more specifics,

23
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:16,080
but it is a very specialized designation that's given to it by the Internal Revenue Service, the IRS, which is a division of the Treasury.

24
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,120
So. These organizations are typically mission driven.

25
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:27,000
I think the biggest thing that I find in talking about nonprofits that is most confusing to

26
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:32,490
those who are involved with them is the first point here the idea that they're mission driven.

27
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:39,899
Now, why is that maybe confusing? Or the idea that it's mission driven sometimes has the connotation that it's not a business.

28
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,030
It doesn't run as a traditional corporation.

29
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:48,780
It doesn't carry the same responsibilities in terms of what it has to do as a functional corporate entity.

30
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,800
And that, I think, is the biggest myth about the nonprofit as an organization.

31
00:02:53,220 --> 00:03:02,400
While it carries a mission, it does also carry the very same levels of scrutiny and important upkeep as any other corporate entity,

32
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,390
any other company that you might encounter. So we're going to talk a lot about different managerial practices that go into these nonprofits,

33
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,560
but they're very much aligned with other entities that you'll encounter along the way.

34
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,959
For those of you in our department who are from the Department of Health Management

35
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,990
of Policy or working toward a master's in Health Services Administration,

36
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,669
if you're working at a hospital,

37
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:31,020
you'll encounter quite a bit of practice that is related to hospital administration and it will mimic corporate administration.

38
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:40,530
So if you were finding yourself working at a company like Apple, a company like Bank of America or any other sector,

39
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,680
you might find yourself interfacing with some of the principals we're talking about with the very specific thing missing,

40
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,680
though, which is that you do not have that 501c3 designation.

41
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,550
Our hospitals carry that. Many of them do. We'll talk about that in a moment.

42
00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:00,059
But for the most part, this is the distinct product. So tax exempt, what does that mean?

43
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,230
Tax exempt as it pertains to business income tax.

44
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:10,140
Okay. So they're not paying these organizations are not paying taxes on the income that they generate.

45
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,730
Income. It's a good question. Right. But what does that mean? Income.

46
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:20,070
Income means the money that's coming in. That's maybe where you start to see some deviation.

47
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:26,490
But again, don't let the name non profit fool you into thinking that perhaps it's not generating income somehow.

48
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,360
Just because it's receiving income in the form of grants or donations.

49
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:38,160
It doesn't mean that very different than what a company will generate through the revenue or the income by selling a product or selling a service.

50
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:44,009
In fact, many nonprofits deliver programs, and those programs are the services.

51
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:52,260
Those are the products that they're delivering on, in addition to what they might also be doing in terms of mission driven work.

52
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,540
But at their core, they are mission driven, meaning they are required to have a mission.

53
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:04,230
They're required to be defined by that mission. And they have this focus on being public servants.

54
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,160
We're going to make a distinction between these and the five or 1c4 organizations.

55
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:17,700
Those C Fours are organizations that have the ability to work in lobbying specifically for candidates.

56
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,790
So the C three is not permitted to do that.

57
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,350
The C four is raise your hand if you've heard of a super PAC or a PAC.

58
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,340
And once someone shouted out, What's a pack? Political Action Committee.

59
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:40,630
Okay. What do they do? Typically, it's a rough definition, but money is funneled into them to lobby for specific causes or candidates.

60
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:46,300
Okay, great. So specific causes candidates that this political action committee is lobbying for.

61
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:52,780
Typically, they're operated as a C for. So very often you might see, for example, Planned Parenthood,

62
00:05:53,110 --> 00:06:01,810
they have a separate five one seat or that does all of their work in lobbying and advocacy and ac3 that is delivering the services.

63
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:11,920
If the C three is found lobbying for a particular political candidate, it's in violation of the mandate of what the C three requires from the IRS.

64
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,950
If the C four is lobbying for a political candidate, it's operating under a separate set of rules.

65
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,800
And that's the distinction I want to just have everyone keep in mind.

66
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:31,480
So there are more than 2 million of these organizations in the United States, and the nonprofits account for nearly 10% of jobs in the U.S.

67
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,340
Now you might ask, why is that? That's kind of interesting.

68
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,380
I would have thought that, you know, a 10th of the jobs in the United States are inside of nonprofits.

69
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:49,920
Well, prior to 1980, much of the services that were being delivered in human services, health services, etc., were being delivered.

70
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:58,829
If we go back to this pyramid that I was showing you inside this zone of the government, the government would deliver mental health services,

71
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:04,530
substance abuse services, services related to public health services,

72
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:09,929
related to food security or insecurity, people who are experiencing homelessness.

73
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,790
All these kinds of services were being delivered by the government. Right.

74
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:20,869
About 1980, the government decided that it was not going to be in that business anymore and started

75
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:26,359
to slowly and maybe more rapidly over the course of a decade extract itself from that.

76
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,999
There were policies put into place by the Reagan administration later on, even into the Clinton administration,

77
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,030
where the government was extracting itself out of a lot of these services.

78
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:41,150
But the services themselves were not unnecessary. They simply needed to be delivered by other entities.

79
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,930
So we'll talk about throughout the term examples of where the nonprofits actually are receiving government

80
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:52,660
funding to deliver services that prompted that had previously been delivered directly by the government.

81
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,580
And we'll talk a little bit about the tension throughout the term on, you know,

82
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:02,860
whether or not the government doing it directly versus having another entity that has a particular mission delivering it.

83
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,540
Whether that makes sense or doesn't make sense. But these are going to be the kinds of questions will be considered.

84
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,190
So as I said, there are about 2 million of these.

85
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,930
About a million are five and 1c3, specifically 84,000 or C.

86
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:25,660
There's another half of them. They have other designations. They pay about half a trillion dollars, a little over half a trillion dollars in wages,

87
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:32,260
and they receive nearly $2 trillion in revenue and about 3 trillion in assets.

88
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:40,570
Now, interestingly, from 2000 to 2013, the number of employees in this space increased by 23%.

89
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:46,870
So many, many more people over time and it continues, are employed by not for profit organizations.

90
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,290
Now, many of those could be inside of very specific types.

91
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:57,400
But again, we're thinking about it as one large umbrella. So what defines an organization as five and 1c3?

92
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:02,290
Well, there you can see from the federal government, from the IRS definition,

93
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:10,930
it's allowing for federal tax exemption of charitable nonprofit organizations who are organized and operate exclusively for exempt purposes.

94
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,450
That's pretty broad and kind of vague.

95
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:20,079
They specify a little bit, though, to say public charities, private foundations or private operating foundations.

96
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,500
But again, what's a public charity? What's a private foundation?

97
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:31,450
What's a private operating foundation? These are all defined through rules that the IRS sets out and means tests and

98
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,430
other ways that the IRS is looking at whether or not an organization will qualify.

99
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:44,020
It's very challenging to receive a five on C three designation requires a lot of investment of time, effort,

100
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:50,320
resources, not impossible to receive, but you have to kind of know what you're doing in terms of how it's structured.

101
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:57,969
And you have to be able to meet all of the threshold that the IRS sets out in order to receive that designation,

102
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,030
because it's a very specific designation.

103
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,460
So charitable. When we think about the term charitable,

104
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,610
I think that sometimes we might be harkening back to a definition of something that perhaps isn't necessarily what we're talking about today.

105
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:24,350
So here I'm laying out for you a technical definition of charitable purposes that are religious,

106
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,890
educational, scientific testing for public safety, etc., etc.

107
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:34,370
But what this means is not so much that the organization is doing something for people who can't do for themselves,

108
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:41,900
or that the organization is somehow taking it on their shoulders to do for people who are otherwise unable to do.

109
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:46,520
But rather it's a definition that's used to describe a certain set of activities.

110
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,519
So we're going to talk about this quite a bit because there are terms that have

111
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,860
been created in the lexicon of accounting and of other other managerial spaces,

112
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:00,440
specifically as it relates to health care delivery organizations or hospitals, for example, you'll hear the term bad debt,

113
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,610
you'll hear the term uncompensated care,

114
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:09,139
etc. These are terms that were created for the purposes of reporting that perhaps

115
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:14,990
don't carry the connotation that they either were meant to connote or be,

116
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,760
that really reflect the diversity of our population and the people that they are serving.

117
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,790
So I want to encourage us as we talk through these terms,

118
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:28,580
to think about and keep in mind that not all of them reflect what we are necessarily intending for them to.

119
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,510
And sometimes the term like bad debt to refer to, you know,

120
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:40,610
services that a delivery organization may provide because people don't have coverage that that that connotes a certain value.

121
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:48,170
But that we need to keep in mind that these were defined for the purposes of structuring a set of definitions,

122
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:52,670
for the purposes of reporting and for tax accounting.

123
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,140
So keep that in mind. And I would ask that all of us, as we're discussing these,

124
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:02,240
think about how we would define them and what we think is a good way to evolve those definitions.

125
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:10,070
QUESTION That you mentioned earlier that you'll get into hospitals in the states that you mentioned earlier that include hospitals?

126
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:14,780
It likely does, yes. So hospitals are part of the 501c3 cluster.

127
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:19,460
So they are part of it. Okay.

128
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:27,920
So the IRS states that none of the earnings of these nonprofits may endure to any private shareholder individuals.

129
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:32,450
This is a key distinction with the nonprofit. There isn't a shareholder, right?

130
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:37,460
So in a Bible one, C three, there's a board of directors which are going to talk about quite a bit today.

131
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:44,430
There are contributors, there are staff, but there are not shareholders.

132
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:49,730
We're not distributing a percentage of what we make the profit to the shareholders.

133
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:55,910
Rather, those dollars that come in that are income go to our programs and if they're in surplus,

134
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:03,450
they're set aside on the balance sheet as assets that are then used for other purposes to fulfill the mission of the.

135
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:12,870
Now. No accident that your first assignment for our course is to review the 1990, which we're going to talk about today.

136
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:21,540
It's a very special and very long tax form that every nonprofit must complete every year.

137
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:29,010
It has very specific rules associated with it, very specific reporting points to it.

138
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:34,079
And here we find one of the first key distinctions between a traditional

139
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,680
corporate entity and a by 23 that we're going to be talking about in our course,

140
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,510
which is the nonprofit, is required to be extremely transparent.

141
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:48,200
It must report everything, what money it's receiving, where it's receiving it from,

142
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:52,230
who is receiving it from, where it's going, what it's using it for.

143
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:58,799
And as you'll see in the 1990, so much so to the granularity of what percentage of those dollars are coming in through

144
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,120
public support as to whether or not the organization can be considered a public charity,

145
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:10,020
treating a certain percentage of its revenue is coming from the sources that are able to designate it that way.

146
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,740
So there are lots of nonprofits.

147
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:19,950
I told you last week when we were talking that as you considered the organization you're going to work on for your assignment,

148
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,730
one, two and three, throughout the term that I want you to be focusing on those that are health related.

149
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:28,260
But I want to acknowledge that there's a lot more political lines, arts and culture,

150
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:34,110
research, museums that you might see, environmental protection organizations,

151
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:41,430
those that look to create a culture of appreciating the bricks on the walls, in particular communities,

152
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:51,389
those who are looking to protect the architecture of a particular place professional societies, labor, trade or business leagues.

153
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,600
All these are sitting inside of that large umbrella.

154
00:14:54,630 --> 00:15:00,360
All of them operate under these rules, but health related organizations are about 13% of them.

155
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,820
You can see here a bit more statistics wise is from 2015 from the Urban Institute.

156
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:09,930
A little bit more about what makes those up.

157
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,590
And you can kind of see, interestingly, what their assets are.

158
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:22,510
Now the number and expenses of reporting share of public charities are quite distinct.

159
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:28,780
And what this figure here is really meant to give you a sense of is where we see

160
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:36,640
that a large number of these organizations have expenses of $10 million or more.

161
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:41,530
Okay. Now, what is the reason that I say this or show this to you,

162
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:49,720
which is to set for us this distinction that we're going to make throughout the semester around the small versus the large organizations.

163
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:58,180
And this is our first question and a very foundational question that we'll be asking related to equity associated with these organizations,

164
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:04,780
which is not so much about the people that are being or the people who are receiving services as a result of the organization.

165
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:16,030
But about the organization's size itself, its ability to deliver, and what resources are needed in order to make that organization have that status.

166
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:20,229
It's 523, so it's a very big question that I want us to kind of keep in mind,

167
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,790
which is those large organizations that have access to capital, access to resources,

168
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,869
access to donors,

169
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:34,420
access to networks of people who can help them to achieve the status that they need achieve and maintain that status and report, etc.

170
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:40,240
What is their profile versus those that perhaps are coming from the more grassroots community

171
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,010
where there are a group of people who are looking to start an organization to achieve a mission,

172
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,430
to deliver on a certain service, but maybe don't have access to all of that.

173
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,200
And where is it fair or not fair in terms of their ability to access those resources,

174
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:59,860
specifically as it relates to grant dollars that the government may give for the foundations in the community might be willing to provide.

175
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:08,450
Now. It's no accident that the nonprofits have a unique set of challenges that they face from one,

176
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,060
they've got some managerial issues that they have to contend with.

177
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,490
For starters, they're constantly having to trade off between their mission and their resources.

178
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:21,230
So are we delivering on our mission, or are we adherent to what we say we're working on?

179
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:28,250
And are we getting the right number of resources to do that? Number two are the financial problems that may emerge.

180
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:34,460
They don't have the ability to have customers and have people attracted to the idea of distribution of shares.

181
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,460
So there's increased competition for government funding.

182
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:43,610
There is ongoing competition between organizations, which we'll talk about some throughout the course,

183
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:47,750
especially in our case on the blood bank, the Carolina blood bank.

184
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:53,690
We'll talk about it's a great example of the tension between a local organization and a large organization.

185
00:17:53,690 --> 00:18:00,530
So the blood bank that was started in the Carolina blood bank versus the American Red Cross, a smaller one and a larger one.

186
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,090
What they were trying to do in order to deliver on that same vision.

187
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:11,660
And then finally, issues of public trust. Does anyone remember Susan G.

188
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,250
Komen that the organization. Susan G. Coleman. Anyone want to throw up?

189
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:21,520
What do you remember about that organization? Go ahead.

190
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:30,410
I saw a couple of. But you have to remember that the energy problem, it was specifically with breast cancer.

191
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:37,250
And so a lot of people gave it a lot of people to the runs and then it came out marathons, runs pretty quick.

192
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:44,060
And then it came out that there was some misuse of funds. I believe there was some kind of mismanagement within the system.

193
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:49,159
And I remember people in my community being upset about that and definitely

194
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:54,719
start focusing more on more local organizations after that as a direct impact.

195
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,220
But so that's a big thing for an outside the United State.

196
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,960
I think that's a good summary of of of this point, which is the point of public trust,

197
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,510
which was that the organization had built a very large identity around its work,

198
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:15,200
all over the yogurt labels, all over merchandise, you know, people giving, going to the walks, etc.

199
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,230
And then through a series of unfortunate headlines,

200
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,570
the trust of the Down and the organization really lost a lot of its ability to access the resources.

201
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:28,910
So the trust component of these organizations is very premier in terms of how we think about them.

202
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:35,540
And that's why the 1990 is a great place to start, because we're saying you must report so that we can be arbitrary,

203
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:45,110
but rather to say with the responsibility that you have and with the power that you're getting to be able to collect donation dollars,

204
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:53,120
to be able to be exempt from corporate taxes in this way, we expect a certain level of of behavior from these organizations.

205
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,219
So that's I think that's a good way of thinking about it and a good way for us to sort of keep in mind

206
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,930
that the public trust component is really key in the way that we think about these organizations.

207
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:10,330
All right. So we talked a little bit about how these organizations are benefiting society.

208
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,679
We've talked some about the critical role that they're playing in creating greater

209
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:20,260
equity and creating thriving communities somewhat about their public interest.

210
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:26,530
And now I want to kind of pivot to what their role and function is as it pertains to the public's needs,

211
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:32,020
but also how they structure their time in their offerings.

212
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:42,580
So some changes in the nonprofit revenues by field, you'll see that there's been quite a bit of change in the health category.

213
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:49,490
One of the higher ones. And then there are other organizations that sort of sit inside of this ecosystem.

214
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:58,489
So voluntary organizations, I just want to mention as quickly just as that one that you might encounter are those that are organized on a national,

215
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:05,090
state or local basis and supported primarily through volunteer voluntary contributions from the public at large.

216
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:14,870
These organizations that are receiving dollars from the public at large for delivery of programs, services, research, etc.

217
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:21,670
What are their functions? Well, here you can see that they typically have these pillars associated with their mission.

218
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:31,990
And that key to this are key to keeping in mind to this is that they are actively working in all of these different spaces to move something forward,

219
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,910
educate, demonstrate, advance research.

220
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:41,220
All of these are part of these organizations, charter to move something forward.

221
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:47,740
Again, a distinction from a company that maybe is not labeled with the 523 designation where they

222
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:54,460
don't necessarily have this attribution of having to deliver in a particular category.

223
00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:03,240
The C-4. We talked about this a few minutes ago. But just again, to review, the vast majority of them are advocacy organizations.

224
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,250
A small number of them are HMOs and other medical and dental insurance plans.

225
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,160
But again, the key difference that I want you to keep in mind, those are tax exempt gifts to see.

226
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,910
Fords are not tax deductible. Okay.

227
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:25,150
Yeah it's kind of 501c for is V like is there a limit on how much lobbying they can do or can they do whatever they want?

228
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,180
They have very, very, very few restrictions.

229
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:39,520
Uh, Citizens United, the Supreme Court decision from 2010 really cemented a very laissez faire approach to how these organizations operate.

230
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:45,360
There used to be a lot more rules, and then the Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to essentially impose them.

231
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,210
And so, you know, much has changed in the last.

232
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,890
12 years. But say 15. I want to speed up time any faster than it's uploading.

233
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:07,700
Okay. Some examples of organizations and I've organized these for you in a way.

234
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:20,420
In a continuum. Larger ones here on the left or medium sized regional ones in the center, and more local organizations on the right.

235
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:25,240
The American Cancer Society. Very, very large. 511c3.

236
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:34,900
It's good example along with the American Heart Association and JD, RF all three are typically having a corporate headquarters in one city,

237
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:41,470
and then you'll see that they have separate chapters, separate chapters that manage their affairs within states or regions.

238
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:47,520
In the center, you see organizations here that are more regional, perhaps in their focus.

239
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,509
Collectively,

240
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:56,430
Development Inc is an organization in Detroit that's primarily serving black families and different issues related to black family welfare.

241
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:00,150
United We Dream, an organization that works inside of immigration.

242
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:07,589
On the right, you'll see more local organizations Growth for Change as an organization Atlanta

243
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:12,600
based in Atlanta that does work around primarily Black Women Affirmations,

244
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:20,940
an organization in Ferndale that does work around LGBTQ plus advocacy, as well as services for the LGBTQ community.

245
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:25,800
And then Grandmothers Against Gun Violence Foundation, an organization in Seattle.

246
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:33,750
Now, part of the reason I show you all these organizations here in this continuum is to make it clear that you'll very often see

247
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:40,080
organizations that maybe at the local level here that may mimic an organization that might be over here at the larger level.

248
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:48,299
And that's to remind you, as you keep in mind, that just because an organization exists at the larger scale level doesn't necessarily

249
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:52,800
mean that it's serving all the needs in the community associated with that cause.

250
00:24:53,190 --> 00:25:00,720
So if I'm addressing gun violence in a particular community through a national through a chapter of a national organization,

251
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:08,249
may only be able to serve as a very narrow part of those of that community's needs versus an organization that's based in that community,

252
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,489
that has donors from that community, that has a board that's based in that community.

253
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:18,150
It's thinking very clearly and only about that community's needs as it pertains to that issue.

254
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:25,870
So we talked about the increased competition. We've talked about the ongoing competition with other organizational types.

255
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,309
Some of you mentioned in in our first your your interests in either starting

256
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:36,400
an organization or in perhaps working in inside of the social impact space.

257
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:43,900
Perhaps you might move on to work in a corporate environment that's not five one C3, but you'll be working in social entrepreneurship.

258
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:51,010
I just want to mention again that these organizations are distinct from those, but also synergistically, very much aligned.

259
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:57,340
But again, we have to keep in mind the growth in the nonprofit sector.

260
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:05,830
And again, that tension between the capacity of the organization to deliver and what it needs to deliver upon.

261
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:12,890
So if my organization is responsible for addressing food insecurity in a community,

262
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:18,170
if they don't have enough resources in order to deliver on that, what exactly am I doing?

263
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,890
What programs are my able to serve? How many people are my serving?

264
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:26,890
And to a certain point, am I actually delivering on the services,

265
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:31,969
or am I just able to deliver such that I can put out an annual report and continue

266
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:35,300
to run a payroll and have employees and kind of have the organization exist?

267
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:43,489
So I want to be clear. My goal in in our discussions and how we sort of think about these organizations

268
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:47,570
from different angles is not to sow seeds of mistrust about the organization,

269
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:54,770
but to help you to think critically about the organization's operations and really think about are they working toward their mission?

270
00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:00,650
Are they drifting away from it? You know, are they really seeming like they're on autopilot,

271
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:07,370
just kind of doing something over and over because they have a staff and they have to keep going and they don't want to deviate.

272
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:12,110
And then there are going to be organizations that are working toward a cause that completely changes.

273
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,770
March of Dimes is a great example. They were familiar with that organization.

274
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:20,260
March of Dimes. Go ahead. Throw it out with your babies.

275
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,520
Premature babies. Okay. So what else were they responsible for?

276
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,470
You remember some of. They are also responsible for quite a bit for polio work around polio.

277
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,840
Years ago, some, not all, but some. And their missions changed.

278
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:46,910
A lot of things have changed because polio was for some time eradicated in the United States and that, you know, such the world turns,

279
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:52,370
but the organization finds itself in a precarious situation in which maybe as its goal

280
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:58,910
is swept away by greater action along the lines of the access of other entities.

281
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:05,090
So again, not to say that an organization's sole mission is to be focused on one thing,

282
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:08,840
although organizations like these that are in the larger category,

283
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:18,470
like, for example, giraffe, that advocates and works toward developing awareness, but also about treatments and cures for type one diabetes.

284
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,820
You have to ask the question, what if a cure is found for type one diabetes?

285
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:26,030
What is the role of that organization? What is its mission?

286
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:34,550
And then you have to put on your sort of critical glasses and say, does the organization have an interest in moving that mission forward?

287
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:44,630
Or does it have an interest in kind of creating a friendlier space for those who are perhaps experiencing some of the challenges associated with this?

288
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,420
So, again, it's not to apply a values judgment.

289
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:55,069
And I want to be very clear as we have our discussions and we structure our our case presentations, etc., we're not saying one is bad or one is good.

290
00:28:55,070 --> 00:29:03,170
You know, one is not right and one is, you know, right. It's really more so to say, how do we look at them from all the different perspectives?

291
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:08,330
And then how do we as future managers, as future leaders, are we going to say, okay,

292
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,720
I'm going to consider all the different parts and then I'm going to make a decision.

293
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:19,000
Okay. Back to that term, charitable. We talked about it a little bit earlier.

294
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:24,010
So the nonprofit has to serve the public through a community mission.

295
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,540
Very important point, though, and it's not the same as only providing charity.

296
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:33,850
Okay. So delivering on a mission does not necessarily mean that we are, you know,

297
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:39,880
just giving away a service or just giving something because it's a good idea.

298
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:46,659
Many of these organizations you'll find, like the blood bank example I gave, and this is a preview for the case presentation.

299
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:55,360
It was meant to do this. So that organization, they were in the business of supplying blood for those who needed blood transfusions.

300
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,470
So too is the Red Cross in that business competition between the two.

301
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,080
Right. So it's not just that, yeah, we supply blood for blood transfusions,

302
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:12,360
but also we are serving the community and we have a particular corporate interest in terms of what we're looking to achieve.

303
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:20,030
Question so far. How was everyone's weekend?

304
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:28,700
Good. Okay, let's pivot to mission, vision and values.

305
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,970
So mission, vision and values. We're going to talk about those terms for the next 13 weeks or so.

306
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:42,140
We'll be talking about them all the time. These are the three key terms you're going to hear over and over as it pertains to a nonprofit organization.

307
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:46,250
What is its mission? What is its vision? What are its values?

308
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:50,090
The mission guides every single thing that the nonprofit does.

309
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:54,500
It's perhaps the most distinct part of having a five and 1c3 designation.

310
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:00,470
And the first thing that the IRS asks for in setting one up and in your annual reporting.

311
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,550
What's your mission? Did you deliver?

312
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:08,710
Now, if I make my mission too structured or too specific, well, then I'm not going to be able to deliver much on it.

313
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:12,020
Because things change, things evolve.

314
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:17,210
So very often the mission of an organization is asking the why?

315
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,840
Why does the organization exist at its most meaningful level?

316
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:25,070
And it's often very aspirational. It's not something that you're going to see as you know.

317
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:33,680
Our mission is to ensure that every street has 20 bricks inside of it's paved road for the next ten years.

318
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:38,180
That's a very specific objective. What I just laid out the mission instead.

319
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:43,010
Maybe our goal is to see a world in which the streets are paved for the future.

320
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,620
Right. Very broad term. Street a future.

321
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,990
Okay. So that's, again, a broader statement.

322
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:59,900
The vision is a compelling picture of what the organization will look like in the future and what different metrics might define success.

323
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,740
I'm going to go through some examples here of these.

324
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:09,410
And the values are the boundaries that the organization uses, those those key pieces that help to guide its mission.

325
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:18,530
So when we think about the mission, vision and values, we can then start to think about that as fitting inside of the organizational infrastructure.

326
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:25,310
So we'll see how they influence the organization's behavior, how they create a culture inside of an organization,

327
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:31,580
and specifically how the outcome of all of that is the performance of an organization at every level.

328
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,760
So clear missions, clear visions and values,

329
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:42,950
clear groups of these four things are going to help facilitate the strategy of an organization and align it toward the consensus that it's looking to.

330
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:48,180
Let's take a look at some of the ones that we were talking about in that slide. Give me an example.

331
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:53,030
So the American Cancer Societies values listed up here on the top, right?

332
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:59,270
But here you can see its mission to save lives, celebrate life, and lead the fight for a world without cancer.

333
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,200
Very broad. Very broad. But key focus in this mission.

334
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,830
Right. So lead the fight for a world without cancer.

335
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:15,270
We have to focus on what specific issue the organization is addressing, but not necessarily a specific level of every detail.

336
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:22,890
And that's what provides the organization with its maximal ability to innovate and kind of adjust as it moves through time.

337
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:29,880
Because these organizations are often very much set up to be longstanding pillars in the community.

338
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:34,890
They're not really set up to just kind of come in and then go out a couple of years later.

339
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:39,629
It takes time. It takes many years. You'll see in your first assignment, I'm going to ask you to review.

340
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:42,840
Five years of now. 95 years. Why?

341
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:49,660
Because things change over time and things sort of evolve as the organization comes to its different uses.

342
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:54,840
But you can see mission, vision values here for the American Cancer Society.

343
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,810
On the left is the mission for affirmations to provide a welcoming space for people of all sexual orientations,

344
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:09,160
gender identities and expressions and cultures can find support and unconditional acceptance, and where they can learn, grow, socialize and feel safe.

345
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:14,440
All right. So the distinct difference between this mission and this mission.

346
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:21,930
What do we. What's different about. A and B.

347
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:37,720
It's far more specific. It's about marketing the specific groups it's trying to look for.

348
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,500
What do we think if we apply that same principle on this mission?

349
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:54,640
What would happen? So we made this mission much more specific, much more clear about specific groups of people.

350
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,290
So it would be more difficult to achieve if we make it more specific for this one,

351
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:02,440
because it's a fight against cancer and you never know how it comes out.

352
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,740
Thank you to both for sharing that.

353
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:15,430
So I think you both make excellent points here, which is that the mission of the organization, perhaps the larger it is, the more established it is,

354
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:25,190
the broader it may become because it's creating many, many different, let's call it, tentacles through which it's sort of looking to achieve its goal.

355
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:29,470
And the longer it's established, the longer it has to kind of think about creative ways to achieve it.

356
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,650
You can see here, girls for a change, empowering young women by inviting them to design lead fun funded,

357
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:40,670
implement social change projects that tackle issues girls face in their own neighborhoods.

358
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:45,950
So one question I would ask if I was working with this organization, I might I might ask, okay,

359
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:56,479
so what happens if the organization no longer is going to be looking for programs that are providing young women to design,

360
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:05,180
lead, fund and implement social change projects? What if we pivot to a version of this where the organization is delivering programs

361
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:10,159
in which young women are evaluating these types of social change projects,

362
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,610
or young women are recipients of grants for these types?

363
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:20,719
So again, I would ask, you know, as you think through a mission, give some thought, how specific is it, A, but B,

364
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,540
is it creating a scenario in which the organization may have trouble adhering to what it is that it's saying it's going to do?

365
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:33,150
Well, good governance of an organization is really critical to a lot of what we see here.

366
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:39,240
And this is where I want to kind of start to pivot toward the different roles that you'll see inside of organizations.

367
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:45,000
So we have to establish and sustain the mission, vision and values of the organization.

368
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:52,740
And we need to move toward the ability for the board to identify and meet stakeholders needs.

369
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:59,370
So all of these sort of milestones throughout help us to move toward that direction of the board.

370
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:06,780
The board, you hear it all the time. The board, the board, the board, the board of directors, the board members.

371
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,200
The President of the board. The Treasurer of the board. What's the board?

372
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:15,750
Anyone have any experience with the board in the nonprofit? Yeah.

373
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:21,149
Oh, I was just saying I have experience, but it really, I mean, I guess the best way could explain a board.

374
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:25,470
It's just there's a representation among a lot of different fields and everyone has

375
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:30,420
expertize in one field that contributes to the overall running of an efficient.

376
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:38,250
Organization. Not that there's like meetings and just to make sure everything is moving along as it should be.

377
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:42,740
Okay. Very good. Excellent. Thank you for sharing. Others are there to lobby.

378
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,460
The decision makers for the nonprofit can be the board.

379
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,150
Often they're kind of like an oversight sort of role.

380
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:56,349
They're not actually doing the day to day functioning of the organization, but they're saying like,

381
00:37:56,350 --> 00:38:02,220
yes, we can move in this direction or else you can move in that direction. And like they do the budget and stuff like that, you know?

382
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:06,450
Yeah, I love them, but. Okay. Okay. Right.

383
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,390
I think everyone has kind of articulated some core attributes of the board of directors.

384
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:17,200
And here you have a little bit of a definition. They're tasked with the legal responsibility to govern their organization.

385
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:22,130
Okay. That's really broad. It's governed the organization.

386
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,080
What on earth is that supposed to mean? But I can govern the organization however I want, right?

387
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:30,850
I am the board. I am the board. I hire the CEO.

388
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:36,990
It's my job. This is the reason why organizations create bylaws.

389
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:41,910
Bylaws are the most important part of a nonprofit's operation.

390
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:47,220
Why are they? Well, for starters, they govern the board.

391
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:51,510
The board has authority to make decisions about a lot of things.

392
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:58,110
And we often forget we often forget how much authority they actually have an electoral situations.

393
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:07,200
So those are words that are elected school boards, local canvasing boards, environmental boards, all these boards.

394
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,380
We sometimes don't really remember how much authority they do, how they vote.

395
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:16,650
They take a vote and they decide, is it going through?

396
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,370
Is it not?

397
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:29,760
We saw or maybe you all saw the the news last week that the board of canvassers at the state level had made a decision and really make a decision.

398
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:39,870
It was deadlocked with two versus two. I have two members who voted yes and whoever voted no over whether or not the state could

399
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:45,510
proceed with a constitutional amendment on the ballot in the fall related to abortion.

400
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:52,589
And the case really boiled down to two members said that due to a technicality related to the

401
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:57,300
spacing of words on this proposal and whether or not there were spaces between certain words,

402
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,820
they felt that that was not acceptable to go before voters in the fall.

403
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:09,690
And another two members said, well, we do feel that that's acceptable to go forward to versus two, it's deadlocked so can't move forward.

404
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:16,260
So four to that question and I'm sure it will it will certainly become a case of it.

405
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:22,380
To me, it's already becoming a case, a legal case. COURT To that question is, what is the charter of that board?

406
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:26,420
What is its responsibility? What is it supposed to be working on?

407
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,860
What is it not supposed to be working on? You know,

408
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:37,530
these questions will be ones that are going to have to get decided in court and get decided by a lot of different opinion makers and legal experts.

409
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,630
But the key that I want to emphasize here is how critical those bylaws are now.

410
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:50,430
Elected boards sometimes don't have a specific set of bylaws necessarily, because they're typically governed by,

411
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:56,610
you know, municipalities or or by the state or kind of, you know, state law, constitutional law, etc.

412
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:03,570
But inside of a nonprofit, I want you to think of the bylaws as being the legal code that the organization operates under.

413
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:13,080
Think about a condo association board. Right. So that board is entrusted with managing the dues for all the co-owners who pay dues every month.

414
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:19,710
And they make decisions, you know, shall they go through and repave the road in the association, should they not?

415
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,950
But they make those decisions. They might hire someone day to day to deal with your concerns if you live there.

416
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:30,030
But the board decides ultimately whether or not the funds are going to be appropriated.

417
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:34,190
So the board does carry quite a bit of responsibility. Now.

418
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:39,480
Part of its role is to ensure that it has sound financial management for the organization,

419
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:45,060
that it has a clear mission and purpose, that it's improving the organization's programs.

420
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:53,040
But perhaps its most critical point that it is working under its appointing, supporting and evaluating the CEO.

421
00:41:53,700 --> 00:42:00,390
So the CEO of the organization, the chief executive officer, they are serving at the pleasure of the board.

422
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,700
So we saw, for example,

423
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:11,640
last year that the Board of Regents at the University of Michigan voted unanimously to remove President Schlissel as president of the university.

424
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:18,660
This was something only the board could do. As it was the board who had the authority in order for that to take place.

425
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:23,880
But of course, the charter that that board operates under and again, you know,

426
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:33,750
every 523 organization board has said the set of bylaws needs to explicitly lay out what all those provisions are and how decisions are getting made.

427
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:43,500
So board members have a variety of duties. The composition of the board helps to accomplish its functions and represent different community interests.

428
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:46,770
And it's interfacing primarily with the CEO.

429
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:57,989
So in a well-functioning board, you usually are not going to see board members coming in to the chief administrator that works inside of a division,

430
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:04,800
inside of a sub unit, inside of a core team in the organization if they're interacting with that person.

431
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:08,460
Usually that means they're probably overstepping their authority,

432
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:12,840
meaning they're kind of getting involved in an area that the CEO is going to need to be managing.

433
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:19,620
The CEO will hire and grant powers to other members of the leadership team, and they sort of dictate those rules.

434
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:26,760
So the board of directors is really going to interface with the CEO. So a successful CEO of an organization, one that's really,

435
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:36,450
really working toward the key principles of leadership in a five of 23 is going to be one who is board focused or focused.

436
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:44,670
Now, that doesn't mean catering to the board or just sort of doing whatever the board says it needs, helping to empower the board to fulfill its role,

437
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:50,879
providing the proper financial reporting, providing the proper explanations for things,

438
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,660
creating transparency, creating a place for the board to have a role.

439
00:43:55,350 --> 00:44:00,600
Giving board members an opportunity to have involvement that maybe allows them to feel like they own a piece of things,

440
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:06,930
even though very much so, they may not have the expertize to really know what to do, but rather would like to weigh in.

441
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:15,960
So a couple different models that we kind of see in the literature related to the governance of organizations.

442
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:23,430
I outlined them here for you and you can see, but this figure kind of gives you the general idea of what I mean.

443
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:30,340
So model on the left, the board and the CEO are really sitting on opposite sides.

444
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:34,589
The CEO sits on one side of the table. The board is really on the other side.

445
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:39,150
And the two are sort of having to kind of, you know, play against each other.

446
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:47,670
The other model is really thinking about the board in the CEO in a more integrated capacity, the board driving strategic decisions,

447
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:53,640
the board acting in its fiduciary capacity to make sure the finances are being spent responsibly and helping to generate.

448
00:44:55,090 --> 00:45:01,510
So there are many governing functions then that you can think about in terms of the board and I mentioned several of them that we just talked about.

449
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:07,540
Here you can see many of them here. The board is responsible for voting on the establishment of the mission, vision and values.

450
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:10,960
If you want to change the mission, it's something that the board would need to vote on.

451
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:15,070
They're going to oversee quality of service of the delivery of the programs.

452
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:21,820
So the big question that I would have for all of you is, as you think about the board and its composition,

453
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:31,630
then you might start to think about what the disparity is between who those board members are and who the community that it's serving will be.

454
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:40,030
So the board may very well be composed of members who are able to financially give to the organization,

455
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:48,910
who may carry power or access in the community, who may have the ability to guide decision making through their access to a network.

456
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:55,900
But the question that I would ask back is, does that necessarily mean that they reflect the community's composition?

457
00:45:56,950 --> 00:46:04,179
Let's take an example of this. So nonprofit health care organizations in Texas and board diversity.

458
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:08,530
This was a study that was done by the Texas Health Care Trustees.

459
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:16,930
This is an organization in Texas that is an affiliation of association of hospitals, health systems, specifically their board members.

460
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:25,689
So they did a survey of about 260 of the members, and they were thinking a little bit about the board diversity and how it was impacting or

461
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:31,600
influencing the disparities or health disparities that were being addressed by the organization.

462
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,180
So the first question that I bring to your attention,

463
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:41,780
you're on the right is the frequency with which the board is talking about the very demographics of the community.

464
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:49,280
So are they even talking about the community itself? So about half say once or twice in the past 12 months they talk about it.

465
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,820
But 13%, 13% said not in the past year.

466
00:46:54,830 --> 00:47:01,770
We haven't really even talked about the community. Then we look at kind of, you know, what the composition is.

467
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:05,340
So 72% of those are those who identify as male.

468
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:11,010
28% of those who identify as female. You can see here the age trajectory of the board.

469
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,750
So 96% of respondents are over the age of 46.

470
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:20,210
A third of them are over the age of 70.

471
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:27,320
Now, one might make the case that, you know, the board is relying on people who are more established in their careers,

472
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:31,160
who have been working professionally for a long time. They've cemented those relationships.

473
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,580
They have access to people. They have access to resources and network, etc.

474
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:44,510
But then you have to continue to kind of ask the questions of, you know, what the board members composition is.

475
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,729
So here they ask the question of respondents who say their organization has a

476
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:56,540
documented plan for recruitment that is aligned aligned with principles of diversity,

477
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:02,630
equity and inclusion. So 35% say no and about 38% are not sure.

478
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:11,480
So interestingly, the unsure component speaks to whether or not the CEO of the organization is helping the board to really fulfill its role.

479
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:18,380
Is the board really getting the help it needs from its leader that it wanted to help them consider those principles?

480
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,590
I mentioned the gender composition here.

481
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:32,700
As I said, 49% of the state of Texas, those who identify as male, 72% of the board of the board members are those who identify as male.

482
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:39,630
You can see the disparity is quite clear if you're also among those who identify as female.

483
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,850
Here we can take a look at the composition on age.

484
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:49,680
So we're much more oversampled than the 70 plus year old category.

485
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:57,120
And then we can take a look here at how the boards look in terms of race and ethnicity.

486
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:04,320
So far, 40% of those in the state of Texas are identifying as Caucasian or white.

487
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,060
85% of board members identifying as Caucasian or white.

488
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:14,670
You can see here for Hispanic, Latino, Latino, Spanish origin.

489
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:20,040
7.5% on the board in the board composition.

490
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:23,790
But 40% of the population of the state of Texas.

491
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:28,379
So this is something that I want to bring to your attention,

492
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:32,310
because really what I would like us to kind of think about throughout the term

493
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:37,260
is not just what the role of the board is or what the role of the CEO is,

494
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:40,440
what, what, what, what is there. But structurally,

495
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:44,820
what these organizations look like and why they make the decisions that they

496
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:49,770
do and whether or not they have the components or the assets or the internal

497
00:49:49,770 --> 00:50:00,000
capability to necessarily work in the space that they're working in and start to make decisions about communities or populations that they're serving.

498
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,740
And applause there for a moment. Questions? Comments.

499
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,330
Yes. Who holds the board of companies? Is it just the CEO or the.

500
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:13,290
How much power? Because that's the bylaws, too. It's a great question.

501
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:18,390
It's second shareholders. While there are no shareholders.

502
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:21,300
See, that's the key. That's a great. So great. I'm glad you brought that up.

503
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:26,820
So, so, so in a corporate situation, the shareholders hold them responsible.

504
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:30,620
The shareholders can vote and say, no, we're done with you both.

505
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:34,860
You're not you're not really helping us. You're not doing what we like. So that's it.

506
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:41,520
But in a nonprofit situation or in 523, it really is boiled down to those bylaws.

507
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,750
What's the term of a board member who's responsible for recruiting them?

508
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:49,950
And what's the process for removing a board member out force?

509
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:55,770
A board that wants to keep itself in a sort of authority over an organization may choose

510
00:50:55,890 --> 00:51:00,870
leadership to recruit leadership that reflects its priorities so that there's synergy.

511
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:05,030
That model that I was showing you where you had kind of board versus CEO.

512
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:09,049
You know, that's not necessarily the ideal ecosystem because both have interests.

513
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:14,210
Board members have interest to stay as board members. You know, CEO has interest to stay in its role.

514
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:20,010
Other companies did so with having a board for non profit.

515
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,270
Is it just like a good governance practice to have one? But is that a requirement required?

516
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,700
I must have one. Yeah, that's.

517
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:33,060
So when you file in 1990, you'll see you're required to disclose who your board members are, how much they're compensated, and all that.

518
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:43,650
So do you think the IRS will ever require a diversity among the board relative to the community they serve?

519
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:54,259
It's a great question. What do we think? What do we think? You're welcome to join or other fun.

520
00:51:54,260 --> 00:52:00,710
Something that I feel like it's probably a long way off, sadly, but I just can't help but think why isn't that a requirement?

521
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:06,450
When you see these disparities and. But what do we think on that question?

522
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:11,980
And I think it probably has to be some sort of executive directive or something.

523
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:21,870
To control the race by proxy know. That would be the quickest way, I think would be difficult for viruses to kind of do that on their own,

524
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:26,400
because if the executive branch of government knew that, I would be fine.

525
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:31,370
But I think if your budget measures are not.

526
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:45,559
I can see it more likely that for the Minister I prefer to disclose the demographic makeup of their board as opposed to it being required.

527
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:51,490
But it matches the community. What I feel like.

528
00:52:52,030 --> 00:53:00,459
What? What? Why do you think? But because I think it's more passive and it shows that there is an interest and this

529
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:04,720
is important that like making a requirement that would be really controversial.

530
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:10,270
And so I feel diversity could be important.

531
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:17,800
But in this particular case, I feel like more than diversity, it's important to have people who share the same vision towards the.

532
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:27,280
The process. You know, it's also, again, complex in what you define as diversity.

533
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:37,270
It's just race or language or like depending if you have to go by the financial makeup of the community as well.

534
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:43,150
I feel like it would also get challenged in court by conservatives.

535
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:51,340
Government. This also just kind of occurred to me that depending on the size of the board, I mean,

536
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:57,000
if you're trying to have quite represented improvement, it's just literally not possible in terms of five people on the board.

537
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,980
There's, you know, ten different groups you're trying to represent.

538
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:04,410
You know, you're going to run into problems there with trying to make requirements that, you know,

539
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:11,760
the numbers are going out to the point, you know, kind of diversity of opinion, you know.

540
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:20,580
Federal tissue just as often. I think some boards do have some kind of diversity.

541
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:26,430
The comparisons are right. Like I know in New Mexico, the Board of Regents of the university,

542
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:34,050
the governor appoints them and they can all be like the governor can only appoint a certain degree of public concern about independence.

543
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:40,840
Missouri Democrats have to be. So it's an interesting point you bring up.

544
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:47,280
Everyone, thank you for sharing all that on this topic because, you know, that's exactly where the governor is pointing.

545
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:51,370
The Board of Regents, University of Michigan is elected, so voters elect statewide.

546
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:56,980
But to the point of some of this and kind of specifically to this slide here,

547
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:01,600
we have to think about, you know, who does the organization want on its board?

548
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:06,819
You know, is there a desire organizationally to have certain people on the board that are able

549
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:11,770
to do certain things that it's looking to have assets that it's looking to achieve?

550
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:19,990
And what are the motivations that the organization is looking to try and satisfy in its delivery of its core programs and its mission?

551
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:25,570
And that's the question that I think that I want to pose to all of you to kind of keep thinking about is what.

552
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:30,770
Does the organization what what is its interests? What is its desire?

553
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:37,610
What are its desires, etc.? So again, not to say one is right or wrong, but rather, you know what?

554
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:40,910
What guides the decision making process or the thought process?

555
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:45,020
One example to, uh, to to this point, though,

556
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:49,760
for federally qualified health centers is that 51% of the board of every

557
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,660
qualified health center has to be members who receive services from that center.

558
00:55:54,050 --> 00:56:05,750
So this is an example where a board is created with a certain requirement in terms of who is there now receiving services from that center.

559
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:09,050
All kinds of people can come and receive services from the center.

560
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,600
So, you know, you see that the definitions get set very broadly because at the end of the day,

561
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:21,140
the organization is looking to try and have certain influencers in its organization to, um, you know, have involved.

562
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:26,540
So that's why one of the things that we're really looking at in your assignment is I'm going to be asking you to look at the board,

563
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:31,249
look at the board of the organization that you're studying and get a sense not just of who's there,

564
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:36,100
but where do they work, where do they curry the majority of their employees?

565
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:41,600
Where is it that they have worked before? You know what? Why do you think maybe those people are on the board?

566
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,790
You know, why did the organization ask them to be part of the board, etc.?

567
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:56,610
Okay. We're going to pivot here and just kind of quickly walk through a few mechanics on the organizations themselves,

568
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:02,520
and then we will be concluding the monologue part of today.

569
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:09,559
I want to hear from all of. All right. Resource dependance theory, organizational theory.

570
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:13,190
Very important to how we think about organizations and how they operate.

571
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:19,940
It is that organizational theory that was developed by sociologists and other social scientists.

572
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:24,860
It really thinks about how we explain behavior in terms of an organization's

573
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:32,090
reliance on external constituencies for their revenue and for their resources.

574
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:34,190
So we think about nonprofits.

575
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:42,530
We can be focusing on the interdependencies with external organizations and the individuals who are going to hold power over them.

576
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:49,129
Okay. So key to this theoretical principle is this idea of displacement that an organization

577
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:54,380
might be looking to please those that have power in donors or board members.

578
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:59,420
And by adjusting their activities, you know, changing the fundraiser to accommodate a donor,

579
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:03,410
changing the building if we're going to build changing the service that we're going to deliver,

580
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,999
and then internal players could start to emerge as powerbrokers.

581
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,809
So the person who raises the most money for an organization starts to be the one

582
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:14,720
who gets to all of a sudden get asked what they think about certain things.

583
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:19,730
You know, that the CEO may decide to do something, but really they're going to consult with the person who's giving the most.

584
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:27,820
ISO more. ISO more ISM is another organizational theory that we can apply to nonprofit organizations.

585
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:35,380
It recognizes the importance of an organization's environment as a predictor of how it's going to behave.

586
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:39,790
So as the organization embraces its norms, its values, its beliefs.

587
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:47,560
ISO morph ISM is really relating to how the organizations start to become more like each other.

588
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:56,900
Let's think about an example. Military services specifically for those wounded in conflict.

589
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:01,490
Disabled American Veterans. Wounded Warriors. USO.

590
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:05,000
Three organizations that deliver very similar services.

591
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:11,150
And if you look across their programs, you start to kind of see, okay, they're sort of, you know, doing similar things.

592
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:21,470
So these organizations start to not necessarily compete, but look at different types of adherence.

593
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,950
So we could think about it through terms like coercive.

594
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:30,500
So this is the idea that we might have forced ice or more business stemming from regulation.

595
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:36,170
So the comment that was made about, you know, can we mandate that the board has a certain number of directors, you know,

596
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:45,379
that could be a coercive way to try and make organizations look similar mimetic that forces so you know,

597
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:51,350
organizations looking to mimic each other what they're doing. So not for profit hospital development departments often do this.

598
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:53,210
You know, they'll look to copy each other.

599
00:59:53,600 --> 01:00:01,500
This foundation went and this fundraiser we're going to do with you, how many of you have ever heard of a golf outing for a nonprofit?

600
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:05,450
Raise your hand. Yeah. Okay. Anyone here play ball?

601
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:10,870
Well, people, if you been to one. Okay.

602
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:14,580
Was it fun? Sure.

603
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:19,319
Probably about the same as the one that you would have been to in another state or another state.

604
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:26,100
They're all about the same. They kind of study each other. You know, I call my friend in Pennsylvania and I say, Hey, you're throwing a golf outing.

605
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:29,730
Okay, I'm doing one in California. Okay. What did you do? Okay, well, I'm doing it at this club.

606
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:36,090
You're doing a backflip. Okay, great. Thank you. All right. So, you know, this is what happens is things start to, you know,

607
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:40,380
start to look and so we start to see that organizations don't necessarily act creatively.

608
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:44,910
That's very possible that the community that that organization is serving really has no connection to ball.

609
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:51,389
Right. It may be more meaningful for that organization to go inside of a community center in

610
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:54,690
the middle of the community where it's serving and set up some kind of an arts program.

611
01:00:55,050 --> 01:01:00,420
That would be great, wonderful, you know, a great way to bring people together and have donors, have a chance to interact with the community, etc.

612
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:08,459
But we see these memetic pressures that emerge. Then we also see some normative components.

613
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:13,890
So all physicians following a certain ethical code, you know, things that create norms within organizations.

614
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:18,870
All right, I'm gonna run through these real quickly. Are we talking about them all term?

615
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,360
Yes. Are we getting a study at all?

616
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:29,530
It's new public management, area of research, generation of resource generation, instead of working on being dependent on resources.

617
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:37,860
So I think I have the sentiments, whatever to do versus organization that says, okay, let me generate as many resources as possible and go for it.

618
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:42,570
I believe that's a new management term, but our way of looking at the forces in general is correct.

619
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:46,950
So thank you for bringing it up. What we will do is, as we take apart the cases,

620
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:51,089
I'm going to ask everyone to really think about theoretically where we're applying

621
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:55,200
classical theory that we might be talking about and more contemporary theory.

622
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:59,280
I do that on purpose so that we can all work together to think about how each of

623
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:03,210
these cases help to guide us through some of the newer structures and systems.

624
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:10,320
Right. No, no. Great question. Okay. So CEO Chief Executive Officer.

625
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:16,600
CFO, Chief Financial Officer. They're responsible for all the financing parts of the organization.

626
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:20,400
They handle the budget, they handle the contract investments.

627
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:28,010
Usually the finance team is working on this overseen by the CFO, chief information officer is reporting to the CEO.

628
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:33,389
They're usually handling things related to technology information, exchange of information,

629
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:43,440
all that the chief operating officer usually working in terms of their role to see that organizational activities are being delivered appropriately.

630
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:48,990
The chief nursing officer reported in a health care delivery organization they're

631
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:54,120
responsible for complications associated with nursing or related attributes.

632
01:02:54,780 --> 01:03:02,670
The Chief Diversity Officer. This is a position that's usually focused on principles of diversity, equity and inclusion.

633
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:09,209
And I would pose the question to everyone with regards to this particular position is whether or not

634
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:15,960
it's the responsibility of one person on the leadership team to think about DNI and other components

635
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:20,760
or whether or not it's the responsibility of every member of the leadership team to really be thinking

636
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:27,900
critically about the organization's contribution to a more equitable and just delivery of services.

637
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:34,860
So this is another example where, as we think about the structure of the organization, I want you to really give thought critically to,

638
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:43,350
you know, does the role that's established traditionally, you know, have some need for evolution and to the point of theoretical evolution?

639
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:47,610
You know, sometimes classical theories that we talk about there, they're a bit arcane.

640
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:50,520
You know, they don't necessarily reflect the composition of what is.

641
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:56,129
So having a chief diversity officer maybe something that is going back to the Eisenhower Worf wharfies

642
01:03:56,130 --> 01:04:00,440
in principle mimetic meaning organizations saying oh will you have a chief diversity officer?

643
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:07,739
Well, I'll have one too. But that doesn't necessarily mean that that is the most effective or the most equitable way to ensure

644
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:14,400
that the organization is advancing a leadership that's reflective of key principles of inclusion.

645
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:20,400
Chief medical officer again for a health care delivery organization.

646
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:23,910
And then finally, another CTO, the chief development officer.

647
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:29,730
We're going to talk quite a bit about the chief development officer and the role of philanthropy in organizations in a few weeks.

648
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:37,979
But this person is typically very much at the center of all things, philanthropy and arguably carrying a lot of power in the organization,

649
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:43,139
even more so sometimes than the CEO, because they control where the dollars are coming from,

650
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:46,620
specifically from the donors who are giving the largest gifts.

651
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:53,010
Now, that being said, the CEO very often is engaging in large gift acquisition as well.

652
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:57,050
So you can imagine there's some tension between those two folks.

653
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:05,550
So you have to give some thought then in terms of these organizations, not just to the board diversity, but also to the leadership and its diversity.

654
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:13,830
So the American College of Health Care Executives put out a paper in 2014 where they were looking at diversity of health care executives.

655
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:19,860
And, you know, a large roadblock that we have to kind of keep in mind in terms of our ability

656
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:24,180
to have to work toward inclusion is unconscious biases that might emerge.

657
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:29,940
So you can see you're just right off. And again, this is 2014 is a little older.

658
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:41,160
About half of those who responded were male, those who identified as very Caucasian or the oldest, and about 75% were married.

659
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:45,460
So, again, I want to kind of keep you keep your wheels turning.

660
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:49,080
Who's working inside of your organization? What is the demographic makeup?

661
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:54,240
What does that mean in terms of the norms that they set up, in terms of the assumptions that they make,

662
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:58,140
in terms of whether the programs reflect the diversity of the community?

663
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:02,160
You know, is everybody in a particular community married? Maybe not.

664
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:09,080
You know, maybe that is not necessarily reflective. But if everyone who works there reflects a certain composition and, you know,

665
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:12,500
perhaps certain things start to sort of reflect in the programs that are being.

666
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:19,930
Okay. So gives you a little bit more about the the responses and kind of what what things looked like.

667
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:29,350
Want to just draw your attention to how the various positions broke down by different demographics?

668
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:36,520
So the department head category was diverse, but the higher level positions were showing gaps.

669
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:44,200
A higher proportion of those who identify as male and were identifying as Caucasian or white than those were

670
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:52,120
identifying as nonwhite and identifying as male and attained a CEO position but African-American and Asian,

671
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,820
uh, males that were more represented.

672
01:06:55,180 --> 01:07:02,380
So again, you have to kind of look at the different compositional components and then you start to see different trends that begin to emerge.

673
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:09,940
So you can see kind of predicted mean total composition, controlling for education and years of experience.

674
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:18,280
And what's key here is that, again, we see some of these trends emerging, which is that, for example,

675
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:25,840
median salaries for those who are identifying as white, Hispanic and Asian and identifying as women were approximately the same.

676
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:35,590
But the median salary for those who are identifying as black and identifying as women was 13% less than half of those who were at white female.

677
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:45,400
So some of this comes out in terms of the feelings that are reflected in the organizations sort of culture,

678
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:49,660
uh, and you know, the way that they frame things, right?

679
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:57,700
So the idea that sort of diversity being reflected in social gatherings or that that's sort of the way forward, you know,

680
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:03,069
perhaps doesn't reflect a more contemporary thought around what it means to have

681
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:08,580
an organization that reflects a diverse population and an equitable organization.

682
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:14,440
You know, is it just about getting people together and having people talk, or is it codified in all the procedures,

683
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:19,090
in the bylaws and the way that we think about the structure of the organization, etc.?

684
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:23,500
So the American College of Health Executives, you know, made some recommendations.

685
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:30,730
You know, they they made recommendations around, you know, ways to identify and combat, uh, unconscious bias and sort of how to address these.

686
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:38,439
But again, as we kind of think through week by week, especially as we get into the cases, I want to challenge you to really think about this.

687
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:42,999
Not so much from, you know, kind of the, you know, here's the list of recommendations that we can think about,

688
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:50,440
but how would you apply the principles in the organizations that we're considering and in the organizations that you are working on,

689
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:56,410
what structurally in the organization needs to change, what structurally needs to be valued,

690
01:08:56,620 --> 01:09:00,549
what needs to happen in order to ensure that it is promoting a culture of

691
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:04,360
inclusivity and that it's not just kind of something people are talking about,

692
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:09,060
but rather it's codified within the organization and how we think about the organization's function.

693
01:09:11,310 --> 01:09:17,400
That is indeed why we think about different mechanisms for how we create accountability,

694
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:26,880
whether those are accountable statutes through laws that they are accountability principles through self-regulation,

695
01:09:27,690 --> 01:09:33,450
or the principles of transparency, which we're going to be talking about through this first assignment.

696
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:39,220
So. We're going to take a five minute break.

697
01:09:39,430 --> 01:09:44,620
That was a lot of information. What I want to do when we come back, we're going to take 5 minutes.

698
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:47,490
I'm going to run through assignment one and we're going to keep going.

699
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:53,229
I've got quite a bit to cover today, and I want to make sure we have time for our great current events presentations,

700
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:57,550
which I'm sure are going to be excellent and our practice case presentation.

701
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:01,610
So 5 minutes. 595, 24.

702
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:08,131
I'm going to start talking about aspects of this.

703
01:10:13,594 --> 01:10:18,724
Again, the organization that you choose needs to be a501c3 organization.

704
01:10:19,114 --> 01:10:24,154
So it needs to have that designation and deliver some type of service in the health care services space.

705
01:10:24,574 --> 01:10:29,074
You're going to be evaluating the information on the income and expense of the organization.

706
01:10:29,374 --> 01:10:31,534
Uh, five pages, double spaced.

707
01:10:32,014 --> 01:10:40,354
The 89 aides are available from the nonprofits themselves, sometimes on their website or from candid, which I'll I'll just refer you to.

708
01:10:40,684 --> 01:10:43,923
And it is a website where you can go there and type in the name of the nonprofit,

709
01:10:43,924 --> 01:10:47,404
and I'll show you the different nine nineties that you have access to.

710
01:10:47,404 --> 01:10:53,134
So you can look at those. You'll also be able to look at different public ratings available at Charity Navigator,

711
01:10:53,554 --> 01:10:59,614
and then you're gonna be looking at the annual report and the website material as well as other research that you're going to do on the organization.

712
01:11:01,864 --> 01:11:08,164
So the assignment is really helping you to think about what areas of the 1990 you

713
01:11:08,164 --> 01:11:13,654
can identify the different discrepancies between the 1990 and the annual report,

714
01:11:14,074 --> 01:11:20,193
the types of revenue and expense the organization is reporting again to our discussion from that ago.

715
01:11:20,194 --> 01:11:27,124
The type of board the organization has, the board members and their affiliation is where the organization is growing,

716
01:11:27,124 --> 01:11:37,294
where the organization is seemingly behind, and how the organization's mission is being fulfilled by what you see.

717
01:11:37,414 --> 01:11:40,864
So is the 990 description consistent with what you're reading?

718
01:11:41,254 --> 01:11:46,834
So I again, it's a very much a critical exercise for think about in terms of detective work.

719
01:11:47,114 --> 01:11:51,784
You know, you're really looking at the organization critically and trying to understand what's out there.

720
01:11:51,904 --> 01:11:56,334
You know, what are the messages that they're putting out, press releases, news articles, you know,

721
01:11:56,344 --> 01:12:03,184
bulletin announcements, all these kinds of things and sort of how they align with what you're seeing in the 99.

722
01:12:04,174 --> 01:12:08,584
Oh, I talked quite a bit about the 99, which I'm going to jump into in a moment.

723
01:12:10,154 --> 01:12:13,614
I just want to give a few specifics about the assignment itself. Okay.

724
01:12:13,634 --> 01:12:16,954
I'm going to throw it up here on the screen. It's a little bit clearer.

725
01:12:18,254 --> 01:12:26,114
The assignment prompt is on canvas. Five consecutive years of published 90 shows need to be available for your organization.

726
01:12:26,564 --> 01:12:31,004
So if you've chosen an organization and you can't find those five years, you might want to think about a different one.

727
01:12:31,694 --> 01:12:39,614
But you need five consecutive years. Again, you're going to be looking at all kinds of different reporting pieces.

728
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:46,114
But I want see three 990 out of 524.

729
01:12:47,354 --> 01:12:51,974
Uh, and critical here is the five age limit.

730
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:57,014
So five pages is five pages.

731
01:12:57,284 --> 01:13:01,814
And I outline for you here all of the different sections and how many pages they should be.

732
01:13:03,264 --> 01:13:08,664
I want to be clear, I'm not prescriptive on these types of assignments because I'm looking to try and be arbitrary.

733
01:13:08,964 --> 01:13:18,204
I want to help you to work through the writing skills necessary to focus your writing and to be very clear and succinct with your communication,

734
01:13:18,774 --> 01:13:24,833
primarily because I think that's a really critical component of leadership is being clear

735
01:13:24,834 --> 01:13:30,534
in your writing and being able to communicate what you have to say in a very precise way.

736
01:13:30,984 --> 01:13:36,684
So I've structured these page elements intentionally. You may find it challenging to fit everything in here,

737
01:13:37,254 --> 01:13:43,494
but I can let you know this if you are submitting this to someone in leadership at the organization, which you could imagine you might be.

738
01:13:44,214 --> 01:13:46,734
You probably only have their attention for about five pages.

739
01:13:46,884 --> 01:13:52,224
So think about it in terms of where you're going to have their maximum attention on what you're trying to

740
01:13:52,224 --> 01:13:59,084
say and what points you want to try to convey in terms of getting them to understand your considerations.

741
01:14:00,224 --> 01:14:07,664
So the first section is two pages long. You'll summarize the organization structure and think about their mission.

742
01:14:07,664 --> 01:14:10,753
What type of organization a constituency organization is serving?

743
01:14:10,754 --> 01:14:15,764
How many board members the organization has, how many staff members it's employing the second section.

744
01:14:15,764 --> 01:14:19,544
Section two pages is the financial analysis. We'll talk about that here in a minute.

745
01:14:19,544 --> 01:14:24,044
But revenue and expense over the past five years, is it in stable growth, decline?

746
01:14:24,044 --> 01:14:27,794
The salaries of the staff in the board, where the revenue sources are,

747
01:14:27,944 --> 01:14:33,644
the distribution of revenue and expense, and then what level of public support is achieved or maintained.

748
01:14:34,724 --> 01:14:38,623
And then finally in one page, the organization's organizational analysis.

749
01:14:38,624 --> 01:14:43,694
So how well is it adhere to its mission? Do you see evidence of mission creep you?

750
01:14:43,934 --> 01:14:46,724
Are there conflicts of interest that you noticed between the board and staff?

751
01:14:46,904 --> 01:14:52,304
Are there issues the organization is facing that are influenced by systemic and structural racism?

752
01:14:52,884 --> 01:14:56,864
You know, does the organization appear to have issues of oversight struggling with financial solvency?

753
01:14:57,044 --> 01:15:01,254
All these things are things you'll cover in that in that organizational analysis.

754
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:03,644
And I want you to just kind of focus on those points.

755
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:10,244
Again, this is something I know students in my course, especially every every year, we kind of wait.

756
01:15:10,294 --> 01:15:14,204
We get to the first assignments. It's a point that I think is the most challenging.

757
01:15:14,774 --> 01:15:21,014
Please adhere to these page elements for these sections. I intentionally set them up so that you'd have space for the different parts.

758
01:15:21,404 --> 01:15:24,883
So if we get to a paper where you know it's a page and a half on a section,

759
01:15:24,884 --> 01:15:29,024
I'm going to just kind of go and read the first page and then go to the next section.

760
01:15:29,594 --> 01:15:32,744
So try to try to stay within those those page, page limits.

761
01:15:33,104 --> 01:15:41,954
And I'm happy to talk with you if you're having any challenge now, but I'm confident that everyone will be able to be successful in that regard.

762
01:15:43,874 --> 01:15:56,144
Okay. Let's look at a 1990, like I've said it multiple times now, and I'm not being very I'm revealing the grand surprise of the 1990.

763
01:15:56,534 --> 01:16:02,023
So the 1990 is going to look the same for every organization, the same form that the IRS requires,

764
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:07,544
that the organization pile at the top, you'll see the basic information about the organization itself.

765
01:16:07,934 --> 01:16:11,224
And part one, number one, there you have it.

766
01:16:11,354 --> 01:16:15,134
A mission? No, the mission is right there on the front at the top.

767
01:16:15,764 --> 01:16:22,094
Sometimes it might. Depending on if the IRS released a new copy of the form, it may be a little bit different from year to year, but generally.

768
01:16:24,084 --> 01:16:28,904
This organization. This is for affirmations in Ferndale. This organization is a smaller one,

769
01:16:28,914 --> 01:16:34,944
so I chose it because it's a little bit easier to read the 990 because they don't have many schedules that sort of separate all their assets and etc.

770
01:16:35,634 --> 01:16:42,204
You can see here on the first page a high level summary of their of their revenue and then a high level summary of their expense.

771
01:16:42,714 --> 01:16:46,464
Here you can see in line 19 revenue less expense.

772
01:16:46,464 --> 01:16:49,464
So this is telling you whether or not they're running a surplus or a deficit.

773
01:16:49,914 --> 01:16:55,044
You can see in 2015 they were running a deficit and 2014 they were running a deficit.

774
01:16:56,824 --> 01:17:02,853
You can also see what their assets and liabilities are. Assets for those of you who are unfamiliar with this terminology,

775
01:17:02,854 --> 01:17:08,404
assets being those things on the balance sheet, which the organization carries with it from year to year.

776
01:17:08,414 --> 01:17:16,534
So if I own equipment about a building, if I own property, those are all assets distinct from income.

777
01:17:16,954 --> 01:17:24,724
So dollars I get for delivering a program, dollars I get for delivering a service that's income or revenue that I'm going to collect.

778
01:17:25,294 --> 01:17:31,984
Assets are those things that are fixed in nature that I bought that I have and that I'm continuing to have.

779
01:17:32,404 --> 01:17:36,154
Sometimes the staff might be referred to as an asset because it's a person,

780
01:17:36,154 --> 01:17:41,524
but they can also review for you as a liability in the sense that I call money out to pay for that staff.

781
01:17:41,974 --> 01:17:46,474
So if I have money that's promised to be paid, that's a liability.

782
01:17:46,744 --> 01:17:51,844
If it's money that I've already paid, that's an expense. You're going to give questions.

783
01:17:51,994 --> 01:17:55,974
Feel free to jump. Jump in with me separately. Okay.

784
01:17:56,514 --> 01:18:03,324
Briefly explain the organization's mission. You can kind of see here different current program projects and activities.

785
01:18:03,624 --> 01:18:05,484
If you're only looking here for this,

786
01:18:05,484 --> 01:18:11,594
you'll probably miss quite a bit because the organization typically is not going to discuss everything on their 99.

787
01:18:11,694 --> 01:18:17,484
It's a very high level summary. So that's where you'll need to look at their site and other reporting tools.

788
01:18:17,844 --> 01:18:21,404
Okay. Part four requires schedules.

789
01:18:21,414 --> 01:18:24,114
It kind of gives you a sense of what those required schedules are.

790
01:18:24,504 --> 01:18:31,704
So as on through those those details, etc., here you can see, you know, issues related to policies do that.

791
01:18:31,704 --> 01:18:37,224
Does your organization have global chapters? Now, this is a very quick way to see how the organization is structured.

792
01:18:37,554 --> 01:18:45,564
And you'll get a sense of what you're looking for. So use these first few pages as a guide for you to understand what the organization looks like.

793
01:18:46,464 --> 01:18:51,444
Okay. Part seven, the board. So here you can see the board and who is on the board?

794
01:18:51,804 --> 01:18:57,884
Their average hours per week. And what reportable compensation from W-2 income or 1099 income.

795
01:18:57,924 --> 01:19:06,684
They are receiving W-2 income, meaning income that was taxable where they were treated as an employee at 99 income,

796
01:19:06,684 --> 01:19:12,894
meaning the organization was hiring that person as a contractor and they were not paying for their payroll taxes.

797
01:19:13,164 --> 01:19:17,454
Either way, the organization is treating that person as somewhat employed.

798
01:19:17,574 --> 01:19:21,744
But again, the distinction between employed contractor versus employees is a separate.

799
01:19:24,174 --> 01:19:27,914
For this assignment. You don't need to make that distinction. Okay.

800
01:19:27,924 --> 01:19:32,334
So you'll see a little bit more about the board and you'll be able to understand who that board is.

801
01:19:32,664 --> 01:19:35,843
You'll be able to see if the board changed again. That's why I'm asking you to do it.

802
01:19:35,844 --> 01:19:39,474
Over the course of five years. You can make comparisons, compare and contrast.

803
01:19:40,204 --> 01:19:49,194
Um, here on this page, you'll see statements of revenue that continues on, uh, it continues on then with the balance sheet and part ten.

804
01:19:49,254 --> 01:19:53,604
So the balance sheet containing all the information related to their assets and liabilities,

805
01:19:54,714 --> 01:20:03,594
I would not necessarily be too concerned about the, this year prior year comparisons on these 990 because you're going to look at five of them.

806
01:20:04,134 --> 01:20:08,004
So I'm more interested in that. You're looking at each five, each of the five individually,

807
01:20:08,514 --> 01:20:14,794
but you can see what they started with at the beginning of the year and where they ended up at the end of the year for those assets.

808
01:20:14,854 --> 01:20:19,454
My. Okay. Number sorry.

809
01:20:19,454 --> 01:20:25,034
Page 13. Here this one, Schedule A, the public charity status and public support.

810
01:20:25,464 --> 01:20:29,954
Here's where the organization outlines how it's met for 513 designation.

811
01:20:30,374 --> 01:20:36,844
Here's where it identifies if it has public support and what percentages of dollars, etc., are speaking to that.

812
01:20:37,394 --> 01:20:42,254
That looks like affirmations is computing public support on a different computation.

813
01:20:42,614 --> 01:20:45,614
So here's the support schedule for what they're asserting.

814
01:20:46,824 --> 01:20:52,514
Here is their total support. So again, you compare it and then they generate this public support percentage.

815
01:20:53,194 --> 01:20:59,534
It is over a certain threshold, then they are compliant if not, and it's over the course of a few years.

816
01:21:00,224 --> 01:21:05,654
Typically it's about 50%, you know, that you have to kind of adhere to, but sometimes you'll see a dip down to 33%,

817
01:21:05,654 --> 01:21:10,094
etc. If it's too low for a few years in a row, that's when the IRS starts to scrutinize.

818
01:21:11,904 --> 01:21:17,434
Okay, I continue on and I see any, you know, information about supporting organizations.

819
01:21:17,444 --> 01:21:24,644
I start to see information about, you know, any other partnerships that might exist here.

820
01:21:24,644 --> 01:21:30,513
I start to see supplemental information that's identified. You'll see here.

821
01:21:30,514 --> 01:21:34,714
As I continue, I get to the next scheduled Schedule D supplemental financial statements.

822
01:21:34,714 --> 01:21:43,474
Here's where the organization might provide additional financial disclosure, you know, investments that it might have other securities, um,

823
01:21:43,594 --> 01:21:51,154
other assets that it might have long term liabilities that it's been holding on to income tax, that it might go to the federal government.

824
01:21:51,904 --> 01:21:57,333
Here you'll see a reconciliation of revenue, uh, according to an audited financial statement,

825
01:21:57,334 --> 01:22:00,124
which won't talk about audited financial statements later in the term,

826
01:22:00,484 --> 01:22:04,324
you'll encounter these audited financial statements on the websites of the organization.

827
01:22:04,834 --> 01:22:12,754
So, you know, think about on a Web site, you might see that the organization has a list of audited financial statements,

828
01:22:12,754 --> 01:22:16,804
annual reports, and then 99 days, not all organizations will have them.

829
01:22:17,194 --> 01:22:26,044
But the audited financial statement means that a certified public accountant or CPA went through or a firm went through the across all their books,

830
01:22:26,044 --> 01:22:33,544
looked across everything that they had, the receipts and the invoices and the statements and everything with the CFO and everyone was overseeing

831
01:22:33,874 --> 01:22:40,024
and they certified in their audit that everything that the organization is reporting is in fact,

832
01:22:40,414 --> 01:22:43,834
um, true to their professional opinion.

833
01:22:44,464 --> 01:22:52,834
The reason I say we'll revisit this is because it's a key tension in grantmaking in terms of inclusivity and equitable access to resources,

834
01:22:53,284 --> 01:22:59,764
which is many grant makers require organizations to have an audited financial statement or in order to qualify for a grant.

835
01:23:00,274 --> 01:23:04,054
And of course, it's very costly to have an audited financial statement done.

836
01:23:04,474 --> 01:23:09,274
So you have to start asking the question of who's getting to even access the grants that are out there.

837
01:23:09,574 --> 01:23:17,224
If one of the publications or one of the of the key metrics that you have to meet is to have something that has a large barrier of cost associated.

838
01:23:17,854 --> 01:23:21,604
So that'll be something we'll talk about throughout the term in terms of our discussions.

839
01:23:23,004 --> 01:23:27,564
Here, you see a little bit more about their fundraising activities, you know, events that they might have had.

840
01:23:27,594 --> 01:23:32,484
You won't get any details here about exactly every event unless they choose to share.

841
01:23:32,484 --> 01:23:35,514
Sometimes I want them all together in just a category called events.

842
01:23:35,874 --> 01:23:40,974
But at least you can get a sense of whether or not the events are providing them much.

843
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:45,353
So here you can kind of see where we'll talk about in our discussions about philanthropy,

844
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:49,674
where events aren't necessarily the most lucrative choice for raising dollars.

845
01:23:50,604 --> 01:23:58,704
Here they received about $140,000 from their event, and the expense associated with the event was about $85,000.

846
01:23:58,704 --> 01:24:01,944
So not a whole lot at all that gained.

847
01:24:02,274 --> 01:24:10,894
So sometimes events are used as a way to organize people as opposed to being direct fundraisers, but nonetheless, they did generate some revenue.

848
01:24:12,354 --> 01:24:18,534
So you'll see here towards the end, sometimes there will be in schedule, oh, supplemental information.

849
01:24:18,924 --> 01:24:21,924
You know, they'll talk about election of members and their rights.

850
01:24:22,164 --> 01:24:27,684
Here you can see right here how they've codified their board members are elected at the annual meeting held in May.

851
01:24:28,044 --> 01:24:35,484
The board is elected by a majority of the total votes cast by members at the annual meeting, either by mail or in person.

852
01:24:35,844 --> 01:24:38,874
Okay, so what is a member? Is it a board member?

853
01:24:38,904 --> 01:24:46,194
Is it a member of the center? You know, these are all the kinds of things that the organization has to consider in its governance policies.

854
01:24:46,914 --> 01:24:52,554
You know, more on compensation processes for officers and compensation for staff, etc.

855
01:24:53,584 --> 01:24:55,204
So for the most part,

856
01:24:55,204 --> 01:25:04,534
what I'm asking you to do in this assignment is really think critically about how you want to be evaluating the organization itself.

857
01:25:05,164 --> 01:25:09,333
And in that structure that I've laid out, the the two pages,

858
01:25:09,334 --> 01:25:13,534
the two pages and the one page take apart the organization in the different ways and

859
01:25:13,534 --> 01:25:19,624
understand its contributions through the various reporting mechanisms that it has.

860
01:25:19,984 --> 01:25:27,843
So a successful submission on this assignment will have taken into account both the five years of the 1990s,

861
01:25:27,844 --> 01:25:38,494
the organization's website, the board, some research about who the board members are, the annual reports, the public facing stories.

862
01:25:38,494 --> 01:25:44,914
If you can find financially audited financial statements, all those things will sort of help you to shape this.

863
01:25:45,494 --> 01:25:50,014
And the reason we do this assignment truly is to set you up for assignments two and three,

864
01:25:50,284 --> 01:25:55,593
to really be very informed about the organization's trajectory so that you can start to make a clearer

865
01:25:55,594 --> 01:26:00,904
recommendation on what programs it can move forward with an assignment to and then an assignment.

866
01:26:00,914 --> 01:26:03,544
Three How to think about a five year strategic plan.

867
01:26:03,874 --> 01:26:11,433
All key principles of management that I want to help you to understand throughout our 14 week time here and develop as leaders

868
01:26:11,434 --> 01:26:18,654
in organizations and the processes that that good leader that effective leaders who are working toward excellence are working.

869
01:26:19,954 --> 01:26:24,994
Questions on the assignment. I'll take them for one minute, then I want to move on because I want to leave time for.

870
01:26:27,564 --> 01:26:31,004
Yeah. What? Crows from the night from the high 90.

871
01:26:31,074 --> 01:26:36,534
Like, how do we do the citations for that? Like distinguishing between one year to the next year.

872
01:26:37,194 --> 01:26:43,194
So, so the way that I outlined in the in the assignment scene is the Vancouver the jam, you know,

873
01:26:43,194 --> 01:26:53,304
basically superscript on your references on purpose so that you're not using up the space in the pages with long citations and text citations.

874
01:26:53,724 --> 01:26:58,984
Um, but I would say, you know, you can kind of cite each 990 once, you know,

875
01:26:59,064 --> 01:27:03,714
if you want or you can just cited as a, you know, as a hat one as one reference.

876
01:27:04,044 --> 01:27:07,874
And that that part. I'm not not not. Yes.

877
01:27:08,624 --> 01:27:18,324
If we present our statements as percentage like the changes and percentage from year to year, do you accept that or are you wondering like this?

878
01:27:18,404 --> 01:27:22,334
It was December this year. This year. Do you have any specific.

879
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:27,074
I want to see the direct numbers or the expectations.

880
01:27:27,074 --> 01:27:31,874
You'll do both. I'd like you to sort of report what is, and then I want you to draw conclusions.

881
01:27:32,174 --> 01:27:37,994
So successful submission here is not going to just be saying this is what it was this year, this year, this year, this year.

882
01:27:37,994 --> 01:27:46,064
But to your point, thinking about what the trends were, what the changes were, and drawing a critical analysis around it,

883
01:27:47,024 --> 01:27:52,274
it's, I think, not necessarily very exciting if there is not a value in what you were saying,

884
01:27:52,274 --> 01:27:55,093
but just generally some students in the past have sort of, you know,

885
01:27:55,094 --> 01:27:59,494
they use the assignment just kind of report info and I don't know that it necessarily is

886
01:27:59,504 --> 01:28:03,704
helpful because it ends up just kind of making it so you're not really getting much out of it.

887
01:28:03,704 --> 01:28:06,763
So that's I appreciate you asking that because that's really important.

888
01:28:06,764 --> 01:28:13,003
Part of the assignment are nine nine available from 2021 five years back generally

889
01:28:13,004 --> 01:28:17,684
or do we have to go like like I was briefly looking at I only find one for 2019.

890
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:21,824
Great question. So. They're supposed to be.

891
01:28:22,094 --> 01:28:25,844
But you can always get a waiver. You can always get an extension.

892
01:28:25,844 --> 01:28:33,614
And you don't always have it in on time. Which means that these public support, public facing entities don't always have the ability to gather them.

893
01:28:33,924 --> 01:28:39,434
So you have to kind of do your best to see if you're struggling to find a good block of five years.

894
01:28:39,764 --> 01:28:42,944
And I would suggest choosing a different organization where you can find them,

895
01:28:43,274 --> 01:28:47,774
because it's going to be very frustrating as you go through if you're working on stuff at stake from 2012,

896
01:28:48,614 --> 01:28:55,554
because it won't really allow you to think about contemporary issues. And did you provide like a link for where is the best Friday night candidate?

897
01:28:55,874 --> 01:28:58,874
That's the best candidate. The one it's on the site here.

898
01:28:59,924 --> 01:29:04,394
I thought I saw it, but that's for candidates where I recommend you go.

899
01:29:05,654 --> 01:29:07,764
But you'll find them sometimes on the organization's website.

900
01:29:07,814 --> 01:29:20,594
The post COVID was really, of course, a big, um, it was a big interrupter of things for the 1990.

901
01:29:20,624 --> 01:29:29,504
Many organizations deferred filing for a period, so they may be behind like 2020, may have come in very late.

902
01:29:29,894 --> 01:29:33,944
And the IRS was pretty liberal about finding accepted filings for those years.

903
01:29:34,754 --> 01:29:39,554
But note note note that you will see government grants on these nine nineties,

904
01:29:39,554 --> 01:29:44,383
which was not the case last year, but it is this year because they haven't done it yet.

905
01:29:44,384 --> 01:29:48,344
But all forgiveness of the Paycheck Protection Program, the PGP,

906
01:29:48,704 --> 01:29:58,154
this was the program set up by the government in the Corona Virus Relief Bill in 2020 and then the American Recovery Act in 2021,

907
01:29:58,514 --> 01:30:04,244
the PGP was established to provide grants to corporate incorporated entities.

908
01:30:04,634 --> 01:30:12,194
Um, so most non-profits, if they were able to secure the PGP for both the first draw and the second trial,

909
01:30:12,214 --> 01:30:15,984
meaning both times that they were available. So you'll see them as a government grant.

910
01:30:16,004 --> 01:30:21,794
So I want you to be very intentional about looking at that in your assessment and in your evaluation to not necessarily say,

911
01:30:21,794 --> 01:30:24,763
Oh, and they got this great big grant from the government.

912
01:30:24,764 --> 01:30:30,464
It's likely, if you haven't seen it showing up in other years and it's not giant, it's probably the TPP.

913
01:30:33,614 --> 01:30:36,914
It's an important point because it sort of throws you off your thinking that they're

914
01:30:36,914 --> 01:30:41,924
growing and that they got all this access to resources that everybody had access.

915
01:30:42,284 --> 01:30:46,424
Yes. Well, that's hold on. I wanted everyone to have access.

916
01:30:46,964 --> 01:30:47,924
Everyone was supposed to.

917
01:30:50,084 --> 01:30:59,654
Are there other appropriate websites to look for that in any sign or is it should it just be on the website of the organization or on the.

918
01:31:00,564 --> 01:31:02,984
Candid is usually the one where you'll find it the easiest.

919
01:31:02,994 --> 01:31:08,484
There are other ones though, if you find it there, as long as you find a PDF like the one I was showing, that's it.

920
01:31:09,144 --> 01:31:14,084
They'll show up in different ways. All right, let's jump start current events.

921
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:22,764
I'm happy to take questions on this after class, and I want to just revisit what I said is a great example of government programs and their intent.

922
01:31:23,514 --> 01:31:29,784
While they are supposed to be available to everyone, very often they are not.

923
01:31:29,904 --> 01:31:32,274
And it's it's an important point to keep in mind.

924
01:31:32,664 --> 01:31:36,114
It's something that I would I would challenge all of you as you're reading through those nine nineties,

925
01:31:36,444 --> 01:31:42,144
whether or not the organization maybe you think could have benefited from those resources and perhaps maybe they

926
01:31:42,144 --> 01:31:48,894
didn't get it because perhaps they didn't have access to all the capability to to put forward an application,

927
01:31:48,894 --> 01:31:56,664
which was, again, to that point, have audited financial statements, quite a list have to do and required a lot of resources in the network.

928
01:31:58,254 --> 01:32:01,914
All right. Our first current events. Who wants to go first?

929
01:32:04,494 --> 01:32:17,204
So they open it. Three.

930
01:32:17,424 --> 01:32:20,574
Water crisis. No, that's not enough.

931
01:32:20,654 --> 01:32:32,864
You know, you want the Google stuff from the New York Times.

932
01:32:41,844 --> 01:32:46,214
Hi, everybody. I'm here for my current events presentation.

933
01:32:46,224 --> 01:32:51,144
I'm going to be talking about the flooding that's occurring in Pakistan and then UNICEF's role in that.

934
01:32:54,774 --> 01:33:01,004
So right now in Pakistan, as you can see in these videos, there's a lot of devastating flooding that's been occurring.

935
01:33:01,014 --> 01:33:07,554
About one third of the country is currently underwater and that's as a result of a really

936
01:33:07,554 --> 01:33:14,334
unexpected natural disaster and heat waves that kind of start at the beginning of the summer.

937
01:33:14,484 --> 01:33:19,914
What's happening with the heat waves is basically there's just more rain than usual.

938
01:33:19,914 --> 01:33:25,544
That's kind of. Raining all over in larger regions and in large quantities all over Pakistan.

939
01:33:26,234 --> 01:33:36,133
And more than 1.3 million houses and 5000 kilometers of road and over 240 bridges

940
01:33:36,134 --> 01:33:39,764
have been destroyed because of the rain and the flooding that's been occurring.

941
01:33:40,184 --> 01:33:45,584
33 million people have been displaced, so that's one in seven people in Pakistan.

942
01:33:46,154 --> 01:33:51,173
There's about a 1,100% total. I think it's actually based on what I've heard on the news this morning,

943
01:33:51,174 --> 01:33:56,534
that's over 1200 and about one third of that is children, according to UNICEF.

944
01:33:58,154 --> 01:34:01,514
So we're going to kind of divert into UNICEF really quickly.

945
01:34:02,234 --> 01:34:11,893
It is a nonprofit organization. And what UNICEF stands for or what originally stood for was the Arab Nations International Children's Emergency Fund.

946
01:34:11,894 --> 01:34:16,034
But that name has since become the United Nations Children's Fund.

947
01:34:16,484 --> 01:34:26,564
And basically, this started around 1946 as a result, to provide aid for people, mothers, mothers and children who were impacted by World War Two.

948
01:34:27,374 --> 01:34:35,204
Now, it currently exists as an agency of the United Nations, and it provides humanitarian and developmental aid to children worldwide.

949
01:34:37,244 --> 01:34:41,474
It's present in a little less than 200 countries and territories all over the world.

950
01:34:42,374 --> 01:34:46,024
And the overall management and administration of.

951
01:34:46,274 --> 01:34:50,294
Of UNICEF as a global organization takes place in headquarters in New York.

952
01:34:51,374 --> 01:34:57,944
Every country where UNICEF operates has its own country office that's responsible for carrying out the organization's mission.

953
01:34:59,794 --> 01:35:03,304
Some of the services that it provides are immunization and disease prevention.

954
01:35:03,904 --> 01:35:07,384
UNICEF is actually the number one provider of vaccines in the world.

955
01:35:08,374 --> 01:35:10,984
They also do HIV treatment for mothers and children.

956
01:35:11,524 --> 01:35:19,923
They enhance childhood and maternal nutrition, improve sanitation through providing safe water and hygiene kits for education.

957
01:35:19,924 --> 01:35:24,784
And then they also provide emergency relief for disaster. This is actually a very recent picture in Pakistan.

958
01:35:25,984 --> 01:35:28,654
These kids are actually holding hygiene kits from India.

959
01:35:30,094 --> 01:35:41,194
So these since offered 66 metric tons of supplies and material aid, and that includes safe drinking water, lifesaving medical supplies,

960
01:35:41,194 --> 01:35:49,444
hygiene kits that establish like learning centers and as well as things to support the protection and psychosocial well-being of children.

961
01:35:49,444 --> 01:35:53,914
So they've also provided things like literacy activities for kids to play with,

962
01:35:53,914 --> 01:35:57,154
just to kind of help them a little bit with the trauma of the flooding that's occurring.

963
01:35:57,964 --> 01:36:07,984
32 metric tons of 32 I'm sorry, a million metric tons of supplies were delivered September 4th, actually, and that contained most of these supplies.

964
01:36:07,984 --> 01:36:20,613
And another 36 was actually delivered today. And that contained medications and like I'm sorry, also contained medicine, medical supplies,

965
01:36:20,614 --> 01:36:27,694
water purifying tablets and then I am sorry, medicines that treat prosthetic infections as well.

966
01:36:28,444 --> 01:36:33,874
And they actually came from UNICEF's supply station in Copenhagen.

967
01:36:33,874 --> 01:36:40,414
So they kind of have like emergency aid on standby for devastating or natural disasters,

968
01:36:40,414 --> 01:36:45,544
emergency disasters that occur like this as far as monetary aid.

969
01:36:45,554 --> 01:36:52,674
So $2 million worth of supplies, which was actually the material it became that I just discussed, was delivered in the past week.

970
01:36:52,684 --> 01:36:58,513
And then there's also 160 million in support for the national flood response allows another 37

971
01:36:58,514 --> 01:37:02,884
million that's going to be used to reach children and families in need of lifesaving support.

972
01:37:02,894 --> 01:37:13,774
So large quantities of money. But given the size of the natural disaster, it's well needed, especially to help with all of those people in Pakistan.

973
01:37:14,284 --> 01:37:18,724
Now, this is kind of the discussion section.

974
01:37:19,114 --> 01:37:25,894
So what I have here is just a graph that kind of shows where the money comes from for UNICEF.

975
01:37:26,914 --> 01:37:31,443
The Gold Line is for that's the total one, but the blue line is public sector.

976
01:37:31,444 --> 01:37:38,634
So that's the government funding. The private sector is like NGOs, individual funding, things like that.

977
01:37:38,634 --> 01:37:42,694
And then you have the the lowest one, which is the other one.

978
01:37:43,114 --> 01:37:45,544
Now, in 2021,

979
01:37:45,814 --> 01:37:55,324
total contributions to UNICEF for about 8.1 billion and 5.9 billion of that came from government and our governmental and our organizational partners,

980
01:37:55,324 --> 01:37:57,994
which is that public sector number that I was talking about.

981
01:37:58,564 --> 01:38:06,603
So as far as our discussion, what I wanted to kind of think about was in the case of multiple concurrent emergencies, how is it allocated?

982
01:38:06,604 --> 01:38:12,544
You know, they do have an emergency fund. And right now most of that money, of course, is going to Pakistan.

983
01:38:12,544 --> 01:38:17,764
But in the case that other disasters are occurring in other areas of the world where mothers and children are impacted.

984
01:38:17,974 --> 01:38:24,213
Something to think about is where those resources would be allocated to how they would be allocated to allocate,

985
01:38:24,214 --> 01:38:30,874
where they would be allocated in particular. And then the second question that I thought about is if the children where

986
01:38:31,204 --> 01:38:36,244
are most of the accounting for one third of the death toll or from the third,

987
01:38:36,244 --> 01:38:41,464
that 33 million displaced number, 60 million were children, which is nearing half.

988
01:38:41,474 --> 01:38:45,484
So would you just have to be as involved in delivering those funds?

989
01:38:45,484 --> 01:38:50,254
And at that point, while other organizations would step up to help in these kind of areas.

990
01:38:53,114 --> 01:38:57,134
Ex-wife, Nicole Eggert, for being our first one.

991
01:39:00,544 --> 01:39:07,054
So here's here's how we'll do. I want to take about two or 3 minutes per presentation to have a bit of a discussion.

992
01:39:08,374 --> 01:39:11,494
And I didn't have to call any time because you were right on time.

993
01:39:11,844 --> 01:39:17,434
And I see that you're drifting. I'll give you, like, a two minute warning and then a one minute.

994
01:39:17,704 --> 01:39:21,514
I really don't like doing that. So please just try to keep it 5 to 7 minutes.

995
01:39:21,664 --> 01:39:25,404
So I don't need to be the annoying snag in the corner to you.

996
01:39:25,804 --> 01:39:30,093
I didn't want to make anyone else have to do that. Okay, let's take.

997
01:39:30,094 --> 01:39:34,654
Which one would you like to take first? Number one or two, we could talk about number one, I guess.

998
01:39:35,194 --> 01:39:45,054
What do we think? So a lot of these organizations or organizations in general, that's a good question.

999
01:39:45,054 --> 01:39:49,554
By the way, create jobs. I have the same question as well because they do get a lot of funding.

1000
01:39:49,554 --> 01:39:53,724
But how much of that funding is going towards the people that they're trying to serve?

1001
01:39:54,084 --> 01:40:01,224
I know that a lot of the funding is given to like transportation or the supply chain with people who are on the ground.

1002
01:40:01,494 --> 01:40:05,424
And I know that you mentioned that there was $160 million.

1003
01:40:05,634 --> 01:40:11,514
So how much of that is really split up into actually to the people who are affected by these floods?

1004
01:40:12,414 --> 01:40:18,334
So so more like the actual aid is given versus the administrative costs.

1005
01:40:22,874 --> 01:40:25,974
She was a Catholic.

1006
01:40:26,014 --> 01:40:31,284
I'm imagining, like, there's reserves for like certain emergencies and there was like 70 year lives.

1007
01:40:32,844 --> 01:40:39,714
So based on, like what I read, they do have like these emergency reserves, like the, for example,

1008
01:40:39,714 --> 01:40:45,234
all of like the kids that they got from Copenhagen that was already in place in the case of an emergency occurring.

1009
01:40:46,734 --> 01:40:50,904
So for example, like with COVID two years ago, right. That happened all over the world.

1010
01:40:51,354 --> 01:40:55,314
What if there was something else that happened all over the world that needed those kind of emergency kits?

1011
01:40:55,314 --> 01:40:59,664
Right. How do we how do we, you know, divide those resources?

1012
01:41:01,074 --> 01:41:08,213
I my I kind of have a question that's related directly related to this question is that I remember I was discussing with

1013
01:41:08,214 --> 01:41:15,923
someone in the W.H.O. and we were discussing how a lot of the stuff that the W.H.O. is for the lower income countries,

1014
01:41:15,924 --> 01:41:18,804
because a lot of people perceive that those are the people that need it the most.

1015
01:41:19,404 --> 01:41:25,044
But then it comes to the question of, okay, what if you are the United States, you pulled out of a lot of agreement,

1016
01:41:25,064 --> 01:41:29,393
but our former president was in power because we didn't see that we were getting any benefit of it,

1017
01:41:29,394 --> 01:41:35,424
even though we were having you have natural resources, we have things going on every day in this country as well.

1018
01:41:36,534 --> 01:41:44,214
So like in this instance, the U.N. is mainly publicly funded because it is a partnership of countries, governments.

1019
01:41:44,334 --> 01:41:48,384
That's what they're there for. That's why that number is so high. Do we do it?

1020
01:41:49,434 --> 01:41:53,364
How many needs what? More like what's that's like almost a moral, ethical decision.

1021
01:41:53,364 --> 01:41:57,384
Right? And yes, these children need it a ton.

1022
01:41:57,384 --> 01:42:03,833
And I'm very happy it's going to Pakistan. But that being said, if you or someone from the United States or these other countries are funding this,

1023
01:42:03,834 --> 01:42:08,484
like my question is how much of that there is that tension of, okay,

1024
01:42:08,484 --> 01:42:13,673
I'm giving a lot of money, maybe I'm a main contributor and it's all going to Pakistan.

1025
01:42:13,674 --> 01:42:18,654
And meanwhile in California, my first start burning and people are dying too.

1026
01:42:18,984 --> 01:42:20,933
So that's like something I would ask.

1027
01:42:20,934 --> 01:42:27,054
And then there's a lot of other players that have like Europe has its own urgency, relief funds that might play into it.

1028
01:42:27,804 --> 01:42:31,914
So yeah, I don't know. I that's my that's what this brought up to me.

1029
01:42:32,034 --> 01:42:34,464
So no, that was something I actually thought about too.

1030
01:42:34,464 --> 01:42:39,864
Like, you know, you're assuming that a lot of high income countries are about governments that are contributing to these funds.

1031
01:42:40,194 --> 01:42:44,003
And then how much of it is actually being allocated to them versus to countries where these types

1032
01:42:44,004 --> 01:42:49,494
of things are occurring or they don't have the funding to provide emergency relief as well?

1033
01:42:50,864 --> 01:42:56,864
I guess a question I have to that then is going back to like what is the mission of UNICEF in general?

1034
01:42:56,864 --> 01:43:00,974
And then for those people who are contributing and providing funds,

1035
01:43:01,394 --> 01:43:06,734
they must understand it and know that this is the mission and it is going to go to those

1036
01:43:06,734 --> 01:43:12,314
who are in need or who have like this incredible natural disaster going on at a time.

1037
01:43:12,584 --> 01:43:18,764
So I'm just curious. I can't remember if you had it on one of the slides specifically, but what is the mission?

1038
01:43:18,794 --> 01:43:27,074
And those people end up going to and providing these funds knowing that that is the goal of this particular organization.

1039
01:43:28,124 --> 01:43:31,933
So tell us about the mission before we saw those missions.

1040
01:43:31,934 --> 01:43:33,524
Obviously very important for nonprofits.

1041
01:43:33,524 --> 01:43:39,974
When you actually go on the UNICEF website, it says like UNICEF's mission, and then it has just a paragraph about what they do, like a very long one.

1042
01:43:39,974 --> 01:43:42,214
So there isn't one concise mission.

1043
01:43:42,224 --> 01:43:49,664
But from from what I read in the gist of it essentially is to provide relief and support to mother, mothers and children in need.

1044
01:43:51,704 --> 01:43:56,054
I just want to sort through that question. So, yes, I would.

1045
01:43:58,024 --> 01:44:01,444
I would assume that if there were several concurrent emergencies,

1046
01:44:02,044 --> 01:44:11,344
it would go to the countries that don't have their own emergency funds or the emergency funds available like the US has,

1047
01:44:11,434 --> 01:44:14,104
like FEMA set up and ready to respond to things.

1048
01:44:14,614 --> 01:44:21,214
So I would assume that's part of the reason why developed countries often don't get as much as many resources

1049
01:44:21,214 --> 01:44:28,533
from non-profits and organizations like this is because they have their own resources and emergency funds set up.

1050
01:44:28,534 --> 01:44:39,824
So for other countries. I don't know if Pakistan did have an emergency fund set up, but I would imagine that it wouldn't be as big as us.

1051
01:44:40,004 --> 01:44:46,264
It's FEMA, so I guess I would assume it would go to the country that has the most amount of resources.

1052
01:44:49,084 --> 01:44:56,464
Thank you. Thank you. And I appreciate your presentation because I think you're bringing to our attention a point that we were talking about earlier,

1053
01:44:56,464 --> 01:44:59,554
which is the role of the government in a lot of this.

1054
01:44:59,914 --> 01:45:04,234
And if there are so many of these events, you know,

1055
01:45:04,624 --> 01:45:12,664
is it even sustainable to believe that a nonprofit organization has the capacity to deliver on it, or does it require a consolidated effort?

1056
01:45:12,694 --> 01:45:17,074
So thank you for mapping directly onto something we're talking about today without even.

1057
01:45:21,094 --> 01:45:26,404
Okay. That's good. Between the.

1058
01:45:30,474 --> 01:45:39,934
No, I don't think so. I think, you know, I just think it's a you thing.

1059
01:45:41,204 --> 01:45:45,104
Either way, it's a good idea.

1060
01:45:45,164 --> 01:45:52,574
You wouldn't want it on the Internet. Yeah.

1061
01:45:53,534 --> 01:46:02,894
Okay. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Finan and my current events presentation is going to be on the water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi.

1062
01:46:04,364 --> 01:46:11,054
So I specifically chose this photo because it reminded me of the flood that took place last July in Dearborn,

1063
01:46:11,504 --> 01:46:15,074
which was also due to outdated infrastructure and reduced rent and development.

1064
01:46:15,074 --> 01:46:21,103
And specifically of this photo, because there's they're just kind of like making the best of the situation here with the boat.

1065
01:46:21,104 --> 01:46:25,114
And in Dearborn, there are people and jetskis, which obviously isn't safe.

1066
01:46:25,124 --> 01:46:26,354
And it just reminded me of that.

1067
01:46:28,404 --> 01:46:35,033
So before we dove into current events, I do want to paint a picture of what's happening in the current state of Jackson,

1068
01:46:35,034 --> 01:46:37,494
Mississippi, and then all of the events that led up to it.

1069
01:46:39,484 --> 01:46:44,853
So the troubled water system is among a crippling array of challenges that face Jackson, Mississippi,

1070
01:46:44,854 --> 01:46:51,634
which is a very large city and a majority black city that suffers and struggles with a lot of different things.

1071
01:46:51,634 --> 01:46:56,104
The first one is chronic poverty, with their poverty rate at 24%.

1072
01:46:56,674 --> 01:47:01,924
We also have a very high crime rate of 45.8, with the U.S. average of 22.7.

1073
01:47:02,284 --> 01:47:07,614
And also a lack of basic public services, such as reliable trash pickup and regular road repairs.

1074
01:47:11,204 --> 01:47:14,684
So with the water crisis, what do we see going on right now?

1075
01:47:15,074 --> 01:47:22,873
So I do want to mention to, I guess, two specific things that are very readily talked about in articles in news stations all the time,

1076
01:47:22,874 --> 01:47:28,214
which is the lack of tap water and flooding. But there is one that I want to specifically focus on.

1077
01:47:28,784 --> 01:47:35,904
I'm particular. So Mississippi, the city has been running out of bottled water to give residents.

1078
01:47:35,924 --> 01:47:39,524
It's the largest city in Mississippi and is 80% black.

1079
01:47:40,034 --> 01:47:45,434
The water system is failing because of years of neglect, and that's environmental racism.

1080
01:47:45,644 --> 01:47:49,904
There have been some media outlets and some elected officials that have briefly touched on this.

1081
01:47:50,264 --> 01:47:56,144
I do want us to go back to it and the discussion section so we can elaborate, elaborate a little bit more.

1082
01:47:56,624 --> 01:48:00,974
But before we do that, I do want to go into some more specifics about the water crisis.

1083
01:48:01,424 --> 01:48:08,714
And so current day, we saw the largest water treatment plant failing, but there were other events that took place leading up to it.

1084
01:48:09,044 --> 01:48:17,264
And so first, a lot of residents reported disruption of services along with frequent boil water notices that would last up to one month.

1085
01:48:17,684 --> 01:48:23,564
I did pull out one comment from an article that stood out to me and this resident reported that he has

1086
01:48:23,564 --> 01:48:30,584
not gone a month without having a boil water notice or low to no water pressure in the last two years.

1087
01:48:31,954 --> 01:48:37,714
Excessive rainfall, coupled with years of water issues, have resulted in a crisis in Jackson,

1088
01:48:37,984 --> 01:48:43,744
where the city doesn't have enough water to fight fires, flush toilets, or even hand out bottled water to the residents.

1089
01:48:44,134 --> 01:48:47,584
This problem has been building for a decade and it's past time we fix it.

1090
01:48:48,094 --> 01:48:53,314
And so since this is specifically happening right now, I did list a few ways that we can help.

1091
01:48:53,344 --> 01:49:00,124
They are still taking both water and monetary donations and a really easy one is just speaking out.

1092
01:49:00,334 --> 01:49:04,294
As I mentioned, this is happening because of years of neglect and environmental racism.

1093
01:49:04,534 --> 01:49:12,334
And if we can use our social media platforms or if anyone else has any other ways to just like loudly speak about it, it could go a really long way.

1094
01:49:12,664 --> 01:49:18,064
I did compile a list that I can send out to anyone specifically who's interested, and I'd be more happy to do that.

1095
01:49:19,774 --> 01:49:26,554
So specifically, the nonprofit I chose that I thought would be really beneficial to helping Jackson is Mercy Chefs.

1096
01:49:27,184 --> 01:49:37,684
So Mercy Chefs is a faith based nonprofit disaster relief organization, principally focused on providing disaster relief both at home and abroad.

1097
01:49:38,374 --> 01:49:45,124
So it's really cool about Mercy Chefs as they provide services in many different ways, and they adapt it based on a natural disaster.

1098
01:49:45,364 --> 01:49:50,014
And so I picked out three of the services that I thought would be applicable to Jackson,

1099
01:49:50,284 --> 01:49:54,964
and that's their mobile kitchens, local volunteers and the food insecurity response.

1100
01:49:56,254 --> 01:49:59,554
The next slide, I have photos of what that specifically looks like.

1101
01:49:59,824 --> 01:50:09,544
And so the photo on the far left or your right, I don't know on that photo is what the national security response team looks like.

1102
01:50:09,844 --> 01:50:17,764
And so specifically, I guess what this looks like is based on the disaster they adapt to what services are provided and the little event.

1103
01:50:18,334 --> 01:50:21,814
And previously what it looked like was they had like grocery box distributions.

1104
01:50:22,174 --> 01:50:26,644
They also had single parents, cooking classes, budget recipe creations.

1105
01:50:26,914 --> 01:50:32,884
Again, it varies based on natural disaster. This photo is the mobile food.

1106
01:50:33,304 --> 01:50:38,974
Yeah, like the mobile food clinic. Or they like mixing up the mobile kitchen.

1107
01:50:39,334 --> 01:50:45,634
Yeah. So the mobile kitchen again is just a mobile that goes to areas of needs and goes into areas of need,

1108
01:50:45,964 --> 01:50:50,344
excuse me, and provides free meals and then again the local volunteers.

1109
01:50:50,614 --> 01:50:55,593
So this one's specifically important because Jackson is has a lot of the Jackson

1110
01:50:55,594 --> 01:50:59,734
residents have been complaining of really long wait times at community clinic centers,

1111
01:51:00,004 --> 01:51:06,934
and some residents have reported having to wait up to 2 hours to receive bottled water and some even at the end of that, they would have run out.

1112
01:51:06,934 --> 01:51:10,024
And so they just waited in a long line for nothing.

1113
01:51:10,024 --> 01:51:13,564
And so if there were local volunteers, just as this photo is showing,

1114
01:51:13,834 --> 01:51:18,484
who could hand out bottled water, that would help tremendously with the residents.

1115
01:51:21,004 --> 01:51:27,124
Yeah. So with all that in mind, I'd love to first pose a discussion that I kind of alluded to in the beginning of the presentation,

1116
01:51:28,204 --> 01:51:33,294
that this is happening partly because of environmental racism and years of neglect.

1117
01:51:33,334 --> 01:51:40,174
So like knowing that and keeping that in mind, how do we shift the city from being proactive instead of reactive?

1118
01:51:41,044 --> 01:51:42,844
And then the second discussion question,

1119
01:51:43,534 --> 01:51:53,554
the EPA has warned Mississippi in 2020 of imminent dangers to for people drinking and water and drinking Jackson's tap water.

1120
01:51:53,764 --> 01:51:58,864
And so the 80% black city has sought repairs since the 1940s.

1121
01:51:59,254 --> 01:52:02,704
And Governor Reeves repeatedly refused requests for funding.

1122
01:52:02,944 --> 01:52:08,134
The states only approved 66% of requested fund repairs last year.

1123
01:52:08,554 --> 01:52:15,964
And so when I kind of discussed that, like, how has race contributed to the lack to the government's lack of response and what we can do about that?

1124
01:52:16,654 --> 01:52:21,003
And I know I'll jump back to this, but I just want to say thank you for listening.

1125
01:52:21,004 --> 01:52:27,634
And I did also list a few of the organizations that are still seeking out volunteers, either while seeking out volunteers one.

1126
01:52:27,634 --> 01:52:33,064
But then I guess what we can do, since we're not in Mississippi, is the water or monetary donations.

1127
01:52:33,064 --> 01:52:39,783
And of course, it's free to just speak about it, let people know what's happening, and hopefully we can create some traction because again,

1128
01:52:39,784 --> 01:52:48,874
the government, the local government is a big reason for the hindrance and like why this is happening in a very majority black city in Jackson.

1129
01:52:50,944 --> 01:52:59,694
In your excellent. So once again, I'm just going to add a couple of things to your questions here.

1130
01:52:59,724 --> 01:53:08,194
Thank you for for sharing this. And I think that you point out two very important questions that speak to.

1131
01:53:08,904 --> 01:53:12,674
Again, back to earlier, the role of the nonprofit there.

1132
01:53:12,924 --> 01:53:20,144
So here you're outlining kind of a nonprofit that can be working to respond, but to the structural component of it.

1133
01:53:20,424 --> 01:53:27,544
What's the role of the nonprofit that is helping to advocate such that the structure is changing itself?

1134
01:53:27,574 --> 01:53:31,014
You know, is it even reasonable that nonprofits should have to respond to this?

1135
01:53:31,404 --> 01:53:34,854
Or is it a failure of government to not be involved at all?

1136
01:53:35,184 --> 01:53:42,674
Yeah, that's also a good point. I did want to add. A lot of the help that Jackson has been receiving has been from outside of the state.

1137
01:53:42,684 --> 01:53:45,114
So there's like Atlanta has been helping a time.

1138
01:53:45,384 --> 01:53:51,104
So there hasn't I mean, there have been some local nonprofits in Jackson, but that it wasn't a majority at all.

1139
01:53:51,114 --> 01:53:54,944
And so that's why I think mercy checks would be a good one.

1140
01:53:54,954 --> 01:53:57,744
I tried to like look at what could be done since there isn't that much.

1141
01:53:57,744 --> 01:54:00,834
I mean, there have been a lot of donations, but they need a lot more than that.

1142
01:54:00,844 --> 01:54:04,704
Like they need to restructure the infrastructures. Outdated.

1143
01:54:04,714 --> 01:54:12,394
There wasn't any help. The governor is being very he's repressing all of the commotion that the residents are trying to start up.

1144
01:54:12,394 --> 01:54:17,084
So I guess there has to be work that's done outside of the city specifically, too.

1145
01:54:17,104 --> 01:54:20,494
So I guess I try to incorporate that. Yeah, I just have a question.

1146
01:54:20,644 --> 01:54:30,814
You know, I wonder how much of Biden's infrastructure bill will be affected or how much of an impact it will have?

1147
01:54:30,814 --> 01:54:33,904
Because I know a big part of it was drinking water.

1148
01:54:35,184 --> 01:54:39,474
So that's that's really I actually didn't think about that. But that's a that's a good question.

1149
01:54:39,474 --> 01:54:46,314
I don't know if anyone has any specific knowledge into the infrastructure, but haven't worked specifically on that one.

1150
01:54:46,434 --> 01:54:53,534
But that could help. I don't know if there's limitations on it based on state or if there's allocations based on disasters.

1151
01:54:53,544 --> 01:54:58,104
Honestly, not sure. So critical to answering that question would be to see what.

1152
01:54:59,274 --> 01:55:07,644
Powers lie within the states to decide where those dollars go and get their infrastructure fixed.

1153
01:55:08,154 --> 01:55:15,944
So it could be limited based on the governor or the legislature even, you know, that you get X dollars to the state.

1154
01:55:15,954 --> 01:55:19,154
But the governor and the legislature decide how to pass a law to.

1155
01:55:22,044 --> 01:55:25,494
So just kind of off of discussion. Question to it.

1156
01:55:25,524 --> 01:55:30,684
In the beginning of your presentation, you alluded to Dearborn and the flooding and stuff that happened last year,

1157
01:55:30,924 --> 01:55:35,934
last year with the the people that were helping clean up that situation where the local nonprofits.

1158
01:55:35,934 --> 01:55:39,534
Right. And that issue was not worked around with our previous administration.

1159
01:55:40,134 --> 01:55:42,984
And because of how angry people were and how emotional they were,

1160
01:55:42,984 --> 01:55:49,194
because they lost so much, it pulled out the greatest voter turnout Dearborn has ever had.

1161
01:55:49,494 --> 01:55:51,804
And we ended up switching over administration.

1162
01:55:52,194 --> 01:55:58,914
And now we have a mayor who actually graduated from who has a masters of public health from Ann Arbor, and he is prioritizing these issues.

1163
01:55:59,334 --> 01:56:08,244
So I think what's important with that is putting leadership in place that it looks like the community needs to because that helps.

1164
01:56:08,244 --> 01:56:14,393
And that's kind of ties into that diversity aspect we were discussing earlier with the boards and whatnot, having people that look like you,

1165
01:56:14,394 --> 01:56:20,364
that represent you, because the reality of it is that, you know, they understand maybe they'll care more.

1166
01:56:21,144 --> 01:56:22,254
That's just kind of how it works.

1167
01:56:23,334 --> 01:56:30,954
Even in Dearborn, we've had other environmental issues in the south end of Dearborn, which is just one primary population, affordable air quality.

1168
01:56:30,954 --> 01:56:33,684
Sometimes they would tell the kids, don't come to school like it's hard to breathe.

1169
01:56:34,254 --> 01:56:39,024
And now we have an administration that's working on those issues and working on the infrastructure and advocating for that.

1170
01:56:39,834 --> 01:56:46,044
So putting people in place that care about every area of the city or every area of the state or whatnot.

1171
01:56:46,044 --> 01:56:51,774
Right. And and having those conversations at the Advocate for you at every level, I couldn't agree more.

1172
01:56:58,244 --> 01:57:04,134
You put, just sign up for me on. They thought.

1173
01:57:07,364 --> 01:57:13,634
I appreciate you sharing this, because I think that one of the things that that we can keep in mind as it pertains

1174
01:57:13,634 --> 01:57:17,054
to these types of episodes is the frequency with which they're occurring.

1175
01:57:17,054 --> 01:57:23,504
And both of you are talking about, you know, events that we don't have control that they're going to happen,

1176
01:57:24,164 --> 01:57:32,594
but that we have control over how we respond. To your first question, you know, how proactive are we being in terms of what we're doing?

1177
01:57:33,014 --> 01:57:39,284
And at the same time, what the organizations that are involved have a capacity to do.

1178
01:57:39,914 --> 01:57:43,754
So, you know, everybody is working toward addressing a crisis.

1179
01:57:44,174 --> 01:57:51,754
At some point, the organizations are strapped. And that goes back to what we were talking about earlier with regards to, you know,

1180
01:57:51,764 --> 01:57:56,464
how much bandwidth does an organization have and how much resources, how many resources do they have?

1181
01:57:56,474 --> 01:58:04,003
So now even suppose mercy comes in and and is responding, you know, is it a sustained response?

1182
01:58:04,004 --> 01:58:08,564
Can they be there for ten days? Can they be there for 20 days? You know, how much money is there?

1183
01:58:08,654 --> 01:58:10,874
Are there donors willing? Is there overwhelming?

1184
01:58:11,594 --> 01:58:18,734
You know, we entrust a lot of authority and power to organizations that may, as you outlined, not be there.

1185
01:58:18,944 --> 01:58:23,654
And so they're not from the community. So they come as much as they can.

1186
01:58:23,654 --> 01:58:29,944
But then, you know, at the end of the day, what kind of organized structure needs to be in place in order to address it?

1187
01:58:29,994 --> 01:58:34,364
So I think it's an excellent, excellent point to excellent presentations.

1188
01:58:34,974 --> 01:58:40,664
So thank you both. Okay.

1189
01:58:41,384 --> 01:58:47,294
All right. So we are going to take our next break.

1190
01:58:50,264 --> 01:58:56,114
Why don't we come back here? We took a little bit longer than our last one, so let's come back 625 minutes.

1191
01:58:56,294 --> 01:59:01,215
Okay. Because I know you know how to make.

1192
01:59:04,421 --> 01:59:07,781
Now to the grand reveal the case presentation.

1193
01:59:07,901 --> 01:59:11,051
I'm sure everyone was just couldn't wait to hear about it.

1194
01:59:11,591 --> 01:59:24,461
Okay, so the case presentation requires you to step through a certain case analysis process that I use to structure case discussions.

1195
01:59:25,121 --> 01:59:34,451
I posted on canvas a chapter or a short chapter that outlines this this whole structure and this whole approach,

1196
01:59:35,021 --> 01:59:38,981
and it's structured around six core domains.

1197
01:59:39,281 --> 01:59:44,891
So I ask that before you start on your presentation, that you read that chapter.

1198
01:59:45,281 --> 01:59:48,821
It's right on the front page of the canvas site. How to Analyze a Case.

1199
01:59:49,451 --> 01:59:55,241
For those of you who've been in courses with me previously, you'll recognize it very similar to some of the strategies we use.

1200
01:59:55,691 --> 02:00:02,080
The cases that we're going to do in here, though, are going to be deeper and I'm going to expect a greater level of emphasis.

1201
02:00:02,081 --> 02:00:06,941
So if you've been with me before, it's a little bit more intensive in our course here.

1202
02:00:08,231 --> 02:00:11,741
Six components. Now, why do we choose these six components?

1203
02:00:11,741 --> 02:00:15,131
Primarily to help us think about the case from different angles.

1204
02:00:15,491 --> 02:00:19,961
So today I want to practice working through a case, the one that you read for today.

1205
02:00:21,041 --> 02:00:29,920
And I want to step through designing one of these slide shows simply so that you can organize your discussion in your groups

1206
02:00:29,921 --> 02:00:37,091
that you chose and start to kind of practice thinking about the case through the structure that we're going to be using.

1207
02:00:37,481 --> 02:00:46,071
So. The situation. You're going to need to identify for your case whether it's a problem, a decision or an evaluation.

1208
02:00:46,191 --> 02:00:51,291
There are three distinct possibilities here. Again, we're not looking to be arbitrary.

1209
02:00:51,651 --> 02:00:58,641
It's mainly just to help you think about this from a particular frame so that you can then structure your solution to it.

1210
02:00:59,421 --> 02:01:05,751
Our primary objective with these always and keep this in mind is you're the decision maker.

1211
02:01:06,501 --> 02:01:10,101
The thing is not solved. You've got to come up with what you're going to do.

1212
02:01:10,971 --> 02:01:19,191
So I like I said last week, I'm going to ask all of you to push each other to get to some decision.

1213
02:01:19,611 --> 02:01:26,691
Okay. So not enough to come and just kind of talk about, yeah, they did this and spend like 10 minutes recapitulating the whole case.

1214
02:01:26,931 --> 02:01:30,771
Everybody will have read the case by the time we sort of get back.

1215
02:01:30,801 --> 02:01:40,751
Right. We're all going to read the case before that. So please, from the bottom of my heart, don't spend 10 minutes or 15 minutes reciting the case.

1216
02:01:40,761 --> 02:01:44,631
Rather come out to talk about what your plans are.

1217
02:01:44,931 --> 02:01:47,121
So give us a quick context for what you're doing,

1218
02:01:47,121 --> 02:01:51,571
but then we want you to jump into what you're doing about it, because that's the key to what we're looking.

1219
02:01:52,951 --> 02:01:59,741
So. Is it a problem? Is it a decision or is it an evaluation of what to do?

1220
02:02:01,641 --> 02:02:06,441
The questions. So what do we need to know to adequately assess the situation?

1221
02:02:06,891 --> 02:02:11,181
So it's a problem. What's the problem you're trying to address? Who's responsible for it?

1222
02:02:11,541 --> 02:02:18,561
If it's a decision, what are the options and what's at stake? If it's an evaluation, who's responsible for evaluating it and what are the criteria?

1223
02:02:18,951 --> 02:02:23,211
And then key to this particular domain, not covered in the chapter,

1224
02:02:23,211 --> 02:02:27,981
but it's something that I've added into that into the domain that I want that I'll be looking for that you cover.

1225
02:02:28,341 --> 02:02:32,751
Are there issues related to health equity and systemic racism that need to be addressed?

1226
02:02:33,081 --> 02:02:39,541
Okay. The bulk of the points in this assignment are built into the hypothesis section.

1227
02:02:40,091 --> 02:02:45,961
Why? Well, that's where you're making a recommendation. So the chapter refers to it as hypothesis.

1228
02:02:45,991 --> 02:02:49,441
You could also call it recommendation or what you're advising.

1229
02:02:50,311 --> 02:02:55,111
You're going to articulate what you're recommending, what you think should be done.

1230
02:02:55,351 --> 02:02:58,591
How it's going to impact the problem, the decision or the evaluation.

1231
02:02:59,011 --> 02:03:05,401
And as part of your recommendation, I want you to go back to, you know, thinking about what you identified here about systemic and structural racism.

1232
02:03:06,391 --> 02:03:09,841
You know, how you're going to address those principles in what you're proposing.

1233
02:03:11,201 --> 02:03:16,371
The proof and action. Well, what evidence do you need to support the hypothesis?

1234
02:03:16,391 --> 02:03:21,071
What additional evidence is needed? And then how are you going to implement the decision?

1235
02:03:22,381 --> 02:03:26,161
Very important here how you're going to implement the decision.

1236
02:03:26,611 --> 02:03:30,151
It's not enough to just say, we're going to do this. That's not good enough.

1237
02:03:30,631 --> 02:03:35,911
Okay, I'm in charge. If I'm in leadership, if I just say, yeah, we're going to start a new program.

1238
02:03:36,241 --> 02:03:41,581
That's nice. Put it on the list. Oh, what are you going to do?

1239
02:03:42,511 --> 02:03:46,291
When are you going to do it? Where are you going to hire? Who's going to work on it?

1240
02:03:46,771 --> 02:03:49,471
Who's going to be responsible for it? That's where you got to be thinking.

1241
02:03:50,161 --> 02:03:54,751
So a good manager, a good leader isn't necessarily the one who has to figure all that out.

1242
02:03:55,261 --> 02:04:02,371
You'll have people on your team that will work with you to figure that out. A good manager is one who is going to be saying, I have an idea.

1243
02:04:03,061 --> 02:04:06,151
I have a suggestion. I have a direction I'm going.

1244
02:04:06,451 --> 02:04:11,071
And here's how I'm going to make sure that it happens. So not enough just to propose something.

1245
02:04:11,371 --> 02:04:22,621
You've got to have a plan for what you're going to do to get it done. Now, in order to make a plan, you got to know how your plan does work.

1246
02:04:23,341 --> 02:04:30,481
So you have to assess the weaknesses of what you're proposing and then identify two alternatives to what you're recommending.

1247
02:04:30,721 --> 02:04:36,091
And then I want you to describe how these might be stronger or weaker responses to the case.

1248
02:04:37,031 --> 02:04:41,590
So why do we do this? Because really, you know, if you have a clear direction in mind,

1249
02:04:41,591 --> 02:04:45,611
if you're in leadership to give a clear direction in mind and you're convinced this is the right way to go,

1250
02:04:46,181 --> 02:04:48,901
why bother spending time thinking about alternatives?

1251
02:04:48,911 --> 02:04:53,381
I mean, of course you're evaluating alternatives in terms of your ability to think about different choices,

1252
02:04:53,381 --> 02:04:57,281
but you should be focusing as a leader on where to go. Right?

1253
02:04:57,311 --> 02:05:02,441
Yeah. Well, no, I know, cause you report to a board.

1254
02:05:03,371 --> 02:05:10,481
Report to a board? I promise you, there are fabulous members of your board who have a great idea of what to do.

1255
02:05:10,931 --> 02:05:19,461
It's probably not yours. So you have to be responsible for thinking about and anticipating what some of these alternatives might be so that as you

1256
02:05:19,461 --> 02:05:26,191
socialize your proposal for what to do and make your recommendation more sensitive to the other ideas that people might have.

1257
02:05:26,511 --> 02:05:30,591
And you can start to create some consensus. And that's a hallmark of these organizations,

1258
02:05:30,891 --> 02:05:35,391
is the need to create consensus and bring people together around the different things that you're looking to do.

1259
02:05:35,811 --> 02:05:39,171
Everybody has to win somehow. Everybody's got to get something out of it.

1260
02:05:39,651 --> 02:05:43,611
It doesn't mean it has to be their idea or that it has to be the thing that they wanted.

1261
02:05:43,971 --> 02:05:48,921
But there's got to be some way to take into account consensus building in what you're proposing.

1262
02:05:50,631 --> 02:05:54,531
Finally, I want you to identify 3 to 5 questions for discussion.

1263
02:05:54,831 --> 02:06:00,711
And it's your responsibility as the case presentation group to facilitate discussion or some type of activity.

1264
02:06:01,521 --> 02:06:03,741
Why do I say some type of activity? Well,

1265
02:06:04,371 --> 02:06:13,341
it would be a lot more entertaining and engaging if you have something for everyone to do to plug into or if you have a discussion question set

1266
02:06:13,521 --> 02:06:20,331
that you're prepared to kind of walk us through as a group those discussion questions and really help us engage with what you're thinking about.

1267
02:06:20,691 --> 02:06:25,881
So I just want to give you your creative bandwidth to in order to explore these cases.

1268
02:06:26,481 --> 02:06:35,151
One group in the past designed a quick simulation where they assigned everyone kind of a different part of the organization.

1269
02:06:35,151 --> 02:06:40,281
And we sort of practice thinking about the decision that was going to get made through the lens of the

1270
02:06:40,281 --> 02:06:46,491
different people based on the recommendation that they were making as the leader or as the decision maker.

1271
02:06:47,031 --> 02:06:50,551
So, you know, different ways that you can approach it, not a requirement to do that.

1272
02:06:50,601 --> 02:06:55,250
But again, try to think about how you can keep us engaged as a learning community so that

1273
02:06:55,251 --> 02:07:00,081
you're driving a a good deliberation and a good discussion about the case.

1274
02:07:01,761 --> 02:07:05,451
If you put in the effort on it as a group and really engage with that process,

1275
02:07:05,901 --> 02:07:09,621
you'll know you've achieved results because it will not be silent in your mind.

1276
02:07:09,621 --> 02:07:16,021
It's silent. It's very, very challenging. I'll try my best to keep it moving, but I get real boring after it.

1277
02:07:17,721 --> 02:07:22,760
What are you doing today? We're going to practice working on this a little bit as case presentation group.

1278
02:07:22,761 --> 02:07:29,751
So be your first secretary to work with your group. Um, about 20 minutes now, I want you to spend about ten.

1279
02:07:30,081 --> 02:07:35,331
Just kind of roughly outline for us what you're. What you think for each of those sides.

1280
02:07:35,751 --> 02:07:39,080
Not no pressure. Just have some notes about what you think.

1281
02:07:39,081 --> 02:07:45,671
For each of the slides, you'll make six slides. One slide at the top of it will have all your group members names on it.

1282
02:07:45,681 --> 02:07:49,041
We're here today. If someone is not here, don't put their name on it.

1283
02:07:49,041 --> 02:07:52,311
They'll have to make it up and submit it. But I think everybody except for to see.

1284
02:07:52,401 --> 02:07:53,811
So you'll be good.

1285
02:07:54,471 --> 02:08:01,431
So every slide to have the title of the section if addressing situation questions about this group and action alternatives and discussion.

1286
02:08:01,971 --> 02:08:07,891
I want you to submit these at the end of class. And, you know, let's take 10 minutes to start the program up.

1287
02:08:07,911 --> 02:08:14,541
If we're feeling like we need more time, you might, um, you might be late discussion for it.

1288
02:08:14,871 --> 02:08:17,911
So next people. I don't want any more time on that.

1289
02:08:18,261 --> 02:08:21,811
Let's get to it. Something.

1290
02:08:24,201 --> 02:08:31,251
So in your case, presentation group, you know, I knew I was here.

1291
02:08:32,831 --> 02:08:37,341
I know what you're doing. Don't put it that way. Oh, I don't mind.

1292
02:08:37,761 --> 02:08:43,311
Yeah. So that's what I feel like. I have such an image of a group.

1293
02:08:43,321 --> 02:08:55,331
I said I wanted to show them what they had to do, so I was just like, Yeah, I like that.

1294
02:08:55,921 --> 02:09:03,171
That's a hypothesis. Okay. How are you doing there?

1295
02:09:03,201 --> 02:09:10,221
Because I think I couldn't see everyone here, but that's okay.

1296
02:09:11,361 --> 02:09:16,411
All right. Everybody here I got.

1297
02:09:16,561 --> 02:09:30,341
So I people are you know, how you're dealing with this topic.

1298
02:09:30,651 --> 02:09:40,161
How would you respond?

1299
02:09:40,161 --> 02:09:42,772
You laugh so that you can produce a group of other folks.

1300
02:09:45,179 --> 02:09:53,159
All right. What are we doing? How are we doing? We need more time or we get more time.

1301
02:09:53,859 --> 02:09:58,039
Yeah. Okay. Here's opposed to this way. We have to take five more minutes.

1302
02:09:58,049 --> 02:10:02,579
Do we mind seeing a few minutes past 10 to 7? Is that okay? Okay.

1303
02:10:02,789 --> 02:10:07,399
I would have to leave. I do it now, so let's do this.

1304
02:10:08,639 --> 02:10:15,779
I'd like to hear before we before we continue, I want to hear kind of where we are so far, and then we'll pick up a little bit of this next week.

1305
02:10:15,949 --> 02:10:22,919
Okay. We can just hear from each other a little bit. So who identified what this case was so far,

1306
02:10:23,039 --> 02:10:32,199
or would you all identify that a decision basically as it should remain in position as CEO of HCC

1307
02:10:32,219 --> 02:10:36,959
or take on the responsibility of a national expansion and to partner with the BLUMARINE Group.

1308
02:10:37,319 --> 02:10:41,589
Okay. Others, we feel differently. We agree with that. Yeah.

1309
02:10:41,829 --> 02:10:46,739
Okay. All right. What questions are we asking to the listeners?

1310
02:10:50,719 --> 02:10:59,499
I can I just. So a question I had had, was I national expansion?

1311
02:10:59,539 --> 02:11:04,599
Do they want to make it a larger organization like the American Medical Association,

1312
02:11:04,609 --> 02:11:09,009
or are they putting like an association like the Chicago conference?

1313
02:11:09,429 --> 02:11:15,859
Like, let's see. All right. So a more clarification around what type of expansion this would be.

1314
02:11:17,509 --> 02:11:19,188
All right. What are the other options?

1315
02:11:19,189 --> 02:11:28,459
What are some other options that we could identify or we could think about as part of this decision and think about other options, other questions?

1316
02:11:29,379 --> 02:11:35,659
Yeah, that obviously we talked about just a few mentioned is going to be more in for having the capacity to

1317
02:11:35,659 --> 02:11:40,818
take on this neuro community as a young kid at home who's already stressed out about didn't elaborate,

1318
02:11:40,819 --> 02:11:43,879
but said, you know, in a stressful situation,

1319
02:11:44,719 --> 02:11:53,119
something that you don't want to take on a new project in that you're already kind of planning for like being a part of it.

1320
02:11:53,959 --> 02:12:01,549
So we had a couple of questions like how will expanding beyond Harlem impact the work or the progress that was being made in Harlem as of now?

1321
02:12:02,239 --> 02:12:07,579
And what would expanding look like for the members since most of them are already overbooking?

1322
02:12:08,269 --> 02:12:12,379
And then something that's at stake, other resources for Harlem,

1323
02:12:12,589 --> 02:12:19,249
like public opinion among people that are being served by the organization and the progress that's been made.

1324
02:12:20,639 --> 02:12:30,799
Right. Excellent. Yeah. We talked about if they don't have the capacity organization doesn't have the capacity to take on the national role,

1325
02:12:32,689 --> 02:12:37,639
that they should have kind of an internal team audit to understand what structures they have,

1326
02:12:37,639 --> 02:12:48,609
the capacity they have internally to focus on, think about furthering support for Harlem whether that is supporting small business across.

1327
02:12:50,099 --> 02:12:55,229
Right. What do we do about it? Certainly we would expand on what you said.

1328
02:12:55,439 --> 02:12:59,098
I'm just saying, how would the program model need to be better adapted to fit the needs of the

1329
02:12:59,099 --> 02:13:02,819
individual cities themselves because each community is going to be different.

1330
02:13:03,809 --> 02:13:09,209
How long will manpower. You need to carry that out as well?

1331
02:13:10,649 --> 02:13:15,059
Okay, I've got time for one. What are we going to do about it? What are we doing?

1332
02:13:17,459 --> 02:13:20,899
Someone recommended. I bet you someone had an idea. What's our hypothesis?

1333
02:13:20,949 --> 02:13:29,319
What's the recommendation? We said we weren't sure if he should take the offer because he just as starting as CEO,

1334
02:13:29,319 --> 02:13:32,619
talked a lot about his mental health and if he could really take on the opportunity.

1335
02:13:33,579 --> 02:13:40,239
It also spoke about like how he's going to be the CEO for a really long time and we're getting over a pandemic right now.

1336
02:13:40,249 --> 02:13:46,179
Like there's a lot of opportunities in the future for something like this to come about, for him to expand.

1337
02:13:47,289 --> 02:13:48,339
And I think also,

1338
02:13:48,339 --> 02:13:54,009
like the first thing that opened my eyes when I was reading it was that they're already in the process of all the money to organization,

1339
02:13:54,009 --> 02:13:59,498
and we just kind of want to engage CV to help coordinate it so it gets out in the process.

1340
02:13:59,499 --> 02:14:04,239
They can kind of figure out how to solve and then really need the help to do that.

1341
02:14:05,149 --> 02:14:09,069
Okay. All right. So a preview for next week.

1342
02:14:09,069 --> 02:14:12,429
We'll come back to this because they were our first group to offer a recommendation.

1343
02:14:12,909 --> 02:14:20,169
I'm on the board. I don't agree we're going to do this on friendly terms through change.

1344
02:14:20,439 --> 02:14:27,629
You could say that HCC can have a smaller role in helping expand the program rather than completely implementing it.

1345
02:14:28,209 --> 02:14:32,649
Right. All right. So we'll go have a couple and then we'll then we'll wrap up.

1346
02:14:33,609 --> 02:14:39,848
We have the option of like expanding to only a few other alternative sites to try to see how that goes.

1347
02:14:39,849 --> 02:14:44,059
And then going from there, I was just saying, okay, so gradual process.

1348
02:14:44,099 --> 02:14:50,919
So here's what I want to leave you with. Okay. So this is what I want to leave you with.

1349
02:14:51,099 --> 02:14:57,759
So the thing is this this case sets out a CTO who has a lot of different things

1350
02:14:57,759 --> 02:15:01,239
that are maybe barriers to being able to move forward with the decision.

1351
02:15:02,229 --> 02:15:08,799
The board that's responsible for hiring him, they likely have an agenda, too.

1352
02:15:09,849 --> 02:15:14,559
So making the case that, you know, you're overwhelmed or a lot going on, etc.,

1353
02:15:14,559 --> 02:15:20,649
all of that you better have or best have a really good reason why, number one.

1354
02:15:20,739 --> 02:15:26,439
And number two, what are you going to do in order to kind of make it right so you can see in the back two groups.

1355
02:15:26,799 --> 02:15:30,849
All right. So excellent suggestion to sort of think about maybe not for moving forward,

1356
02:15:31,149 --> 02:15:36,429
but here in the back to recommendations of how we're going to try to build consensus,

1357
02:15:36,819 --> 02:15:41,648
what we're going to do to get everybody on board so that we aren't going to have a situation of,

1358
02:15:41,649 --> 02:15:45,369
well, wait a minute, you promised that you were going to come and determine all this around,

1359
02:15:45,759 --> 02:15:48,398
and now you're saying no to the first thing that we're looking to try.

1360
02:15:48,399 --> 02:15:53,919
And that's how I want you to be thinking about these, and I want you to really be thinking about all of it.

1361
02:15:54,189 --> 02:15:56,949
Every time you come up with a suggestion, I want you to think to yourself,

1362
02:15:57,039 --> 02:16:01,269
Okay, what do I do if someone looks at me and says, Nope, I don't like that.

1363
02:16:02,169 --> 02:16:06,759
Okay, and then you'll start to think about them critically. Next week we'll take on a little bit more.

1364
02:16:06,999 --> 02:16:09,669
Our first case presentation group will be up.

1365
02:16:11,019 --> 02:16:17,169
Did you all notice how well you were able to jump right into that case and work on that and didn't take you very long to get going on it?

1366
02:16:17,469 --> 02:16:21,399
Yeah, because you all read it. Thank you for doing that.

1367
02:16:21,849 --> 02:16:27,759
I expect every week like that so that we can engage in such a pleasure.

1368
02:16:32,669 --> 02:16:38,138
So 1/2 for this week.

1369
02:16:38,139 --> 02:16:42,548
For this week, for those slides. Do me a favor. If you finished, submit them.

1370
02:16:42,549 --> 02:16:45,759
If you need some more time, submit them in the next week.

1371
02:16:45,759 --> 02:16:48,819
If you need more time yet next week, we'll see where we are.

1372
02:16:49,029 --> 02:16:53,769
Just a practice. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Kim.
