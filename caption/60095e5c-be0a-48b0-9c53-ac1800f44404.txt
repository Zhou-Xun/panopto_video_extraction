00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Population Health Part one. My name is Alfred Franzblau.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm a medical doctor and I'm a professor in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences in

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the School of Public Health. In addition to being trained in internal medicine, I specialize

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
in an area of preventive or public health medicine called occupational and

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
environmental medicine, which focuses on illnesses and injuries related

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
to exposures in workplaces and the general environment. I want

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
to speak with you today about population health.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
In the first segment of this lecture, we will discuss the concepts of health, public

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
health and population health and how these concepts are related and how they differ.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In the second, third and fourth parts of this lecture, we will focus on three

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
key measures of population health, in particular infant mortality,

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
life expectancy and mortality rates for each of these three measures

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
of population health. We will explore how they have changed over time and

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
why. How does the United States compare with other countries?

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What are some important patterns and why? How does population health help

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
to explain and or understand trends over time and thereby

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
inform public health policy or interventions?

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So how do we define the three concepts, health, public health and population

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:56,000
health? How do they differ? And also, how are they related?

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
In a previous lecture, we defined public health briefly as the set of activities

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
a society undertakes to monitor and improve the health of its collective membership.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
In the early 20th century, Charles Edward Winslow, a leader

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
of American public health, offered a more comprehensive definition of public health.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He called it the science and the art of preventing disease, prolonging

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
life and promoting physical health and efficiency through organized community

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
efforts for the sanitation of the environment. The control of community infections.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The education of the individual in the principles of personal hygiene. The Organization

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
of Medical and Nursing Services for the early diagnosis and preventive treatment of disease.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And the development of the social machinery which will ensure to every individual and the community

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
a standard of living adequate for the maintenance of health. This may be quite

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
a mouthful, but it highlights that public health is multifaceted. Public

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
health involves a broad range of activities that include three key domains assessment,

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
policy and assurance. It is also much more than just medical

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
care or medical practice.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
In contrast to public health, the concept of health is focused on the individual.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Some have defined health solely in terms of physical health, such as freedom from disease.

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But others, like the World Health Organization, have taken a broader, more holistic

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
approach that includes more than just physical well-being and also encompasses mental

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
and social wellbeing. Hence, personal

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
or individual health is multi-dimensional. But the concepts of health

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and public health are not totally distinct, as illustrated by the Venn diagram. The concepts

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
of health and public health are overlapping. Public health often has a major impact

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
on the health of individuals and conversely, the collective health of the individuals

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
in a population represents the public health.

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So what is population health and how is it related to or how does it differ

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
from health and public health? How is it related to these latter concepts,

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
population health has been defined as the health outcomes of a group of individuals,

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
including the distribution of such outcomes within the group. It is inherently

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
a numerical concept. It involves collecting health data on

50
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
or about individuals health risk factors and health outcomes that taken together

51
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
provide an assessment of a population's health.

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Examination of risk factors and outcomes provides a basis for assessing temporal

53
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
trends and also for making comparisons between populations.

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Population health looks for patterns in health data that may help to explain

55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
or to understand such trends. Population health can provide a justification

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
for public health policy or interventions that seek to improve individual

57
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
health outcomes. Population health can also provide a foundation

58
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:37,000
for assessing the impact of such interventions.

59
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So having presented these various definitions, it might be helpful

60
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
to evaluate a case study in order to help clarify these concepts.

61
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Consider the case of Joe Smith, who's a student at the University of Michigan

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
who happens to live in Markley Hall a few weeks after beginning a semester

63
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
over two or three days. He developed symptoms consisting of cough, fever

64
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and malaise, and he goes to the University Health Service for evaluation.

65
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So the first question is, is this a health issue? Well, of course

66
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
it is. Joe's health has been adversely impacted as manifested by the symptoms he is

67
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
experiencing, which leads to the next question.

68
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Is this a public health issue? Well, maybe it depends.

69
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Does he have a routine cold? If that were the case, the public health implications

70
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
would be minor. On the other hand, what if he were found to have the seasonal flu?

71
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This would then lead to more questions. Is his flu virus covered

72
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
by the seasonal flu vaccine? And if so, did he get the vaccine or

73
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
not? And importantly, what do we know about other people living in Markley

74
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
or elsewhere on campus having received the flu vaccine? Does there need to be a campaign

75
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
to get people vaccinated quickly to prevent the flu from spreading through his dorm

76
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and elsewhere on the campus or even into the more general community? The point being

77
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
that the details of Joe's illness may or may not have important ramifications

78
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
with regard to public health actions and interventions in his dorm, on the campus

79
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and in the more general community. A key question is how might we determine

80
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
whether there is a public health problem and if so, what can be done about it? This leads

81
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
to the last question. Is Joe's illness a population health issue?

82
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Again, this depends again. Suppose he was diagnosed

83
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
with the flu recall. He lives in Markley, which typically houses just

84
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
under twelve hundred students. Suppose the University Health Service

85
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
had been collecting data that showed in the preceding week that 50 other students

86
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
in Markley had been diagnosed with the same flu, but they were in the same timeframe.

87
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Only five students had been diagnosed with the flu. In South Quad

88
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and similarly in West Quad, both of which has roughly the same number of students as

89
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Markley. These data clearly indicate that not only is there flu circulating

90
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
on the campus, but that for some reason there is a 10 fold higher

91
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
rate of transmission in Markley than in the other residence halls. These

92
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
data not only support a campaign to get people vaccinated in general, but might warrant

93
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
further investigation as to why transmission has been 10 times greater and Markley

94
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
than in the other residence halls. In addition to a vaccination campaign, should

95
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
there be a temporary quarantine of students living in Markley to prevent further spread of the virus?

96
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Finally, imagine the same scenario, but substitute covered 19

97
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
for the flu. The point is that the data provide a foundation for framing

98
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
questions, for understanding the problem, and for designing possible interventions

99
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
to protect the public's health and individual health. The collection and use

100
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,000
of data is an essential foundation of population health.

101
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Population health is more than just numbers. It can reveal trends. It

102
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
allows for comparisons and for assessment of patterns in the data.

103
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The data can provide for identification of underlying causes or explanations of trends.

104
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And importantly, the data can provide a basis for public health interventions.

105
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
We will be looking at such data throughout this course.

106
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
In the last three segments of this lecture, we will focus on three key measures

107
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
of population health, including infant mortality, life expectancy

108
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and death rates. We will explore temporal and historical trends,

109
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
offer some explanations for these historical trends, and also make some comparisons

110
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:30,089
between the United States and other countries.
