00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:10,500
Hello and welcome back. In this session, I will discuss the tasks that will be completed from months July through September.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:19,280
During this time frame, you will be preparing and working on program documents for your application.

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,000
One of those documents will be your personal statement

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,620
I have allocated three months to work on your personal statement because this is the most important component of your application.

5
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:36,850
The personal statement is the university's first impression of who you are as a person,

6
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:46,000
as a student and as a professional. Your essays can either positively or negatively impact your chances of being accepted.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,180
This is your first impression. So make it great. Personal statements, usually have a word count, and this can be very intimidating.

8
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:04,330
You would have to demonstrate who you are and why you are a great candidate for this program in between 250 to 500 words.

9
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:11,380
To do this, you want to be original and be personable. Begin your essay with an attention grabber,

10
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:19,390
start off with a personal story or be different and write a poem or a song as your essay or be creative.

11
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:28,630
Also, try to use real life examples of impossible so the application committee  can see who you are and the experiences that shape you.

12
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,460
Gain insight from those close to you about who you are as an individual.

13
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,190
Sometimes we underestimate who we are and the impact we have had.

14
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:44,860
it it's OK to recycle life stories or other components of each program for each program's personal statement.

15
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:51,730
But remember to always write and essay that is tailored to that particular school or program.

16
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:56,200
And lastly, the most important tip is to stay on topic with the prompt.

17
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,640
It is very common for people to write off topic and sometimes we feel inclined to

18
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,070
keep this information because it sounds great. However are limited with words.

19
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:10,200
And if it does not relate to the point, then delete it.

20
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:19,440
By staying on topic, you were answering, not only answering the prompt, but showing your ability to follow directions.

21
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,850
Additional tips for writing your essay always have another set of eyes read your essays before submission.

22
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:34,320
Get feedback from your friends, family members or mentors about your writing.

23
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,510
If your school has a writing center or career center, schedule time, then to review your essays as well.

24
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:46,960
Get their feedback and return again to make sure that their concerns were addressed.

25
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:54,620
There will be a lot of drafting and editing until the final papers is complete and ready for submission, so do not get discouraged.

26
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:06,050
As a reminder, personal statements cannot be completed in one sitting. Use the entire three months to create a meaningful and well-written essay.

27
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,430
For these months, you will also be requesting your letters of recommendation.

28
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,110
I will provide you with a brief introduction about letters of recommendation.

29
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:20,840
More information will be provided by the FPHLP team in a later video. To keep it short,

30
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,440
the purpose of letters of recommendation is to endorse your skills,

31
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:36,590
capabilities and potential as a student and a professional. Request letter from those that actually have an academic or professional relationship with.

32
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:41,750
During this time, you will also be working on working to update your resume.

33
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:47,830
You are will have the opportunity to get assistance with updating your resume from Krystle Forbes,

34
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:53,300
who is the career service coordinator and adviser at the University of Michigan

35
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,130
School of Public Health in a later session that will live. For right now,

36
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,920
just be sure that your resume is current by

37
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:11,110
including all your most recent experiences. Also only include activities and opportunities you have already engaged in.

38
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:18,310
Right now, you will also be requesting your transcripts, academic transcript displays your course

39
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:28,840
history. it shows the courses you have taken and the grade recieved for that course, it also includes your semester, an overall GPA.

40
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,000
There are two types of transcripts: you have your official transcript and your unofficial transcript.

41
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,160
Unofficial transcripts have the university seal, which makes it official.

42
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:45,520
The unofficial transcript can be found on the university's website and it's not as official.

43
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,890
Usually it's just something you can go and download and just add it to your application.

44
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:55,930
Currently schools accept the unofficial transcript during the application process and

45
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:01,330
require the official transcript after you have decided to accept the school's offer.

46
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,970
Check with your program of interest to understand their transcript requirements.

47
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:12,970
If your program uses SOPHAS, you will be required to manually type in your transcript.

48
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,960
SOPHAS would they have a check over your transcript for any errors

49
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,950
and this process usually takes between five to seven business day.

50
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:28,500
So it was recommended that you do not procrastinate. And that you go ahead and get these transcripts in.

51
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:37,920
So we have just went over  months, April through September. This may seem hectic because of GRE preparation,

52
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:44,550
taking the GRE exam and completing those application documents, however, if you follow this timeline, and create

53
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:53,870
a weekly plan devoted to the time to completing these tasks, the process will seem less daunting.

54
00:05:53,870 --> 00:06:00,650
In the next session, I will go over the finalization and submission process for graduate school applications.

55
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,600
Also, I would give an overview of the free application for federal student aid,

56
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:12,586
also known as FAFSA and the importance of locating funds outside the university.
