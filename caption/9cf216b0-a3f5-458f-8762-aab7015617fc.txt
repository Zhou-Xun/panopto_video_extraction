00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,180
Welcome to this lecture on
Introductory Concepts in Biostatistics.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:09,540
This lecture will cover common
study designs for collecting data.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,310
Now data do not simply appear.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,770
They're first collected with
a specific purpose in mind.

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,710
And knowing how the data were
collected is essential to knowing how

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,060
we can best use them.

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,960
Data can be collected from a clinical
trial for medical health records,

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,030
from insurance claims or
from a cross sectional national survey.

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,800
They all might have similar variables, but

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,290
they will have vastly different
interpretations and uses for their data.

11
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,130
So the learning objectives in this
module are first to understand four

12
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,010
different methods for
collecting data in public health.

13
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,974
Including a randomized control trial,
a case-control study,

14
00:00:44,974 --> 00:00:48,880
a cross-sectional study and
a prospective cohort study.

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,050
And then, to the benefits and

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,390
limitations of the four different data
collection methods I just described.

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,330
Now, as I stated in previous lectures,
really what we're interested in doing

18
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,230
when we collect data is
understanding how an exposure and

19
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,800
an outcome are related to each other.

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,280
We might consider the exposure
of chewing gum and

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,520
the later outcome of having
a cavity filled by the dentist.

22
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,510
So again, our exposure is chewing gum or
the amount of gum we chew and

23
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:19,990
the outcome might be having a cavity
filled or the number of cavities filled.

24
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:24,860
The second example might examine the use
of an anesthetic for dental pain.

25
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,890
Here we have a picture of lidocaine,
which is used for dental surgery.

26
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,120
And the outcome might be then how
much pain is actually experienced by

27
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,800
the patient after they
are given the anesthetic.

28
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,570
So again, the exposure is
receiving like lidocaine or

29
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,730
perhaps the dosage of lidocaine, and

30
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:47,350
the outcome is the level of pain the
patient experiences during their surgery.

31
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,070
Now, ideally,

32
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:53,090
we collect variables in the order in
which they are related to each other.

33
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,540
So we would first collect information
on the exposure for each person.

34
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,350
And then over time, wait for
the outcome to happen, and

35
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,730
then collect information on
the outcome for each individual.

36
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,450
So we determine first if
each subject was exposed, or

37
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,360
perhaps the amount of exposure.

38
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,540
If it were a drug, we'd want to
know the dosage of the exposure.

39
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,100
And then we later see what
happens to each subject.

40
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,620
This data collection method is known
as a prospective study design,

41
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:26,860
because it follows the order in
which exposure follows outcome.

42
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,750
The hallmark of a prospective study
is a randomized controlled trial.

43
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,260
And in a randomized controlled trial,

44
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,510
we have a study population from
whom we will collect data.

45
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:42,800
The exposure is under our control, and so
we randomly decide that some people in

46
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,360
the sample will get the treatment,
as highlighted in red, and

47
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,960
some will get something else,
typically a comparative control.

48
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,240
As highlighted by the green.

49
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,710
We then follow these two groups
of individuals over time.

50
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,870
The gray then indicates that some
individuals experience the outcome, and

51
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,070
some don't, and then we compare
the results of these two groups

52
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:10,110
to see how the outcome and
the exposure were related to each other.

53
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,350
Sometimes the exposure is not under
our control and cannot be randomized.

54
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,900
In this case, we gather two groups of
people some who have the exposure and

55
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,590
some who don't.

56
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,660
And this example we have a group
of smokers indicated in red, and

57
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,750
we have a group of non smokers
as indicated by the green.

58
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,780
Smoking is an exposure which would be
unethical to randomized individuals.

59
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,780
Therefore we follow smokers and
non smokers over time.

60
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,330
At a later point in time, we will see
the outcome occur in some individuals and

61
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,580
some not as indicated by the grey.

62
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,770
And once again we compare the results
of these two groups to see if there is

63
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:52,690
any association between smoking and
the outcome of interest.

64
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,980
However, in many public health settings,

65
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,440
our only option is to collect
the data in reverse order.

66
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,320
In this case we might know
the outcome of each individual, but

67
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,250
we don't know who was exposed and
who wasn't.

68
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,830
So we first gather the outcome and
then go back in time,

69
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:13,520
perhaps looking in medical records,
to see who was exposed and who wasn't.

70
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,380
Again, we first determine what
happened to each subject and

71
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,860
then we determine if each subject
was previously exposed or

72
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:26,410
we collect the amount of exposure for each
individual after we know their outcome.

73
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,640
This design is known as a Retrospective
Study Design because the data collection

74
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:36,100
goes in reverse order of how we think
the exposure and the outcome are related.

75
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,360
The classic example of
a retrospective study design

76
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,880
is what's known as a case control study.

77
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,540
And this example here again,
I have two groups of people.

78
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,930
The first group in red
are individuals who have cancer.

79
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,830
And in green are the individuals
who do not have cancer.

80
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,780
Cancer patients are called cases.

81
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,900
They are the people that have
the outcome of interest.

82
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,890
The individuals in green are called
controls, because they do not have cancer.

83
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,575
Hence giving the study the name,
case control study.

84
00:05:05,575 --> 00:05:09,955
Now that we know the outcome of each
individual, we must go back in time and

85
00:05:09,955 --> 00:05:13,245
take histories,
began perhaps look at medical records.

86
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:16,395
And determine for
both groups who has been exposed and

87
00:05:16,395 --> 00:05:19,690
who was not as indicated in the gray.

88
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,440
And again, we compare differences between
these two groups to determine if in fact,

89
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,560
there's an association between cancer and
the exposure of interest.

90
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,790
Now these three study designs that I've
just discussed all include some aspect of

91
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:37,600
time, a perspective study design,
first collects exposure data and

92
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,340
then moves forward in time
to see who has what outcome.

93
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,020
In contrast, a retrospective study design
first collects the outcome data, and

94
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,360
then goes back in time to figure out
who was exposed and who was not.

95
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,400
A first commonly used study data is
known as a cross-sectional study design,

96
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,310
and it's one in which all of the data
elements, both the exposure and

97
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:04,970
the outcomes are measured at
one specific point in time.

98
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,140
Now this study design is very useful for

99
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,480
looking at the relationship between
the exposure and the outcome.

100
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:17,230
But because we collect all the data at the
same time, we cannot determine whether or

101
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,860
not the exposure actually
causes the outcome.

102
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,750
And this is an important aspect
throughout the remainder of this course.

103
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,740
We can talk about associations of two
variables, but it is often much more

104
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,700
difficult to determine if one
variable causes the other variable.

105
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,340
So at this point,

106
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,730
I've described to you different approaches
we can use to collect our data.

107
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,186
But now we need to decide how much and
what kind of data we want to collect.

108
00:06:41,186 --> 00:06:47,590
And we need to describe the kinds of
data that we might consider collecting.

109
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,910
And different types of data,
need different analysis approaches.
