1
00:00:03,244 --> 00:00:07,201
So Part 2, Infant Mortality.

2
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:10,760
So a couple of key definitions
with infant mortality.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,056
Infant mortality itself is the death
of a baby who was alive at birth, but

4
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,955
died before reaching his or
her first birthday.

5
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:22,667
Infant mortality rate is the number of
deaths of infants under one year per

6
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:24,342
1,000 live births.

7
00:00:24,342 --> 00:00:28,402
This rate and this definition
is standardized globally, so

8
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:35,918
that we're comparing similar numbers
across communities, states, and nations.

9
00:00:35,918 --> 00:00:40,608
Infant mortality is a sensitive
measure of the overall and

10
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:44,533
well-being of women,
of our communities, and

11
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:49,719
of our nations, and so
we track infant mortality most closely.

12
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:55,588
And not only when we're talking about
the well-being of our communities,

13
00:00:55,588 --> 00:01:00,081
of course when an infant dies
there is a tremendous adverse

14
00:01:00,081 --> 00:01:06,666
impact across family and
an entire community.

15
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:11,120
If we look at our progress over the last
70 years, we can be very proud of

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,395
the fact that infant mortality
has substantially decreased.

17
00:01:15,395 --> 00:01:20,535
If we look at overall infant
mortality going from the upper 40s

18
00:01:20,535 --> 00:01:26,546
per 1,000 live births all the way
down into less than 10 on average.

19
00:01:26,546 --> 00:01:35,793
That is a testament to improved health and
improved care of individuals and families.

20
00:01:35,793 --> 00:01:40,144
If we look at our rankings compared
to other countries, however,

21
00:01:40,144 --> 00:01:44,760
we're getting substantially
worse from a global perspective.

22
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:50,714
So if we look in the 1960s we were
11th in infant mortality rates,

23
00:01:50,714 --> 00:01:55,987
and as we come over even here
to 2013 we're ranked 50th.

24
00:01:55,987 --> 00:02:00,280
So what this means is that we're
substantially behind advances

25
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,880
in other wealthy countries to
decrease our infant mortality rate.

26
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,890
If we look at where we are here in 2013,

27
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:13,340
our infant mortality rate is quite
comparable to Croatia and Cuba.

28
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:19,587
Which are countries that have a
significantly lower investment per person

29
00:02:19,587 --> 00:02:25,845
in healthcare, and so it's surprising
that our rankings would be so low.

30
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:29,049
And this is just another
depiction of where we are today,

31
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,130
looking at infant mortality rates.

32
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:36,782
To see that despite the amount of money we
spend on our healthcare, that we are not

33
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:44,453
ranking as high as many wealthy countries
that we consider peer countries.

34
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:48,411
Now if we look at infant mortality
rates in the United States,

35
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:52,992
we can see that its infant mortality
rates are also state-dependent.

36
00:02:52,992 --> 00:02:59,537
And this is the overall rate of
infant mortality in the US in 2011.

37
00:02:59,537 --> 00:03:05,125
So you can see here, so the dark blue
is the highest infant mortality rate,

38
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:09,550
and the light green is the lowest
infant mortality rate.

39
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,990
So those disparities have shifted.

40
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:16,049
So we can see that when we're even
discussing the United States that there

41
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:19,662
are pockets where there are much
higher infant mortality rates.

42
00:03:19,662 --> 00:03:24,170
And indicates that we really need
to work in a more focused nature on

43
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,460
providing care in these communities.

44
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,960
So if we look at Michigan as an example
of the geographic disparities that

45
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,070
exist in infant mortality.

46
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,951
We can see here, so this is data
from 2013, in Michigan overall,

47
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:44,189
across the population our
infant mortality rate is 7.4.

48
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:48,589
The goal, or
healthy people at 2020 goal is 4.5, so

49
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:52,552
we still have a long way to
go across our entire state.

50
00:03:52,552 --> 00:03:56,650
However, if we look at the geographic
disparities, Wayne County,

51
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,540
which is the county where Detroit is
located, the infant mortality rate is 10.

52
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,930
And if we look at just
the city of Detroit it's 13.4.

53
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,833
So this points to the fact these
substantial disparities exist and

54
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:15,835
we need to think about concerted
efforts in specific communities.

55
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:18,060
What else do we know
about these disparities?

56
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,793
We know that there's a substantial
racial and ethnic disparity.

57
00:04:21,793 --> 00:04:25,697
Black babies are much more likely
to die before one year of age.

58
00:04:25,697 --> 00:04:29,377
And if we look here we can see
when we're comparing yellow,

59
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:34,360
which is white babies and orange and
black babies that low birth weight.

60
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,417
Black babies over twice as
likely to be low birth weight,

61
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:42,823
black babies are substantially
more likely to be pre-term.

62
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:45,734
And infant mortality is
over double that for

63
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:48,494
black babies than it is for white babies.

64
00:04:48,494 --> 00:04:53,191
So once again, we want to talk about
how in our exploration of disparities

65
00:04:53,191 --> 00:04:56,320
that this is not a genetic predisposition.

66
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,953
But rather there are environmental and

67
00:04:58,953 --> 00:05:07,413
social contributors that are creating
this significant disparity.

68
00:05:07,413 --> 00:05:12,694
So if we look at the same data from
another view point, what we have

69
00:05:12,694 --> 00:05:19,060
here red squares are African-American
babies so it's much higher here.

70
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,645
And then we have,
compare it to the overall state level,

71
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:25,123
which is the green circles right here.

72
00:05:25,123 --> 00:05:30,969
If we look at the black to white ratio
demonstrating the disparities there,

73
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:35,078
we can see it's pretty
persistent that like 2.6 to

74
00:05:35,078 --> 00:05:41,654
2.9 times increased risk for black babies.

75
00:05:41,654 --> 00:05:45,309
So I'm transitioning now to
another part of the lecture,

76
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:47,850
I want to talk about three approaches.

77
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,798
And these are not the only
approaches that are available, but

78
00:05:50,798 --> 00:05:54,493
three approaches that have been shown
to improve maternal and child health.

79
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:58,975
So we're gonna talk about breastfeeding,
birth spacing and intended pregnancies and

80
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:02,733
also preventing premature births.
