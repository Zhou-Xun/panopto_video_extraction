1
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:43,950
I thought it was. You have go to community.

2
00:00:46,780 --> 00:01:01,360
You know. Yeah.

3
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:35,150
Fine Phi. And I am.

4
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:46,110
Can. Yeah.

5
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:24,440
So. Yeah.

6
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:14,490
Am. You got to be there for me.

7
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:43,930
She? I suppose.

8
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:56,180
I. Oh.

9
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:10,360
I think. You don't, actually.

10
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:30,800
Good morning. Good morning, everybody.

11
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,110
Okay. So we're going to go ahead and get started.

12
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:48,120
Hope you have a good weekend. I don't have any fun announcements from this weekend.

13
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,970
It was just regular. It's a letdown after the weekend before.

14
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,540
So today we're going to be talking about quantitative methods.

15
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,230
So we'll continue our discussion of gathering credible data.

16
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:13,380
This week, we'll talk about quantitative research and we'll also talk about probability sampling.

17
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:18,140
I realized and thinking about yesterday, the way that I order the lack,

18
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:26,640
the the subsequent lectures that if I one thing I want to make sure I don't imply over the next two weeks is that

19
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:36,910
probability sampling only belongs to quantitative and non probability sampling only belongs to qualitative.

20
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:44,639
That is not what I want to imply, and I'm just giving the disclaimer because I realize at looking at the order,

21
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,050
I'm like, Oh crap, I hope this does not imply what I did not mean to imply.

22
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:57,150
So just know that as we talk about sampling, that sampling.

23
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:08,980
Whether it's probability or non probability can be applied in both quantitative and qualitative research.

24
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:19,080
So with that said, other than that announcement, just know that Quiz three is opening up.

25
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:28,170
Thursday and. I want to go through a quiz, too.

26
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:31,920
I've got a couple questions and I will respond to those.

27
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,400
I want to make sure that I want to see kind of where they are.

28
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:44,970
If those questions show that commonly before I talk about quiz number two in class.

29
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:53,880
So just know if you email with the question. That's me trying to decide do I want to talk about it in class or just answer you personally?

30
00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:06,090
So I do see your emails and as always, if you have any questions about the upcoming assignment or anything else, feel free to email myself and Hannah.

31
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:12,300
And on Thursday, I realize I'm stuttering alone to Thursday.

32
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,560
I'm also going to talk about the next assignment.

33
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:24,670
The next group assignment, that is. So any other questions before I jump into material?

34
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,130
All right. So last week we talked about indicators.

35
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:43,140
And remember, indicators are a way of measuring constructs that show up in our evaluation questions or our logic model.

36
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,570
And they should be measurable, they should be specific, and they should be observable.

37
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:55,769
You know, there are other qualities that you should keep in mind when developing indicators, but above all,

38
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:01,589
you want to make sure that they are measurable versions of constructs that you

39
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:07,530
have named and either or and your logic model and the valuation questions.

40
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,209
And they're really important because once you have your indicators,

41
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:18,810
that's going to give you a sense of how you are going to pick which methods you pick or how you sample.

42
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:27,120
So it's, it's, it behooves you to take some time to think about what the best indicators are for answering

43
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:35,070
evaluation questions and if you have any kind of questions about making indicators.

44
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:41,920
Please feel free to reach out to us. I forgot to tell you.

45
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:48,389
Well, I guess Ari did tell you what we're talking about today, so. Actually.

46
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:53,100
Why did I put that? Sorry. I realize I made. I made a big deck for the whole week.

47
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,280
So we're not talking about probability sampling today.

48
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:09,610
So as I mentioned, we are talking about gathering incredible data and we talked about identifying indicators.

49
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:21,729
Well, we're going to start talking about for the next two weeks are these other three steps that are components of gathering credible data finding,

50
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:30,220
developing, finding or developing measures, determining a sampling strategy and selecting data collection methods and sources.

51
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,560
These are not necessarily in order. These are some things that you basically do in conjunction.

52
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:48,190
So you're identifying measures. You're thinking, thinking about how you're going to sample your population of interest.

53
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:55,060
You're thinking about how what best methods that you are going to use.

54
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,820
And essentially what we'll talk about today are the methods that fall under quantitative.

55
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:15,580
So what is quantitative research? Well, quantitative research is essentially the work of measuring or examining some type of phenomena.

56
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:27,850
In this case, a program. We're doing that by collecting numerical data that's eventually analyzed using mathematically based methods.

57
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:39,450
In particular, we're using statistics. Now, I will say that as a tip, as an evaluator,

58
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:47,640
even though you may not necessarily be doing your own analysis and this actually applies to all researchers,

59
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:55,050
you may not eventually do your own analysis as you kind of get further in your career,

60
00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:03,600
but it's important that you understand how your analyst are actually getting to what they're getting to.

61
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:11,580
So even though we won't get very deeply into statistics, if at all.

62
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:20,880
Well, a little bit in this course, I would highly recommend that you at least have a working knowledge of statistics as you go through your career.

63
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:30,450
Today, we'll talk about two types of ways that you can go about collecting data.

64
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,000
Quantitatively assessments and tests or surveys.

65
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:43,110
And then we'll talk about some related concepts, namely construct validity and we'll talk about reliability.

66
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,670
But first, so when do we use quantitative research?

67
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,290
We use it when we are classifying and counting.

68
00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:06,040
So, for example, if we're doing some descriptive work, we want to know, for example, the mean average or the mean value of.

69
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:11,760
How people rate it or self-reported their HIV knowledge.

70
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,420
We also use it when we're identifying numerical change.

71
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:27,060
So when we're doing more inferential analysis, we're trying to understand that were changes significant?

72
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:32,190
For example, on a pretest versus a pulse test.

73
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:41,940
Was there some sort of change in the mean knowledge that students had about HIV transmission?

74
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:50,460
We also use quantitative research when we're constructs constructing statistical models to explain what we're observing,

75
00:12:51,720 --> 00:13:02,940
whether it be a regression model to understand the factors that influence one's HIV AIDS risk behavior.

76
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:13,830
We might, you know, for example, use a statistical equation modeling to develop a model for explaining another construct.

77
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,700
We also use it to predict associations. We might use correlation.

78
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:31,590
We might use, again, regression events. And although this is not always the case in evaluation, because we don't always have on the hypothesis,

79
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:36,330
we do use quantitative research to prove or disprove a hypothesis.

80
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:46,530
So we might, for example, hypothesize that especially if we're doing a more kind of mathematical approach to our evaluation work,

81
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,960
we might hypothesize that based on increasing.

82
00:13:53,190 --> 00:14:00,270
The number of sessions that a student engages in for a gardening program,

83
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:10,260
the greater they will have knowledge about healthy eating and better increased positive attitudes around healthy eating.

84
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:18,499
Now. Hold on. Let me turn this off. What I just found out.

85
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,219
My son is not in class. Did you do that when you were a senior?

86
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,790
Just skip class for no reason at all. Oh, I love that.

87
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:32,080
Thank you. Honesty. Whereas here.

88
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:40,730
Just now. Being a parent is hard, but we did not have to worry about when am I?

89
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:48,110
When I was a kid, we didn't have to worry about our mom getting alerts on the watch, telling her that she's telling me, telling her that I was absent.

90
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:56,930
I just didn't go to school. So sorry.

91
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:01,640
Or maybe I have a secret desire to be a comedian that now know.

92
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:09,290
I'm just. I don't know. Anyway, understanding the difference between assessments in test and surveys.

93
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:16,609
So like I mentioned, the way we collect quantitative data is we do it through assessments and test,

94
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:22,160
which we've linked together because they serve a similar purpose and then surveys.

95
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:29,670
So our assessment and test, those are ways that we measure variables objectively.

96
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:45,780
Right. So, for example, if we have, you know, some static scale, some set scales around gardening that are part of this gardening program,

97
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:58,030
we would use an assessment to identify whether that person has obtained the necessary amount of skills or not.

98
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:01,320
It can also apply that knowledge or health outcomes.

99
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:08,940
What's specific about assessments in test is that the answers are compared to established standards.

100
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:20,860
So these are. These are tools where there is a set response that has objectively been determined.

101
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:28,330
It's been peer reviewed. It's been assessed according to some standard.

102
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:35,350
It's similar to when you were in high school or junior high or middle school, whatever they call it now.

103
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:45,729
Where you. There was a standard that you were supposed to score in the same way.

104
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:53,440
This is how we use assessment in test and quantitative research and public health and an evaluation.

105
00:16:55,090 --> 00:17:00,580
In contrast, surveys are used for measuring variables that are more subjective in nature.

106
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:05,050
So attitudes, opinions, self-reported behaviors.

107
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:13,990
For example, there is no one right attitude when it comes to whether kale is a great vegetable.

108
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:19,740
Now in terms of someone's preference, right?

109
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,270
You like kale? You don't like kale. That doesn't mean that you're right or wrong.

110
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:32,910
In contrast, you in an assessment, a question you might ask is, is kale considered high in vitamins?

111
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,220
That's an established fact.

112
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:45,470
So the difference is, is that with surveys, it's really they're really used to be able to gather information that is unique to a person.

113
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:56,300
Whereas assessments are used to gather what's objective in nature, what are at least what we've established to be known.

114
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:05,810
Now the trick with that is that when you are working with different populations, what's considered objective might differ.

115
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:17,270
So one thing you need to keep in mind when you are selecting assessments and tests in particular is that what is what the standard is,

116
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:22,310
is a standard that can be endorsed by a population of interest.

117
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:35,710
So it can get a little tricky, right? I mean, it's this it's the same argument you've probably heard about IQ test or g g r e test where yes,

118
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:45,280
there is technically an established standard that you need to score to get a certain score on either those test.

119
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,290
But we know that that standard may not apply to all populations of interest.

120
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,110
So some examples. Um, you know,

121
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:03,709
as I just made of assessments and test administering an educational assessment

122
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:08,540
test on gardening for an elementary school based program on healthier 80.

123
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:16,370
Testing participants knowledge about HIV transmission before and after a safer sex program.

124
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:26,130
Maybe you are using quality water quality testing to measure the environmental impact of a water quality monitoring program.

125
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:33,690
Or you might be assessing participants at sea levels before and after implementing a diabetes self-care intervention.

126
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,129
So again, these are these are objective standards that we know.

127
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:47,370
For example, we know there's a certain level of water or chemicals in water that will be considered high.

128
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:55,670
And so. Assessments and tests don't necessarily need to only be used on people.

129
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,790
But again, the measure itself is objective.

130
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:10,650
Examples of surveys in contrast assessing participants satisfaction level with a program again a matter of opinion,

131
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:20,370
measuring participants attitudes about exercise or comparing employees and students self-reported smoking behavior.

132
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:27,700
These are. These are elements that are subjective in nature.

133
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:36,430
So I don't know. How do we.

134
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:39,300
Sorry. I'm just mumbling to myself because of the overlap.

135
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:48,000
As you might imagine, I talk to myself all the time, even in the grocery store that makes for fun.

136
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,880
Like, who is your targeted way as a collect survey data?

137
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,440
So there's four primary ways that you could go about collecting survey data.

138
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,080
One is face to face, and typically that's interviewer administered.

139
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:13,830
There have been there are exceptions to that. For example, if you are if the test itself is of a sensitive nature,

140
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:22,050
there have been cases where it's recommended that you do that face to face, but let the person self-administer the test.

141
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:34,690
Telephone, which can be interviewer or self-administered in the case of self-administered if it is a automatic survey.

142
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:40,260
You may have possibly received the call and it asks you to push what?

143
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:49,320
Even like a satisfaction survey after a service call, it asks you to push one if you agree to mail.

144
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:57,190
If it's a mail, it's self-administered. And then web, which is also a self administer test.

145
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:04,360
And then there are different kind of molds within these four kinds.

146
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:10,730
But these are the four primary ways that you will collect survey data or assessment and test data.

147
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:27,760
So in terms of thinking about collecting and thinking about which ways you would collect this data, some considerations that you should keep in mind.

148
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:34,910
One. Eliminate those that automatically bias your survey.

149
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:41,840
So for example, you are wanting to know the frequency of using the Internet for health information.

150
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:46,790
Well, you probably would, unless you can't get away from it.

151
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:53,810
Not use a Web survey. Why? Because the Web survey is, for one, pushing you on to the Web.

152
00:22:54,590 --> 00:23:02,000
But two, it's also probably most likely drawing in people who use the Web.

153
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:08,240
Whereas if it's somebody who's not comfortable using the Internet, they're probably not going to do your Web survey.

154
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:14,480
So you want to eliminate those that relate to.

155
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:22,030
Relate to the outcome of interest and take and create a bias.

156
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,620
You also want to keep the keep in mind the cost and the resources available.

157
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:39,520
Obviously, if it's face to face or it's otherwise administered.

158
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:48,470
By another person. It's going to cost more because you have to train and pay those people to be able to administer it.

159
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,620
Whereas if you're doing a mail survey, the cost might be a little lower.

160
00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:02,850
But then again, you also have to and I've had this lovely experience, put stamps on and stuff,

161
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:08,009
300 envelopes with surveys and then enter the data when it comes back.

162
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:15,700
You. But you might do that, for example, because I was working with a lot of seniors,

163
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,500
so we decided to do paper surveys because a lot of them didn't have emails.

164
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,440
Which leads to the third one who's taking your survey.

165
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:32,250
So you want to think about things like literacy, including media literacy.

166
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:42,280
How literate are they with technology? Different forms that we take in media, technology, skills, motivation, level.

167
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:55,150
Again, maybe you have a population of interest that might be able to use computers but might not like using computers.

168
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:00,260
And then finally, the types of questions you need to ask.

169
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:08,300
As I mentioned, you know, when the questions are more sensitive in nature.

170
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:18,430
Cloning, drug use, sexual behavior, you know, gender identity, sexual identity,

171
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:24,900
things that we know are already of our, you know, engagement and illegal behavior.

172
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,410
We know those things are sensitive.

173
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:37,000
So we're more likely to do a self-administered survey so that people are a little bit more secure in the issue of confidentiality.

174
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,150
So what are some best practices? So say you have to develop your survey.

175
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:59,100
Ideally, you're going to find measures that have been validated with the populations of interest, but that's not always going to be the case.

176
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:04,320
So say you have to develop your own survey or assessment or test.

177
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:09,570
What are some best practices? So there's four that I'll talk about today.

178
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:24,870
The first is language you use. You want to be you want to keep your survey simple and at a lower literacy level.

179
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:34,270
So approximately a fifth grade literacy level. The nice thing about things like programs like Microsoft Word is that they're

180
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:39,220
now starting to tell you a little bit more about what the literacy level is.

181
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:43,380
There's another one. I won't get into that.

182
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,740
But there are ways that you can assess literacy level.

183
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:51,090
Relatively easy using different software.

184
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:56,040
You want to avoid words that are more than 2 to 3 syllables.

185
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:09,330
If it comes down to you saying. You know, some jargony word versus a more simple word that might be actually two words.

186
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,870
It's better to go with the less jargony two words than it is to go with the jargony one word.

187
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,030
And again, you want to avoid jargon or terms that are not universal.

188
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,910
So that does sometimes mean working with, again, population of interest to identify.

189
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:34,510
Okay. If I start talking about evaluation, does that make sense to you now?

190
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,510
Now, it doesn't make sense to half of us as evaluators. So how would you say that?

191
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,290
The thing that you are evaluating, the program that you are evaluating.

192
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:47,190
So you want to try and avoid jargon.

193
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:58,210
Question wording. When you're developing the questions, you want to avoid double barrel questions.

194
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:04,930
And that's those are questions where you're asking about more than one topic at the same time.

195
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:11,500
Do you like chicken or how much do you like chicken and turkey?

196
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:19,190
Well, if a person says that they you know, that they always like chicken and turkey.

197
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:26,360
Do do you know that they're talking about chicken or are they talking about turkey or are they talking about both?

198
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:30,680
So you want to keep the subject of the question down to one.

199
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:38,690
Do you like chicken? Do you like turkey? And that way it is clear what they're responding to.

200
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,790
You don't want to make any assumptions in your questions as well.

201
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:50,649
So, for example, you don't want to ask a participant, how many cigarets do you smoke without asking?

202
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:57,430
Do you smoke? Think about that health questionnaire that you always have to fill out when you go see a new doctor.

203
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:10,190
The reason why I ask is. Do you smoke is because you don't want to create assumptions that might create some type of reticence

204
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:16,040
about responding or that might seem like you're making assumptions about your population of interest.

205
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:22,660
And yes, it seems like it would be easier just to say how many cigarets you smoke and just write zero.

206
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:34,210
But again, you want to make sure that you're not creating an atmosphere where somebody is resentful or concerned about completing your survey.

207
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,200
Be sure to define the terms as necessary.

208
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:50,560
For example, if you are doing a survey to find out about staff's level of cultural humility as they're implementing a program.

209
00:29:51,160 --> 00:30:00,440
Not everybody knows what cultural humility is, so it's perfectly fine to say culture, humility, and X questions will ask about cultural humility.

210
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,910
Cultural humility is etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

211
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:11,350
And that way it's clear that what they're responding to is the construct that you're actually trying to find out about.

212
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:18,770
And then finally you want to keep recall time span shorter when possible?

213
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:24,680
Of course. That's not always possible.

214
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:31,460
But, you know, think, for example, if you're doing a pull a one pulse test designed.

215
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,709
You might be doing that because you've a program has already ended.

216
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:42,510
And so you're asking them to recall back to something that had done in the past.

217
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,000
But wherever possible, you want to keep that recall timespan short.

218
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:53,490
So, for example, if they're engaging in an intervention, the intervention ends.

219
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,890
You want to ask questions at the end of the intervention, not six months later.

220
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:04,680
Because not only six months later, because you want to find out.

221
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:12,360
What are they recalling when they when they immediately leave the program?

222
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:35,690
The third thing is response options. So it's best if you're developing a survey where you have a scale, keeping that 5 to 7 point scale.

223
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,920
And it's also best when each scale option is labeled.

224
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:46,770
So you don't want to have questions where it just says on a scale from 1 to 10.

225
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,610
What would you rate your pain level? That is a common one.

226
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:59,570
And if you notice that increasingly those scales are getting shorter and they're being labeled.

227
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,890
And that's because one person seven might be another person's four.

228
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:07,970
Even though objectively the pain level was the same.

229
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:16,280
So you want to be able to at least have an understanding of what when the person says seven.

230
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:22,780
What does that seven mean? Be sure that response options do not overlap.

231
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:32,590
You know, you don't want to disagrees or you don't want a disagree,

232
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:40,180
some kind of disagree, somewhat disagree where there's some overlap over the degrees.

233
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:50,490
And then you also want to avoid agreed disagree rating scales when possible because of and I'm going to

234
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:58,600
struggle with this word equity essence bias and that is a bias where we're inclined to agree whenever we can.

235
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,230
We're more likely to agree than disagree. Yes.

236
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:20,950
Yeah. I can see also that a lot of. Yeah.

237
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,550
So that's the best answer I've ever give it.

238
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,830
But yes, some people do. You know, there you see it.

239
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:34,920
You still see it a lot. I still do it. And then I, like, teach a class.

240
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:42,220
I'm like, oh, you're not supposed to do it because it got ingrained into you so much that you forget that it's really.

241
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,520
Best practice to not actually have that neutral.

242
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:55,460
And if you think that the neutral is standing in for not applicable, you should just put in that applicable.

243
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:03,840
So you want to try and stay away from just agrees disagree scales and you want to try and stay away from neutral.

244
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:16,830
Sure. The best. So here is, you know, an example of what you could use instead of the strongly agree to strongly disagree scale.

245
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,970
Never. Seldom. Sometimes. You usually. Always.

246
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:30,500
And that way it actually gives you a little bit more information to, in this case, about behavior.

247
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:41,070
It gives you a little bit more information about frequency. And then the fourth tip is question ordering.

248
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:49,200
First question should be a simple question, something that's close and that require minimal recall.

249
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:56,410
What name would you like to use on this survey? How old are you?

250
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:07,390
Is it also helps that if you have a question that is going where the response will be fed into future questions to ask that as well.

251
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:18,880
So for example, if you're doing a survey about with someone about child rearing, you want to ask at the beginning, how many children do you have?

252
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:27,620
And then that way, you know what information should be fed into the rest of the questions.

253
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:35,030
Otherwise it's best to put those demographic questions and sensitive questions near the end of the survey.

254
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:44,900
So, for example, and developing a survey on HIV knowledge and attitudes, I'm going to likely put the attitudes after the knowledge.

255
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:51,950
Attitudes why? Because those are more sensitive. And then I'll put the demographic questions at the end.

256
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:59,330
And then you want to organize questions by topic. Keep similar questions together.

257
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:13,340
I would add on to this that one thing, though, to keep in mind is that if you are using multiple questions to measure the same construct.

258
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:18,700
So for example. Take this question again.

259
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:29,150
Seatbelts are just as likely to harm us. Help you say you're asking in a different way than just confirm that the person has that attitude.

260
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:33,070
So you might say later on, seatbelts.

261
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:47,620
Our harmful. You might not put that right next to me, next to that question, only because you're trying to use multiple questions to.

262
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:52,210
Gather information on the same topic or the same construct.

263
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:58,600
And you know, they say if you look at a measure like say you look at the.

264
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:07,780
The CCD, which is used to measure depression measures, constructs related to depression.

265
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:17,540
You know, failing concepts like feeling blue, feeling suicidal, feeling like you've lost interest.

266
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,680
It measures those in different questions.

267
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:31,100
But those questions are mixed up together because they're trying it's designed to confirm particular aspects of depressive episodes.

268
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:50,080
So we also want to keep in mind equity, right? And as I mentioned, with, you know, Cree approaches, culturally responsive and equitable approaches,

269
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:54,900
it's not necessarily about doing things, doing different things.

270
00:37:54,910 --> 00:38:04,150
It's about doing things differently. So again, you're going to still use these best practices for other things you want to keep in mind.

271
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:09,490
Be attuned to decisions about who's collecting data and how to collect it.

272
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,920
So we've talked about power dynamics.

273
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:22,060
If a teacher, for example, is collecting data from their own students, there's a power differential there that you might be concerned about.

274
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:31,330
If it's, for example, you are collecting data on a Web survey,

275
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:38,290
but you're doing it with low income populations that don't necessarily have access to technology,

276
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:46,330
although I quibble with that for the recording, but I'm not going to get onto that soapbox today.

277
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:50,179
But that's a standard thing you hear. Don't collect by.

278
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:55,540
I don't collect the web if you don't know that your population has access to the web.

279
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:02,440
Those are examples of being attuned to decisions about data collection in an equitable manner.

280
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:10,060
You want to identify and or develop data collection instruments that are validated with diverse populations.

281
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:19,799
So for example. A lot of specialty in psychology.

282
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:29,740
A lot of the mainstream measures were developed initially being validated with college populations.

283
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,610
If anybody who's taking psych one on one those,

284
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:40,810
you probably had to sit in and be one of those participants in the study where you had to go answer questions.

285
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:45,250
Am I the only one I have? I cannot be the only one to ask.

286
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:48,629
Like I feel like I see a bunch of blank faces now.

287
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:54,240
I don't know if that's because you don't know what I'm talking about, but typically if you take a psych 101 class.

288
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:59,880
You're going to have to participate in a research study as part of that.

289
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:13,429
The assignments. So because a lot of measures were developed that way, they had to again be validated with diverse populations so that we know that,

290
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:21,470
for example, if I am measuring depression, using this measure, using this scale, it's going to work.

291
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:32,100
Not only with. You know, a young white college student, but also an older black man who did not go to college.

292
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:39,470
So the nice thing is that a lot, you know, that's pretty much a lesson that's starting to be translated.

293
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:47,900
So you have to make sure, though, that when you're picking a scale that you do your due diligence and reading about who it's been validated with.

294
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,780
So you can usually find it in the peer reviewed article,

295
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:58,550
or if there's a web page dedicated to the scale from the developers, they'll have that information as well.

296
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:10,640
It also helps too, when you're doing data collection in an equitable fashion to have measures of root and causal factors and the effects of search.

297
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,970
So, for example, if you are.

298
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:22,010
Doing a measure of COVID. COVID vaccines.

299
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:27,750
It helps to ask a question about What is your attitude about experimental research?

300
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:38,830
Because especially if you're working with black and brown populations because of the history of history of medical experimentation.

301
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:45,370
But there's also potential confounding factors. So you want to think about those things as well.

302
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,190
And then finally, when you need to develop, develop through participatory methods.

303
00:41:53,640 --> 00:42:01,320
You know, that includes working with community groups to identify questions or at least the drafts of questions,

304
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:08,970
and then you apply the best practices after that. So, for example, a group might recommend asking about COVID.

305
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:21,290
Let's ask a question about, you know, your interest and when you ever get the Johnson Johnson or a or Moderna vaccine.

306
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:29,520
Well, you can just go later on. Split those into two questions because that's a terrible question.

307
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:36,690
And then work with the community group to discuss why you made it into two questions versus one.

308
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:43,320
That way, you just help build capacity for that, for that organization and for that community group.

309
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:55,960
Right. So any questions about surveys or assessments or tests before we go on to some related subjects?

310
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:07,690
So then we'll talk about construct validity. An associated topic.

311
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,780
Because when we are developing or selecting.

312
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,740
Measures we want. And this includes quantitative and qualitative.

313
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,390
We want to consider construct validity.

314
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:29,000
She I talked about internal validity, external validity.

315
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:33,410
Now we're finally talking about construct validity. So.

316
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:39,050
And that's defined as the extent to which a measure assesses the construct it's intended to.

317
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:45,920
So just like with validity, external and internal, it's about confidence.

318
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:53,060
And we'll talk about three types based validity, content, validity and criterion validity.

319
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:59,200
But before we jump into those three types of validity,

320
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:07,600
I want to just kind of remind you and as well as introduce something new to make sure we're clear,

321
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:12,490
like we're on the same page about what we're talking about when we talk about construct validity.

322
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:20,640
So constructs, as I talked about last week those are that your key concepts of a giving theory.

323
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:26,340
And again, it doesn't have to be like your capital or teach theory.

324
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,910
Right? It doesn't have to be the health belief model theory or.

325
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:37,360
Or it doesn't have to be a theory of plant behavior.

326
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:44,110
It can be just your theory of change. But the key concepts of that are its constructs.

327
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:56,890
And so they're very used in a particular theory to be kind of theoretical representations of real objects and real processes.

328
00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:01,180
So I used this example last week, if we are talking about.

329
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:13,480
Parent youth communication. Some different ways that we operational we will break this down into constructs.

330
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:19,360
Well, parents intention to talk to you. Parents attitudes about communication.

331
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:30,170
Youth perception of peers, communication. These are different ways that we have constructs related to parent youth communication.

332
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:39,380
In contrast measures. And I believe I remember somebody asked this question related to this measures.

333
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,560
These are actually asked about variables.

334
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:53,120
Measures are labels that are usually in America, the numerical that are assigned to an observation that's been subjected to measurement.

335
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:02,060
So let's take this construct parents attitudes about communication.

336
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:08,940
Well, we can pull a question from the parent adolescent communication scale.

337
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,740
That serves as a as a measure of this particular construct.

338
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:20,390
I am very satisfied with how my child and I talk together.

339
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:25,580
So that's an example of a measure of this construct.

340
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:32,840
And in the same way, if I want to measure youth perception of a parent's communication,

341
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:43,310
I might have a question like my mother slash father was always a good listener in that, you know, this question is something I would ask you.

342
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:53,190
This question is something I would ask parents. So when you're thinking about measures,

343
00:46:54,300 --> 00:47:02,250
you want to make sure that the concept that the measure is ask is responding to the construct that you want it to measure.

344
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:08,670
But I feel like I set that backwards. You want to make sure that the measure is measuring the construct.

345
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:21,930
So, for example, if I have a construct school climate, I want to say and I want to make sure that this measure, this five item,

346
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:28,799
these five items from the student basic psychological needs at school scale that that

347
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:34,440
is actually measuring school climate and so on and so on with the other two examples.

348
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:42,730
So when we start talking about validity, what we're talking about are the constructs, not the measures.

349
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:51,960
So the first construct, the type of construct validity is face validity.

350
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:59,740
And this is really the extent to which a measure appears to be measuring what it's supposed to measure for a given population.

351
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:04,080
So it's really a common sense approach to construct validity.

352
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:16,020
And, you know, say we go back to that Internet safety intervention that I use as an example sometimes.

353
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:20,010
So if we're going to ask a youth about Internet safety,

354
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:30,150
I want to have a youth actually review the tool to see does it have face validity with the population of interest.

355
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:39,880
The second type of construct validity is content validity.

356
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:46,660
And this is really the extent to which a measure or instrument covers all dimensions of the construct being measured.

357
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:54,100
So for example, I want to measure whether a program increased a community's capacity.

358
00:48:55,270 --> 00:49:06,970
So when I'm thinking about content validity, I want to know does the measure I'm using measure all dimensions of community capacity?

359
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:19,320
So according to in this case, according to a well used article from Goodman 1998,

360
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:26,340
there are ten dimensions of community capacity which include participation and leadership skills.

361
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:30,140
Sense of community and community power.

362
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:39,720
So you want to make sure that if you want high content validity, it's actually measuring all those dimensions.

363
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:45,120
Those tend not just for. So how do you figure that out?

364
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:50,420
You do your research. Look in the literature. That's way.

365
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,770
If you were doing it on community capacity,

366
00:49:52,770 --> 00:50:01,620
you likely come across this government article and that will let you know that if you're looking for a measure, it needs to be able to.

367
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:11,300
You know, measure all the dimensions of this construct. And then finally.

368
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:24,890
Criterion validity. And that's the extent to which a measure relates to other measures as expected.

369
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:31,840
And then there are three types of criterion validity. One is predictive validity.

370
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:38,300
That's how well does a measure predict something it should theoretically be able to predict.

371
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:43,070
So, you know, going back to the idea of the GRC.

372
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:49,910
If the GRC was a good predictor of academic success,

373
00:50:50,390 --> 00:51:03,050
you would see that there was a correlation or an associated statistical association between gray scores and the sub scores and student success.

374
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:11,090
So for example, if you score high on mat the math, I forget what this called math, the mathematical reasoning.

375
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:15,690
Then you would expect that somebody who scores high.

376
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:23,530
What actually do well in mathematics. And, you know, in contrast, they do poorly.

377
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:30,130
They would score poorly. We're now seeing that that is not the case.

378
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:37,570
So I don't know if it applied to you, but some of you may have been able to apply without submitting your grade scores.

379
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:46,660
Whereas I had to put I had to put up a case because my degree math score was just a little bit too low.

380
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:52,250
To get into the Ph.D. program. But then I did well with statistics.

381
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:56,220
There was no correlate. There wasn't a correlation. I just hate tests.

382
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:08,109
A lot. That's why I don't give them except for these quizzes, because I'm always like, Well, no, that doesn't make sense.

383
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:12,250
Let me do it that way anyway. Convergent validity.

384
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:17,790
That is how well a measure correlates, what measures overlay that constructs.

385
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:27,960
So, for example, if I measure a depression, I would think that that measure is going to correlate with measures of anxiety,

386
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:36,420
because we know from the literature, we know from various experiments that there is a strong correlation between depression and anxiety.

387
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:42,720
So if I find that the convergent validity is low, that's cause for concern.

388
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:53,250
And then finally, discriminant validity is to what extent a measure is uncorrelated when measures of an unrelated construct.

389
00:52:54,150 --> 00:53:00,720
So in taking this same example of a scale or a measure related to depression,

390
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:05,950
I would expect that to be uncorrelated with one that measures depression.

391
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:09,840
I mean, for happiness, right?

392
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:14,460
Because we would expect that depression and happiness would not be correlated.

393
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:25,850
So when we're thinking about assessing the validity of the measures that we either select or we develop,

394
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:34,040
really, there's no no value, no test to face validity and content validity.

395
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:44,540
So when you're assessing the validity of measures for those in those two respects, those two types, it's helpful to ask your stakeholders your,

396
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:52,820
you know, the parties that you're working with, as well as members of your population of interest to review the measures.

397
00:53:55,210 --> 00:54:04,510
And then in contrast, criterion validity, you can go about assessing that type of validity by pilot,

398
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:12,610
testing the measure and doing some preliminary statistical test to assess whether correlates as expected, with other constructs.

399
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:23,020
So in other words, your pilot testing it with your population of interest you're seeing, does it correlate with similar constructs?

400
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:26,860
Does it theoretically measure what you would expect it to measure?

401
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:30,700
And does it not correlate with unrelated constructs?

402
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:38,120
Any questions about construct validity?

403
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:46,640
Yes. So what do you do?

404
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:52,030
Where you're better in history. You don't have a massive consolidated.

405
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:58,350
Okay. So say you have a measure. So you have the measure.

406
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:04,860
You haven't designed it. Exactly. Preexisting medical practices that are commonly used.

407
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,980
Okay. Yeah. So say you find the measure and it looks great.

408
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:19,740
You're like, Oh, this is great, I should use it.

409
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:30,239
But then you realize it hasn't been validated with, you know, your population of interest or maybe it hasn't been validated.

410
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:36,480
What I, what the first thing I would check is, has it been validated with diverse populations.

411
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:42,230
So like, say. You know, I might be working with a you know.

412
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:52,410
Black LGBTQ youth. And they may not have gone as far as to validate it with black LGBTQ youth,

413
00:55:53,040 --> 00:56:01,050
but maybe they validated it with black LGBTQ adults or LGBTQ youth, regardless of race.

414
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:05,460
And you can see that they validated across different race.

415
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:14,070
So that that's the first step I would take because there even if it's not validated with your specific population,

416
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:20,610
there might be some sign that it's been validated with different populations and that can at least give you some confidence.

417
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:28,140
But say it, it's just straight up. College students from Ohio State University.

418
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:39,720
And we know there's something wrong with them. I better stop actually like Ohio State.

419
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:48,530
You have a beautiful campus. So what I would see is who I would look at, who has been validated with.

420
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:59,750
Maybe there are some commonalities that what draw allow me to kind of draw the conclusion that it would be useful.

421
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:09,910
So say it's been validated with this, you know, Latino LGBTQ youth.

422
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:18,850
So stigma is not diverse, but it's a population that also experiences discrimination because of sexual identity or gender identity.

423
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:24,599
But say even that is not the case. Know, it's just completely straight up.

424
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:31,860
Ohio State, you don't have any reason. What I would do is run it by the population of interest.

425
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:38,480
Now, if you don't if you have money to try and go through the process of a formal validation, that's great.

426
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:43,310
But nobody ever has that money. So run it by the population of interest.

427
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:49,850
And then if that requires wording to be changed and sometimes it does, that's okay.

428
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:53,750
The only thing I would recommend, though, is that if I change.

429
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,440
Often a measure will have subscales in it. Right.

430
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:10,110
So I want to make sure that if I change one question that it does it throw off the likely balance of of the subscale.

431
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:17,220
So for example, I would change the wording, but then run the subscale by and see if they're still correlated.

432
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:24,820
You know, thinking about the. Thinking about predictive validity.

433
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:30,200
And then when we talk about reliability. I'll go to it real fast.

434
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:34,280
I'll make sure that the internal consistency reliability is still the same.

435
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:44,110
Any other questions? Uh huh.

436
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:57,630
How would you describe? Yeah.

437
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:59,850
So the question is of your name, here are this.

438
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:10,020
Why why is this so challenging to get get measures validated in diverse populations since it's so important because it's cheap to just,

439
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:22,799
you know, but but realistically, the process of doing a formal peer review, validation and test of reliability is kind of expensive, right?

440
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:30,690
Because you have to make sure you have the sample size. So you need to have the statistically speaking,

441
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:37,229
you need to have enough power in your sample size to be able to run the different tests that

442
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:44,580
you need to run on the measure or the data from the measure to be able to validate it.

443
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:49,060
And then be honest with you, a lot of these things, when they were, you know,

444
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:52,740
scales, when they were developed, this was not something that we were attentive to.

445
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:59,759
So we just figure, oh, well, you know, the college students, if it if it makes sense for the college students,

446
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:05,550
there was no thoughtfulness about how would this reflect to other populations.

447
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:12,209
So, again, you're thinking about research. You know, you know, you're thinking about, you know, hegemonic ideals.

448
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:17,850
You know, what's normative and who defines that. So the idea was, well.

449
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:23,030
The standard we're reaching, too, is what the college students say.

450
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:26,480
So we're just getting to their point.

451
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:31,870
Where we realize that that's not a good idea. That's not a good assumption.

452
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:41,520
So for the next hour, for the last 20 minutes, we'll talk about reliability.

453
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:54,870
So in addition to construct validity, when we are looking at measures, we want to also have an understanding of the measures, reliability.

454
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,830
Reliability is the extent to which a measure is consistent.

455
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:08,030
So validity is giving you confidence that it's measuring what it's supposed to measure,

456
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:12,710
and reliability tells you that it's measuring something consistent.

457
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,780
I won't say I'll say that point for later.

458
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:27,520
So essentially the question we're asking is, does the measurement tool measure the same thing every time it's used?

459
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:33,990
We'll talk about three. I realize they're measurement valid or reliability.

460
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:38,570
Was on your slide when I posted it. Excuse me.

461
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:42,290
You can just delete that. So we'll talk about three.

462
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:49,540
Today in Iran, the reliability test retest reliability and internal consistency.

463
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:55,680
Reliability. So test retest reliability.

464
01:01:56,220 --> 01:02:04,020
That is referring to the consistency of a measure when the same individual is tested at two or more points in time.

465
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:14,100
So for example, if an IQ test is technically supposed to have high test retest reliability.

466
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:23,610
So regardless if you take the or the IQ test is administered on October 17 of 2020.

467
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:28,730
Or to October 19th, 2022.

468
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:43,070
It is meant to be reliable across time and so if it has high test retest reliability, you will get the same score on both of those dates.

469
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:55,330
So this is you want to keep this in mind when you expect that the outcome or the measure would be consistent or static.

470
01:02:55,660 --> 01:03:04,590
So for example. IQ tests technically or maybe a level of.

471
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:11,800
Introversion versus extroversion. That's.

472
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:20,890
Typically that's supposed to change across time, but there are things where you don't want a high.

473
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:25,600
You wouldn't expect to see a high test retest reliability.

474
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:34,990
So, for example, if you have a sleepiness measure, you know, research suggests that that can change.

475
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:42,310
And that's a pretty variable. You know, you can be sleepy or more sleepy during the winter versus the summer.

476
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:48,030
So you wouldn't expect that to actually have a high test retest reliability.

477
01:03:53,400 --> 01:04:01,680
Second one is integrator reliability. And that's the consistency of a measure when two or more raters are measuring the same thing.

478
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:13,710
In this case, we have a test for blood pressure, regardless if rater one or rater two takes your blood pressure.

479
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:21,840
The process should garner the same result in this case as 117 over 76.

480
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:28,330
This also applies to analysis.

481
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:35,380
So this is used a lot in qualitative research analysis or qualitative data analysis.

482
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:45,640
Because when you're analyzing and identifying things in the data or you start using codes,

483
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:52,030
you want to know that there's consistency in what's being labeled what in the qualitative data.

484
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:57,340
So again, these are not exclusive to quantitative.

485
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:08,070
They're also applied to qualitative as well. And then finally, finally, internal consistency, reliability.

486
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:14,370
And this is the consistency of a person's responses across all items on the multiple item measure.

487
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:20,460
So this is what I was talking about with if you're changing the wording of a question.

488
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:25,650
So if you, for example, are measuring.

489
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:37,380
It's like a sub construct of depression, you know, engagement and behaviors that you get used to.

490
01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:43,110
And you have different measures of that or different questions related to that,

491
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:53,580
or you have a measure related to self-esteem and you have different questions that are asking about self-esteem.

492
01:05:53,970 --> 01:06:00,170
You should expect that. Those questions are going to be.

493
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:03,920
The responses to those questions are going to be consistent across the board.

494
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:09,780
And if they are, then that's a cause for concern.

495
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:19,530
So the core value that you see actually with an array, the reliability as well is Chromebox Alpha.

496
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:27,320
And generally you want to see a score on the Chromebox 0.7 or above.

497
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:36,150
That's. Preferred yes or no.

498
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:42,500
Does it matter whether the. Lack of consistency is because of the reader.

499
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:51,850
It. It does matter. So the question was whether the reliability doesn't matter.

500
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:58,120
The consistency is at the rater level or the measure rated or measure level.

501
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:03,820
Yes, it does. So you might just have say, for example, let's take the coding example again.

502
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:07,690
You might just have somebody who is just totally.

503
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:15,100
Of the wall. You know, in terms of what they're defining the coattails.

504
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:20,320
So that shows you that it's not the issue of the measurement.

505
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:31,490
It's the issue of the rater. So the way you would counter that is to have somebody else step in to see if it is the tool or the person.

506
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:38,700
Imagining where someone makes the perfect house, period.

507
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:46,140
So like three oh so like if even the subject of the the, the measurement.

508
01:07:53,190 --> 01:07:58,030
It. It shouldn't like. But.

509
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:05,170
Like in the case of blood pressure. You know, that's a little different.

510
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:10,060
But for like questions, it shouldn't really make that much of a difference.

511
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:14,950
It should at least capture a similar it doesn't have to be exact, but it should at least be similar.

512
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:22,150
Right? So maybe rate or two, even though, you know, you know, oh boy.

513
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:26,080
Comes in the second day and works for Rader, too.

514
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:32,920
And today he's flustered because he really likes Rader, too. It should always be similar if the methods are the same, but.

515
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:36,350
But that's important to keep in mind, right?

516
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:47,310
Because if the the measure itself can vary that much based on like conditions outside of them, you should think about that and keep that in mind.

517
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:51,090
Right. Because you want to try and control.

518
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:56,130
Control everything else so that it can be as consistent as possible.

519
01:08:56,190 --> 01:08:59,339
That's a good question. All questions are good.

520
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:02,930
And I'm sorry, I should say all questions are good. They are.

521
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:14,000
Any other questions? All right.

522
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:18,020
So what does it mean to put those together?

523
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:22,700
Right. So construct validity and reliability.

524
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:28,030
Themselves are, too. You know, it's important to realize there are two different.

525
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:32,770
Concepts so you can have something.

526
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:40,720
This bullseye metaphor is a common one to talk about the difference between reliability and construct validity.

527
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:55,630
So think of validity as that. That orange are.

528
01:09:57,490 --> 01:10:07,480
You can have something that's reliable but not valid. So if you know this here on this first example, it's consistently giving the wrong target.

529
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:14,020
But it's reliable. So you can have something that's reliable but just straight up wrong.

530
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:20,900
In this case, the second one, it's not reliable or valid.

531
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:24,470
So the answers are the hits, if you will.

532
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:30,890
All over the. I have no idea what you call this thing all over.

533
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,490
And they're not hitting the target, which is the bullseye.

534
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:41,970
If something is reliable and valid, it's not only being consistent, but it's consistent.

535
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:46,490
But it's. Hitting the right place, the bull's eye.

536
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:53,240
So ideally what you want is something that has high construct validity and high reliability.

537
01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:04,770
So how do we maximize the reliability of our measures?

538
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:09,180
One, we standardize measurement protocols.

539
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:18,570
So, you know, we talked about, you know, it should be used with the same process and it should be applied the same.

540
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:29,920
Just a side note that there are cases where you're not necessarily aiming for higher standardization.

541
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:37,870
Semi-Structured interview protocols are an example, but by the nature of their design, they're meant to be a bit variable.

542
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,870
That's why they're considered semi-structured,

543
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:51,880
because they allow for like moving through different questions in a different order based on the the path of conversation with the respondent.

544
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:58,200
So that's kind of an exception to this idea of standardizing measurement protocols.

545
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:06,330
But at the very least, you want to make sure that at the start they are consistent and standardize even a standardized,

546
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:10,410
even even the semi-structured interview protocol.

547
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:19,460
When you're using questionnaires of some kind, you want to make sure that you're using multi item scales with high internal consistency.

548
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:31,010
Again, you're doing that because you want to make sure that your question itself is not only measuring one dimension of a construct.

549
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:36,380
So you want to be able to have it so that it's measuring multiple dimensions.

550
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:45,380
And those dimensions or those questions that they're answering are actually have or core are correlating.

551
01:12:46,990 --> 01:12:54,879
Regularly calibrate equipment. So, for example, with blood pressure equipment, you want to make sure that when it's calibrated.

552
01:12:54,880 --> 01:13:05,230
So it's always when it says 117 over 776, it is an objective measure of 117 over 76.

553
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:11,360
And it's the same every time and then train and retrain data collectors.

554
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:16,160
It's helpful. And again, this is where, you know, you think about cost and resources.

555
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:17,149
First,

556
01:13:17,150 --> 01:13:25,940
you have to train your data collectors so that they especially if they're administering a survey that they're doing at the same across the board.

557
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:31,280
But we also know that as people are engaging in this work.

558
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:35,240
If you've ever been a research assistant or done, you know,

559
01:13:35,330 --> 01:13:41,659
data collection or administering a survey of some kind, you kind of get into your own little habits,

560
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:51,500
all of the quirks and rhythms you want to make sure that that doesn't give it as a a PR or, you know, the person who is supervising the work.

561
01:13:51,950 --> 01:14:00,300
You want to make sure that that actually is not interfering with the consistency across the board of the data collection collector.

562
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:05,840
So you have to continually train and retrain and make sure that people are being consistent

563
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:10,130
and they're not getting too caught up in their little quirks or little rhythms.

564
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:27,310
So in summary. What quantitative research we're talking about, numerical data that's analyzed using mathematically based methods.

565
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:34,240
We have two different types of ways to collect that data assessment slash test or surveys

566
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:41,860
you want when you are picking a measure to make sure that it has construct validity.

567
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:45,580
So that's measuring the construct that it's intended to.

568
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:54,010
And then you want to make sure that you check on reliability, which is the extent to which a measure is consistent.

569
01:14:57,290 --> 01:15:01,970
And again, that applies both to quantitative tools as well as qualitative tools.

570
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:09,870
All right. Any questions? All right.

571
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:15,719
So just a reminder today, I'm going to cut off this hour short today.

572
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:20,130
So I will probably stay here until 1145.

573
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:25,320
I'm just going to stay here for today since class doesn't start till noon, then here.

574
01:15:26,190 --> 01:15:31,470
But then I'm leaving 15 minutes early. But as always, if you have questions, feel free to reach out to me.

575
01:15:31,950 --> 01:15:35,130
I'm also happy to meet over Zoom.

576
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:43,040
If that or in person. I'm happy to come to this wonderful place of an arbor and have some coffee.

577
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:54,260
There's all kinds of places for coffee, so if you need that, just let me know or let Hannah know.

578
01:15:54,770 --> 01:16:00,510
Otherwise, I. We'll see you on Thursday where we talk about probability sampling.

579
01:16:00,530 --> 01:17:06,940
It's so exciting. Yeah.

580
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:28,600
Oh. Black.

581
01:17:44,320 --> 01:18:10,690
Done some of that. Right.

582
01:18:54,380 --> 01:19:03,540
All. Are you getting any of that?

583
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:09,870
No. I'm not responding to emails. But.

584
01:19:12,650 --> 01:19:24,590
Now there's always emails. You know, I worked through some work in my office all the time.

585
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:31,640
I'm so used to it. On some of the topics that we would cover.

586
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:40,170
Yeah. I'm sure that we get along. Something like this.

587
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:48,160
Is there for. These are for the light therapy or the like.

588
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:52,090
This was pretty. Actually, this is very relaxing.

589
01:19:57,830 --> 01:19:58,190
I'm fine.
