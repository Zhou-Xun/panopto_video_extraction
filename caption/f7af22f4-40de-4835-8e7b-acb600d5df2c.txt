1
00:00:09,892 --> 00:00:13,510
In this module, we'll be talking
about the exposure disease model,

2
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,577
which turns out to be a really useful
organizing framework for looking at EHS.

3
00:00:17,577 --> 00:00:20,599
So by now you've had a chance to
answer the questions that we've had

4
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:24,377
in the class and hopefully you've thought
well, how does this relate to my health?

5
00:00:24,377 --> 00:00:26,956
These questions all seem pretty unrelated.

6
00:00:26,956 --> 00:00:29,112
Well, I want to run back
through the questions now and

7
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:32,101
by the end of this lecture, you're
going to see how these things relate and

8
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:35,390
how they're all actually intimately
tied to Environmental Health Sciences.

9
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,688
So let's run through the questions and
I'll give you my responses to them.

10
00:00:39,688 --> 00:00:44,440
Question one was named a chemical,
biological, and physical stressor.

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,730
So there are an endless number
of chemical, biological, and

12
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,700
physical stressors.

13
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,280
What I've provided you here
is basically a small sampling

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,210
just of some examples that may
be familiar from daily life.

15
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,300
So when we think about
a biological stressor,

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,024
this is an organism that can harm you.

17
00:01:00,024 --> 00:01:04,840
It could be a pathogen, like tuberculosis
or the zika or influenza viruses or

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,113
salmonella that you might
have in your food at home.

19
00:01:08,113 --> 00:01:11,308
It could also be an animal that
could bite or trample you.

20
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:14,858
In terms of chemical stressors or
hazards, think about your home.

21
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:18,506
You have cleaning products made
of many many different chemicals.

22
00:01:18,506 --> 00:01:24,012
Maybe you're breathing cigarette smoke,
either secondarily or as a smoker.

23
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:28,147
Of course, lead in drinking water is
an issue for far too many people.

24
00:01:28,147 --> 00:01:31,571
You could be exposed to chemicals
like bisphenol-a because

25
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:34,199
of the plastics present
in your environment.

26
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:38,654
And all of us are very much exposed
to carbon monoxide as a result of

27
00:01:38,654 --> 00:01:41,660
combustion engines in the vehicles we use.

28
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,340
Physical stressors are energy, basically,
that's imparted into or onto your body.

29
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,314
This would include things like
ultraviolet radiation from the sun,

30
00:01:50,314 --> 00:01:54,427
musculoskeletal or ergonomic issues,
noise exposure, vibration,

31
00:01:54,427 --> 00:01:56,837
even the radiation from your cell phone.

32
00:01:56,837 --> 00:02:01,166
So again, all of these different types of
stressors are things that we worry about

33
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,619
in environmental health.

34
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:05,968
So now we come to question two,
which was broken into two parts.

35
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:09,993
2a, how many chemicals
are there in US Commerce?

36
00:02:09,993 --> 00:02:13,633
A 2b, of the 3,000 high
production volume chemicals,

37
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,590
what percent have basic
health risk information?

38
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,590
So let's talk about 2a first,
the number of chemicals in US Commerce.

39
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,960
I'm giving you a number here and

40
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,840
I'm going to expect you to
remember this number but

41
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,900
I also want you to understand that
this number is almost certainly wrong.

42
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,790
We actually don't know exactly how many
chemicals there are in US Commerce.

43
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,804
This is about the best guess out there.

44
00:02:34,804 --> 00:02:37,410
But the fact that we don't know
how many chemicals are out

45
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,181
there in the first place should
make you scratch your chin and

46
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:43,351
say well, how can we possibly know
much about their health impacts?

47
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:48,108
Question 2b, of these high production
volume chemicals what percentage have

48
00:02:48,108 --> 00:02:50,190
basic risk information?

49
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,646
It turns out in the United States, there's
about 3,000 chemicals that we produce or

50
00:02:54,646 --> 00:02:56,826
import more than a million
pounds of a year.

51
00:02:56,826 --> 00:02:59,524
So this is a lot of each
of those chemicals you'd

52
00:02:59,524 --> 00:03:02,091
assume we'd have information about these.

53
00:03:02,091 --> 00:03:06,617
Now internationally, experts agree that
there are six basic tests that we need to

54
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:08,662
understand how toxic a chemical is.

55
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:12,100
We call this the screening
information data set.

56
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,750
So these six things are, number one,

57
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,990
acute toxicity, is this thing
going to make me sick right now?

58
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:22,210
Number two chronic toxicity,
is this going to make me sick over time?

59
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,966
Number three, developmental and
reproductive toxicity,

60
00:03:25,966 --> 00:03:30,981
is this going to impact my ability to have
children or impact my children directly?

61
00:03:30,981 --> 00:03:32,925
Number four, mutagenicity,

62
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:36,519
is this chemical capable of
causing genetic mutations?

63
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:38,232
Number five, ecotoxicity,

64
00:03:38,232 --> 00:03:41,938
is this chemical harmful to
the general environment around us?

65
00:03:41,938 --> 00:03:43,697
And number six, environmental fate,

66
00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:47,230
what actually happens to this chemical
when it gets out into the environment?

67
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,620
Does it go away immediately or
is it going to stick around?

68
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,684
Now most of us assume that
this testing is done and

69
00:03:53,684 --> 00:03:56,317
that all chemicals in commerce are safe.

70
00:03:56,317 --> 00:04:01,293
Unfortunately, the data indicate
that about 93% of these 3,000

71
00:04:01,293 --> 00:04:06,600
chemicals that we make the most of are
missing one or more of these basic tests.

72
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,860
And 43% of these high production volume
chemicals are missing all of these tests.

73
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,908
We don't know anything about their
human or environmental health risk.

74
00:04:15,908 --> 00:04:19,936
So that should get you thinking about all
the thousands of chemicals you're exposed

75
00:04:19,936 --> 00:04:24,110
to on a daily basis and how they may or
may not be harmful to you.

76
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,192
Question 3, globally water bodies
that serve how many billion

77
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:32,963
people are polluted by chemical,
biological, and physical stressors?

78
00:04:32,963 --> 00:04:36,528
So I'm going to show you a map here and
give you a very surprising number.

79
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:41,227
Out of the seven and a half billion
people on Earth, about 5 billion of them,

80
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:44,914
or two in three, are served by
water bodies that are polluted

81
00:04:44,914 --> 00:04:47,327
with some of those types of stressors.

82
00:04:47,327 --> 00:04:52,208
So on the map on the right, you can see
there's color coding by country and

83
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:52,850
by area.

84
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,409
Blue in this map indicates areas that
have a low water security threat and

85
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:01,085
yellow and red are areas with
high water security threat.

86
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:03,822
So you can see some good news on this map.

87
00:05:03,822 --> 00:05:07,259
Canada, Alaska, Russia, parts of Brazil,

88
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,769
parts of Australia all have
very low water security threat.

89
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:17,263
But if you look, most of Europe,
South Asia, China, parts of South America,

90
00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:22,603
and sub-Saharan Africa are all very
much under high water security threat.

91
00:05:22,603 --> 00:05:26,845
Even here in United States where we're
fortunate enough to be able to turn on

92
00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:28,852
a tap and get clean drinking water.

93
00:05:28,852 --> 00:05:32,343
You can see a bright red stripe
down the middle of the country.

94
00:05:32,343 --> 00:05:34,811
You may think that's
the Mississippi River.

95
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:37,400
In fact, it's something
called the Ogallala Aquifer.

96
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,210
This is an underground body of water
that actually has driven much of our

97
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,271
agricultural productivity for
the past hundred years.

98
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:48,425
The problem is, we've been taking
water out faster than it recharges and

99
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:50,168
polluting that water as well.

100
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:54,394
Which places an otherwise highly
productive region that we depend on for

101
00:05:54,394 --> 00:05:56,550
food under a very high water stress.

102
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,508
And the same story has played
out elsewhere in the world.

103
00:05:59,508 --> 00:06:04,543
So question 4, how many Americans
live in areas that exceed

104
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:09,197
the National Ambient Air
Quality Standards, o NAAQS?

105
00:06:09,197 --> 00:06:11,497
The answer here again may
be surprising to you.

106
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:15,683
It turns out, about 127 million Americans,
or more than one in three,

107
00:06:15,683 --> 00:06:19,602
live in areas where the air pollution
levels are above what the federal

108
00:06:19,602 --> 00:06:23,203
government believes to be safe and
healthy for the population.

109
00:06:23,203 --> 00:06:25,315
Now in environmental health,
we focus on well,

110
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:27,830
where is that is that
pollution coming from?

111
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,990
So in the graphic here, you can see
we've got lots of different sources.

112
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,347
Nature creates air pollution,
volcanoes and

113
00:06:33,347 --> 00:06:37,360
wildfires can put out tremendously
high levels of air pollution.

114
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,000
Unfortunately, so can stationary human
sources like industrial power plants or

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,490
incinerators.

116
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,140
We can have areas like cities and

117
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,600
agricultural regions that produce
pollution over a very wide scale.

118
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,535
And we have mobile sources as well,
cars, buses,

119
00:06:53,535 --> 00:06:57,770
trains, planes that also
produce air pollution.

120
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,810
Now the air pollution
problem is bad enough and

121
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,390
it's been with us long enough that
we've actually developed ways to

122
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:07,030
inform the public in real time about
what the air pollution levels are.

123
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,890
So the weather app that you check on
your phone probably has an air quality

124
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,790
index built in.

125
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,940
We like to see people with good air
quality, the green region on this chart.

126
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,670
Unfortunately, we often see people
down in the moderate or unhealthy for

127
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,170
sensitive groups.

128
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,827
Unhealthy, very unhealthy, and

129
00:07:23,827 --> 00:07:27,150
hazardous levels certainly do happen
in parts of the United States.

130
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:31,960
They're even more common around the globe,
particularly in megacities.

131
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,090
So coming to question 5 now, how many
liters of air do you inhale per day?

132
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,190
I won't go through the math, but

133
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:43,050
it turns out the typical person breathes
about 11,000 liters of air per day.

134
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:43,950
Why do I mention that?

135
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,780
Well, that's 11,000 liters of
contaminated air coming into your lungs.

136
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,930
So now we have potential exposure issue.

137
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,590
And it's not just that you're
exposed via your lungs.

138
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:57,540
We also have food that you eat,
about 2 kilograms per day.

139
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,230
And the water you drink,
about 2 liters per day.

140
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,838
So all of these things
are potential ways for

141
00:08:02,838 --> 00:08:06,090
you to come into contact
with environmental hazards.

142
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,072
Question 6,
what percent of global death and

143
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,150
disease is due to environmental hazards?

144
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:16,220
So the answer here is about
25% of all disease around

145
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,015
the globe is due to factors in
the environment that we can modify.

146
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:23,030
If we zoom in and look just at children,
it's more like 33%.

147
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:27,780
A lot of this is due to the fact that
about a billion people on this planet lack

148
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,500
safe water and about two and

149
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:35,160
a half billion people lack sanitary
ways to get rid of their waste.

150
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,760
So we've actually just walked right
through the exposure disease model.

151
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,123
I'm going to highlight
the components to you now.

152
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:44,642
So questions 1 and
3 were focused on the source of a hazard,

153
00:08:44,642 --> 00:08:48,167
where does an environmental
health hazard originate from.

154
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:53,173
Question 3 was talking about the movement
of pollutants throughout our environment.

155
00:08:53,173 --> 00:08:55,628
Question 4 talks about human exposure,

156
00:08:55,628 --> 00:08:58,719
basically coming into
contact with these hazards.

157
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:03,705
Question 5 refers to dose, that's
basically how much of a nasty chemical or

158
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:07,017
biological or
physical agent gets into your body.

159
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:13,515
And question 6 is adverse health
effects resulting from these exposures.
