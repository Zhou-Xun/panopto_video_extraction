1
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:21,409
So I split the reading a little bit late, so I gave you a little bit more time to turn that.

2
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:35,120
And so the person that's helping me set up can decide right across the perusal settings, change the settings.

3
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:41,510
So I have to learn how to host approval ratings with the new settings, and I want to put a whole bunch of them up there.

4
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:46,760
And I didn't get a chance to do that yet, so I gave you an extra day for this particular assignment.

5
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,830
It's kind of dated. The paper was published in 2015.

6
00:00:52,460 --> 00:01:02,300
However, the trends are pretty much the same for 2015 to 2018, in which the data was collected and mentioned.

7
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,530
I would expect to see some big changes and this kind of information race,

8
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:17,750
ethnicity and metabolic health in the city during the what happened during the COVID pandemic.

9
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,430
And I've been looking around to see what's going on there.

10
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,470
There have been a lot of review papers suggesting what might happen, and there's been some anecdotal evidence that these changes occurred.

11
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,410
But I'm waiting for the big names report to come out, showing us what really happened.

12
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:43,590
So with that in mind, I'm going to go over the learning objectives.

13
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:53,250
So to understand potential mechanisms that lead to racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities and the prevalence of obesity.

14
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,270
And these are potential mechanisms. There's a lot of supposition in this regard.

15
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:07,010
So some of this was discussed and described in the paper and some of it was wasn't.

16
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:17,940
And also, this is an opportunity to introduce the topic of whether so you should be able to

17
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,590
describe whether it is a meeting of early self-determination among black individuals.

18
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,130
And how many of you have heard about weathering before?

19
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,730
Just one person, a couple of people. This is an important concept.

20
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:45,300
It comes from a paper that was published in 2006 by Harlan, who is a faculty on the faculty here in health, behavioral health, education.

21
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:53,080
And it was a groundbreaking paper published in 2006, but not everyone is aware of it, apparently.

22
00:02:53,100 --> 00:03:04,620
So it's an important thing to discuss, to describe issues regarding to living at us and a racist aside what impact it could have on one's health.

23
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:15,330
Okay. So the very first slide to have from you, for you here is the race, that race and ethnic disparities in BMI.

24
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,850
And I'm looking for updated data for this and haven't found it yet.

25
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,690
But this is what I got from the last enhanced report that came out.

26
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,040
So the overall prevalence is about 42%.

27
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:35,280
And it breaks this graph, breaks it down on race and ethnicity.

28
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:43,020
So you have in the very dark blue bars, non-Hispanic white, in the light blue bars right next to that non-Hispanic black.

29
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:54,090
The three bars that the brighter green is non-Hispanic Asian and the lighter green is represents the Hispanic population in the United States.

30
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,860
Now, this is how the Centers for Disease Control describes race and ethnicity.

31
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,900
And there's a need for disaggregation. I have on the next slide, but this is what we've got.

32
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:17,130
So in terms of the greater rate of prevalence of obesity, broken down by ethnicity and by sex for men and women,

33
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:26,040
we see that there's a higher prevalence of obesity in white men and Hispanic men,

34
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,330
and the lowest prevalence of obesity in men is with non-Hispanic Asian men.

35
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:43,080
And then when we look at women, the higher prevalence of obesity is among non-Hispanic black women, followed by Hispanic women.

36
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,330
And the lowest category here would be Asian.

37
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,420
Now. So what do we disaggregate?

38
00:04:53,250 --> 00:05:03,630
The Asian and Hispanic groups and again, this is the CDC's description, our definitions for these different ethnic groups, this is what we find.

39
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:12,720
So remember the cutoffs for Asians honest and used by many epidemiologists 23 for overweight, 25 for obese.

40
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,330
And they break it down to different groups.

41
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:24,810
We have the average BMI people. Chinese ancestry in the United States is 24.9.

42
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,560
And the paper didn't break it down for you any further in terms of men and women and so on.

43
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:39,180
There were some mention of children for Asian Indians, the BMI, the average BMI is 25.8.

44
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,220
And for Filipinos, BMI was a bit higher, 27.3.

45
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,710
Break this down and look at how Hispanics get passed groups.

46
00:05:51,540 --> 00:06:02,879
You see that people with Cuban ancestry, 29.5, Puerto Ricans 30.6, and people of Mexican ancestry, it's a bit higher.

47
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,950
It's the highest. It's about 31.1. So this is some disaggregation of this information.

48
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,240
Hopefully in the future we'll see more data like this that's more commonly presented so that we can

49
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:22,710
get an understanding of the prevalence of weight categories within different ethnic populations.

50
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:30,660
And so this is what we've got to take into the next question that I'm going to address.

51
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,989
Is this so a question of socioeconomic status? So it's socioeconomic status.

52
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:47,980
The general over. All trend is that people who have a or in the lower socioeconomic groups, they have a higher prevalence of obesity.

53
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,780
And the paper addresses some reasons for this.

54
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:59,290
But let's look at the overall trends first. So in this graph,

55
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:06,220
they're looking at the percentage of people who have obesity and they're looking at

56
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:12,220
the different categories here based on the percent of the federal poverty level.

57
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:23,740
So this would be an income that represents these different groups over a period of time from 1990 9002 to 2014, 2011, 2014.

58
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:32,830
I looked, but I couldn't find more up to date information on this that was presented really nicely in this way.

59
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:42,550
So let's look at the trends. So the dark blue line represents those individuals who are living in households.

60
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:55,660
So we have men and women who are living in households where their total household income is equal to or less than 130% of the federal poverty level.

61
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:04,270
And then the dashed the heavy dashed lines are the middle group, 130 to 350%.

62
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:11,370
And then finally, you have that the smaller dashes are dotted through a dotted line here.

63
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:15,790
This represents a 350% above the federal poverty level.

64
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:25,030
And so for women, as I said, people with lower incomes have a tendency to have higher body mass is higher prevalence of obesity.

65
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,420
This seems to be true among women.

66
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:39,580
So women with a higher incomes have lower the lives of women, too, who are in households that have this middle income group of middle,

67
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:48,160
and then those who have the 101 hundred husband are equal to 130% of their poverty level,

68
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,300
have the higher highest level of or higher prevalence of obesity.

69
00:08:54,070 --> 00:09:02,200
And then with men, it's a different story. So when you look over here, the relationship is a bit different.

70
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:09,340
So all of these trends are going up and there are some significant trends, as mentioned down here in terms of increases over the years.

71
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,849
They all seem to be going up slightly with men.

72
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:22,600
It's a little bit different. So the highest group here now, it's this heavy dash line representing those who are at the middle,

73
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:31,600
33%, followed by those who are had the highest income.

74
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:40,600
And then the dotted line here and then the lowest group in terms of prevalence is those in the lower income group.

75
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:46,690
And so this is interesting. It's it's very different than what we see for for women.

76
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,190
And then in terms of trends over time, as far as what's increasing,

77
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:59,890
there's there seems to be a modest increase over time, some of which is significant, some it's not.

78
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,460
But this is what we have from data collected during this period of time.

79
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:18,170
So the next. Yeah. Kitty, I'm just wondering. So, like, do you happen to know if.

80
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,450
Because here they kind of they categorize.

81
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:26,060
They turned this into a categorical variable, but it would be very simple to use it as a continuous variable.

82
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:32,210
And it seems almost like in men, if it were used as a continuous variable, there wouldn't be any significant difference.

83
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:39,920
Possibly, possibly through the separation is more visible and clearer with women, but not with men.

84
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,800
And for reasons that I don't quite understand, you're right.

85
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,950
If you, if you used, uh, you made this calculation somewhat differently,

86
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,210
you might not see very much of a separation at all in these particular groups.

87
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,360
So the next slide looks at education.

88
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:09,030
And it addresses the issue. Well, perhaps it's a it's a knowledge issue.

89
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:17,280
People are consuming foods and are consuming foods at a level or the amount of foods that is leading to

90
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:23,670
this weight gain in which people are coming up with higher BMI rise as a consequence of their education.

91
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:29,670
And within this is probably socioeconomic status as well.

92
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:38,100
So people who have greater socioeconomic status have a there are more people within that group who have college education.

93
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,750
So with that in mind, let's look at the data.

94
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,090
So here's the percentage for people with obesity. Men and women again.

95
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:54,749
And the trends that you might expect to find in women are all about here.

96
00:11:54,750 --> 00:12:02,690
They followed that. The ones with the highest just high school education have a higher prevalence, followed by those with some college education.

97
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:10,380
And then lastly, in the lowest prevalence categories is women with a college education.

98
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:23,249
Okay. Then the trends are a little bit different being that men with a college education now have the lowest prevalence of obesity,

99
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,450
followed by those who just have a high school education.

100
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:33,849
And then there's this Nobody seems to have the highest prevalence of obesity.

101
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:40,170
This is some college this could be maybe an associate's degree or these individuals didn't finish college.

102
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:52,760
And in all cases, there's a significant linear trend in all groups except men who have who are college graduates in terms of that increase.

103
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:02,070
Yeah. Are they in Charleston, for instance? The property.

104
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,010
So, yes, that would be built into.

105
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:13,630
So the federal policy line would change from year to year based on based on dollar incomes changing from year to year.

106
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:24,490
And then I'll say this again. It'll be really interesting to see what changes occur during the pandemic when that data comes out.

107
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:30,550
I'm looking for it every day, and I haven't seen very much in terms of an enhanced large population study.

108
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,370
What about children? Well, children follow a more predictable trend.

109
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,840
And this is just everybody thrown together in this particular diagram.

110
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,120
We have child and adolescent obesity rates generally decrease with increase in family income.

111
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:56,649
And in this this particular graph, they're using 100 as their baseline here,

112
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:09,910
4% poverty thresholds or 100% or less followed by this 100% jumps, 99, 203, 99, and so on.

113
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:21,010
And as you see, as you get past this threshold, one, 100, 299% of the poverty threshold, the prevalence drops.

114
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:28,440
Okay. So why?

115
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,790
Why is that? Why do we see differences in race, ethnicity?

116
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:39,750
Why do we see differences in household income and education in regard to the prevalence of obesity?

117
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:46,530
Well, the paper that you've read throughout a bunch of ideas as to why that strongly explained,

118
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:53,420
some of which seem to be true and some of which are positive.

119
00:14:54,370 --> 00:15:05,910
But you really don't know. The first of which is the differences in perhaps in diet, physical activity.

120
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,560
So let's look at physical activity to start out.

121
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:26,100
So in this particular review, they cite a paper that looked at leisure time, leisure time physical activity between 1988 2010 adults.

122
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:33,299
Now, this is a while ago and getting this type of information from a large database like this,

123
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,379
getting a publication on it is you'll find a few papers here and there.

124
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:47,670
But this is the one they cited. And in this particular paper, there was a decline in leisure time physical activity.

125
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,030
I've looked at other papers and they said, well, maybe, you know,

126
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:58,170
if anything at a later time points after 2000, and perhaps it hasn't changed that much.

127
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:03,120
But anyway, for this particular time frame, there was a decline in leisure time activity.

128
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:11,419
And also with this, within this time period, within the sample population that they looked at,

129
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,570
there didn't seem to be a significant change in caloric intake.

130
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,890
So these two points here come from that particular study, one particular study,

131
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:33,440
and there are some interesting differences that weren't accounted for in this particular paper that's mentioned in the review that you read,

132
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,510
and that had to do with snacking.

133
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:43,450
So this would be meals that are consumed outside of your regular breakfast, lunch and dinner that would be considered snacking.

134
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:47,060
During this time period, there was an increase in snacking.

135
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,139
So I'm going to ask a couple of questions about this.

136
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:58,040
So why would you think there might be a decline in leisure time activity during this particular period of time?

137
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:10,070
Leisure time activity means that you are setting aside time outside of your regular schedule to exercise just for the purposes of exercise.

138
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:19,340
Yeah. Hitting different societal expectations or work hours is very stringent.

139
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:24,170
Yeah. So what happened between 1988, 2010 in terms of our work habits?

140
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:31,889
Constantly. Yeah. So we went from a regular schedule right in the office.

141
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:38,120
So you go to wherever you need to work and you work. And then we had this thing called email that was introduced during this time

142
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,400
period where you have constant contact with not only friends but employers,

143
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,320
and there's this explicit or implicit expectation that you're going to answer the emails and do something to respond to those.

144
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,040
So you're always on the job, or you could potentially be always on the job.

145
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:03,140
So that would mean that you're working more and there's less time, time activity.

146
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,310
So that's one hypothesis. What else? What else changed during this time?

147
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:15,320
Somebody besides getting also technology?

148
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,910
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Technology with greater accuracy. I think that recently people have started to get more jobs.

149
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:28,220
They're further away from their homes. So like living like 40 or an hour away from the city, commuting for work.

150
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,950
Yeah, commuting time is a very big point.

151
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:43,010
So when I had my first job, my wife was going to live in Connecticut, my wife is going to college, and then she decided against it.

152
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,640
But for one year I commuted 55 miles each way.

153
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,520
And that's like that was a that was a big chunk of time, especially in the wintertime when there's snow on the roads.

154
00:18:54,300 --> 00:19:01,350
So and a lot of people did that. A lot of people commuted not 55 miles, but a lot of a long distance to get to work.

155
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:07,950
What else? It's all sitting in front of you, Kimmy, but also be like the recession or the need to, like, work multiple jobs.

156
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:12,809
So then you have less time for other things that happened too.

157
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:20,010
So people needed to work more jobs because we had this final system where employers would hire more people.

158
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:26,370
Instead of giving fewer people 40 hours a week, they'd hire more people and gave them less hours.

159
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,880
So people had to work more jobs in order to get the same pay.

160
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,830
And as a consequence, they had less time to spend on leisure time activities.

161
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,560
You had to use of screens?

162
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:44,280
Yes. So if people go to work, spend the day on computers and then come home to watch TV.

163
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,040
Yes. Now we have our cell phones. Yes. More time and more screen time.

164
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:55,380
Yes. That was a big change during this time as well. So and what were your experiences like?

165
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:07,120
I realize that many of you weren't alive in 1988, but what were your experiences with changes in technology in terms of your devices?

166
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:15,590
Big, big changes. So yeah, everybody has a smartphone nowadays.

167
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:23,640
Um, and you can access all this information where you had to use a laptop or desktop computer on your phone.

168
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,580
They've gotten to be a lot more user friendly, and that's contributed to this trend as well.

169
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,320
So the big changes occurred during this time and might explain this difference.

170
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,130
Okay. So I've got the energy balance equation,

171
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:49,879
positive energy balance as a consequence of greater food intake and less physical activity or same food intake and decreased physical activity.

172
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,930
Perhaps that's part of what we're seeing here. Okay.

173
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:59,220
So in terms of differences in physical activity,

174
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:07,380
the paper talked about two types of physical activity with regard to different

175
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:14,790
different preferences or affordability of different leisure time activities.

176
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:22,230
So it made it draw the conclusion that blacks, Mexican-Americans,

177
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:30,960
were more likely to be engaged in physical activity involving team sports and that white individuals were at war,

178
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:39,450
would spend more time and facility based exercise, leisure time activity.

179
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:44,220
And certainly income has something to do with this.

180
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:50,190
So if you have more income, you can go to a club and go to a gym and exercise there.

181
00:21:51,510 --> 00:22:00,720
And then this this wasn't in the paper I cut and pasted this into the figure and it looks at this is now a percentage of sports participation.

182
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:06,899
This is among adolescents and it breaks it down, African-American, Hispanic and white.

183
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:16,260
And you can see the differences here in regard to higher percentage of African-Americans,

184
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,590
adolescents in basketball, football, and then it breaks down some of the other sports as well.

185
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:32,340
So this is an idea that's been thrown at participation increases with family income, but not for basketball.

186
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:44,310
And then some of you wrote in the perusal, well, you know, some of these basketball courts are more accessible to people in different parts of a

187
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:50,219
neighborhood in which there's a higher population of black children or children of other type,

188
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,240
other ethnicities. And this is probably why this would it be explained.

189
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:01,800
So these are generalizations. Now, this is somebody looking at this massive data set and drawing these conclusions.

190
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,190
What do you think could be differences in physical activity?

191
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:12,460
Yeah, I think it's a lot of it's cultural because it's harmful and you can't even explain it.

192
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,420
So it also depends like other people to play with like sports that people are there for games.

193
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:25,219
It's greater if there's greater social engagement and group activities in other countries.

194
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:35,480
So you're saying maybe like specific sports in specific cultures are reservation people and then they're more likely to be their game.

195
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,690
Okay. So I knew that I didn't grow up here.

196
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:52,920
Sorry about my daughter. So yeah, so that, that is really important and it says something about the way we view these are time activity too.

197
00:23:52,950 --> 00:24:01,620
So is it for some of us a way to socialize or is it something you do to put in your 30

198
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,190
minutes a day or an hour a day or whatever you might want to call your physical activity?

199
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:14,160
And hopefully it's something you enjoy. You don't feel like you have to put in a certain amount of time because that gets really boring after a while.

200
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,319
I mean, some people do that.

201
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:23,850
I find that boring, but, you know, everybody has a different preference in terms of the time that they put in and the activity that they engage in.

202
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,500
Yeah, the access to facilities also makes access to facilities, definitely.

203
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:36,780
And do you think access to facilities is going up or going down for a certain socioeconomic and ethnic and racial groups?

204
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:53,330
Yeah. So as communities declined, the access to different areas becomes a problem as well in terms of there being restored or maintained.

205
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:59,690
So that could potentially explain some of this. What else?

206
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:13,610
Yeah. Well, a lot of the times playing team sports is seen as kind of like a way out or peacefulness of these areas of lower socioeconomic economic,

207
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,020
because most of time their high school football team and whatnot.

208
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:22,969
And they're also like encouraged to play these sports because they're told by a lot of

209
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:28,390
people and society as a whole that this is only for you to get out of your situation.

210
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,700
Social mobility, but social mobility. Yeah, sure.

211
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:38,060
Surely. And then sport just for fun.

212
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,010
Yes. Individual thing is not hard. It's not as fun.

213
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,280
Bright and fun. Yes, I do.

214
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,999
Yeah, yeah. Gabriel, I just feel there's more.

215
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,370
I guess what you talked about is more access to, like, soccer fields, basketball and actual gyms in these communities sometimes.

216
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,630
Yes. So there's not enough gyms, but there's more fields.

217
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:09,440
Right. So what does that do to your physical activity during seasonal change, though, is is that season of change to us?

218
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,889
So yeah, when it's in Michigan, it's really cold.

219
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:17,830
In the wintertime, it's snowing so that you have access, but you might not want to go out there and play.

220
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:21,350
Right. So that's something that can affect our activity.

221
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:28,370
So all of these things have an impact on energy balance in the long run.

222
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:39,590
Now, whether or not, um, other changes that would explain these differences were described in the paper,

223
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,840
well, this had to do with the food composition and the focus was on children.

224
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,650
They did mention some work in adults, but, um,

225
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:59,030
but in general they mentioned this trend in a decline in discretionary calories and they describe discretionary calories as snack food,

226
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:05,089
if not poor nutrient density, high work density.

227
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:09,380
So, um, general things like that are shown here.

228
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:18,080
Uh, are there fewer dollars spent on this type of food during this particular time?

229
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:29,690
However, we're consuming plenty of this stuff, so a slight decline in this may not have had a big impact.

230
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,990
What about fruit and vegetable consumption?

231
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:40,100
So what percentage of children or what whether disparities exist in terms of who meets the recommendations?

232
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:45,650
Well, they were saying that Mexican children and children who live in households where there's higher income

233
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:53,629
have a greater likelihood of meeting the federal recommendations for getting enough fruit and vegetables,

234
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,420
whole grains in your diet. Yeah, I have a question.

235
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:04,820
How were that discretionary powers defined and that you may be able to recognize that a snack like a cookie,

236
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:10,370
but you may not be able to recognize a very sugary cereal or something like that.

237
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:18,170
Yeah. So I don't, I don't remember the detail in terms of what they would consider, but a sugary a cereal or a breakfast cereal is breakfast.

238
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:25,340
So that would not be included in this group, even though some of them are more like a dessert, then they're more like dessert.

239
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:30,890
Yes, convenience type with snack foods, sugar sweetened beverages, that sort of thing.

240
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,440
So let's let's focus here on sugar sweetened beverages.

241
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,309
And for a long time,

242
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:49,410
the public health announcements and messages to discourage the consumption of sugar sweetened beverages seems to have is having an impact.

243
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:53,570
So this was data that was published 2020,

244
00:28:54,110 --> 00:29:03,220
and they looked at the period of time between 2003 and 2006 and high sugar sweetened beverage consumption, too.

245
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:11,000
Before you get too excited about this, that the y axis here is the prevalence of heavy sugar sweetened beverage intake percent.

246
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:23,630
So the percentage of people who consumed more greater than or equal to 500 calories from sugar sweetened beverages has declined for decades.

247
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,120
So that's a lot. That's what. So what is it?

248
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,260
Is it 12 ounces or 16 ounces of Coca-Cola?

249
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:39,940
140 calories? That's because they can as well can.

250
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:44,650
So that's that's right.

251
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:49,450
For cans. There are fewer people. Let's put the equivalent of cans of Coca Cola.

252
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:54,950
There are fewer people consuming four cans or more of of of Coca Cola every day.

253
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,280
So things are getting a little bit better.

254
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:06,340
But, you know, they're still probably consuming too much in the way of empty calories in the form of sugar sweetened beverages you can have.

255
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:17,620
This is not to say you can't ever do this is to say that you shouldn't consume this much, a lot which would be greater than or equal to 500.

256
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:31,300
How about who makes the federal guidelines for whole fruits and vegetables, whole grains, dairy products, milk, a good source of calcium?

257
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:34,900
Not everybody can drink milk. Not everybody likes milk.

258
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,790
But that's the reference that was given in this particular review paper.

259
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,500
So no surprise. Higher income. With higher incomes, you're more likely to meet these recommendations.

260
00:30:49,240 --> 00:31:00,820
What in terms of differences might exist in regard to race and ethnicity, ethnic disparities as well for Mexican-American?

261
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:08,259
These are adults now. They meet some, but not all of the federal guidelines for fruits and vegetables,

262
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:16,930
whole grains and dairy and black individuals are least likely to have to meet the guidelines for whole fruits, vegetables and dairy.

263
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:25,250
So why do you think income is such a strong predictor of consumption?

264
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:28,660
Are following federal guidelines for fruit and vegetable consumption?

265
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:34,930
Kitty, I just wanted to comment on that because this is interesting because I think fruits,

266
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:41,710
vegetables and whole grains are associated with lower risk of obesity, but dairy is actually associated with higher risk of obesity,

267
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:48,870
especially in more recent reviews, like there's this obesity in obesity reviews,

268
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:56,980
there is a total dairy consumption is inversely total delivery that I just shortened to put dairy.

269
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,209
The reference was actually milk. But then what kind of milk is it?

270
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:12,760
Skim milk? Well, this is also total milk consumption was positively associated with overweight prevalence and incidence and prospective studies.

271
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:21,790
All right. So so in the review paper, they thought this information that the detail was milk and I quote dairy.

272
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:33,190
So, yes, but in regard to barriers to consuming fruits and vegetables and whole grains, what are the barriers for this?

273
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:41,550
Yeah, because usually fast food is expensive, prefers to catch fruits and veggies.

274
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:48,900
And that's why you can like, yes. Get more access to the healthy food choices then certainly.

275
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:58,170
Yes, that's certainly part of it. So foods that are high in micronutrients are more expensive than convenience.

276
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:02,010
Foods that have a longer shelf life for fast food.

277
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:06,299
Processed foods can be expensive to better processed and stuff.

278
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,290
Yeah. Yeah. There was another comment over here again,

279
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:22,020
because those fresh fruits and vegetables need more time to process and people need more process and it's easy to perish.

280
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:28,080
So they may not have such a small income,

281
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:35,250
they may not have the time or the technique to get that part of it so that the processing when I think of that,

282
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:41,910
I think if you've got to go out and harvest this, some of these fruits and vegetables require harvesting by manual labor.

283
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:50,430
So that's an added cost. Okay. Whereas grain and getting corn to make a high fructose corn sirup,

284
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:59,430
this is all collected by mechanized operations and the cost of harvesting processing is lower.

285
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:07,560
The cost of harvesting whole fruits and vegetables is higher because you have that that manual labor component that that's expensive.

286
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:12,260
And yes, there's a shorter there's a shorter shelf life. Yeah.

287
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:19,940
So are the pricing ethnic disparities, is that within higher income individuals or those two separate.

288
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:28,190
Yeah. With even within even within the different racial and ethnic groups, income is a is an important factor.

289
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:38,030
So if you are an individual within the African-American community, if you have higher income, you're more likely to meet the guidelines.

290
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:55,280
Okay. So food insecurity is also a significant barrier to getting enough healthy food in your diet.

291
00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:01,700
How many of you have taken the food insecurity course? Our office last year.

292
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:05,950
As an undergraduate, of course, people tell.

293
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,220
So food insecurity is not a new thing.

294
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:19,370
It's been with us for forever. And it what is this definition?

295
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:22,430
Limited or uncertain? Access to safe and nutritious food.

296
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:31,550
And it's becoming a more and more common problem and it's becoming a common problem among college students.

297
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,710
So how many of you knew that there was a food pantry for college students?

298
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:45,729
Let's get you to Washington, D.C. So this is not just here at the University of Michigan, where it's expensive to live, Ann Arbor.

299
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,290
It's expensive to go to school here.

300
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:54,820
But just about all of the major colleges now have food pantries for students because this is a very common problem.

301
00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:07,350
So. My experience when I was when I was a student in the eighties, people had problems with access to food.

302
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:17,800
They didn't talk about it. So the dormitory served food on only two meals on Sundays.

303
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:23,620
Is this true for food as per your experience? No. Sometimes people are saying yes.

304
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,160
So the dormitory is only served to meals on Sundays.

305
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:33,580
So if you had had ample income or at the end of the month, if you ran out of income,

306
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:40,540
you would just skip that meal and wait till the next to the next time that the cafeteria was open.

307
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:44,200
And when I lived in a dormitory, I had to do that a few times.

308
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:47,500
And then when I lived in an apartment, you know, that was never an issue.

309
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:55,510
So this is this is this happened a little bit in the olden times in the eighties, but it wasn't as common as it is now.

310
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:10,990
So. There's this higher prevalence of overweight and obesity, particularly in children who are faced with insecurity.

311
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,020
And there are a number of potential factors that have been mentioned to explain this.

312
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:22,800
So as you mentioned earlier, access to, um,

313
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:32,340
so it's it's less expensive to buy food that is high and caloric density but low and micronutrient density.

314
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,070
If you are used to this pattern of not having enough food,

315
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:44,610
perhaps you'll consume more food at one particular setting because you don't know when your next meal is coming.

316
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:50,300
And that's part of it as well. Yeah. Is it true this isn't Food Institute?

317
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:57,450
It's like to be obese at the same time, like nutrient deficiencies.

318
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,540
So they have to focus on nutrition or not.

319
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,980
Yes. Yes. That yes, this certainly could happen.

320
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:12,280
And it's not just happening. This is happening in other developed and developing countries as well.

321
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:18,489
So within some middle income company countries that are experiencing this nutrition

322
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:24,640
transition where the traditional diets are being replaced with Western diets,

323
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:29,980
you're seeing this increase in the prevalence of obesity in those households.

324
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:35,500
And you could have family members who have a higher BMI and those who are energy malnourished.

325
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:43,450
And so this is a really interesting and problematic issue that scientists are trying to understand.

326
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,820
Why does this occur? So.

327
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:53,840
So if you're if you're used to eating a lot of food and then having to wait a long period of time before your next meal,

328
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:58,700
perhaps this leads to metabolic changes that encourage storage.

329
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:04,969
And this addresses the issue of, okay, so this intermittent fasting thing that people do, what does that do?

330
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:10,110
Is that kind of like intermittent fasting? I don't know. Yeah, I'm just.

331
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:17,480
So as far as the metabolic juice, because you read that article about cortisol and that was related to weight stigma but wouldn't.

332
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:24,800
Like food insecurity and low socioeconomic status could also possibly have cortisol resistance, don't you know?

333
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:31,100
So the paper that I had to read last week had to do with stress reaction to stress, stress, reactivity.

334
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:37,430
That's a separate question in terms of what's the baseline level of stress and how that affects cortisol levels.

335
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:42,710
I don't know the details. I can't give you any details in regard to food insecurity.

336
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:54,700
That's actually really puzzles me why people say that the reason the meat cause more than vegetable abundant

337
00:39:54,870 --> 00:40:04,820
you can't get a huge bagel terrorists and broccoli's in string beans and much less than a bag of hamburgers.

338
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:14,360
Yeah, but you have to go to you have to have access to a grocery store to do that because of people's poor access to grocery stores,

339
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:19,700
they can't do that. They would have to travel on foot or on bus.

340
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,970
A significant difference in order to do that and they have to carry it home.

341
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:33,200
I agree with you. At the same time, those people who do have access, they don't go to or take bags of vegetables and cabbages.

342
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:38,000
They just go to the hamburger patty aisle.

343
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,720
It's become a habit. And French fries and fried chicken are little breaded things.

344
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:53,020
And, you know, to browse it's not that I can't comment on that right now with with food insecurity, I don't have details of it.

345
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:58,069
This is the biggest bush slice. Oh, I see what you're saying.

346
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:03,350
Okay. So you're saying it's an education issue.

347
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:15,620
So there are two issues. One is that the food industry has been like the taste like, oh, my, my, it is like basically a mess.

348
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:20,960
She kind of tastes and we have implanted the things that people are drawn to certain food

349
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:26,240
and now the image of that because it tastes good because they already have that program.

350
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:32,270
And secondly is because it's become a habit. They are really like French fries.

351
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:35,570
They the family have the fried chicken.

352
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:39,350
They will go to get those little patty they can she develop at home.

353
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:51,470
I think it's a habit, first of all, program by the food additives that we use and then we're leading this whole population into that kind of culture.

354
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:58,020
Okay, Jackie, I'm going to let Jack cut you off here, but it might also just be the taste of vegetables, too.

355
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:05,090
So someone who grew up on like standard supermarket vegetables are shipped in from other countries.

356
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:09,640
Like they don't taste as good as like if you get a farmer's market.

357
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:18,560
And so after like having farmers market fresh produce this year, it's like I didn't notice it was such a huge change in it.

358
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:26,900
And like after having that, like it's hard to incorporate like vegetables from the supermarket because they just, they don't taste as good.

359
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,550
Could be, could be as well.

360
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:37,940
So now there are more and more efforts from communities, especially low income areas, to have community gardens and farmer's markets.

361
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:47,280
And you can get coupons if you qualify to reduce the cost of the fruits and vegetables that you find farmers.

362
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,540
And yes, this is there is a big difference.

363
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:57,349
I got an awesome head of leafy lettuce, curly leaf lettuce the other day at the farmer's market here downtown.

364
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:05,120
So, yeah, I agree with that. So getting back to the food insecurity, we're talking about preferences.

365
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:13,370
So in terms of food insecurity is more common among black and Mexican-American households.

366
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:25,130
But when you look at whether or not having food insecurity as a child predicts whether or not you'll have a higher BMI as you get older,

367
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:29,240
there are some studies that show that, yes, that's true and some that do not.

368
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:39,950
So this as this idea as a predictor of future BMI, it's not agreement among all studies.

369
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:54,349
All right. Sleep. Something that because of our constant attention to our cell phones and social media and

370
00:43:54,350 --> 00:44:00,200
other things that are going on has suffered and become problematic during recent times.

371
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:08,390
And short sleep duration may be linked to body mass for a number of reasons.

372
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:14,780
There are this there's this hypothesis that there's this hormonal dysregulation.

373
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:25,340
So hormones that control glucose homeostasis like insulin, higher insulin resistance associated with short sleep duration,

374
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:33,190
higher levels of ghrelin, that's that's a hormone produced by your stomach that induces this sensation of hunger.

375
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:39,439
Perhaps it's dysregulated. Perhaps our sensitivity of leptin is affected by sleep duration as well.

376
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:45,560
And these are some hypotheses of poor quality of sleep.

377
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:50,959
This is when your sleep is broken up and that makes sleep for a few hours.

378
00:44:50,960 --> 00:45:04,130
You wake up, you can't fall back to sleep. Or in this perhaps could lead you to consume a snack or because of this you're tired the next day.

379
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:09,860
And if you have a tendency or perhaps it affects your leisure time,

380
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:17,030
physical activity or your physical activity in general because you're tired, you're less likely to move around and exercise.

381
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:22,100
And as a consequence, this can lead to a more positive energy balance.

382
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:32,720
So in terms of lower sleep duration or quality and increased BMI among among different racial and ethnic groups in general.

383
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,830
So here are some points that were discussed or described in the paper.

384
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:46,280
There are some associations between higher BMI and shorter sleep and in some ethnic groups,

385
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,930
Mexican, but not Puerto Rican and Cuban Americans, and then black men and women as well.

386
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:58,580
So this is a new area of research. We have a faculty member who studies sleep quality, sleep duration,

387
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:08,960
and she's looking at it as an important aspect or predictor of of body mass and some other things in terms of health.

388
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:17,450
And she's she's finding some really interesting things. So screen time, we talked about screen time and sedentary behavior.

389
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:25,100
Does increased screen time increase the prevalence of one's BMI of being overweight or obese?

390
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:29,990
Well, if you look at all the data, there's a weak association.

391
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:35,630
And that's because you can have high screen time, but high leisure time physical activity.

392
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:42,560
Okay. So just because you have a lot of time that you're doing right now, you're looking at your screens,

393
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,670
doesn't mean that that's going to indicate any kind of physical activity that you might engage in.

394
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:51,950
So that's probably why that is. There's not a good association there.

395
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:56,820
So. There are some.

396
00:46:56,850 --> 00:47:02,250
Yeah. Go ahead. Are there differences by age, like. Did you see a strong association with children?

397
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:13,260
So when I talk about childhood obesity, there are a number of studies looking at sedentary behavior in children related to screen time.

398
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:28,850
And, um, it depends on the type of screen time that they're engaged in, whether it be commercial television or commercial videos,

399
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:37,469
where there's an advertisement or if they just have a video recorded on a on a CD or another device where there's no advertisement,

400
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:41,670
there's an important interaction parent. And that's with children now.

401
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,780
So with adults,

402
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:50,850
there's this loose this week association again because of this possibility that you could be very active and spend a lot of time on the screen.

403
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,150
You can increase snacking behavior if you have access to highly palatable food.

404
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:02,129
And its impact in regard to race and ethnicity is complicated.

405
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:04,560
And here are some of the studies that have looked at children.

406
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:13,800
And in some studies you see children of lower income are more likely to have DVD players or TVs or video devices in their bedroom.

407
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:20,430
My kids had DVD players, but no TV and video game devices in your bedroom.

408
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:30,250
And so, you know, these are these some of in some ways they seem to be arbitrary to me.

409
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,700
But let's let's stick with the program here.

410
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:39,630
Positive association between watching television and ABC is stronger than whites and in black or Hispanic children.

411
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:55,080
So these are some ideas in terms of mechanisms that might explain this complex interaction and association between screen time and higher BMI.

412
00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:00,100
All right. Now let's look at biological factors.

413
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:07,480
So there's within biological factors, developmental perspective, genetics, epigenetics.

414
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:20,710
We'll talk about let's see the developmental perspectives later and this month, probably life exposures on September 26.

415
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:28,990
We'll talk about genetics on September 21st. And so let's look at developmental perspectives.

416
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:42,020
So prenatal, perinatal and early childhood exposures to adverse environmental conditions can manifest poor health outcomes later in life.

417
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:56,450
So if women have metabolic syndrome or they have a higher BMI, the offspring are more likely to have an a bollock issues later in life.

418
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:02,660
And this has been shown in animals of the animal lives as well.

419
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:08,210
And the opposite is true.

420
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:22,700
So if a child is exposed to famine, this can result in a greater prevalence of metabolic disease later in life.

421
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:30,050
And example, one example here is this hunger winter that we'll be talking about later in life.

422
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:39,590
So either of these circumstances can lead to a greater prevalence of metabolic disease and a higher BMI and.

423
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:52,330
Apparently there's genetic factors. So within the past 15, 20 years, there has been a lot of work done with genome wide association studies,

424
00:50:52,660 --> 00:51:04,150
and they have found people that have certain genes or copies of genes such as the FTO gene that's associated with a higher body mass index.

425
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:15,250
And there are also genes such as a snip that would affect the activity of the Mylanta calling for receptor.

426
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:23,560
Mel And of course for receptor. We'll talk about and subsequent lectures and how it plays a role in appetite and satiety.

427
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:29,440
And so, yes, these genes can affect feeding behavior.

428
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:39,910
However, this explains a very small, very small portion of the prevalence of BMI.

429
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:44,380
So there's there's when you look at different racial and ethnic groups,

430
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:51,729
DNA variation provides very little or incomplete biological evidence in regard to

431
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:57,910
why we see disparities among racial and ethnic groups and in socioeconomic groups.

432
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:04,209
Yeah, we feel like it's a combination of insurance and other risk factors that kind

433
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:11,560
of like it's not to say that it's genes that there are gene and environment.

434
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:16,000
Yes, there are genes and environmental factors that we'll discuss in greater detail.

435
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:25,810
But yes, certainly it's not just the genetic factors. So here's here's the point I made about socioeconomic differences.

436
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:33,430
There's a little plausible explanation for large wide variation in BMI in this regard.

437
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:44,649
And then finally, epigenetic factors. So the pre perinatal early childhood conditions could be explained by epigenetic

438
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:48,970
mechanisms and the epigenetic mechanisms that we're going to talk about later.

439
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:56,500
Mechanisms when we talk about early life exposures on the 26th, we'll talk about methylation of DNA,

440
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:06,010
histone modification, non-coding RNA and much more detail and how this can potentially explain higher BMI.

441
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:11,920
And so if you live in an environment where you're exposed to certain environmental conditions

442
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:20,440
that you could be exposed to something that has these potential for epigenetic modification,

443
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:25,060
there's a possibility that this might explain some of this.

444
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:30,850
Yeah. Do you have examples of what these conditions are like?

445
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:41,650
An example. So one example that people have explored that didn't exactly pan out was this finale.

446
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:49,780
So this was a compound that was used in polymerization of plastics, that were used in food containers.

447
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:55,210
And Danielle and I did a lot of work on this. And actually my lab, we did some work on this.

448
00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:02,860
And so they were looking at to see whether or not exposure to this whole egg in the perinatal period before,

449
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:09,040
during and after pregnancy increased one's likelihood, have a higher body weight.

450
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:23,730
And there were some animal models that showed that it did increase or it affected an epigenetic modification that led to obesity and in others.

451
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:33,250
And then wild type mice it did not actually had may have had an opposite effect, decreasing your body weight.

452
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:38,110
And there were differences between male and female mice in human studies.

453
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:48,160
It's difficult to separate food consumption from BPA exposure because if you're consuming more food,

454
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:54,340
especially sugary beverages, your exposure to BPA is also higher as well.

455
00:54:54,970 --> 00:55:04,570
So the ability to differentiate those two in terms of an exposure as a predictor, you can't based on the animal studies.

456
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:12,070
We did some we did work with this in L.A. We fed mice before, during and after pregnancy.

457
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:15,370
And we didn't see any difference in their body weight.

458
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,400
So it's mixed lots of mixed data.

459
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:25,120
I think if there's a social environment and neighborhood context.

460
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:30,600
So this has to do with, um, do you feel safe in your community?

461
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:36,460
This could be related to stress. Um, it could be related to physical activity as well.

462
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:42,730
So you don't feel safe in your neighborhood and it's unlikely that you're going to spend your leisure time

463
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:53,370
activity walking or running or exercising outside your neighborhood if there's a noise in the presence of danger.

464
00:55:53,380 --> 00:56:02,020
So if you live in a neighborhood where you hear sirens or there's lots of traffic, this could affect your sleep quality.

465
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:15,520
If you're afraid to go outside. Perhaps this raises your level of stress and this could affect your consumption of food and your sleep quality here.

466
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:20,470
The amount of sleep that you get and whether or not it's broken up or whether this happens repeatedly.

467
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:32,050
Um, and then your opportunities for healthy behavior might be limited because of where you were in terms of engaging in physical activity,

468
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:36,370
in terms of engaging with conversation with people in your neighborhood.

469
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:41,889
Um, so if you're less likely to engage in conversation with people in your neighborhood,

470
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:44,950
you're isolated and this could have an effect on your mental health.

471
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:58,940
Um, so, and this is, this is, is an important factor in terms of racial and ethnic inequality, um,

472
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:04,270
because non-whites and low income individuals are often living in segregated and isolated communities.

473
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:11,979
What do I mean by isolated communities? So if you live in a neighborhood that's isolated and yes, you have these safety issues,

474
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:22,360
but you also don't have access to grocery stores and other types of conveniences that higher income neighborhoods.

475
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:28,390
What happens is then there's the social network.

476
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:39,700
So your social network can influence your body, you can shape your behavior, it can shape your physical activity behavior.

477
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:46,389
It can shape your eating behavior. It can even affect your food preferences and your activity preferences.

478
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:54,040
So if you hang out with a group of people who love fast food, you're probably going to eat a lot of fast food.

479
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:59,110
And this is particularly true with adolescent boys. Adolescent boys have this.

480
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:06,910
They're the ones who are the targets for a lot of the marketing for fast food chains.

481
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:12,010
So they'll see these commercials. They want to try the newest thing at Taco Bell.

482
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:17,320
And those are that those are the people that they're targeting because they love that kind of food.

483
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:26,870
And if you hang out with a lot of boys with with disposable income and cars to get to these places,

484
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:30,340
well, they're going to consume a lot of your lifestyle.

485
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:38,649
Whether or not you engage in physical activity, the types of it that you do, you prepare them at home.

486
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:44,320
You hang out with people who can do. You hang out people who go to farmer's markets.

487
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:51,190
All of these things can influence your food preferences and your physical activity practices, body image.

488
00:58:51,840 --> 00:59:00,640
You hang out with a bunch of people who are overly concerned with your body, but their body image can distort your view of your own body.

489
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:11,320
And this is true for for for eating disorders. And then finally, access to medical care.

490
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:18,450
So many racial and ethnic minorities, particularly, and people with low income,

491
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:25,750
they're less likely to have high quality health insurance, so they're less likely to have regular screening.

492
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:32,110
And this can contribute to issues with with BMI.

493
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:36,400
We're not having access to treatment.

494
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:40,400
And it can affect many things, not just. One's body size.

495
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:46,760
Okay. Now, I wanted to talk about this issue of whether it's not very few of you have heard about this.

496
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:57,010
So what do I mean by weathering? So weathering is this concept of early aging.

497
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:04,459
So with black men and women, they experience further deterioration due to the cumulative effects of repeated

498
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:09,530
experience with social and economic adversity and social political marginalization.

499
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:14,040
And this was the author of this paper from 2006.

500
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:17,550
It's a classic paper. That's why I'm mentioning it from Arlie Geronimo.

501
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:27,980
And she looked at among people within this group, she looked at their static look.

502
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:33,540
And now a static load is essentially the physiologic burden imposed by stress.

503
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:48,770
It's not just cortisol. She looked at other biomarkers catecholamines, hydro at the end, dust around the dirt and the sterile sulfate.

504
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:52,130
So DHEA. She looked at these levels.

505
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:57,740
She also looked at some physiologic responses, such as blood pressure,

506
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:05,510
geologic markers that she'd say blood pressure, hemoglobin, A1, C, blood lipids and so on.

507
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:17,180
And based on these metrics, she developed an algorithm to assess physiologic age and and related that to mortality.

508
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,420
So here's that here's the abstract of the paper.

509
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:27,830
Here's the title Weathering and Age Patterns of Static Load Scores among Blacks and Whites United States.

510
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:35,059
So the objective of this study was to consider whether U.S. blacks experienced earlier health

511
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:41,960
deterioration as measured across biological indicators of repeated exposure to adaptation to stressors.

512
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:48,630
And she used a large database. This is from the enhanced database.

513
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:56,580
So she examined our stack. Let's use this algorithm to calculate base load scores or static load scores.

514
01:01:57,510 --> 01:02:07,080
And with these scores, the estimated the probability of a high score by age, race, gender and poverty status among blacks and whites.

515
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:20,760
So she's looking at how these anesthetic stressors affected the the estimated the probability of a high score by age,

516
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:28,710
race, gender and poverty status and odds of having a high score relative to the score was a static load.

517
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:36,810
And I'll show you the results here. So here's figure one from this paper.

518
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:40,020
This is the probability of analysis for higher.

519
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:45,149
Again, all static load was calculated from the algorithm, from the data that they collected,

520
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:49,560
the stressors and the physiologic responses to this or stressors.

521
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:56,980
So here we have a discussion.

522
01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:02,790
So here you have the first part of the figure predicted probability.

523
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:16,200
So in the upper half we're looking at now having a greater score, whereas the probability of having a greater score, black versus white.

524
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:21,150
So the static load is higher for black individuals than it is for whites.

525
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:29,010
And the difference between these lines separates with age, indicating it's a greater static load.

526
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:33,150
Blacks trigger whites as they increase in age.

527
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:39,630
Then they looked at similar parameters in the second part of the figure.

528
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:48,150
And here you see here, here they're looking at differences in a static load.

529
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:51,110
And men and women, black men, women and white men.

530
01:03:52,230 --> 01:04:00,360
So in the squares here, you have black men at the lowest static load over a course of years, white women.

531
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:06,780
And then the static load was higher for black men and black women.

532
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:19,370
So let's had a higher score than the whites. Whites a greater probability of a high score at all ages, particularly 35 to 65, four years of age.

533
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:31,670
And then they looked at whether or not socioeconomic status income affected those differences.

534
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:38,540
So in the top half of this second figure, they're looking at poverty income ratio.

535
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:42,470
This is based on somebody's eligibility for food assistance.

536
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:48,260
So in this particular figure, they're looking at the probability by age of having a high score.

537
01:04:48,890 --> 01:05:01,640
And they're looking at those with the poverty income ratio of 1.5 or less and 1.85 or greater.

538
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:10,970
And lo and behold, those those individuals who had a higher poverty income ratio had a higher static load.

539
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:23,010
Okay. So there are differences in terms of funds, poverty levels or lower socioeconomics, lower socioeconomic status, higher anesthetic risk.

540
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:31,770
And then in the bottom half of the graph, they looked at whites and blacks in regard to this value.

541
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:42,810
And here you see and they open whites scarcest is whites where the pride value of greater than 185, they have a greater income.

542
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:50,550
Here's the black squares. Here's the whites with less income.

543
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:54,150
So they have a higher price score.

544
01:05:55,170 --> 01:06:06,149
And then here we have black individuals with PRI of greater than 1.85 and it's

545
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:11,670
higher than the other values for white individuals of lower or higher incomes.

546
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:26,400
And then the highest score for this static load metric is for black individuals who have this lower this higher value, I should say one less.

547
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:35,670
The PRI is less than or equal to 1.5. So when you control for the point of this, when you control for poverty level, you still see these differences.

548
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:40,650
Okay. You're shaking your head back here. And have you seen this before?

549
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:52,860
Oh, no, no. Okay. So there are x rays of high scores among black were not accounted for by higher proportion of blacks were poor.

550
01:06:53,610 --> 01:07:02,610
So. So the conclusions in this paper were racial inequalities and health issues across a range of biological

551
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:09,780
systems on adults and are not explained by racial differences in poverty and weathering effects.

552
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:19,920
Weathering effects of living in a race conscious society may be greatest among blacks and most likely to in those who engage in high effort coping

553
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:36,030
women that referred to the very first one be figure you saw higher esthetic load and men compared to black women compared to black men shown here.

554
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:51,360
So these these constant stressors now could have a significant impact on one's food consumption practices and physical activity as well.

555
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:59,460
So these are things that you need to consider when we're talking about differences in race and ethnicity in regard to differences.

556
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:07,620
BMI. Yeah. Can you explain what you mean by high abstract coping, so high effort cocaine?

557
01:08:08,550 --> 01:08:17,880
Oftentimes black women are left with the burden of keeping the family together, earning an income too, especially single black women.

558
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:27,900
Okay. They are putting a lot, a lot of effort in to keeping the family unit together, supporting a family with 1 to 3 jobs,

559
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:42,990
providing a constant, normal family activities, regular meals, different activities, trying to support the family to keep it together.

560
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:54,550
Any questions about this? Yeah. So this is the first time I'm hearing about the concept of weathering.

561
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:59,300
I was wondering, like, do members of the black community, are they aware that they're experiencing this?

562
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:03,530
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yeah, very, very much so.

563
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:15,380
Anecdotally, I've known several families that have had this, and the women in the families have taken a considerable load.

564
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:22,280
So, yes. Any comments before you in class today?

565
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:32,849
All right. So I will be leading the next reading, but I'll give you an extra day to read that because I think I've got a video now how to do this.

566
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:36,319
So let's I'll get that up and then the following once I'll be able to once I figure this out,

567
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:40,700
I can get them all loaded up so you don't have to at them.

568
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:45,560
And you'll have plenty of time to look at and comment on them in the future.

569
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:53,900
So I would wanted to remind you that there's a quiz quiz, too, on Friday, and it's going to be the same kind of a format.

570
01:09:54,890 --> 01:10:01,310
It will cover the last three lectures on weight, stigma today race, ethnicity and then the food environment.

571
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:05,070
All of those will be in place. All right.

572
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:09,379
Any questions for you today? I will be going to complete quickly.

573
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:13,190
So I know you said the last time I left it unlimited.

574
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:18,590
This time I will shorten or I mean, like you gave us a 12 hour, 12 hours.

575
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:23,059
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I know. It's almost a really busy schedule.

576
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:27,860
Yes, I know it won't be 12 hours, but it won't be 30 minutes either.

577
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:34,700
Okay, so. But so we will only have that like 12 hour window.

578
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:41,340
So I will open it once you open it and you have to finish from that time.

579
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:46,980
But it's only open for like 12 hours we only have access to a of saying is like

580
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:51,770
like I have 5 hours of class on Fridays and we work for 5 hours on Fridays.

581
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:54,770
So I don't have a lot of experience difference in the Masters.

582
01:10:55,190 --> 01:11:02,570
So it's a longer time. It'll open on Friday if you lose on Sunday or something like that.

583
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:09,110
Yeah, it was just six years.

584
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:39,400
They were planning on doing on the first he shot while I was there for like for funny.

585
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:48,210
I didn't like to say yes. I'll think I'll talk to you. Yes, yes, yes.

586
01:11:50,980 --> 01:12:01,900
Yeah, I go on.

587
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:28,390
I mean, I'm going to ask you, do you know anyone that got you?

588
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:35,080
Oh, God, I have no idea.

589
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:39,490
Yeah, that's where I go. Are you going to everybody?

590
01:12:40,340 --> 01:13:25,180
Yeah. I am so tired it when you are required to take time to check out my house right now.

591
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:31,320
But, you know, I think.

592
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:46,420
Okay. Oh, yeah, I thought about it, but that's not what happens.

593
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:52,080
Really, I think. Yeah, like, I.

594
01:13:56,830 --> 01:14:11,070
I love my internships, not even in the states, like how to do this for five months.

595
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:28,720
So I was like, Max, really interesting to see a little bit school, which is like, I should just stay here until I have to sell for maximum use.

596
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:32,030
That's really what's happening for sustain itself, right?

597
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:38,140
Instead of having more and then like another kind of ephemeral besides that I did events for pattern.

598
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:42,010
It becomes more of an end at increased risk.

599
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:49,990
It's like, I don't really see how this is a bit like a parent or a friend's nonsense.

600
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:53,890
And I was like, What? And then like later I was like.

601
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:57,970
From the events that I should expand on.

602
01:14:58,270 --> 01:15:08,260
And I was like, you know, that's not as significant as agreed or but I'm going to talk to, you know, in the future.

603
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:21,790
Yeah. Yeah. I just like to they under they I like I had a lot of stuff and like I was saying that certain that's like out of high school.

604
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:25,990
Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Like, you probably don't know.

605
01:15:27,070 --> 01:15:31,890
Yeah, you're small, so you might have an account.

606
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:35,170
And then she also told me that I didn't. Yeah, I do know that.

607
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:38,710
And I am interested to see how to avoid that.

608
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:42,480
I was like, just because they didn't make it doesn't mean that they're in there.

609
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:51,450
Yeah, because I went back to my room and I underlined my responsibility.

610
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:55,000
What's your expectations for, like, for this class?

611
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:00,100
You could do like, I don't know, like Total Fantasy Island, so.

612
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:12,260
Yeah. Yeah. And then she took photos and I was like, oh, for what point of all the edits that you made before does that, man.

613
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:18,980
Yeah. It's like I haven't addressed anything like that.

614
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:26,040
It's so trying to be great to have more input on it.

615
01:16:26,370 --> 01:16:32,999
Okay, I got ideas. So it's perhaps I was like, What are we going to do?

616
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,180
I think I'm going to get you for that.

617
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:40,350
I do apologize, but I think it's going to be. Yeah, I mean, I'm going to argue.

618
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:50,420
I think, like I said, I'm going to change things when off because it will be a lot easier for them.

619
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:55,230
And like that is a little bit like this.

620
01:16:56,540 --> 01:17:06,360
But like I'm going to argue for those two points back because like I said, yes, when I got into playing on Saturday,

621
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:16,290
I heard from parents and I think it's like you're designing your really like especially the type of teacher.

622
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:21,959
Yes. Okay. And so we had to do a course description and she liked my overall and give me a lot of feedback.

623
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:27,410
And I only got like nine out of ten and I feel like it's doing it.

624
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:34,980
So she is excited that I got to get very excited.

625
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:43,680
I know like and I think that I really like people that are like, you have a good mom, you feel that way about your school.

626
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:50,330
And I feel like it makes you feel like, Oh yeah, I sent her an email and I like, like I would like to like chat about like that.

627
01:17:50,350 --> 01:17:56,340
It is not like how that's going to go because of everything.

628
01:17:56,780 --> 01:18:00,870
I need this so much.

629
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:11,340
Exactly like every teacher until 593 came out and how could someone not, you know, spend time with you?

630
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:15,420
So your business is one. Yeah.

631
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:27,150
I feel like for now my so like for me the most stressful part is to make the mess beside that it's manageable.

632
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:32,520
Okay, I know that that's just one that is there for 24 students.

633
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:41,700
I figured I don't want up to two sections or want to set up each page, each sex section with 22 students.

634
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:48,890
So in total four. Yeah, I'm super nervous about that because I don't want to miss anything.

635
01:18:49,560 --> 01:19:01,139
You know, I tell myself it's going to be a big problem. So anyway, to you, do you have any like just like friends that have like a lab before yours?

636
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:04,500
I guess it's like they. What are you with?

637
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:08,740
These are your labs. It's Tuesday morning and Friday mornings.

638
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:12,900
It's a friend that has a lab on Monday. Oh, the Monday.

639
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:17,430
So because of the Labor Day, we have Labor Day off now.

640
01:19:17,430 --> 01:19:26,430
The first session is Tuesday. And that's going to say like, oh, my goodness, I like some travel show.

641
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:36,810
I just like, who can you go to? Like. Like, do you have like a professor that, like, we have like meeting every Tuesday, but.

642
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:47,340
Yes. Oh, yeah.

643
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:56,910
So that's like more deaths than, you know, compared to last week is a lot more desks.

644
01:19:58,060 --> 01:19:58,410
Oh.
