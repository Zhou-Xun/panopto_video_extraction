00:00:02,619 --> 00:00:04,002
Hi everyone. So thanks for

2
00:00:04,002 --> 00:00:09,425
listening to the lecture where we're going to go through the renal system,

3
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:14,110
and talk a little bit about the burden of chronic kidney disease.

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:19,696
So the renal system is also known as the urinary system, and its primary role

5
00:00:19,696 --> 00:00:25,570
is to filter the blood, form and store urine, and excrete urine from the body.

6
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,755
And so we'll see some very complicated and elegant ways in which

7
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:35,843
the renal system is able to do these very things to keep us safe,

8
00:00:35,843 --> 00:00:41,440
and your use urine as a way to maintain homeostasis of our body.

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,906
The renal system includes two kidneys which are on either side here,

10
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:49,299
they're kind of being shaped you can see them here.

11
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:55,515
And those two kidneys are connected by two ureters to a urinary bladder.

12
00:00:55,515 --> 00:01:01,868
And the urinary bladder then is connected to the outside of our body by a urethra,

13
00:01:01,868 --> 00:01:06,640
and that is the tube by which urine flows to exit the body.

14
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,440
And it's so interesting how much work our kidneys really do.

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:17,730
They process up to 20-25% of our total cardiac output.

16
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:22,187
And to put that in perspective, that means that they are processing

17
00:01:22,187 --> 00:01:25,840
approximately 1,000 ml of blood per minute.

18
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,564
And so our kidneys are constantly working hard to keep our bodies safe

19
00:01:30,564 --> 00:01:35,451
from toxins that might be present in our blood, and to filter them, and

20
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:39,340
to excrete them from our body to keep us safe.

21
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,723
So, as I said the renal system's primary role is to help us with homeostasis,

22
00:01:44,723 --> 00:01:48,170
and it does it through many different processes.

23
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,171
It helps with regulation of body fluid volume and composition.

24
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:57,050
And we'll see how it does that in a little bit through urine secretion.

25
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,040
In doing so it eliminates metabolic waste from our blood.

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,295
It has a major role in synthesis, release or activation of hormones,

27
00:02:06,295 --> 00:02:10,410
such as erythropoietin, renin, and vitamin D even.

28
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,130
And that those hormones then help us in our regulation of blood pressure.

29
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:21,444
So one of the ways that our body works through our renal system to regulate blood

30
00:02:21,444 --> 00:02:27,100
pressure is through the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System.

31
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,520
And this system plays an important role in regulating blood volume, and

32
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,701
our overall vascular resistance.

33
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:37,525
And these two things together influence cardiac output and

34
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:39,740
arterial blood pressure.

35
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:44,443
As the name implies, there are three important components to this system,

36
00:02:44,443 --> 00:02:47,410
renin, angiotensin and aldosterone.

37
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,471
And so renin as you can see here is secreted by the kidneys.

38
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,902
So it's a secretary product of the kidneys, and

39
00:02:54,902 --> 00:03:00,008
it stimulates the formation of angiotensin in the blood in the tissues,

40
00:03:00,008 --> 00:03:05,840
and that in turn stimulates the release of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex.

41
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,240
And so let's walk through just a little bit about how that actually happens.

42
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,434
So renin is released into the circulation by the kidneys as I mentioned,

43
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:20,371
and its release is stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system, or

44
00:03:20,371 --> 00:03:23,114
by hypertension of the renal artery.

45
00:03:23,114 --> 00:03:26,338
So low blood pressure within the renal artery, or

46
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:28,651
by decreased sodium in the kidney.

47
00:03:28,651 --> 00:03:33,623
And so we have these three mechanisms by which renin might be

48
00:03:33,623 --> 00:03:37,880
secreted to counteract these types of inputs.

49
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,530
And so when renin is released into the blood, it acts upon a circulating

50
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,970
substrate that's released by the liver called angiotensinogen.

51
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,328
And this interaction between renin and

52
00:03:50,328 --> 00:03:55,219
angiotensinogen forms a product called angiotensin I.

53
00:03:55,219 --> 00:04:00,243
And angiotensin I can then be converted to angiotensin II

54
00:04:00,243 --> 00:04:05,180
by an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme.

55
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,340
That's a nice handy name.

56
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,218
And so this enzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme is present

57
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:16,297
in the vascular endothelium of our lungs for example,

58
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:21,640
as well as other tissues, the heart, the brain, other vasculature.

59
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,780
And so really its role is to convert angiotensin I to

60
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,740
Angiotensin II through a cleavage process.

61
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,537
Angiotensin II is important because it has many functions to

62
00:04:34,537 --> 00:04:37,750
regulate our blood pressure directly.

63
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,563
And so one way that it can do that is through stimulating the release of

64
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:42,440
vasopressin.

65
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,440
And if you remember, vasopressin is also known as antidiuretic hormone.

66
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,619
It's secreted from the posterior pituitary, and

67
00:04:51,619 --> 00:04:56,690
then that release increases fluid retention in the kidneys.

68
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:01,840
And with the increased fluid retention we can increase blood pressure.

69
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,455
Angiotensin II is also stimulates thirst centers in the brain,

70
00:05:06,455 --> 00:05:11,170
which as you might imagine then would increase our fluid intake.

71
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:17,340
And as we just mentioned, having greater fluid then increases blood pressure.

72
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:22,123
Angiotensin II can also trigger constriction of

73
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:25,395
the arterial vessels directly.

74
00:05:25,395 --> 00:05:28,350
So having vasoconstrictive properties directly.

75
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,626
And as we know from our previous lectures,

76
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:36,540
that that vasoconstriction then increases blood pressure.

77
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,479
So in addition to all of those actions, where angiotensin II

78
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,640
can have a direct impact on blood pressure through different mechanisms.

79
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:51,376
Angiotensin II can also stimulate the adrenal cortex to release aldosterone,

80
00:05:51,376 --> 00:05:55,411
and so aldosterone then can act directly on the kidney.

81
00:05:55,411 --> 00:05:59,940
So we're coming back to the kidney here through these secretary pathways.

82
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,053
Aldosterone can act directly on the kidney to increase sodium and

83
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:05,997
water retention, and again,

84
00:06:05,997 --> 00:06:11,840
then having this increased water conservation can increase blood pressure.

85
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,804
So, as you can see here in the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system,

86
00:06:16,804 --> 00:06:22,270
through multiple different mechanisms with multiple different hormones here.

87
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:27,240
There are important implications for the regulation of blood pressure.

88
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,933
And so as such many pharmacotherapies for the treatment of hypertension and

89
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,820
heart failure are specifically targeted at this pathway.

90
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:41,315
And so you may have heard of medications such as ACE inhibitors,

91
00:06:41,315 --> 00:06:45,694
or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or

92
00:06:45,694 --> 00:06:50,940
perhaps have heard of angiotensin II receptor blockers.

93
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:56,028
And in looking at the diagram here, you now identify how

94
00:06:56,028 --> 00:07:05,140
those types of medications might impact blood pressure.

95
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:11,049
So the nephron is the functional basic structural unit of the kidney.

96
00:07:11,049 --> 00:07:15,784
And its primary function is to regulate the concentration of water and

97
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:18,994
soluble substances, by filtering the blood,

98
00:07:18,994 --> 00:07:23,540
reabsorbing what is needed, and excreting the rest as urine.

99
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,861
And amazingly in humans, each of our kidneys.

100
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:32,140
So each individual kidney contains approximately 1 million of these nephrons.

101
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,800
So in individuals who have both their kidneys, we have 2 million of

102
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,330
these nephrons doing this type of work in each little micro unit.

103
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:47,181
And so each nephron is composed of an internal filtering component and

104
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:52,040
a tubule specialized for reabsorption and secretion.

105
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,478
And so, you can see that system up here within the top picture,

106
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,591
at the top right here, you can see that system.

107
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:09,201
And then the bottom right picture here is a magnification of that picture above.

108
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:14,027
And so, think about how we have 2 million of these very intricate

109
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:19,340
systems as shown in the bottom right picture throughout our body.

110
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:24,203
And so, blood enters the kidney through the renal artery, and

111
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,692
it divides into interlobular arteries, and

112
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:33,771
eventually comes into each individual nephron through afferent arterials.

113
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:38,311
And you can see that right here, we have interlobular artery and

114
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:44,140
then it branches into afferent arterials, to get into each individual nephron.

115
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:49,094
And so then blood enters the filtering component of the nephron,

116
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:54,781
through the glomerular capillaries for filtration of the large solutes.

117
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:57,968
And so the glomerulus here is a network or

118
00:08:57,968 --> 00:09:03,501
a mesh work of small capillaries, that blood then travels through and

119
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:09,640
has permeable cell walls to be able to filter out those large solutes.

120
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,644
And the filtrate is then collected in the glomerular capsule which

121
00:09:14,644 --> 00:09:19,736
connects to the renal tubule, for additional filtering of water,

122
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:23,327
filtering of glucose as well as electrolytes.

123
00:09:23,327 --> 00:09:28,392
We can see then if we follow this tubule structure all the way down,

124
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:33,821
that that filtrate then travels down what we call the proximal tubule,

125
00:09:33,821 --> 00:09:38,796
here that's the descending part here, the loop of the nephron,

126
00:09:38,796 --> 00:09:41,163
and then up the distal tubule.

127
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:46,275
And what is left then at the tubule, at the end that time is collected

128
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:52,490
in the collecting tubule over here, and excreted out the renal papilla as urine.

129
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:56,030
And so you might be looking at this picture and

130
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:00,514
wondering why we've named each section of this tubule.

131
00:10:00,514 --> 00:10:07,241
Why do we call it the proximal tubule, the loop of the nephron, the distal tubule?

132
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:10,521
And so we're gonna go through that in a minute and

133
00:10:10,521 --> 00:10:15,401
see how it interacts with the capillary network surrounding it to really

134
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:18,640
regulate the concentration of urine.

135
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,629
So, notice in this picture here that the renal tubule which includes those

136
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:28,395
three parts, the proximal tubules the loop, and the distal tubules.

137
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:34,699
Is surrounded here by a peritubular capillary network called the vasa recta.

138
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:38,080
And the interaction between the vasa recta and

139
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,588
the renal tubules is this complicated and highly coordinated

140
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:47,453
system to regulate the concentration and volume of urine, okay?

141
00:10:47,453 --> 00:10:55,640
So that's what we're gonna do, is walk through how that actually happens.

142
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:01,296
So as you can see in this picture here the flow of water and solutes within

143
00:11:01,296 --> 00:11:06,685
the nephron which is the loop you can see on the right hand side here.

144
00:11:06,685 --> 00:11:12,888
That flow is in the opposite direction as the flow of blood within the vasa recta.

145
00:11:12,888 --> 00:11:18,940
So remember the vasa recta is the capillary network surrounding the tubule,

146
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:24,640
and then that flow of blood is opposite of what we see in the nephron.

147
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,940
So this opposite direction is known as countercurrent exchange.

148
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,733
And it's that process that allows for the reabsorption of elements

149
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:38,439
from the nephron back into the blood, as well as the secretion of,

150
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:42,500
or movement of elements from the blood into the nephron.

151
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,532
So we have both blood and solutes going both ways,

152
00:11:46,532 --> 00:11:50,390
from blood tune nephron nephron back to blood.

153
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:55,493
And so as shown in the picture here, water is reabsorbed,

154
00:11:55,493 --> 00:12:02,159
and by reabsorbed I mean moved back into the blood, and sodium is excreted or

155
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:07,808
moved from the nephron in the descending loop of the vasa recta.

156
00:12:07,808 --> 00:12:13,092
So this process of making the filtrate in the nephron more

157
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:18,165
concentrated is known as the concurrent multiplier.

158
00:12:18,165 --> 00:12:21,199
Increases the filtrate in the nephron loop and

159
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:26,099
then through actions of aldosterone which we heard about a few slides ago,

160
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:29,309
sodium is then reabsorbed in the distal tubule.

161
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:32,170
Meaning, sodium moves back into the blood.

162
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:37,348
And then in the collecting duct water is reabsorbed or moves back into the blood

163
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:42,730
through the mechanism of antidiuretic hormone which we've talked about.

164
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,440
And all of this happens so that urine can be concentrated for excretion.

165
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,771
And this elegant process allows our body to regulate

166
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:57,737
the volume and the concentration of our urine for

167
00:12:57,737 --> 00:13:04,440
excretion so that we can maintain homeostasis.

168
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,144
And so as you can imagine, this is a very complicated system

169
00:13:09,144 --> 00:13:14,051
that happens in each one of our nephrons throughout our body.

170
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:19,699
And so it's without a doubt that sometimes things go wrong,

171
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:24,870
and we're seeing that happening more recently.

172
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,325
And so chronic kidney disease is one of our major diseases of

173
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:32,456
interest with respect to public health.

174
00:13:32,456 --> 00:13:37,980
Because we're worried about the increasing prevalence of this disease

175
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,971
as well as its association with many other age related outcomes.

176
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:45,098
And so chronic kidney disease,

177
00:13:45,098 --> 00:13:48,900
also known as CKD is the gradual loss of kidney function.

178
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,291
The resulting fluid electrolyte and waste build up in the body.

179
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,776
And so as you can understand now,

180
00:13:56,776 --> 00:14:02,840
walking through how kidneys work in terms of excretion.

181
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:08,220
If they're not working well, we will have an imbalance in the amount

182
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:13,135
of fluid that is retained by the body, and the electrolytes and

183
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:17,620
waste that is built up in the body, and not excreted out.

184
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,625
And so, more than 1 in 7 adults right now,

185
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:25,040
that's 15% are estimated to have chronic kidney disease.

186
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,810
And in terms of numbers, the CDC estimates that to be about 30 million people.

187
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:35,102
But what's really important to note is with many of our chronic diseases,

188
00:14:35,102 --> 00:14:39,311
many individuals don't know that they have this disease.

189
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:44,254
And so, estimates are that 48% of those with chronic kidney disease, but

190
00:14:44,254 --> 00:14:45,861
who are not on dialysis.

191
00:14:45,861 --> 00:14:50,381
So with the earlier stages of chronic kidney disease,

192
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:55,891
about half of them actually do not know that they have the disease.

193
00:14:55,891 --> 00:15:00,373
And so this means that we're not able to provide treatment to these individuals cuz

194
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:03,240
they don't even know that they have it.

195
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,647
You can see in the top right figure here that the prevalence of chronic kidney

196
00:15:08,647 --> 00:15:13,819
disease among United States adults is a little bit greater among women.

197
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:17,111
And that we actually see race ethnic disparity,

198
00:15:17,111 --> 00:15:22,813
whereby non-Hispanic blacks have the greatest burden of chronic kidney disease,

199
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:27,790
followed by Hispanics, and then followed by non-Hispanic whites.

200
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,871
And as I indicated, we see a lot of overlap between chronic kidney disease and

201
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:34,870
other chronic conditions.

202
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,013
And so in the bottom right figure here,

203
00:15:38,013 --> 00:15:43,159
you can see that the overlap with other conditions like diabetes

204
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:48,330
shown in yellow, high blood pressure shown in red is very high.

205
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:53,464
And so this figure is actually showing that the underlying

206
00:15:53,464 --> 00:15:57,864
cause of end-stage renal disease which is ESRD,

207
00:15:57,864 --> 00:16:02,920
which is a very advanced form of chronic kidney disease.

208
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,059
That up to 44% of that, or

209
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:10,340
nearly half of that is actually fundamentally caused by diabetes.

210
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:16,010
And so we're seeing not only having an overlap of these two conditions but

211
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:22,331
in fact that many of the diseases that we've talked about in this course already.

212
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:26,873
Such as diabetes, such as high blood pressure are ideologic

213
00:16:26,873 --> 00:16:34,241
factors related to chronic kidney disease as an outcome.

214
00:16:34,241 --> 00:16:38,944
[COUGH] And so accordingly we can imagine that the ideology of chronic

215
00:16:38,944 --> 00:16:43,729
kidney disease can be related to many other diseases such as type I and

216
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:46,219
type II diabetes, hypertension.

217
00:16:46,219 --> 00:16:51,717
Renal hypertension, so that's hypertension specifically in the renal arteries,

218
00:16:51,717 --> 00:16:53,942
inflammation of the glomerulus.

219
00:16:53,942 --> 00:16:59,229
So we walked through that filtering component within the nephron.

220
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:02,481
And those are small capillaries, and so

221
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:07,935
having inflammation of that glomerulus itself means that it can't

222
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:13,291
do its work to filter out the solutes as effectively as it needs to,

223
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:18,940
and it might also result in hypertension within the renal system.

224
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:23,383
Accordingly, inflammation of the tubules as well will

225
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:27,369
impact the amount of filtration that can happen.

226
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:34,564
And then what also can happen is that we can develop cysts within our kidneys.

227
00:17:34,564 --> 00:17:38,520
And that development of cysts is known as polycystic kidney disease.

228
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,219
And as those cysts develop and proliferate within the kidney,

229
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:47,131
we can lose the functional utility of our nephrons.

230
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:52,635
And, although it sounds like a lot that we have 2 million of these nephrons,

231
00:17:52,635 --> 00:17:57,209
once we start to lose them through purposes of inflammation, or

232
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,540
the cysts, or other factors such as cancers.

233
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,701
We need those nephrons to do the filtering work for us, and so

234
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:09,740
if we don't have them intact, then we're really in some trouble.

235
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,010
Of course, ideology related to CKD would be having

236
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,001
obstruction of the urinary track.

237
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:22,712
So if we're not able to get that metabolic waste out through the mechanism, through

238
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:28,352
getting urine out of the body, that could be a problem as well as kidney infection.

239
00:18:28,352 --> 00:18:32,509
For the same reason that we may damage those nephrons and not be able to have

240
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:36,490
them functionally available for us to do some of that filtering work.

241
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:41,758
So, chronic kidney disease is particularly worrisome because

242
00:18:41,758 --> 00:18:47,521
of the many complications and consequences related to its function.

243
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:52,726
And so we started out this lecture talking about how important our kidneys were.

244
00:18:52,726 --> 00:18:56,961
And our renal system was in maintaining homeostasis of our body,

245
00:18:56,961 --> 00:18:59,271
both in terms of metabolic waste but

246
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:03,990
also other outcomes as we talked about with blood pressure for example.

247
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:10,463
And so you can see that once you have a disease like chronic kidney disease,

248
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:15,411
it has a lot of systematic consequences across the body.

249
00:19:15,411 --> 00:19:19,900
And so it impacts hypertension, it impacts heart failure,

250
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:25,547
it can ultimately impact our immune function, and our GI manifestations.

251
00:19:25,547 --> 00:19:29,448
It can lead to osteodystrophy, so

252
00:19:29,448 --> 00:19:35,772
difficulties with our musculoskeletal system through

253
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:41,440
moderation of how we are able to calcify our bone.

254
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,286
And it can lead to the build up of acid within our body,

255
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:49,851
and disrupt our pH balance in that way.

256
00:19:49,851 --> 00:19:54,740
And so this isn't meant to be something that needs to be memorized.

257
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:59,979
I just want to highlight that a disease like chronic kidney disease,

258
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:06,690
because our renal system is fundamentally about maintaining homeostasis of our body.

259
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:13,115
Once that system is impaired, it has really cross-cutting outcomes and

260
00:20:13,115 --> 00:20:18,840
consequences across systems within our body.

261
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,211
And so how do we diagnose the disease like chronic kidney disease?

262
00:20:22,211 --> 00:20:28,074
And so as we have done with many of our conditions, we've seen that we start with

263
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:33,691
blood tests, we can look for creatinine and urea in our biological fluids.

264
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:38,166
And so where we're looking whether we have build

265
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,668
up of those within our bio specimens.

266
00:20:41,668 --> 00:20:45,889
We can do different types of urine tests to see what types of solutes might be

267
00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:47,580
spilling out into our urine.

268
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,800
We can image the kidney, we can take biopsy of the kidney.

269
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,723
And so there's a lot of different types of things that we would do, and

270
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,230
part of that work up.

271
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,741
And what's problematic however,

272
00:21:00,741 --> 00:21:05,595
in terms of treatment is that much of our treatment for chronic kidney

273
00:21:05,595 --> 00:21:10,881
disease right now is either focusing on trying our best to treat the cause.

274
00:21:10,881 --> 00:21:15,965
And so if the cause of the chronic kidney disease for example is diabetes,

275
00:21:15,965 --> 00:21:21,953
then we're not treating the kidney disease per se were treating the diabetes itself.

276
00:21:21,953 --> 00:21:27,532
Hoping that we can then blunt the impact of that initial condition like diabetes

277
00:21:27,532 --> 00:21:32,550
on the kidney and stop the damage that's occurring within the kidney.

278
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,651
Or we can treat the symptoms.

279
00:21:34,651 --> 00:21:38,802
So if some of the symptoms related to the chronic kidney disease

280
00:21:38,802 --> 00:21:43,576
are high blood pressure, or anemia, or swelling, or changes in bone,

281
00:21:43,576 --> 00:21:49,140
then we actually treat those systems rather than treating the kidney itself.

282
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,731
Other ideas are that we can limit the dietary intake of protein.

283
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:58,687
Protein is very hard to break down and digest as we talked about in the GI

284
00:21:58,687 --> 00:22:03,240
system, and it's also difficult for our kidneys to filter.

285
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,079
And so having that low intake of protein means our kidneys don't

286
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:09,740
need to work harder than they need to.

287
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:14,319
If our kidneys have failed so severely that they can no

288
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:18,387
longer filter our blood in a way that we need to,

289
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:23,270
one option is not to actually do any treatment at all, but

290
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:28,601
to use mechanical methods to do that filtration of the blood.

291
00:22:28,601 --> 00:22:34,222
And so to go on dialysis, where the blood is circulated through a machine,

292
00:22:34,222 --> 00:22:40,050
to filter out the metabolic waste and then circulate that back into the body.

293
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,910
So again, I'd like to highlight that this isn't actually improving the function of

294
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:47,608
the kidney as are none of these treatments, but

295
00:22:47,608 --> 00:22:51,940
instead it's trying to take over the job that the kidneys unable to do.

296
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:57,176
And then ultimately as we've seen with many individuals who have end

297
00:22:57,176 --> 00:23:02,340
stage renal disease, the only hope is to have a kidney transplant.

298
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,848
And luckily as individuals we have two kidneys, and so

299
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:11,454
you can survive with just one, and one well functioning

300
00:23:11,454 --> 00:23:16,440
kidney can do the work of two poorly functioning kidneys.

301
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,874
And so for many individuals with end-stage renal disease having a kidney

302
00:23:20,874 --> 00:23:24,378
transplant is their only option, cuz we do not have ways or

303
00:23:24,378 --> 00:23:27,901
mechanisms to improve the function of a diseased kidney.

304
00:23:27,901 --> 00:23:31,132
As you can see, we're treating the cause of the kidney disease,

305
00:23:31,132 --> 00:23:34,775
the symptoms of the kidney disease, or having another way to filter, but

306
00:23:34,775 --> 00:23:37,810
we're actually not able to treat the kidney specifically.

307
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:42,636
And so it's for this reason that our burden of this chronic

308
00:23:42,636 --> 00:23:46,478
kidney disease is so great for public health,

309
00:23:46,478 --> 00:23:52,020
because that's really where we're at in terms of our treatment.

310
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:59,803
All right, thank you everyone so much.
