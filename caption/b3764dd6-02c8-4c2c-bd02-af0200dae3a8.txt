1
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,920
I haven't seen it, but feel free to check it or not.

2
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,170
No problem. They are right.

3
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:31,010
Good morning, everyone. Today we will finish the discussion on case control studies.

4
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:38,390
So as you may recall. We began by.

5
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:46,220
In lay terms describing the difference between a cohort study and a case control study.

6
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,010
Right. So again, study you begin with everybody who is at risk of the outcome.

7
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,900
US is exposure first and then you follow people.

8
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:08,950
Regularly assessing the outcome and register who gets the outcome according to their exposure case control studies.

9
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:16,990
You begin with them. You select some people who have a disease, an outcome of interest.

10
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:25,030
You select a group of people who don't have the disease, were close controls, and then you compare them with respect to exposure.

11
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:35,350
So you typically assess exposure after you have selected the people that you will compare with respect to them.

12
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:43,060
We also mention. That.

13
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:55,260
The selection of controllers is critical. In a case control study and we went through two of the three ways to select controls, right?

14
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:05,190
We went through incidence density. Um, and we went through a school selection of controls.

15
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,670
Um. For this to proceed, there's you need to.

16
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,860
Assume that. There is an underlying goal.

17
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,910
And the key concept of an underlying cohort is the study base.

18
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,170
Because the study bases the person on time. That gives rise to the cases.

19
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:35,850
And it should also be the one from which controls are selling.

20
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:47,570
So in incidence density, you have to peak controls out of a risk set for each case.

21
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,550
Which is composed of everybody in the underlying cohort who was at risk of becoming a case.

22
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,150
At the time, that index case became a case.

23
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,840
The measure of association in case control studies is.

24
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:16,410
Christopher. Okay.

25
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,850
Let me give you a hint. It starts with odds and ends with ratio.

26
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:31,960
Yes. Recall, there are no measures of frequency in case control studies.

27
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,060
We are limited to the multiplicative scale only.

28
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,650
There is no such thing as an additive scale in case control systems of.

29
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:53,900
And we discussed also case studies. And the main difference is the procedure to select controls is that in case God studies,

30
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:02,990
you select controls as if you were at the beginning of the call at enrollment, at baseline and not at the origin.

31
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:11,090
And you select a bunch of people to serve as controls regardless of the person time that they served in,

32
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:16,370
the cohort contributed and regardless of whether they became cause cases or not.

33
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,370
You don't need person time for that type of election.

34
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,660
And because of the way in which this election happens.

35
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:37,320
The odds ratio is an unbiased estimate of the cumulative incidence which I forget to review again that in.

36
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:46,040
Insurance density sampling. The odds ratio is an unbiased estimate of the incidence rate ratio.

37
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:58,570
Yeah. In case cohort studies those ratios an unbiased estimate of the cumulative incidence ratio restrictions that

38
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:04,450
you would estimate in the underlying cohort if you had the possibility of assessing exposure on everyone.

39
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:11,080
All right, good. And what's the measure of association in case cohort studies?

40
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,740
That's right. Yes. All right.

41
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:31,430
Also, in case God studies recall is the only type of case control study in which you can examine more than one outcome.

42
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,040
Because your controls are selected regardless of whether people develop any outcomes.

43
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:49,740
Right. Whereas in the older types incidence, density and cumulative, which we will study today,

44
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:55,530
you begin with a single outcome and you are stuck with that outcome.

45
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,740
You cannot study more than one out. Okay.

46
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,720
All right. Enzo wanted to any any questions on that?

47
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:14,640
Quick recap. You get the essence of case control studies?

48
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,740
When? When should we use case control studies instead of cohort studies?

49
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:30,640
When the disease is rare or. Takes a long time to develop cohort studies.

50
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:42,499
Become inefficient. Also when you when your exposure is something that may be very costly to make sure you do have a biobank,

51
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,560
but you can know this is on everyone so you can.

52
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,490
That's a justification also to do a case control study.

53
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,600
Okay. All right. I.

54
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,380
I wanted. I said that you remember this survey.

55
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:10,690
This was. When I ask what the odds ratio in a case study is an unbiased estimate of and I was sort of joking saying that you know the.

56
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:19,460
Many of the options were gibberish, but I felt bad about not really being explicit why they are gibberish.

57
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,530
I mean, it may be obvious to me, but not to everyone. So apologies for that.

58
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:29,680
And I would like to explain why I call these some of these options gibberish.

59
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,710
So that the right answer is the cumulative incidence rate.

60
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:40,020
And I was pleased that, you know, slight majority of the class got you.

61
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,370
That doesn't mean I was displeased with the other choices, you know, just choices.

62
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,750
Not correct choices.

63
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:58,490
Um, so y y you see my decisions regression win is not Einstein's regression, because in case God studies, we don't have person time.

64
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,439
We don't need person wanting to select controls and the incidence rate ratio

65
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,300
refers to a measure in the underlying cohort that is obtained with person.

66
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,820
So that's why it cannot be the instant regression, right? Why is it not the extraction?

67
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:25,840
Anybody. Was the excess fraction.

68
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,950
You know, to what scale does it pertain?

69
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:52,500
To what scale does the authorization pertain? The idea he was scale or the multiplicative scale.

70
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:59,410
The multiplicative right and the excess fraction pertains to that scale.

71
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:09,810
They're additive. So, you know, it's eggs and apples or apples and oranges, but it says that it cannot be.

72
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,880
That does what he said. He said that means much that don't have anything to do with each other.

73
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:27,810
Why is it not prevalence? We are comparing a measure in a case control study with a measure in a cohort study.

74
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:36,510
What's prevalence? We are comparing measures of association to begin with.

75
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,930
Less prevalence is prevalence and measure of association.

76
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:46,470
Not even that is a measure of frequency or of occurrence or existence, if you will.

77
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:53,050
Does it have anything to do with cohort studies? Oh.

78
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:59,310
What do we care about? Prevalence. In which studies? Cross-sectional studies.

79
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:05,230
So again, this is, as you said, something sort of crazy. It doesn't really have anything to do.

80
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,780
We with this? Okay. So.

81
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,320
There's a bit of a. Yeah.

82
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:26,150
This is tractors for a reason. Right. But. I mean, sometimes you can just discard them by.

83
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:34,420
All right. And we went through this years and this and that.

84
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,270
We are about to begin the discussion of the last.

85
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,440
Way to select controls for a case control study.

86
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,830
And this is cumulative sampling.

87
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:56,140
Of controls. Cumulative sampling of controls.

88
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,570
It's actually what everybody had been doing.

89
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:08,210
And how the first case control studies were done before people develop the theory that

90
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:13,820
actually case control studies were all conducted in the context of an underlying goal,

91
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:23,490
whether it was defined or not. Okay. So to do a cumulative sampling of a case control study, you first select all the cases.

92
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:28,100
Again, we are back to this. Representation of the underlying code.

93
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,060
In this case, it's a it's a it's a close cohort.

94
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:44,250
And mind you, I don't want you to get confused. Cumulative sampling can be done in the context of a close cohort with a primary study base.

95
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:54,950
It is not often the case. You know, because if you have a if you have a close cohort, you are better off by doing incidence density.

96
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:01,589
The only reason why I am doing this example and using a close cohort is because it's

97
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:06,120
going to be simpler and visually and conceptually is going to be simpler to grasp.

98
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:19,200
Okay. But cumulative sampling is typically conducted when you have a secondary study base, meaning usually an open cohort that is not well defined.

99
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,190
Okay.

100
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:33,430
But if you had a you know, in this context, after selecting all the cases, you will select a random sample of participants at the end of follow up.

101
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,870
Among those who did not become cases. So something like this.

102
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:56,000
Right. It's at the end of follow up because you have to make sure or you have to feel certain that they did not become cases.

103
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:03,900
After whatever time you fell. They were supposed to be cases and did not.

104
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,050
That's why this election is done at the end of each person's follow up.

105
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,290
Now, because, you know, for example, in an open court, you don't really know,

106
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:20,640
you know, in this case, this person did not complete administrative end of follow up.

107
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:25,680
But hey, for that person, this unit was the last follow up date.

108
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,160
And at that time, the person had become a.

109
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:40,450
Then it was eligible to become a control. This election also does not take into account there's some time in the.

110
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:52,040
You just have to assume that whomever is not the case was at the end of some sort of follow.

111
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:03,250
Okay. So the what the follow up time really is for for non cases is and define.

112
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:19,810
And as with all other really ways of selecting controls, the number of controls doesn't have to be equal to the number of cases.

113
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:25,519
Yeah. Usually is the same or more, but it doesn't have to be equally.

114
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,230
Doesn't have to be around multiple. No, it's kind of arbitrary.

115
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,580
So I have removed everything else and just left the cases and the controls here.

116
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:44,040
And as with the other examples, now we assess exposure, right?

117
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:50,230
So I got back my results on who was exposed and who was unexposed.

118
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,660
And this is the situation which we can summarize in a table.

119
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:06,700
We have the same number of exposed cases and unexposed cases, and now we have three exposed controls which are this,

120
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:12,460
this and this, and nine unexposed controls which are the blue open circles.

121
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:23,290
The measures are the same. So we have to estimate first the odds of exposure among cases, which is this four divided by two,

122
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:27,460
and then the odds of exposure among controls three divided by nine.

123
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:35,080
And now we estimate the measure of association is the same, the odds ratio, the ratio of those.

124
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,730
Quantities, which is six. Now.

125
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,060
I go back to the same bone.

126
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,239
Think of this outrage in the context of this sampling.

127
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:59,700
We have explained and I would ask you which measure of association in the underlying cohort is the odds ratio?

128
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:04,320
A cumulative case control study unbiased estimate of already?

129
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:33,750
All right. Um. Let's see, we hit 60.

130
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:39,290
It is about 80 people in the room. So six is a pretty good response rate.

131
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,790
Hmm. Okay. All right.

132
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:20,010
So. Hey. Hmm? These reveals the answer is certainly nothing.

133
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,659
So we can go back and review.

134
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,560
Why is not? The others.

135
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:37,100
So I see. No, the incidence rate ratio will recall today and I told you in cumulative selection of controls there is no person time as well.

136
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,800
Right. So that should rule that out. Okay.

137
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:51,980
Um, okay. Let me leave this for the end, because this is the kind of the more controversial and actually, you know, in majority 70.

138
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,200
So why is not the excess fraction? I know you guys were trying to be funny with this, too.

139
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:04,380
Um, it's not the excess fraction because this fraction is in the additive scale.

140
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:09,340
And the odds ratios in the multiplicative scale have nothing to do with you though.

141
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,579
You should. Why is you've no the prevalence.

142
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:19,750
That is really hilarious. Not the prevalence because the prevalence is not even a measure of associations,

143
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:27,220
a measure of occurrence of existence and is not something you do or care about in cohort studies.

144
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:34,220
You care about it in cross-sectional studies. Now.

145
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:46,970
Why is it not the cumulative incidence ratio? He's not the cumulative incidence ratio because.

146
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:07,590
By not sampling at the beginning of the cohort, but at the end.

147
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:22,330
You are. Excluding people from the denominator in the underlying goal.

148
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:31,280
From the denominators of the exposed and unexposed.

149
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,600
And that exclusion is not proportional.

150
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:45,750
Two the actual sizes of the original exposed and exposed denominators.

151
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:53,740
There have been cases. And those guys.

152
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,210
In an underlying cohort and out of the denominator.

153
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:03,370
The controls we are picking at the end do not represent any more.

154
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:10,530
The size is proportional to exposure at the beginning of the call.

155
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,910
So numerically it is not possible.

156
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:22,010
That the odds ratio in this type of study will ever.

157
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:29,810
Equal. The cumulative incidence ratio. The US.

158
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,770
What? Right.

159
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:42,220
You cannot. Now. Numerically, numerically.

160
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,880
These number. Would approximate.

161
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,430
The cumulative incidence ratio. When?

162
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,580
The disease is rare.

163
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:08,380
Because if you think of the underlying cohort, when the disease is rare, becoming becoming a case doesn't do much to the denominator.

164
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,410
Emmy nominated Dassin sharing insights as much.

165
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,520
So if that's the case, you know, the controls that you select.

166
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:29,020
May approximate proportionally the relation of exposed and unexposed at the beginning of follow up.

167
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:41,840
In another Lanco. But the fact that it approximates the cumulative incidence ratio doesn't mean it is an unbiased estimate.

168
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:48,080
Being an unbiased estimate means is mathematically arithmetically exactly the same number.

169
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:56,450
Again, the odds ratio in a cumulative incidence, in a cumulative sampling of controls can never.

170
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:03,110
Equal numerically. The cumulative incidence rate or the relative risk.

171
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,600
So this is what I was explaining before.

172
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:23,790
And you may have heard if you have been exposed to some of these concepts or papers, you may have heard about the rare disease assumption.

173
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:28,160
So this is where that red disease assumption comes into play.

174
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,720
The radical assumption means that's the condition you need to have.

175
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:42,310
For the odds ratio in a cumulative sampling is controlled study to numerically approximate the cumulative incidence rate.

176
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:50,700
And it will never be the same. It will, in fact, always overestimate.

177
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:54,630
Well, I shouldn't say that, because it's not an estimate. It will always be.

178
00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:01,240
Further away from the null value then the cumulative incidence rate.

179
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:08,180
So if the association is positive and the cumulative incidence ratio in another line cohort is above one.

180
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:19,410
The alteration will be even farther from one than the nativity scenes, which if the exposure is protective and the quality of instance ratio is.

181
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,500
Below one. In the underlying cohort.

182
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:34,930
In the cumulative case control study, the odds ratio will be even farther from one and closer to zero than the cumulative incidence ratio.

183
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:42,310
So it might give you the wrong impression of a stronger association.

184
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:50,630
Then it really is. That's also one of the interpretation problems.

185
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,420
With the odds ratio.

186
00:25:53,720 --> 00:26:02,930
When people sort of escape this theory and go on to interpret, for example, the odds ratio, if they if they happen to use the odds ratios,

187
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:10,640
the measure of association in a cohort study, and they go on to interpret the odds ratio as the cumulative incidence ratio.

188
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:17,600
They are getting there or giving the wrong impression that the association is actually stronger than it really is.

189
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:27,280
And that is a mortal sin in epidemiology. Thou shall not interpret the odds ratio as the cumulative incidence rate.

190
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:32,980
But thou shalt not use the odds ratio in studies other than case control studies.

191
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:45,140
Okay. Any questions on this?

192
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,690
Okay. So, again, as I said, you know, these cumulative.

193
00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:02,390
Selection of controls is typically conducted when you do not have a primary study base.

194
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:12,670
It's usually carried out when you have a secondary study, that means when you have a cohort that is not well defined.

195
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:25,740
For example, an open call. And in fact, these were historically the first case control studies that work on that.

196
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,730
I mentioned coalfield 1951 last time.

197
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:41,100
And you know what they would do. Usually, actually, medical doctors were interested in sort of research at the population level.

198
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:51,390
What they would do is they would go to a world in their hospital and recruit people who were hospitalized.

199
00:27:52,360 --> 00:28:01,570
With the disease that they were interested in, and then they would go and select people who did not have that disease,

200
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:05,290
usually who were hospitalized, say, in other services.

201
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,100
Right. Or people who were, I don't know, in the waiting room.

202
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:24,370
And compare them with respect to exposure status. So that type of study is now understood as a cumulative sampling of controls, case controls.

203
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:42,290
Now. You can think of the types of cases that you recruit or select in a case control study in two types.

204
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:51,490
When you have a primary study base, a well-defined cohort that, you know, has been followed,

205
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:59,710
a cohort that started with people who were not cases at baseline, were free of the disease of interest at the origin.

206
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,190
You actually saw the cases up here?

207
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,910
And New knew that means those were insulin cases, right?

208
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:23,410
So when you conduct a case control study out. Of a primary study base, you are typically using incident cases.

209
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:35,170
Because again, you sort of saw them or, you know, whoever the initial investigators of the cohort was, they saw them appear.

210
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:40,510
And you from a group of people who did not have the outcome at base.

211
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,940
Right. So they are incident cases. By contrast.

212
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:50,970
If you go to the ICU at the University Hospital here.

213
00:29:51,980 --> 00:30:01,600
You know, and select everybody who's there with an MRI with a myocardial infarction or as cases for a case control study, cumulative case controls.

214
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:07,870
Nobody has seen those cases appear.

215
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:19,850
From a well defined call. Those were the guys were just like, you're unlucky enough to be there when the investigator went to find their cases.

216
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:26,870
Because of that, you cannot really call them insulin because nobody saw them.

217
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:34,080
Arise from a new. They are called prevalent cases.

218
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:48,970
Really? Because they happen to be men. There is the main difference between prevalent case cases and incident cases.

219
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:54,410
Is that? The prevalent cases.

220
00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:01,460
May be missing some. Key people.

221
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,470
Who should have been there. But where?

222
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,710
In the case of my name, I.

223
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:24,660
Who are you going to find at the ICU to recruit cases in your case, control study, which might still be, but for people who survived the heart attack.

224
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:30,059
So if you lose prevalent cases, you are going to miss everybody with.

225
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:37,110
You didn't make it to whatever location you chose to select your cases.

226
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:45,700
Any of the reasons why some of these people died before making it to the ICU?

227
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:52,760
Happen to be related to the exposure status that you are interested in.

228
00:31:53,450 --> 00:32:01,580
Meaning whether if the people who died before making it to the ICU were more or less exposed to the exposure of your interest,

229
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:07,910
then your selection of cases will be biased, meaning it will give you the wrong answer.

230
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:14,980
Is it clear the difference between prevalent cases and incident cases?

231
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:23,110
So again, easier cases when you have a primary study base, much of a problem because you know everything.

232
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:29,680
So in the case of an inmate, you would actually know who made it and who did not make it to the ICU.

233
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:38,249
But you would get them. All right. Prevalent cases in uses of secondary study basis.

234
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:46,470
Typically, usually when you do a cumulative selection of controls and cases, those cases are going to be relevant.

235
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,960
And they may be subject to selection pressures.

236
00:32:55,050 --> 00:33:02,050
Any questions on that? All right.

237
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:11,240
So. Conceptually.

238
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:25,050
What does the investigator have to do to select controls for the cumulative case control study when they have a bunch of.

239
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:36,170
Cases that just happened to be there. How does the investigator have think about selecting a group of controllers for those people?

240
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:45,220
It's very hard because basically the investigator has to think well, right.

241
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,310
Where do these where did these cases come from?

242
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:58,660
In other words, what this study base was the population that gave rise to them.

243
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:03,720
Because I can only select control from that population.

244
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:17,340
You see, in the other ways of selecting controls, we always knew from which population the cases were coming, right?

245
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:21,640
Because they were closed, cause we had them enumerated.

246
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:27,160
We had databases. We knew. We knew. Exactly. Where those cases came from.

247
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:38,640
They came from everybody who was recruited in the court being. And that helps us reduce the possibility of selecting the wrong controls.

248
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:46,990
What happens? With the possible controls, we can peak for real in cases of an inmate in an ICU.

249
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:52,280
Where did those cases come from? At the University Hospital.

250
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,390
You guys who have been exposed to these the doctors. Doctors to be.

251
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:02,220
Where do cases of May come from?

252
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:08,580
We end up here at the ICU. How would you try to define sort of the source population?

253
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:15,520
But just from your experience, what do you think? What do you think they come from?

254
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,510
To. I.

255
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:33,820
You're here. Precisely.

256
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:43,810
So. Exactly. So this is like a tertiary quaternary level of complexity hospital.

257
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,150
And likely those cases that you get, they are the most complicated on the one hand.

258
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:56,090
On the other. It could also be the ones that. You know, happened closer to the hospital.

259
00:35:56,090 --> 00:36:01,040
You know, if I get any more euphoric over here, chances are I will end up there.

260
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,360
But the most complicated case is may come from.

261
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:15,030
I don't know. Kalamazoo and, you know, Saginaw and.

262
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:23,280
And I come from, you know, say you. So how so would you say the state?

263
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:28,820
How about North Ohio? You might get cases here from rotten Ohio.

264
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,540
So he's very difficult. He's very difficult.

265
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:42,870
Because by delivering these, you know, to begin with, an adequate selection of controls is that you have to do this thought experiment.

266
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:49,390
What do you think of a potential pool of controls? You have to think.

267
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:54,140
Had this guy gotten name I.

268
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:05,310
Would they have gone to University Hospital that ICU, and would I have been able to select them as cases?

269
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:11,610
That's exactly the question you need to answer. If you are able to answer that question with certainty, you are safe.

270
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:17,070
You have been able to use this database for your controls.

271
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:29,600
Not confounding. Selection problems.

272
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:41,130
The controls you might select may not represent the larger pool of controls from which truly the cases can.

273
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,730
And that's a problem. Yes. You had a question and.

274
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:53,890
Yeah. I was just.

275
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:23,680
Great question and we are getting there. It's not a matter of matching.

276
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,130
But what's very important. What's very important.

277
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:35,360
Is that the distribution of exposure of your exposure of interest?

278
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:50,460
In the controls you end up selecting to compare against the cases has to be the same as the distribution of exposure in the underlying pool.

279
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,340
Of the primaries of this of the study bills that gave rise to the cases.

280
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,760
It's a matter of comparability, of exposure, distribution.

281
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:10,050
Actually, the other characteristics don't matter much.

282
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:18,879
There might be differences, but hopefully if you have done your particles and knowledge, you would have collected information.

283
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,900
Then you can deal with the maintenance. That would be a different problem.

284
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:29,189
The issue here is that what you have to guarantee is that the distribution of exposure,

285
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:35,879
again in the controls that you end up selecting for your case control study is the same as the

286
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:42,990
distribution of exposure in the underlying pool of controls that gave rise to those cases in the study.

287
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:49,020
When you cannot even define this study based, that is a challenge.

288
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:59,800
My favorite words in your language. So selection of controls should be independent of exposure to state.

289
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:06,399
These what I'm trying to say. If the distribution of exposure or differing differences between your group of

290
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,270
control selected and the underlying group of controls from which is a general.

291
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:17,800
This is the selection of controls has not been independent of exposure, risk status and you will get the wrong answer.

292
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:30,210
So in order of, you know, practical or logistical terms, how do you go about selecting controls or how have people tried to sort this out?

293
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:40,300
What would be possible sources of controls that may facilitate people sort of definition of that.

294
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:50,450
Ill defined population. The best would be to use what's called population controls.

295
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:56,400
If you can assume that your cases came from a well-defined population.

296
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:07,110
So if you could say, and again we said this is probably not true, but if by any chance, University Hospital only serve two people from Michigan.

297
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:17,200
You could say, well, for sure, sort of the minimal common denominator for all of these cases is the state of Michigan.

298
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,290
So then you would. Try to get some.

299
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:31,760
Enumeration or some information that would allow you to know who is the population of Michigan.

300
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:38,030
At the time those cases became cases, and maybe you can select controls from from them.

301
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:47,630
So, you know, in the old times, you would actually dial random numbers from a from a phone guide.

302
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:54,440
These were books, uh, at the end of you ever seen a phone guy?

303
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:01,250
Oh, many. Not too old and not all right.

304
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,290
But if if the whole first, you know,

305
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:12,080
the whole population that is not enumerated or you can really not be sure that you can defined the study based in terms of of the population.

306
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:19,170
Some people have resorted to use neighborhood controls. Under the assumption that.

307
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:33,370
Well, at least, you know, if a neighbor of the case had gotten any of my perhaps that neighbor would have made it to the same place.

308
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:35,590
Where the case may be. Why?

309
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:45,910
Because, you know, they probably share socioeconomic characteristics, demographic characteristics, perhaps health insurance, closeness to the.

310
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,680
Place of recruitment at center.

311
00:42:53,320 --> 00:43:04,570
But then the other very, very common source of controls in the you know, I guess in the past and which I have actually alluded to is to big.

312
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:10,970
Controllers from people coming to the same hospital, but for obvious reasons.

313
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:20,030
The rationale behind that is that, again, hey, if these guys are in the hospital because they broke a leg or an arm,

314
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:25,400
chances are if instead they had gotten any might, they would have come to the same hospital.

315
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:32,330
So these guys who came to the hospital for a different reason maybe may represent the

316
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:40,250
population from which my cases of interest came as aggression out of hospital controls.

317
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:50,020
But there are some super interesting paradoxes that that this may actually bring about.

318
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:53,900
And we will go through at least one example of it shortly.

319
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:57,290
So none of these methods is perfect.

320
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:03,360
They are all you know, they may all have flaws.

321
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:11,379
And how do you know it is? You have to. Get a Ph.D. in epidemiology.

322
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:15,350
Perhaps all you. I don't know.

323
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:22,400
So some researchers have used family members.

324
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:29,540
Again, this assumption is that you need somebody in the family, got an email and was taken to University Hospital.

325
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:36,050
If they had happened to anybody else in the families, likely they would have made it to the same hospital.

326
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:40,670
But the problem is that family members share many things, including.

327
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,300
Exposure status. So that might also be a problem.

328
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:54,560
And some people have used that controls when the case is that head to begin with

329
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:01,310
they are is very uncommon to do case control studies with that as the case.

330
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:07,040
Can you guess why somebody can get away?

331
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:17,440
What you have to do after you have recruited your cases and your controls.

332
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:21,480
Yes. Vincent, come on. No.

333
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:27,889
In a case control study, you start with the. Events in this.

334
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:31,640
And then and then you have to go back to.

335
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:39,120
Okay. As their teen exposure.

336
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:48,820
And how good are dead people at telling you to lower their exposure status sometime before the event?

337
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:58,230
Okay, good. Some people have used relatives as proxies, but still, you know, they are relatively rare.

338
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:04,630
It's just an extreme example. Yeah. Right.

339
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:15,510
Right? Right. And again, you know, if if if the exposure in that case, then you would argue for a biomarker.

340
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:21,989
You would you should have a close cohort and you should not be doing cumulative sampling of controls.

341
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:29,150
You should be doing incidence density or case scope. All right.

342
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:39,640
Any questions on cumulative sampling? The classical case control study and how it's understood melodies in modern Italian.

343
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,860
All right. So a few summary points on these countries.

344
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:51,999
Things in general, they are efficient for relevance or long latency periods.

345
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,220
Events that take a long time to be become evident that most.

346
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:01,760
They may be less expensive than gold studies. They require a smaller sample sizes.

347
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:07,100
All of them allow for the study of multiple exposures.

348
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:12,560
You are really not limited to a single exposure.

349
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:18,040
However recall, only one allows for the study of multiple outcomes.

350
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:23,490
Which one is that? He's got.

351
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:32,570
Excellent. All right. So as they are efficient for rent outcomes,

352
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:41,300
they are inefficient for rent exposures because the sample size is limited by people who have the outcome and by a bunch of controls.

353
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:47,390
If your exposure is rare, you will end up with very few exposure controls and very few exposed cases.

354
00:47:53,090 --> 00:48:01,540
Sure. They are also subject to the problems of all.

355
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:07,860
Observational studies. You know, we have talked about, Maria said, confounding before.

356
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:13,140
So yeah they are also they are also susceptible to confounding non exchange ability.

357
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:19,170
We talked about the issue of prevalent cases in cumulative sampling that that might be a problem of selection.

358
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:27,540
And then again, their main, I guess, vulnerability is the process of selection of controls.

359
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:36,900
That's where case control studies may go wrong when selection of controls is not independent of exposure to status.

360
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:47,030
The other problem is that often times because we begin with K status and have to go back and figure out what the exposure was,

361
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:57,800
often times we have to ask people about their exposure a long time before they became cases.

362
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,410
And you know,

363
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:11,740
they did the people's memories is is not always accurate and may not be equally accurate according to whether they are cases or controls.

364
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:26,280
So. Not only have a few really interesting exercises for you to think about on on those two main issues and what the consequences may be.

365
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:29,760
First, problems with selection of controls.

366
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:34,020
And later, we will do one on problems with.

367
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:39,620
Recall of past exposure. Okay.

368
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:47,780
So. And these are all actual real cases.

369
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:53,060
They have just simplified the numbers for you to be able to make calculations sort of quickly.

370
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:58,610
This was a case control study of smoking and myocardial infarction.

371
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:05,240
So cases where people with an MRI and controls were people with or without any MI.

372
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:17,479
Um. And let's assume that the people without any might really represented the larger pool of control from which those with a might had arisen.

373
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,470
So they are well selected controls.

374
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:30,830
Other than exposure to smoking and nonsmoking. And you would get this table if this study again was conducted properly.

375
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:39,830
Good selection of controls. The odds ratio is four, meaning there is a positive association between smoking and my now.

376
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:50,630
What would happen if, instead of an appropriate selection of controls and procedures, the controls were patients with a respiratory disease.

377
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:59,170
Let's say the doctors pick your allergies, whatever big people they might at the ICU then as controls.

378
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:08,310
When do they? Respiratory Diseases service, and people were hospitalized there with respiratory diseases.

379
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:18,630
Most problematic here. Exactly.

380
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:22,349
People with respiratory diseases you bed may be more likely to be smokers.

381
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:27,330
This is why they have a respiratory disease, because smoking also causes respiratory diseases.

382
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:32,220
So which cells might be under or overrepresented?

383
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:42,780
On this table. By doing that. Chances are it controls people with the respiratory disease without anybody.

384
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:49,260
You smoke are going to be over represented here.

385
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:54,840
And if this was the case, look what would happen to the odds ratio?

386
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:59,030
No association. You would get the wrong answer.

387
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:14,850
Okay. This is also a very good one is is a case control study of coffee intake and pancreatic cancer.

388
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,550
This study was conducted by.

389
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:27,450
I think Brian McMahon and Demetrius, two couples, both of whom were chairs of epidemiology at Harvard quite some time ago.

390
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:35,460
And he got published in the New England Journal of Medicine. But then it became a bit of an example of a bit of a problem.

391
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:46,970
So if you do an appropriate selection of controls, exposure again is coffee in the right and the outcome is pancreatic cancer.

392
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:57,230
So investigators get a bunch of people with pancreatic cancer, do an adequate selection of controls of people without pancreatic cancer,

393
00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:02,900
and they compared the coffee intake between the cases and the controls.

394
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:08,360
And this is what they would find. A note ratio of one.

395
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:14,170
There is no association whatsoever between coffee intake and pancreatic cancer.

396
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:18,890
But in my mind and to study.

397
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:28,860
The controls were patients hospitalized by the same gastroenterologist for other diseases,

398
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:32,740
the same gastroenterologist who was treating the pancreatic cancer.

399
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:40,790
They use this sort of that clinic, that gastroenterology clinic.

400
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:48,770
To select controls who did not have pancreatic cancer, but obviously must have had some other gastrointestinal issues.

401
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:53,940
What might be a problem with that source of controls?

402
00:53:54,690 --> 00:54:08,440
Yes, Maria. Coffee intake may be lower in the people who don't have pancreatic cancer, but are also in a gastroenterologist clinic like.

403
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:16,879
Right. You know, coffee can give you gastrointestinal symptoms.

404
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,860
And chances are the doctor, the gastroenterologist has told these people with coffee.

405
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:29,150
Right. Coffee can give you GERD Gastro is sort of ideal reflux disease.

406
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:37,570
And, you know, some other symptoms. So which cell might be over or underrepresented if that were the case?

407
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:47,880
The unexposed controls may be overrepresented.

408
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:53,160
There might be more controls. Who do not drink coffee.

409
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:58,610
As there would be otherwise if this election had been a.

410
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:04,330
So you see in this and then you would get the wrong answer.

411
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:11,650
You would get the ratio of four and would assume that, hmm, coffee intake is associated with pancreatic cancer.

412
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:17,890
When is really not. Are you seeing this because your selection of controls was inadequate?

413
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:32,180
Okay. This is just for you to think about and share your thoughts with the class.

414
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:40,100
In a case control study of socioeconomic status as the exposure and aplastic anemia as the outcome.

415
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,960
So cases with people with aplastic anemia, which is a terrible hematological disorder.

416
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:50,110
They controls where people referred to.

417
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:56,540
Oh. The cases where those refer to University Hospital.

418
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:06,590
So typical university. Case Control study, researchers go to the hematology service and pick people with aplastic anemia named for contrast.

419
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:09,700
They selected people living around the hospital.

420
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:14,780
That was the source of controls. Any potential problems with this?

421
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:34,309
Right. You may not you may not guarantee that people living around the hospital represent the same socioeconomic

422
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:44,270
status distribution of the larger pool of controls from which the anemia aplastic anemia cases arose.

423
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:51,320
You cannot be certain. Who lives around the University Hospital here in Ann Arbor.

424
00:56:54,690 --> 00:57:02,879
Yeah. Lots of students. And, you know, I guess, you know, students that might be a lot of variability this year of students,

425
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:12,030
but they may not necessarily represent the larger pool of controls from which aplastic anemia cases ended up at University Hospital.

426
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:24,969
Okay. In a population based case control study OC population base case control study offer of oral contraceptives

427
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:34,240
does the exposure and breast cancer does the outcome controls included a few nuns and women with two ligation.

428
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:43,150
Nuns are women who devote themselves to religious life and renounce sex.

429
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:50,590
They never have sex. The only problem with that.

430
00:57:54,890 --> 00:58:05,890
Emily. You represent the unexposed who are women who do not take oral contraceptives?

431
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:17,100
Okay. This is a population based case control study.

432
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:22,410
That means. Controls.

433
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:28,750
Whereas random sample. Overpopulation.

434
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:39,870
If it's a random sample of a population in which.

435
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:54,350
One per thousand women are nuns. In your controls, you'd have one man for every thousand controls.

436
00:58:56,170 --> 00:59:05,459
In the underlying population. Those 1000 names will probably not be on oral contraceptives because they are not having sex anyway.

437
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:14,610
And, you know, that tends to be the primary motivation. And what would be the.

438
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:23,640
Distribution of exposure in your set of controls. The same.

439
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:50,649
So in this case, it's actually not a problem. Well, that is possible.

440
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:56,770
But again, the important thing here is that we need a population based case control study.

441
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:05,230
The idea is that you pick controls randomly exactly in proportion to everything that is happening in the underlying population.

442
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:09,560
Primarily the exposure and everything else.

443
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:18,700
So in that case, you know, it is very unlikely, unless you are just unlucky perhaps, and you random procedure doesn't work as well.

444
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:28,630
It is very unlikely that you will get a very biased sample of of controls that at the end actually don't represent that the population of.

445
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:34,460
In terms of exposure. The key here is population based.

446
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:39,019
Right. Yes.

447
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:44,720
And with double issues, they will just be proportionally represented in your set of controls.

448
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:50,890
My exposure status in the same way as the underlying source of controls.

449
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:59,370
Okay. So those those were examples on the issue of selection of controls.

450
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:05,200
Now let's go through a few examples on the issue of assessing exposure.

451
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:12,770
Using memory. So this is a case control study of.

452
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:23,809
Cleft defects, cleft are congenital defects of lack of closure of the midline, that of the face.

453
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:27,710
Typically that happened very early during the.

454
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:34,690
During pregnancy. No like cleft palate or cleft lip.

455
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:44,860
And the exposure was whether the mother got colds, the common cold during pregnancy.

456
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:56,850
So people got a bunch of, you know. Mums who had babies with cleft defects.

457
01:01:56,870 --> 01:02:09,020
Those were the cases. And then the let's a adequately bunch of moms it kids who did not have left as controls and then they asked them.

458
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,010
Do you read? Did you have many?

459
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:21,160
Common cause when you were pregnant. Let's assume it's a well-defined question.

460
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:25,790
Where do you find exposure? What do you think will happen?

461
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:32,810
Who do you think? Do you think that that both groups women with babies.

462
01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:37,360
With a congenital malformation and women without will.

463
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:43,210
Remember. Having. Calls with the same accuracy.

464
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:52,600
Okay. You're shaking your head. So what do you expect, Jamie?

465
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:57,700
It has important issues in properly thinking about.

466
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:10,290
Exactly. The women who go the baby with the cleft unit, that is an extremely traumatic experience.

467
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:18,810
And you bet those poor women are going to be thinking and thinking and really thinking, why did I do wrong or what could have ever happened to me?

468
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:26,950
Do you know, for this to have happened? So they might, in fact, remember more calls than.

469
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:35,910
Women who did not go through this traumatic experience is actually has an interesting name is called rumination bias.

470
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:42,480
It calls them ruminants. You know who ruminants are were ruminants marks.

471
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:52,080
Yeah, you're right. They are. I mean, that's the new trend similar to what's that brings us back to.

472
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:59,360
Close by five times. Exactly. ROSE But yeah, that's that's what it is.

473
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:04,280
So in this case, it refers to thinking and rethinking and going back.

474
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:10,550
And by going back so many times, you may end up planting memories in yourself.

475
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:13,410
Right. Roaming and base, sort of.

476
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:23,930
So if if there was no ruminant bias and you had a good sort of highly valued way of assessing exposure, you would have no association at all.

477
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:28,520
But because women had to.

478
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:41,220
Recall and recall and recall. You know, the exposed cases might be overrepresented.

479
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:45,050
Women because women who had a baby with a cleft.

480
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:54,270
May recall falsely, perhaps, that they had more calls than women who did not have a baby with a cleft.

481
01:04:57,060 --> 01:05:03,810
So you may get the wrong answer. You may think that there was a positive association when in fact, there was not.

482
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:11,820
All right. Any questions on that or any?

483
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:22,240
Questions on case control. Within clear.

484
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:29,190
You ready to conduct a case control study with adequate selection of controls?

485
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:35,410
Of. So now we will discuss a different design.

486
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:42,490
He's somehow in the family of case control studies, but really belongs to a branch called Case Only Studies.

487
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:46,570
And this is really mindblowing is a beautiful new.

488
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:54,690
Okay. Uses spatial design to study acute exposures, in other words.

489
01:05:56,310 --> 01:06:05,040
Triggering events, triggering events within an acute acute exposure within a relatively short time can trigger the outcome.

490
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:12,390
An investigator wishes to study the effect of an acute exposure that varies over time and

491
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:18,900
that produces a transient change in risk of an acute event within a short be triggered.

492
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:28,350
Now the examples gone about of vigorous exercise trigger the rupture of an aneurysm.

493
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:35,210
You know. With winter coming up and all that snow we have to blow.

494
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:43,770
This is very relevant. There is no blowing through a myocardial infarction.

495
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:52,200
Believe it or not, these have been actually studies that have been conducted and we have answers for this.

496
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:58,280
Can traffic related air pollution trigger an asthma attack?

497
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:05,500
And having unusually little night's sleep result in a migraine attack the next day.

498
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:12,920
So let's develop that last example.

499
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:22,950
Having an unusual and usually short. Sleep during a night and the beginning of a.

500
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:34,620
Migraine attack. This design is called the case crossover and again, it only requires cases.

501
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:40,439
In this example, we only require people who get an acute migraine attack.

502
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:45,329
So I'm going to remove everybody who's not a case from this schematic and

503
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:50,640
assume that only those with a full circle represent people who go the median.

504
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:56,760
Right. And we. So how is this study conducted?

505
01:07:56,770 --> 01:08:01,120
I mean, you must be wondering. Well, you know, you always have to compare exposed versus unexposed.

506
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:05,530
So how are you going to assess exposure here if you only have cases?

507
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:14,340
While you assess exposure to different exposure periods within the same.

508
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:18,800
People for each case. And that's when you compare.

509
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:27,270
So let's measure exposure level immediately before the event within the same short time window for all.

510
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:31,290
So let's say if we suspect that.

511
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:38,380
The period that's critical and that triggers a migraine attack is not sleeping.

512
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:43,330
For at least 8 hours during the night before we are going to assess.

513
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:48,980
The duration of his leave the night before. Am I going to attack for everyone?

514
01:08:52,020 --> 01:09:02,930
So. The circle immediately prior to the full circle represents that critical time window.

515
01:09:04,290 --> 01:09:18,440
When we suspect the trigger might happen. Having a red circle right before the full circle means that person slept less than 8 hours.

516
01:09:19,870 --> 01:09:28,810
Doing that really the night prior to having a blue circle means the person being they'll have an unusually short.

517
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:38,060
Sleeping. Then we need some comparison.

518
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:44,720
So we are going to measure the usual exposure level.

519
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:50,360
For each person, typically during a different window.

520
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:59,890
So there are, you know, in practical terms, if you are to do a case because there are different ways of measuring what's usually.

521
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:06,080
But for the sake of simplicity here, we are going to assume that.

522
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:19,290
The amount of sleep during the first night, meaning two nights prior to the event, represents what each person would usually sleep right?

523
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:35,260
So I have done that here. And people who appear in blue are those who usually do not sleep less than 8 hours.

524
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:40,480
People who appear in red are those who usually sleep less than 8 hours.

525
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:48,530
Okay. Now.

526
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:52,940
The comparison, though, as you may anticipate.

527
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:03,040
Requires. Only people who differ.

528
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:10,870
In their acute exposure status and their usual exposure status.

529
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:18,820
The people who had the same exposure status usually and right before the event are not informing.

530
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:27,300
Now this person, for example. Had little sleep usually, and little asleep right before the event.

531
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:32,790
So we cannot gain any information from that person.

532
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:42,130
So you have to exclude those people and leave only those with what's called discordant exposure levels.

533
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:50,540
Discordant means that usual exposure is different from the exposure during that critical.

534
01:11:52,370 --> 01:12:02,890
Triggering happy. How do I know that?

535
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:15,110
Okay. So how do you how do I know I have gone back enough for this to represent my usual exposure?

536
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:23,180
I don't know. And again, I apologize. This may be too simplistic, but at the end generate more questions than it answers.

537
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:32,630
So in reality, what I would probably do is rather than focus on just the kind of random night before,

538
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:39,380
I would probably get an assessment of many nights before and take in others.

539
01:12:42,010 --> 01:12:45,100
So, you know, in this particular example, yeah, I don't know.

540
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:49,960
And it's probably, you know, it's probably relatively crappy way to as is usual exposure.

541
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:59,080
So it's a really good question. But in reality, yeah, there are different ways to define what's usual is very important.

542
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:02,080
Yeah, you have to get a really good idea of what's usual.

543
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:05,020
So yeah, well let's assume, you know,

544
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:12,730
just for the sake of the example that in this case these night does represent, usually just for the sake of this.

545
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:20,090
So I'm going to remove I'm going to focus on those who have discordant exposure to statins between the usual period and a trigger period.

546
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:23,930
And the odds ratio is calculated like this.

547
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:38,580
You basically. Half in the numerator, the people who were exposed during the critical triggering suspect period.

548
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:43,680
That means people who had a red circle right before the event,

549
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:54,510
they would be in the numerator three people and in the denominator would be people who were unexposed during day critical.

550
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:58,990
Suspect three getting serious. Only this person here.

551
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:07,890
Right. So because they are discordant, we get sort of the maximum contrast in exposure for everyone.

552
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:13,360
So for these people who aren't usually unexposed.

553
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:18,720
Being exposed takes them to the numerator.

554
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:25,740
For these people who are usually exposed being unexposed, they take them to the denominator.

555
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:40,370
And then the odds ratio on this case is three. So there is a positive association between having a short night's sleep during.

556
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:46,620
And I am having a. Make an attack the next day.

557
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:52,620
But this only works for exposures that.

558
01:14:53,910 --> 01:15:01,070
Have a short term acute effect. Okay.

559
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:06,100
See? Clear. Mysterious.

560
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:11,520
Were mysteriously clear of clearly mysterious.

561
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:16,790
Okay. So a few summary pointers.

562
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:21,290
Each case serves as its own control. That's so cool.

563
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:27,440
Because what you are comparing is. Exposure windows for each person.

564
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:34,480
The analytical unit is time exposure at a time just preceding the acute event,

565
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:40,150
which is you can think of it as the case time compared with some other time, you know, the usual.

566
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:46,910
Exposure time you can think of as a controlled. This.

567
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:49,860
That is very advantageous because you can.

568
01:15:51,220 --> 01:16:00,250
A sure exchange ability by any time fixed characteristics because the comparison is done within each person.

569
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:08,050
So for example, genetics. Is not a source of lack of exchange ability in this type of studies.

570
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:14,820
That's a huge advantage. Now there are some assumptions, of course,

571
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:24,390
like that the outcome doesn't have an undiagnosed stage that could affect the exposure because then you would have reverse causation possibly.

572
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:33,190
That the exposure doesn't have a cumulative effect because then you cannot assume only the acute triggering effect.

573
01:16:35,850 --> 01:16:41,580
And that there are in any other time inviting conditions that could cause non exchange ability.

574
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:46,500
So. Um. This is really good.

575
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:52,920
In the example of. Of a short night sleep and migraine.

576
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:59,940
What could be another time? Varying exposure that might cause non exchange ability.

577
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:08,360
So in other words, think of something that may happen hand in hand with a short sleep night.

578
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:13,210
And that might also trigger a migraine attack. Rachel.

579
01:17:14,470 --> 01:17:17,710
Okay. The midterm?

580
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:24,700
Yeah. Actually, I used to have this example with flanking the midterm.

581
01:17:24,910 --> 01:17:29,470
That was the outcome. But at some point, people told me, you know, that's kind of insensitive.

582
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:34,190
So. Right. So sorry.

583
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:43,410
Yeah, that's absolutely. Excellent example. I was thinking of a more sort of a happy days type example.

584
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:48,640
That. Yeah. Who said that? Yes. Excellent.

585
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:54,770
You know, there are certain beverages that that can trigger migraine attacks like, um.

586
01:17:56,550 --> 01:18:01,770
Sadly, yes, I'm. Whiskey, you know, scotch.

587
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:05,500
Bourbon. At.

588
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:12,800
So, yes, if you have you know, if people tend to enjoy I mean,

589
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:26,470
have these drinks together with your sleep mates and they also can cause a migraine attack, then you really don't know what was the actual cause.

590
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:33,930
So those are downvoting. Characteristics that are sources of non exchange abilities.

591
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:37,650
Right. All right?

592
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:40,840
Yeah, we made it. Any questions on.

593
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:47,370
On case crossover studies? No.

594
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:51,660
Okay. Let me quickly read your progress report because it's very meaty.

595
01:18:52,810 --> 01:19:00,090
Uh. And we have that. You learn to identify like something that I didn't write here.

596
01:19:00,090 --> 01:19:04,650
But I truly hope. And if is not the case, by all means, please reach out.

597
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:09,860
The difference between cohort studies and case control studies.

598
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:17,590
Going from exposure to outcome versus going from outcome to exposure, basically.

599
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:26,420
Right. Identified three possible strategies to design a case control studies according to selection of controls.

600
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:30,410
High density, dense incidence density or risk set.

601
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:35,290
Case cohort and cumulative.

602
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:40,890
And we went through each how to do it and why the issues are right.

603
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:50,170
Explain the relations with a cohort study. The first two typically done in closed cohort primary study bases nested.

604
01:19:51,730 --> 01:19:55,900
Incidence density odds ratio and bias estimate of incidence rate ratio.

605
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:58,910
His cohort was.
