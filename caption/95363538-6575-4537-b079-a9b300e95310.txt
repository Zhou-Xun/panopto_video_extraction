1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,821
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:08,740
This is the quick review video for the metabolism lecture.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,231
So we have two main mechanisms for protein breakdown.

4
00:00:11,231 --> 00:00:16,292
One of them is prosthesis which is specific to certain proteins that

5
00:00:16,292 --> 00:00:22,351
are marked by ubiquitous and this is mediated by either insulin inhibiting fox.

6
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:26,101
So which means that you would get less produced telesis.

7
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:29,158
So insulin promotes synthesis and thus it would make sense for

8
00:00:29,158 --> 00:00:31,740
insulin to be inhibiting protein synthesis.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,101
Or on the other hand you can have glucocorticoids activate fox.

10
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:41,003
So and increased Patel Asus because as we mentioned earlier

11
00:00:41,003 --> 00:00:44,450
glucocorticoids promote breakdown.

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,984
So basically prosthesis is regulated by either insulin inhibiting fox.

13
00:00:48,984 --> 00:00:52,781
And stopping paralysis or by glucocorticoids promoting fox.

14
00:00:52,781 --> 00:00:58,626
So and promoting paralysis and this is only for proteins, specific proteins.

15
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:04,239
To Fiji on the other hand is regulated by an activation of torque one.

16
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,780
So we did say that Emptor would promote synthesis.

17
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,827
And so if you inactivate Emptor only when you inactivate empty or

18
00:01:13,827 --> 00:01:18,691
will you be able to degrade huge organelles through Khafaji?

19
00:01:18,691 --> 00:01:23,432
So for example if you want to break down the full mitochondria then you

20
00:01:23,432 --> 00:01:26,540
would need a topic here.

21
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,784
So those are the signals we talked about earlier.

22
00:01:29,784 --> 00:01:34,444
Also another unknown mechanism by which you can lose muscle

23
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:36,510
mass is this use atrophy?

24
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:43,297
So the muscle the lean mass just gets atrophied if you're not using it and

25
00:01:43,297 --> 00:01:50,417
by the issues we mean it's absolutely someone is absolutely bad driven or

26
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:55,438
is not moving that specific part of their body at all.

27
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,831
So any excess amino assets they can feed into the amino acid pool.

28
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:02,730
We do not have a storage system for them.

29
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,829
Also if you want to get rid of excess amino acids,

30
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:09,780
you can use the carbon skeleton that feeds into the TCA cycle.

31
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,140
Or you get glucose from it.

32
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,771
So energy is a T say cycle.

33
00:02:14,771 --> 00:02:17,281
Or if it's glucose genic then it can go and

34
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:20,170
make glucose depending on your body's needs.

35
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,201
And then you get rid of the ammonia groups through the urea cycle which we'll talk

36
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:26,540
more about.

37
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,581
So when would I mean assets become glucose rather than energy.

38
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:31,970
It really depends on your body's needs at the moment.

39
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:37,522
If you're undergoing let's say Laconia genesis and urine deliver then

40
00:02:37,522 --> 00:02:43,640
it would make more sense that the amino acids would become glucose for example.

41
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,812
And then on the flip side if you need energy to running a marathon then

42
00:02:48,812 --> 00:02:57,040
it would make more sense that those amino acids yield energy for example.

43
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,180
So this is what I said, the carbon skeleton can feed into the TSA cycle or

44
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,881
it can become glucose upstream and the immuno group will go into that urea cycle.

45
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:09,885
And this is the only way we can get rid of the immuno group, which is really

46
00:03:09,885 --> 00:03:14,219
important in the area cycle because if you do not get rid of the immuno group then

47
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:19,940
you'll get ammonia build up in your system and that is highly toxic.

48
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,311
Okay, why should be ch metabolism be controlled?

49
00:03:22,311 --> 00:03:27,415
So we said that BCAS branch chain amino acids which are essential amino acids,

50
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:32,080
Lucy nice solution and violence are very highly available in our diet.

51
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,002
But we use them up so quickly in the body that they end up being at the lowest

52
00:03:37,002 --> 00:03:39,940
levels and the body as free amino acids.

53
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:47,040
And so we need to make sure that we do not lose them because they are very critical.

54
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,831
And so the main regulated step in branch chain amino assad metabolism.

55
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:56,121
And it's the BCKTh enzyme.

56
00:03:56,121 --> 00:04:01,022
So it's Andy hydrogenated that's tightly regulated to ensure that we

57
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:06,940
do not lose Lucien valine and I solution unless we absolutely have to.

58
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,281
And all the amino acids will talk more about it.

59
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:10,850
All of those branch chain amino acids.

60
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:16,589
They use B cat as the first enzymatic reaction, it's a trans am in its reaction.

61
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,740
And then they all use BCKDH as well.

62
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,467
So maple syrup, urine disease is basically

63
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:27,999
the inability to metabolize the lucian I solution and

64
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:33,651
failing due to either a deficiency or a complete mutation NBC KDH.

65
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:37,703
Which as we mentioned is really important for

66
00:04:37,703 --> 00:04:41,770
metabolizing I solution Lucien and valine.

67
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,730
And if someone has maple syrup urine disease then

68
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:49,291
they really need to be careful about their dietary and take a french chain.

69
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:53,361
I mean assets because their body cannot efficiently metabolize them.

70
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:56,640
And then if they build up in the body then that could be very toxic.

71
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,541
Especially for kids and SUVs and inborn error of metabolism.

72
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:05,940
So there's a screening for it at birth.

73
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:12,703
So this is what we just mentioned BCKDH is the most controlled step over here.

74
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:14,661
It's inhibited by phosphor relation.

75
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:19,820
So if BCKDH is phosphor related, it means it will be inactive.

76
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,723
And then if it's defrost related then it becomes active and

77
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:33,840
you get more metabolism and breakdown of pollution I solution and valley.

78
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,630
So here we will talk about glutamine.

79
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,029
So it breaks down chloramine and to glutamate and

80
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:47,481
it will release an ammonia of course because glutamine has to ammonia.

81
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:51,839
And the show making glutamate and then you will be releasing one of the ammonia

82
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,640
groups and holding onto the other one.

83
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,236
So we did say that for cancer treatments it's

84
00:05:59,236 --> 00:06:03,881
been shown that a lot of glutamine is becoming glutamate.

85
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:10,300
And then that glutamate over here can feed into the TCA cycle and yield more energy.

86
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,953
And so for cancer cells this is definitely advantageous

87
00:06:14,953 --> 00:06:20,007
because they can get another energy source from glutamine.

88
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:26,032
So some therapeutic procedures.

89
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:33,580
Not procedures really it's some therapies are targeting glutamine is activity and

90
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,044
trying to inhibit the conversion of glutamine and

91
00:06:38,044 --> 00:06:45,140
to glutamate to kind of starve the cancer cells and prevent their growth.

92
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,640
It's an active area of drug development.

93
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,861
Okay so we did say earlier many degradation paths lead to glutamate.

94
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:56,942
We also said that a glutamate part IX and so many trans

95
00:06:56,942 --> 00:07:01,441
emanates reactions which go both way in either direction of the reactions.

96
00:07:01,441 --> 00:07:07,340
So you really can get good it through so many different ways.

97
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:14,040
One of the ways besides the trans am in its reactions is GDH activity over here.

98
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:19,164
So GDH activity over here would promote glutamate

99
00:07:19,164 --> 00:07:23,450
breakdown into alpha key to obliterate.

100
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,921
So this is not a trans emanates reaction.

101
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:29,540
This is a one way reaction through GDH.

102
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,608
So remember how I said we earlier in a previous video how we lost

103
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:41,440
the endogenous ability to make glutamate from Al Faqih to obliterate directly.

104
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,920
This is exactly the reaction I'm talking about this reaction and

105
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,451
the human body cannot go to the left.

106
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:52,050
We cannot make glutamate from Al Faqih to obliterate.

107
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,271
We can only break down glutamate into al faqih to obliterate.

108
00:07:56,271 --> 00:07:59,490
So in the human body this reaction is only a one way reaction.

109
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,015
Whereas implants they can go in the opposite direction and

110
00:08:04,015 --> 00:08:08,647
synthesized glutamate from only Al Faqih to collaborate.

111
00:08:08,647 --> 00:08:12,083
So anyways that was a tangent anyways.

112
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:15,701
So we have GDH over here which is the D glutamate.

113
00:08:15,701 --> 00:08:20,720
Di hydrogen is that would the hydrogenated glutamate into alphabetic literate.

114
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,670
It is usually inhibited by search for.

115
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:29,730
So search for would inhibit GDH and prevent glutamate usage.

116
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:37,280
On the other hand after Kwan inhibits third for signal over here.

117
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,656
And so if you have an inhibition on search for it and search for would not be able to

118
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:47,891
inhibit GDH and basically double negatives you get a positive effect on GDH.

119
00:08:47,891 --> 00:08:51,851
So emptor would promote GDH activity by

120
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:56,771
inhibiting search for and search for by itself.

121
00:08:56,771 --> 00:09:01,840
Usually would have reduced the GDH activity by inhibiting it.

122
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,803
So the question over here saying that usually we that Emptor

123
00:09:06,803 --> 00:09:12,063
would increase to the h activity by inhibiting straight for and

124
00:09:12,063 --> 00:09:18,840
also we did say that Emptor is usually very important and for protein synthesis.

125
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,726
So when we're talking about the glutamate becoming al faqih to obliterate

126
00:09:23,726 --> 00:09:27,936
in a one way reaction then it's kind of metabolizing glutamate and

127
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:29,160
breaking it down.

128
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,978
And this only happens when Emptor knows that you

129
00:09:32,978 --> 00:09:37,840
have very huge amounts of amino acids that you cannot use.

130
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,030
So Enter would promote synthesis naturally.

131
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,350
Yes only.

132
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,952
So it would be promoting synthesis and also getting rid of the excess

133
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:50,681
glutamate that you have and that you will not be using.

134
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:53,416
So it would be doing both at the same time.

135
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:56,940
Only to get rid of the spillovers Kind of.

136
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,691
So enter is promoting synthesis.

137
00:09:58,691 --> 00:10:04,614
Think of it as you can draw a line over here and say it's promoting synthesis but

138
00:10:04,614 --> 00:10:10,201
also whatever extras that remain in your pool needs to be metabolized.

139
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:15,988
And this is how amateur gets rid of only the extras area cycle,

140
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:20,217
best way to get rid of ammonia and it occurs and

141
00:10:20,217 --> 00:10:27,140
deliver because we have Argenis over here.

142
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,971
Okay so the urea cycle is regulated by nag.

143
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:35,811
So whenever you have increased levels of nag that would send

144
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:41,420
a positive feedback to carbon mobile phosphate sympathies over here.

145
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,150
So it would promote the whole activity activity of the urea cycle basically.

146
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:50,625
And nag is increased in response to his

147
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:55,501
response to glutamate levels as still CO A.

148
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:56,851
Levels and arginine levels.

149
00:10:56,851 --> 00:11:02,629
Whenever those three are up or one of them is up, a nag would be increased and

150
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:07,401
then nag would send a positive feedback to carbon levels in two

151
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:12,013
days over here to promote the efficiency of the area cycle.

152
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:16,650
So this makes sense over here when we say that coogan and glucocorticoids increase

153
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,951
your cycle efficiency because they promote metabolism.

154
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:23,838
So breakdown of protein every time you break down the protein you will get

155
00:11:23,838 --> 00:11:28,298
ammonia group and that ammonia group needs to go somewhere so you always need to make

156
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:32,332
sure if you're breaking down protein that you're a cycle is functional.

157
00:11:32,332 --> 00:11:34,460
Or else it will build up in the body.

158
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,560
On the other hand, insulin promotes synthesis.

159
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,858
So it would minimize breakdown of protein and

160
00:11:40,858 --> 00:11:46,000
this means that you will have less ammonia groups floating around.

161
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,162
So it would reduce the efficiency of the area cycle because if you're not losing

162
00:11:50,162 --> 00:11:52,411
an ammonia group then you do not need that.

163
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:56,240
You're a cycle too metabolize it.

164
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,577
So you're a cycle uses for a TPS.

165
00:11:58,577 --> 00:12:01,490
So those are two steps in the area cycle.

166
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:07,040
So to get rid of every ammonia group you will always be needing for ATPS.

167
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,940
So this is always a net loss of 4 8 p over here, yep.

168
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,301
Anyways carbon skeletons.

169
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:18,008
So this is how you get rid of the amino group and then the rest of

170
00:12:18,008 --> 00:12:21,934
the peptide carbon skeleton can go into the TCA cycle over here or

171
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:28,040
you can get glucose depending on the body's needs.

172
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,910
So this would come in handy again to know which ones are ketogenic, double L.

173
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,310
And which ones are both the PITT.

174
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,831
And then everything else is good.

175
00:12:36,831 --> 00:12:39,121
Hygienic energy production.

176
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:43,865
So we did this in their view session.

177
00:12:43,865 --> 00:12:48,773
So if we say that an amino acid feeds into the TCA cycle,

178
00:12:48,773 --> 00:12:53,540
okay let's say something feeds in over here.

179
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,320
Okay so this is an example of some simple mouth.

180
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,336
So if I ask you to get the ATPS for

181
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:05,840
a certain amino acid that feeds into the TSA cycle over here.

182
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,970
So what you would need to do is calculate how much energy is produced

183
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,320
from the downstream pathway which would be one FATH.

184
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,451
And one NADH.

185
00:13:14,451 --> 00:13:18,970
So that's 2.5 plus 1.5 80 P.

186
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,841
And that would be the net 80 P.

187
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:24,967
Yield that you get from the oxidation of an amino acid that feeds into the TCA

188
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:26,040
cycle over here.

189
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,101
Let's say an amino acid tweets into the TSA cycle over here.

190
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:34,640
So right from the start then it would yield the full 1080 p.

191
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,451
That the TCA cycle provides.

192
00:13:36,451 --> 00:13:41,920
So any acetyl coa a that goes through the TSA cycle fully will yield 10 80 P.

193
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,040
And you can just go through the mass math.

194
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,101
So basically how do we get the 1080 p.

195
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:50,311
It's by looking at by adding the energy up.

196
00:13:50,311 --> 00:13:56,981
So 2.5 plus 2.55 Plus 2.5 plus 1.5 plus 1 80 p.

197
00:13:56,981 --> 00:13:57,770
Over here.

198
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,000
So this would give you an at 80 PF 10.

199
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,543
So just whenever you're thinking of calculation,

200
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,641
just add up the NADHS and GTPS.

201
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:11,240
And FADH keep in mind that everyone NADH is equivalent to 2.5 80 p.

202
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,541
Everyone FADH two is equivalent to 1.58 ep.

203
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:18,140
And every GTP is equivalent to an 80 p.

204
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,027
And that's it.
