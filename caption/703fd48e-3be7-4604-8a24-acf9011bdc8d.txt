1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:03,670
Hi everyone, my name is Krystal Forbes.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:09,340
I use she/her pronouns, and I'm one of the career counselors at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,380
I wish that we were meeting in person because I find these activities and resources to be so fun and helpful,

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,590
particularly with our FPHLP summer program students.

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:23,890
Today, we're gonna be talking about how to make your resume stand out amongst a competitive pool of applicants.

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,480
As a heads up, every career counselor will give you slightly different advice depending on their

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,860
field expertise and where their positioned, either in the country or in the world.

8
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:38,060
This advice is what we would give to any of our students, from undergrads to post-doctoral fellows,

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,630
and we hope that you can take it with for what it is,

10
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:47,280
but also consult your local career services team to find out their specific pieces of advice and opinions.

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:56,300
So let's get started. An important thing to think about when you're preparing your resume, is are you preparing a resume or a CV?

12
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,900
Also known as a curriculum vitae. As a note,

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:05,480
this presentation will be focused mainly on the resume in a U.S. context. Abroad,

14
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,470
a CV may be used as a synonym for a resume and they might be the same thing,

15
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:16,850
so you want to make sure that you're really making sure that the context is appropriate for the document that you're preparing. A resume,

16
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:21,680
in this case, is typically a one page document because undergraduates have a single degree,

17
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,170
and for each degree you can typically get about a page, up to two full pages.

18
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,850
The focus of a resume is to think about the skills that you've gained based on experiences

19
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:36,650
or tasks that you've completed, and is meant to be a snapshot of your relevant experience,

20
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,670
not a full scope or overview of all the things that you've done.

21
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:48,360
So with that in mind, let's continue on. A resume is something that an employer is going to look at to make sure that you have the

22
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,880
skills and qualifications or achievements to do the job that they're asking you to do.

23
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,190
Typically, it will not include anything that is considered a protected identity category here in the U.S.

24
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:04,470
So this includes marital status, age, race, gender or religion.

25
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,640
Again, if you're applying outside of the U.S. context, we will want to make sure that we're including this information,

26
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,500
if it is an expected part of the application process.

27
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:23,100
So an employer will be looking for a document that is well organized, neat, accurate and has a focused style.

28
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,210
Most employers will only look at a document for about 30 to 60 seconds,

29
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:33,810
and that's pretty generous. Sometimes it's just looking at the document, flipping it over and making a choice.

30
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:40,740
So that is why we're going to begin with looking at the formatting and structure of a resume to make sure that the information is appealing,

31
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:47,380
to invite the reader to continue reading.

32
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:55,420
But before we do that, a quick note about bias, there's been a lot of research done, particularly by Sonia Kang, who has identified that,

33
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:04,470
"whitening of a resume and application materials definitely is a process that happens". About 50 percent

34
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:12,400
ethnic sounding names are about 50 percent less likely to be called back for an interview,

35
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:22,510
and this may also be influenced by listing activities such as hobbies, identity based student groups and religious based identifications.

36
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:28,390
Remember, this goes with those protected categories that we mentioned just a few minutes earlier.

37
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:36,040
The research was presented in the context of employers that have statements promoting diversity,

38
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,690
equity and inclusion. However, the actions did not quite align with that.

39
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:46,930
This does not mean that our office recommends changing who you are, your experiences or your names.

40
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:53,410
We do want you to recognize that it happens, and have it as a potential consideration for you, as the applicant,

41
00:03:53,410 --> 00:04:01,120
as a way to screen employers for both their inclusivity and their protection of identity based groups.

42
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,040
So we would encourage you to have specific conversations with trusted advisers,

43
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:11,080
faculty members or people who care about your career to find out what should or

44
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:17,290
can you do to promote your status as an applicant within

45
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:25,660
a company, while also maintaining those strong identity characteristics that make you who you are.

46
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:33,430
All right, so moving on to formatting. This next slide is one of my favorite slides that I've ever created in career development at the university.

47
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:41,210
So here we go. No templates. I hope you all know Edna Mode from The Incredibles, from Disney and Pixar.

48
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,680
She is a fashion icon and superhero role model. And she has this rule,

49
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,670
no capes.

50
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:54,320
It is a strong, firm rule that she presents in all of her designs. For us here in career development at the University Michigan School of Public Health,

51
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:01,010
we have the same strong, firm belief that you should never be using a formatted template for your resume.

52
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,720
The reason for this is because it often does not translate well to updates.

53
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:13,880
For example, I created my first resume using a template in Microsoft Word 1998. When I started this job four years ago,

54
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:20,000
I tried to open it up as an example of something to not use and it literally wouldn't open.

55
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,580
Another reason that we don't want to use this is because public health is a very traditional field that promotes

56
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:31,880
accessibility for both the way that a document is formatted and the type of technologies that it uses.

57
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:38,220
Templates are not friendly for many of our accessibility tools, like an iReader or a translator,

58
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:47,140
and they can be very difficult to translate into things like Braille. So for your own benefit and for the benefit of the reader, no templates.

59
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:52,300
Thinking about how to structure it, though, is a very important component of your resume.

60
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,610
The next thing that we will be looking at is the two documents, one on the left and one on the right.

61
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:02,470
These are two different ways to structure resume. One you will see as paragraph form on the left,

62
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:08,530
the one on the right has bullet points. This was a study that was done using eye tracking technology.

63
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,550
The blue is places where the eye rested for a brief second.

64
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,530
The yellow is where the eye rested for a little bit longer or returned to multiple times.

65
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,580
And then the red is where the eye most frequently took in the information.

66
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,580
You will note that the paragraph base document on the left has some scattering of eye touching,

67
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,290
especially the top, where the reader tried really hard to take in the information.

68
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:37,540
Then it kind of slows down until we get to that bigger red dot on the bottom

69
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,040
right hand corner of the paper where there's literally nothing in the screen.

70
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:49,030
Paragraphs are really hard to skim, they're hard to take in information, and it can often be difficult to give a quick summary in that

71
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:55,330
quick look, look, make a decision type of format, which is sometimes what happens with resumes.

72
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:00,250
You will also note that there is literally no eye touching at the bottom of this document.

73
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:05,110
If you only have one page to make a strong case about your skills and qualifications for the job,

74
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:13,360
we highly recommend against the paragraph form because you are missing a strong opportunity to give scannable relatable information,

75
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:21,340
and that whole bottom quarter of the page is missed. Comparatively, the document on the right has a much wider range,

76
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:28,900
you can see that there is eye touching literally all over the document. There is good attention paid to the different headers,

77
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,880
the top of each section, and then particularly at the education at the bottom.

78
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:39,580
We here at the University Michigan School of Public Health highly recommend that you move your education to the top.

79
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:45,430
Most often, this will be the strongest qualifier you have to get the position that you're applying for. In public health,

80
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:55,030
we really value specific type of training and exposure, and this could be the door that you were looking for, for your exposition.

81
00:07:55,030 --> 00:10:59,550
Next, we have a quick video to give some summative information that I will dive in deeper a little bit later.

82
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,350
All right. I hope you enjoyed that animated video as much as I liked making it.

83
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,240
We think that it is a great way to capture the information and something that you can return to later on

84
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,790
if you just need a quick, three minute refresher on how to structure your document.

85
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:17,960
But let's look at the specific components. First, a quick review.

86
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:26,120
We would note that size is really important. Font sizes should be no smaller than ten point and no larger than twelve point.

87
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,700
This allows us to give a good amount of white space without overwhelming the reader.

88
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,180
The size does depend on the different type of font that you're using.

89
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:40,520
For example, Garamond is a very tiny font and looks very similar to Times New Roman,

90
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:46,520
but when you make it size 10, Times New Roman is often much more reabdale than Garamond.

91
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,900
We want to make sure that this document is single spaced and has no columns.

92
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:57,770
As we'll discuss a little bit later, the columns are very, very difficult for a computer based system to read.

93
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:02,750
We want to make sure that, again, we're making our document as accessible as possible to all types of readers,

94
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:09,110
and this includes online documents submissions. So another firm rule, no columns.

95
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:18,920
A good standard amount of white space around the edges is about one inch, though sometimes we often see students making it smaller with

96
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,850
0.75 inches on the side. For you as undergraduate students,

97
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:30,410
we recommend having one page and making sure that the document is very consistently formatted.

98
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,060
Some specifics about the document header. Of course, this document should have your name on it,

99
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,060
it's your application. It should be proud, large,

100
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:46,790
and in the center or at the very top of your document. There are few questions that we regularly get about names, which is how should I format them?

101
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,870
This is really whatever you are comfortable with and how you're going to present yourself.

102
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,370
Some people don't go by their given name and so it's important for them to include a nickname.

103
00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:04,550
Some people want to include their middle name as a part of their identity and or include a different translation or an American name on their resume.

104
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:09,680
Again, this is completely up to you and how you feel comfortable presenting yourself and how you're going to be

105
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:16,700
using this document to either screen or qualify employers based on your different identity statuses.

106
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,410
A newer structure that some people are also including on their resumes, is to add their pronouns.

107
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,400
This is to normalize the idea that not all people present as the same as what

108
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:31,100
their pronouns are, and to normalize the practice of not making that assumption.

109
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:37,190
So, again, it's up to you to include this, and we encourage you to look around to see how other people are doing it.

110
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:43,730
Another item that is in fluctuation and change, particularly in our virtual world, is the addition of an address. Formally,

111
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:49,610
this was absolutely something that you needed to add, either your current or permanent addresses.

112
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,930
Today, we don't even have to include it.

113
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:58,220
But if you want to, you can also just choose to add the city and state of either your permanent or current address.

114
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:03,260
So, again, this is completely up to you whether to include part of it or nothing at all.

115
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:08,480
Two components that you definitely want to add, though, are your email address and your phone number.

116
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,150
In both cases, we want to make sure that these pieces of contact information reflect who you are as a professional.

117
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:18,020
So you'll want to check your voicemail to make sure that it either says your name or a

118
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,580
restatement of your phone number so that the person who's calling can confirm that it's you.

119
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:27,770
And for your email address, you want to make sure that it represents who you are as a professional.

120
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:34,770
That can include either your name at an open source like gmail or it your school email address, a

121
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:43,800
.edu. An additional component that could help you stand out, and include additional information in your resume is to include a LinkedIn handle.

122
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,440
One thing that you'll want to be careful about if you are adding this, is to first make sure that your LinkedIn is up to date.

123
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,790
And second, to make sure that you have customized the handle so that it doesn't have like

124
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:59,680
the "786_!124" after your name.

125
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:07,100
And so the way that you can do that is by following this link and checking out the options for customizing your URL.

126
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,740
So now that you have your documents set up, we will move on to the education.

127
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:17,490
Again, this is something that we recommend you have at the top of your document as it is the primary gatekeeper for most positions.

128
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:22,950
You will note that the type of information we include is the institution name, a spelled out degree,

129
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:27,390
potentially the location, though not something that is mandatory,

130
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:33,240
and the graduation date. A particular note here is that the graduation date in your education section is

131
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,440
one inconsistency that we will recommend you have in a resume

132
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:45,390
document. Our experience sections will recommend that you have a range of dates.

133
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:50,700
However, in the education section, you just want to include the end date.

134
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,920
And if it's something that is upcoming, you can choose to have the word candidate after your degree title,

135
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:05,160
or you can add the word expected or anticipated before the degree title or the degree end date. Of note, in the education section

136
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,050
we only want to list experiences that result in a degree or a certification.

137
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:17,220
Some common things that we see that we wouldn't recommend would be to list a study abroad separately from the degree of which it was a part of.

138
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,050
So you'll note on this example,

139
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:26,790
we have this "Participated in the Paris Study Abroad" underneath the University of Chicago experience and the date that it happened.

140
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:34,770
It should be summative information about the study abroad or the experience that is included within the education section, but not its own entrance.

141
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:41,430
Another thing that we could see among our students is that a student transferred from one institution from the other.

142
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:46,110
There is a strong bias, unfounded, in my opinion, against transfer students.

143
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,510
And so we would caution you against listing this.

144
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:56,050
And maybe if you do want to note it, to include it as a bullet point underneath the degree in which you intend on completing.

145
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:01,740
A pro tip, some positions will require that you add a GPA. If you're doing this,

146
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:07,530
make sure that you're adding a scale to indicate what the grading component was.

147
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,950
There are places that don't use out of 4.0., you might be one of them,

148
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,580
and there are additional places that might not even use a scale at all.

149
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:19,650
So you want to make sure that you're including this information to set the context for the reader.

150
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:26,930
A way to save space in the future, if you're finding that one page isn't quite enough to fit all of your experience would be to also include awards,

151
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:33,840
honors and other components of your degree as a part of the bullet points that are underneath this section.

152
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:43,020
Again, if you have questions, I recommend talking to your advisers and or career staff professional at your home institution.

153
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,350
Here's a snapshot of what the experience sections could look like.

154
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:53,310
You'll notice that we have the same type of formatting consistently between our education sections and our experience sections.

155
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:59,280
In this case, we have the organization name, a job title, the location, and the dates of employment.

156
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,940
You will also note that there is some tailoring with the way that we have listed the headers,

157
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,670
so research experience and project management.

158
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:10,120
This is something that we'll definitely be talking about in the upcoming video about how to write great bullet points,

159
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:16,830
but I did want to draw your attention to the way that it could be done. Some additional notes.

160
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:21,240
Again, we strongly, strongly, strongly encourage the use of bullet points.

161
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,470
A thing to remember about bullet points is that they should have some type of indentation from

162
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:30,300
the start of the line to the symbol, and then between the symbol and the start of the text.

163
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:36,180
What this does is it allows us to maintain the necessary white space to make the document scannable.

164
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,330
You'll also want to make sure that you're sticking to one page unless you have two

165
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,770
or more years of full time experience in addition to your undergraduate degree.

166
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:50,010
The exception to this would be the federal government, which averages about five to six pages per resume.

167
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:54,660
If you're looking for guidance on a federal resume, please consult USAJobs.gov.

168
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:00,780
They have multiple resources because they also have a fairly specific structure that they may be looking for.

169
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,820
And again, this is something that we'll talk about a little bit later, but it is important to make the document scannable,

170
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:13,550
and one way to do that is to follow different types of groupings or sections to draw attention to the skills that you have.

171
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:17,810
Alright, so that wraps it up on structure. And we look forward to talking to you again

172
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:22,900
about how to make this content really pop based on the words that you use.
