1
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:29,260
I have so many questions about this paper. Oh, that's great. I really am going to keep having it.

2
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,840
And I keep myself under contract. Year.

3
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,880
Take it away. Okay.

4
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:45,090
So I am present in the paper. It's titled Lack of Antibodies Against Seasonal Coronavirus.

5
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:52,270
O.C. four three Nucleocapsid Protein Identifies Patients At Risk of critical COVID 19.

6
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:13,210
Let me get that and get the paper. Okay.

7
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,670
So some introduction and background.

8
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:27,190
So COVID 19, it's mostly a mild disease for a majority of people, but 10 to 20% of people need to be hospitalized in some shape or fashion.

9
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:33,400
A quarter of those need treatments in the ICU. And if you're in the ICU, you're in pretty bad shape.

10
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:41,860
Major risk factors include male sex, high BMI, age diabetes and other types of co-morbidities.

11
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,710
I think you heard it all. I've heard of it all.

12
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:55,600
So previous literature has indicated that previous exposures of seasonal coronaviruses, the four big ones being ozone, 43 and 63.

13
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:06,790
Q1 and Q2 19 have less severe COVID 19, so there might be possible cross-protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

14
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:16,720
This previous literature is T-cell response from unexposed humans to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

15
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:25,450
People have seen hospitalized patients have weaker responses to previous viral infections, such as the seasonal coronaviruses.

16
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:36,820
The severity of disease of COVID 19 correlates with low and IL 63 neutralizing activities in patient serum.

17
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:46,180
In previous studies, and there was a study analyzing people who had less severe COVID 19 system symptoms and

18
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:53,230
contact with small children was noticed in around 30% of the people being analyzed.

19
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:59,350
And people, small children are very prone to these seasonal coronaviruses.

20
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:08,409
It's pretty much just, you know, common cold. So and also there was a pilot study that indicated that antibodies against the Q one

21
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:13,870
and ozone 43 strains of seasonal coronaviruses correlates with less severe COVID 19.

22
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:24,940
That's relevant because they're in the same genus Betacoronavirus of the same subfamily or the Corona Verhaeghe.

23
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:34,570
So they're pretty close to the SARS-CoV-2 Ozone four, three and HQ one methods.

24
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:42,820
So there was a whole cohort from tertiary care centers in Heidelberg, Paris or Lincoln,

25
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:50,050
and Rosenberg probably butchered those pronunciation 296 patients in total,

26
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:58,420
165 male, 131 female in exclusion and or more like inclusion criteria,

27
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:06,490
actually were that they had a confirmed COVID 19 diagnosis by a PCR 18 years or older concern.

28
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:14,500
People with terminal illness were excluded and plasma samples were collected as close to symptom onset as possible.

29
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,950
COVID 19 severity was determined with four different scales.

30
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:26,680
Let's say critical was the use of chemo or ventilation in an ICU setting.

31
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,270
Severe was oxygen oxygen supplementation not in an ICU setting.

32
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,080
Moderate was hospitalization without any sort of oxygen.

33
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:42,010
Oxygen treatment, ventilation or ethanol and mild was just limited symptoms managed in an outpatient setting.

34
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:47,470
So they come in on feeling bad and the doctor tells them to take Tylenol or something.

35
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:55,690
Antigen analysis. So the paper used these microbial nitrogen immuno strip assays.

36
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:06,370
I've never heard of this before, but it's pretty cool. So pretty much these little strips detect the antibodies of seasonal coronaviruses and also

37
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:15,220
the spike and P specific antibodies against the S1 and RBD subunits of the SARS-CoV-2 spike.

38
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:20,830
It's on a scale of 1 to 3, four or five different levels.

39
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:29,200
So very strong intensity is this triple, triple addition science above cutoff is two of those,

40
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:38,439
the cutoff value is one and then below cutoff is a negative side and a plus side and then non detectable is the minus sign in the paper.

41
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:44,350
But on these example pictures it's just like the weird symbol thing.

42
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,940
So this is a SARS-CoV-2 negative sample.

43
00:05:49,240 --> 00:06:00,040
This is a SARS-CoV-2 positive sample. As you can see, the negative one, it doesn't have these marks for the RBD, the MP or the S1.

44
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,910
So this means that there's no antibodies against these various antigens.

45
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:10,510
And yeah, and these are the controls. So reactivity control means that it's always going to.

46
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,160
Have something up here. IGT controls. Well, this is the cut off.

47
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:26,340
And the way that this works is they did statistical analysis with AR and they also literally took pictures of these strips and analyzed them in image.

48
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:34,510
J So the, the more intense it is, the, the higher the value to get a relative antibody levels.

49
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:45,040
And they used ar again with various statistical analysis wilcoxon, chrishell, Wallace Chi Square, etc. results.

50
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:52,870
So there's a statistically significant age difference between two disease severity levels.

51
00:06:53,200 --> 00:07:01,060
The median age for critical disease was 61 moderate and severe disease was 60 and a half and mild disease was 53.

52
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,069
It should be noted that this cohort is a pretty old cohort.

53
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,300
I think it's a in the paper 90% were over the age of 40.

54
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,620
So there's a whole lot of jazz about MP antibodies against the seasonal coronaviruses.

55
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,700
But the main thing is that Ozzy, 43, really stood out.

56
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:26,320
You know, the above cut off very strong cutoff was the lowest of all of them.

57
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,370
Below cut off and non detectable was pretty significant as well.

58
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,180
And here I'll go into more detail about that.

59
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:44,320
So they're significantly different, different frequency of critical COVID 19 patients than other seasonal coronaviruses.

60
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:56,770
And when we're looking at Oc43, the P value was 0.01 for there is less ozone 43 and p antibody in critical patients, significant p value as well.

61
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:04,570
Patients without ozone 43 antibodies had the highest 0r4 all odds ratio for critical disease.

62
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:12,820
It was 2.26 compared to the comparison to other coronaviruses, which are like 1.5 and 1.15.

63
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:22,060
There was no association before between the ozone 43 antibody levels and other risk factors such as sex, age or BMI.

64
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:32,200
And in a binary regression model, Ozone 43 was the second best predictor of critical disease, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.68.

65
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,300
Compared to that, the best predictor was male sex, which was 2.9 AIDS.

66
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:47,590
As you can see here, this is just a scale determining the proportion of how many samples in each type

67
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:55,780
of seasonal coronavirus had these below and below cutoff and undetectable levels.

68
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:05,440
And you notice with only 43, there's a pretty significant level of this red and vomit green color, you know, compared to the rest.

69
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:15,070
And as you can see, with only 43, there is high ICU therapy levels with undetectable and below cut off.

70
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:26,380
And in the 190 and patients, 44 were only 43 negative, while 123 were below the low cut off intensity.

71
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:36,460
And you can see they have high levels of ICU rates, limitations and conclusions.

72
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,379
So critical disease is correlated with being older, higher BMI.

73
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,300
And now that was already established.

74
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:53,650
So prior infections with seasonal coronaviruses seems to be protective against severe COVID 19, especially Ozone 43.

75
00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:00,340
I think in the paper it's just that Ozone 43 was the most statistically significant.

76
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:06,490
So these antibodies against Ozone 43 are a very robust indicator of disease, you know,

77
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:12,400
high cars and various models and compared to other of the seasonal coronaviruses.

78
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,329
And it's an independent risk factor. It's not associated with major risk factors such as age, sex or BMI.

79
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:24,670
So it's a pretty good indicator because some individuals may be female,

80
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:31,360
normal BMI and and the young, but they can still get it, you know, and we've got to wonder why.

81
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:39,010
And the paper proposed to analyze Oc43 IgG antibody levels upon admission to the

82
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:45,370
hospital for COVID 19 symptoms for an individual risk assessment limitations.

83
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:55,060
As I mentioned, this was an older cohort, so 90% are over the age of 40 years old and the patients were analyzed from tertiary care centers.

84
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:59,379
None of these patients were not hospitalized.

85
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:04,390
We're seeing a clinic to some degree, which may not be very generalizable because for the most part,

86
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,740
people infected with COVID 19 usually just take care of it at home.

87
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:14,510
And they were. These were. Sales were only based on one assay, the microchip and immuno strip assay.

88
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:21,500
We don't know if there's a differences in results if we use like another assay, like a laser.

89
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:35,970
Questions. Surely somebody has a question.

90
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,820
Okay. We're done. All right. I think, first of all, we're going to have.

91
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,990
Why? Um, well, you kind of already talked about this,

92
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:05,750
but why AOC for you specifically and not h clean your wife so that if you like, they're kind of equidistant from COVID 19.

93
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,079
I guess my follow up question would be, is this all COVID 19?

94
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:26,420
Or like what what era was, was this in, in terms of, uh, so this paper was published on, it's available online on April 24, 2021.

95
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:32,180
I think in the confusion there were like, this is right before the vaccine rollout.

96
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,569
So they were trying to determine, like in the paper,

97
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:42,860
there are like people who have low 43 antibody levels should be prioritized for the vaccine

98
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,780
along with like the old and people with immuno compromised conditions and all that.

99
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:54,649
So I think this might have still been they didn't specify what strain,

100
00:12:54,650 --> 00:13:01,820
but like just depending on the time it would probably be and think as long as those people were.

101
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,970
Yeah. It's before I, I don't, I don't know the specific like maybe like Delta or something like that,

102
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,340
but it was, it was before overcrowding was the dominant strain.

103
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:18,110
And this is also in Europe. So, you know, they might have had like different strains going on compared to the U.S. at the time.

104
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:25,730
Yeah, but O C 43 and HQ one there, I think they're the closest.

105
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:32,510
You know, I mentioned they're in the same genus and so family has the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

106
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:40,730
Yeah, I haven't quite thought through this, but not every coronavirus circulates every year for seasonal coronaviruses.

107
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,290
Some years you have more O.S. 43 and some years have more than one.

108
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:51,440
And so like you also have this differential in terms of how much baseline antibodies in the population.

109
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,800
Mm hmm. And it could be, you know. So I'm wondering how that's the matter.

110
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,550
Like whether this was spreading through was just older. Mm hmm.

111
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:04,669
Um. Longer than 81 or something like that. Like, it's not even a question you have to answer.

112
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:08,900
I get your point. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know.

113
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,379
I don't think they really took into consideration that they were just like, Oh,

114
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,710
we're going to just analyze these for antibodies, you know, and determine.

115
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:20,870
But yeah, there's definitely probably like a time determine we time.

116
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,280
But yeah, like just age, you know, because people,

117
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:31,220
different people different ages get exposed to at different times for the dominant strain of seasonal coronavirus.

118
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:36,980
Yeah. I'll get back to you. It's a good paper for a workshop. Thank you very much.

119
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,510
Thank you. It's actually different.

120
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:48,710
Yeah. If this were a meeting, a scientific meeting, I would also ask if there was plans to do neutralizing antibodies.

121
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,640
Because just because something binds doesn't mean it does. Yeah, so.

122
00:14:54,110 --> 00:15:05,770
And coronavirus antibodies like bind, all sorts of stuff. One thing also.

123
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,380
So about this time that that study was done.

124
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,999
Where they were was clued into this conversation.

125
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:25,059
But there was there was a lot of conversation that was happening around that time about prior seasonal

126
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:31,840
coronavirus antibodies being present when it was like kind of running towards the vaccine rollout,

127
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,940
but it was in the other directions.

128
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:42,490
And you barely remember kind of like what kind of prior data, what kind of other, if you like, other viruses from other viruses.

129
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:48,940
What have we talked about in this class may worry about if you've got like really

130
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:54,460
prevalent endemic prior antibodies to like a similar but not completely the same virus.

131
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,520
Tomorrow. We talked about dengue and about antibody dependent enhancement,

132
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:12,170
about how if if people had and it was happening most often in situations where

133
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:17,030
people had a moderate but not sufficiently protective level of antibody.

134
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:23,360
And this is something that really kind of well describes the amount of antibody we have for seasonal coronaviruses.

135
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,040
And so there was some concern, was there going to be antibody dependent enhancement?

136
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:37,150
Like could that same phenomenon happen with SARS-CoV-2 if you sort of introduce a vaccine and then you've got this baseline level of antibody.

137
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:45,590
Now, coronaviruses and flaviviruses are different viruses that impact the immune system in different ways.

138
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:54,109
So but that's something that that was tested as because there are ways to look for antibody dependent enhancement in in like laboratory studies.

139
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:58,489
And so it's something that they checked for as they were studying the vaccines was basically what were

140
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:04,790
the adverse events in people with high versus low prior seasonal coronavirus antibodies because of that?

141
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,680
So just good piece of context to think about. All right.

142
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:15,440
I'm going to do just the last couple of slides here.

143
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:27,720
Okay. So I believe I dropped off with talking about the idea of how passive antibody protection works.

144
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:33,840
So the previous product, just to remind you where we left off,

145
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:41,450
the previous product that was there is currently available on the market is synergistic, which requires monthly dose.

146
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:49,530
IT dosing is phenomenally expensive and it has basically the reason it requires monthly dosing is because of the half life,

147
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,940
because that's how long it takes to wear off to the point where it's no longer protective.

148
00:17:54,510 --> 00:18:01,889
So this is a strategy where we are passively administering the antibody itself to the child and we're

149
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:10,890
not prompting their immune system to create their own de novo generated antibodies in their own body.

150
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:20,490
Now, the the announcement that I had you read for today, the press release as a loved one, data comes out in press releases.

151
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:25,080
And so for people on the recording, I'm rolling my eyes right now.

152
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:32,370
So but the you that was the maternal the maternal vaccine strategy.

153
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:41,190
So remember that maternal vaccines operate under the same fundamental assumption that passive administration of a milestone antibody does.

154
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:48,000
So now the pregnant person is receiving the vaccine, is generating the antibodies instead of like a mouse in a lab,

155
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,830
die in the antibodies and then delivering those antibodies to the child.

156
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,700
So that strategy, it's from the perspective of what's been given,

157
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:07,530
and neither in neither of those paradigms is the infant generating their own de novo antibodies from their own B cells.

158
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,940
Their B cells are not being activated as part of either of these processes.

159
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:23,280
One is passively delivering through maternal immunization and one is passive delivery through direct administration of the British army.

160
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:38,160
And then I mentioned that currently this and these are dated old but they are current these are currently who is recommended to get synergies.

161
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:48,560
It's really looking at, you know, so the gestational age cutoff is under under or equal to 28 weeks and six days.

162
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:54,570
So like we're talking about very preterm infants as we talk about these categories or any of these these other categories.

163
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,620
So it's fairly limited in terms of how widely these are currently distributed.

164
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:13,450
So the near seven MADD is the long acting, and this is sort of the new product that's currently making its way towards approval.

165
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:17,140
This is a one dose long acting product.

166
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:24,100
So you give it once and it can conceivably last long enough to get a child through an entire season.

167
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,049
The question then becomes, well, how long is our species and when does it happen?

168
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:39,670
Which is complete disruption right now. So if you look at the initial paper, when this from this is now looking at preterm infants,

169
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:47,140
you can see that there was a reduction in medically attended lower respiratory tract

170
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:52,310
illness and there was a reduction in hospitalization for any respiratory illness.

171
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,370
Now, not just lower respiratory tract illness.

172
00:20:54,910 --> 00:21:02,590
Remember at the beginning of last week's lecture for RSV, make sure you're always paying attention to the case definition of what's being prevented,

173
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,480
whether we're talking about lower respiratory tract or upper respiratory tract or all illness, right?

174
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:21,550
So this is where you kind of see this come out. So what you see here is also a prevention of lower respiratory tract illness.

175
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,950
On the right that is caused by RSV.

176
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:30,440
So basically lab confirmed and then people that were negative by RSV, you see.

177
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,240
No difference if it's not caused viruses. You see specificity of the association for the use of the monoclonal there.

178
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,719
Now on the right hand side, then the next trials, they looked at it with healthy, late preterm entering.

179
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:52,000
But so are the preterm infants are the ones that are most at risk of having severe hospitalization or severe outcomes early on.

180
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,880
You do see asthma exacerbations now.

181
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,719
There's some causality debates to be had,

182
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:05,590
but you do see a lot of asthma in late preterm or in healthy term infants that have had a severe bout of RSV early on.

183
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:10,000
You can see extended wheezing and possibly the development of asthma.

184
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,130
So they are kind of a potential target.

185
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:23,860
So whether or not we use these strategies in late preterm or in in healthy term infants has always been a matter of debate.

186
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:31,120
So whether the like the cost effectiveness plays out because these are such expensive products but is, you know,

187
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,770
the kind of preclude very, very wide distribution from a financial perspective for most health systems.

188
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:44,080
But then the flip side of that is you can prevent some chronic disease by administering these products early.

189
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,960
And there's also a different, you know,

190
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:53,680
rolling out a product on a wide scale that requires monthly dosing every month is going to you know, that's problematic operationally.

191
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:58,360
However, a one dose product is something that could be a lot more feasible.

192
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:07,899
So here you see the data and you see also some prevention with the with late term in term infants.

193
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:19,240
So reduction in medically attended lower respiratory tract illness hear reduction in hospitalization and no signal in terms of serious adverse events.

194
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:30,210
So the paper by the report that you read today for today has this fantastic graph that I really enjoy in it.

195
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:36,459
It talks about the fact that there are operational challenges with whether you're going to give a monoclonal

196
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:41,320
antibody or whether you're going to use a maternal vaccine or and we don't have infant vaccines,

197
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:47,110
but if you had an infant vaccine where you would use it and think about that in terms of timing of when the

198
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:53,860
product works or doesn't work and then timing of when the child's birth happens relative to the period of risk.

199
00:23:54,190 --> 00:24:00,490
Now, again, this period of risk are the darker colors with this bar across the top.

200
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:04,330
Think about how challenging this is right now when we don't know when the period of risk is.

201
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:09,820
We don't know like when this current season is going to end. From a like planning and systems perspective.

202
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,430
So the monoclonal antibody, whether if it's got a five month duration,

203
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:23,590
you basically want to get give it right as the period of risk is starting and then cover yourself for five months.

204
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:33,160
So even if children are born in April, May, June, you don't want to give it then because it'll start to wear off by the time the period of risk.

205
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:40,480
So you want to dose everybody in being at risk now with passive administered, direct administration of a monoclonal antibody.

206
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,130
You can give it, you can give it, and it starts to work almost immediately.

207
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,510
Very quickly. You don't have to give it time for it to start to ramp up.

208
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:55,180
Right now with a vaccine, you've got to give it a couple of weeks before it's really going to work.

209
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:04,510
Now, the infant vaccine, we don't have an infant vaccine, but I'm explain the challenges around the infant vaccine.

210
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,210
And for an a vaccine, you actually can administer it at birth.

211
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:18,490
There's enough maternal antibody circulation already with the child that it prevents the vaccine from working effectively.

212
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,729
And then in the you know, the kids B cells aren't just quite developed enough for these vaccines to really have a great signal.

213
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:31,900
And so you you want to wait until at least four months before you start administering the vaccine.

214
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:37,749
So for kids that are born, say, in, you know, these kind of middle season,

215
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:43,770
so a kid that's born in April has got four months of life before you can administer the vaccine,

216
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:48,190
and then they've got protection long before the period of rest starts.

217
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:54,760
But for the kid that's born closer into the end of the season, you can't possibly administer.

218
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,230
They're not never going to be old enough for them to get the vaccine for the whole RSV season.

219
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:03,520
And those are the kids that are most at risk. Those are the kids that have the most severe outcomes.

220
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,770
So the maternal vaccination strategy bridges these two strategies.

221
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,670
You've got.

222
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:23,230
Basically, you can administer the maternal vaccine and have it at in pregnancy so that as soon as the child is born, they are then protected.

223
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:30,970
However, maternal vaccines are most they are most effective when they're administered in the third trial.

224
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:38,460
Mr. There's a problem. Our most at risk infants are the infants that are most premature.

225
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:49,380
So for that, you've got a lap.

226
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,849
So basically you're having to try to correctly target and when and this is where, for instance,

227
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:58,920
when we're talking about maternal vaccination strategies, prenatal care becomes incredibly important.

228
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:07,019
So you risk losing your populations where you don't have sufficient prenatal care happening because you miss that window when you can dose

229
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:15,330
and you have the mother has to be dosed the prior person to be dosed for as the right amount of time before before birth in order to get.

230
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:22,620
So you have to you have to kind of gauge it well to be able to get the dose in for enough time for antibodies to have mounted,

231
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:29,370
but not too early that it starts to wear off before birth and then have that all kind of in the context of preterm risk.

232
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:36,330
So that is complicated to sort of figure out how to how to balance all of this.

233
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:36,650
Right.

234
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:47,010
But if you think about operationally maternal vaccines, you see you have kids, you know, as they're born, you can kind of start dosing them over time.

235
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:53,850
Here, it's sort of like one week of the year. You got to get all the kids dosed with their their first monoclonal antibody thing.

236
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:59,010
All kind of right at the same time. So with that.

237
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,920
Move to the workshops. Stop the recording.

238
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:10,985
I'm going to spend a couple of minutes starting on talking about viral infections of pregnancy.

239
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:24,154
And so I thought that this would be a good I mentioned before I rearranged the order of topics in the class that I'm starting with,

240
00:28:24,155 --> 00:28:31,565
talking a little bit about a maternal vaccination scenario and then going from there to talk about viral infections of pregnancy.

241
00:28:31,955 --> 00:28:35,435
Now, this these this is a little bit of a logical jump.

242
00:28:35,855 --> 00:28:40,355
So retool your minds to be thinking about we're still talking about pregnancy,

243
00:28:40,355 --> 00:28:51,155
but we're now talking about infections that the that the pregnant person has that may or may not get passed to the child.

244
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:54,394
So this is now this is what we're talking about. Yes.

245
00:28:54,395 --> 00:28:59,075
There are going to be antibody transfers and antibodies are going to be important for some of these diseases.

246
00:28:59,435 --> 00:29:05,315
But we are talking about the virus moving now more than talking about the antibodies moving back and forth.

247
00:29:08,935 --> 00:29:19,285
So and I don't want you to get too to come away with this thinking that RSV is a a vertically transmitted virus.

248
00:29:19,285 --> 00:29:22,195
It's not. Right. We were just talking about antibodies.

249
00:29:22,735 --> 00:29:29,515
Now, RSV does get transmitted by like a sick a sick parent holding a child or like an older sibling holding your child.

250
00:29:29,515 --> 00:29:31,525
But it's not through pregnancy.

251
00:29:33,055 --> 00:29:45,715
So typically with infection in pregnancy, there's a kind of rule of thumb that the most important pathogens tend to be these torch pathogens.

252
00:29:46,615 --> 00:29:51,324
And then the the, you know, pneumonic goes along that each bullet point.

253
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:56,605
But you notice that the vast majority of these are viruses.

254
00:29:58,105 --> 00:30:04,795
And actually, I really like how other just keeps growing because I think the accurate is the same.

255
00:30:05,395 --> 00:30:09,145
Um, HSV is a different.

256
00:30:09,355 --> 00:30:11,545
When we get to HSV, I'll point this out.

257
00:30:11,785 --> 00:30:21,144
HSV is very different than these other viruses where HSV transmitted during pregnancy has to do more with actually the fact that it's a contact.

258
00:30:21,145 --> 00:30:24,625
It transmits by contact transmission,

259
00:30:25,945 --> 00:30:34,705
but it's where the virus is shedding from in the birth canal leads to a contact event that then leads to transmission.

260
00:30:35,065 --> 00:30:42,025
So it is about contact transmission more so than other types of infections that we see in pregnancy.

261
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:52,674
So rubella, also known as German mules, is the first disease we're going to start with is a single stranded,

262
00:30:52,675 --> 00:31:01,165
positive sense RNA genome, a cancer capsid with an envelope, and the virions look satirical like this in the picture.

263
00:31:03,085 --> 00:31:06,615
This was also called Third Disease, because it was like this.

264
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:17,215
It was like virus number three that was characterized by the origami and it causes a molecular popular rash and lymphadenopathy.

265
00:31:17,635 --> 00:31:22,225
And so this is sort of the picture of a child that has rubella.

266
00:31:23,545 --> 00:31:29,935
Now, if the child is infected as a young child, it's going to be very mild.

267
00:31:29,965 --> 00:31:31,885
They're going to have a rash and they're going to recover.

268
00:31:32,905 --> 00:31:38,245
If it, however, is in fact, if they are infected congenitally, then it can become very serious.

269
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:43,135
And so rubella. We're going to talk about the vaccine in a moment.

270
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:50,964
You have to remember that the burden of disease we're preventing is really around preventing the transmission from a pregnant person to an infant.

271
00:31:50,965 --> 00:31:56,544
Congenital be so congenital it's less infectious than measles.

272
00:31:56,545 --> 00:32:08,004
It has droplet spread. And so the point the point at gestation matters and this is different for many of the viruses we look at.

273
00:32:08,005 --> 00:32:11,335
Not all viruses have the same pattern in terms of risk at the point of gestation.

274
00:32:11,755 --> 00:32:19,735
So if you have congenital transmission at very early in gestation, you have a really high chance of infection.

275
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:24,205
You can have multiple congenital congenital defects or spontaneous abortion.

276
00:32:24,595 --> 00:32:35,004
You go all the way down to the bottom, you know, three months of gestation, the syndrome looks different and a less chance of problems.

277
00:32:35,005 --> 00:32:42,955
And then at the very end, four months of gestation and further, if you have transmission at that point, chance of infection starts to go down.

278
00:32:43,435 --> 00:32:49,195
So earlier in the in the pregnancy is a higher risk of transmission.

279
00:32:51,665 --> 00:33:04,055
Or a higher risk of of impacts of transmission. So in the pre vaccine era, there were the 1964 to 1965, there were 12.5 million rubella cases.

280
00:33:04,475 --> 00:33:07,654
But really, the impact was in pregnant people.

281
00:33:07,655 --> 00:33:10,985
So 50,000 people, pregnant people were infected.

282
00:33:11,345 --> 00:33:19,564
And then from there, it's estimated that were there were 20,000 cases of congenital rubella syndrome leading

283
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:24,695
to a very substantial number of infants born that were death or death in their blood.

284
00:33:25,595 --> 00:33:35,555
And then 2000 deaths are coming from those cases as well, and phenomenally expensive in terms of care needs.

285
00:33:37,595 --> 00:33:47,945
The in 1964 Time magazine suggested that spring of 1864 this is pre vaccine is the best of times for a German measles party.

286
00:33:48,245 --> 00:33:54,695
The rolls call for lots of kissing games in the unventilated room so that little old boys and more especially the little girls, get the infection.

287
00:33:54,905 --> 00:34:03,365
It's consistently so mild. It's an inconvenience for children both to have it and get it over with because one barb confers lifelong immunity.

288
00:34:03,935 --> 00:34:11,045
And the reason and this actually was this was a conversation that sometimes happened in some spaces around Zika virus as well.

289
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:19,024
But the girls and other boys kind of language was around the fact that early exposure as a child was predicting

290
00:34:19,025 --> 00:34:27,695
susceptibility as an adult and then predicting risk of congenital rubella during that that child's later pregnancy.

291
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:33,305
Right. And so it's all about preventing preventing this risk events in pregnancy.

292
00:34:35,665 --> 00:34:41,485
So there's so many diseases we've gone through that everybody thought that a party was okay when I had chicken.

293
00:34:41,515 --> 00:34:48,115
Well, you're going to see a picture eventually. There's a picture coming in this class of me with chicken pox and then like like other

294
00:34:48,115 --> 00:34:51,354
parents that their kids over to hang out with me because there is no chicken pox vaccine.

295
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:55,555
And they were like, go hang out with them because it's the summer and it's a really good time to get chickenpox.

296
00:34:59,155 --> 00:35:01,675
So rubella vaccination.

297
00:35:03,175 --> 00:35:11,244
So again, remember that the purpose of rubella vaccination programs is the prevention of congenital rubella syndrome much later.

298
00:35:11,245 --> 00:35:19,945
But so although we vaccinate children, we are the target population is really adults, adults of pregnancy age.

299
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:28,285
So I love the cartoons from this time period, especially the like.

300
00:35:28,285 --> 00:35:33,175
The vaccination program stabbing the Rubella Dragon is one of my favorites.

301
00:35:34,615 --> 00:35:42,895
And vaccines were developed quite some time ago, including the live attenuated vaccine that Stanley Packard made.

302
00:35:43,525 --> 00:35:48,765
So I think about this, you know, when we eventually talk about HPV as well.

303
00:35:48,775 --> 00:35:58,885
So rubella vaccination is so accepted in the in the US, even though this is a vaccination we deliver to children to promote healthy pregnancy.

304
00:35:58,955 --> 00:36:10,795
Right. HPV is a vaccine that we deliver to adolescents to promote, you know, to to reduce cancer rates from a sexually transmitted infection.

305
00:36:10,795 --> 00:36:14,035
And the narrative around it, it's completely different.

306
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:19,635
People don't have a problem with rubella vaccination, but they have more problems with HPV vaccination.

307
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:23,995
So it's interesting to see how these narratives kind of evolve over the years.

308
00:36:26,545 --> 00:36:31,705
Okay. Jumping to herpes virus CMV.

309
00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:38,215
So Sandy is the second most common cause of infectious mononucleosis.

310
00:36:38,215 --> 00:36:48,264
EBV is the most common cause of mono. And this Sandy is is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids.

311
00:36:48,265 --> 00:36:56,725
So saliva, breast milk, sexual contact, CV transmission is often asymptomatic, does not lead to disease in healthy individuals.

312
00:36:57,235 --> 00:37:02,605
It's often something that we are we have concern for in post-transplant patients.

313
00:37:02,605 --> 00:37:10,615
So people whose immune systems have been wiped out by transplant processes, well, oftentimes you have to be very careful.

314
00:37:10,615 --> 00:37:18,715
They may get a CMB infection and 55 to 75% of women of childbearing age are seropositive.

315
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:28,975
And this is another situation where congenital infections, the trans placental infection, is a major concern.

316
00:37:28,995 --> 00:37:38,415
So if the mother has a primary infection, 35 to 55% of infants will become congenitally infected.

317
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:39,885
So then think about it this way.

318
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:50,055
If the mother, Sarah Negative has not had CMB for all the time leading up to the pregnancy and then get CMB for the first time during the pregnancy,

319
00:37:50,475 --> 00:37:54,225
then the risk of congenital infection is 35 to 55%.

320
00:37:54,555 --> 00:38:01,475
Now, this is different than rubella. The risk is lower in the first trimester and is higher in the third trimester.

321
00:38:01,485 --> 00:38:05,695
So the later the see in this infection happens, the more dangerous.

322
00:38:07,335 --> 00:38:11,625
And this is what disease looks like for CMB.

323
00:38:12,555 --> 00:38:16,995
You can read through the various clinical syndromes there.

324
00:38:17,715 --> 00:38:22,005
This is a major cause of hearing disorders is congenital infection.

325
00:38:25,255 --> 00:38:31,555
And here's just graphically showing this risk of intrauterine transmission following maternal

326
00:38:31,555 --> 00:38:37,785
primary infection based on gestation on the black line as kind of the meta analysis,

327
00:38:38,105 --> 00:38:43,315
the other studies and showing wherein the primary infection happens in the pregnant person.

328
00:38:44,335 --> 00:38:46,265
So whether it's transmission, so you're going up,

329
00:38:46,265 --> 00:38:51,115
the risk of transmission is going up throughout the course of the pregnancy as gestational age increases.

330
00:38:54,655 --> 00:39:00,275
So 20000 to 40000 cases annually.

331
00:39:00,295 --> 00:39:12,264
This is not a vaccine preventable disease. There is some there are some efforts to use passive antibodies, monoclonal antibodies in pregnant women.

332
00:39:12,265 --> 00:39:15,955
But there have been adverse effects from some of those found in some of those studies.

333
00:39:16,945 --> 00:39:25,435
And so it really comes down to knowing this idea of identifying serum negative pregnant women

334
00:39:25,855 --> 00:39:29,844
and protecting them in situations where see any chance of seeing B transmission is very common.

335
00:39:29,845 --> 00:39:36,895
For instance, a child like somebody that's working in a child care setting or working around young children, that it's going to be around a lot.

336
00:39:37,195 --> 00:39:44,175
Now, this is not this sort of like an overarching strategy to be able to do that kind of design.

337
00:39:44,185 --> 00:39:49,045
Like I don't want my C and B status, right. You know, so people don't know they're seeing B serology status.

338
00:39:49,045 --> 00:39:58,795
So it's complicated. And it was an interesting conversation to think about how common this is in the United States and how much transmission

339
00:39:58,795 --> 00:40:06,625
is going on compared to the relative impact of burden of Zika virus infection that was happening at the same time.

340
00:40:07,315 --> 00:40:13,585
And so this is sort of an interesting New York Times wrote an interesting article kind of comparing the two conversations.

341
00:40:15,775 --> 00:40:19,945
Here is a layout of worldwide COVID prevalence rates.

342
00:40:21,565 --> 00:40:24,385
Notice all of the blank spaces here.

343
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:37,315
There is a really large paucity of data to be able to think about where where rates are higher or lower and where transmission could be a concern.

344
00:40:40,765 --> 00:40:45,865
Okay. I got one minute, and I know you have more than one minute, so I could talk about herpes viruses for a long time.

345
00:40:45,865 --> 00:40:54,144
So let's stop here. I'm going to pick this back up on Wednesday and but I made it through congenital CNBC have

346
00:40:54,145 --> 00:40:58,975
two kids and I'll see in the papers to read for Wednesday and we'll have a discussion then.

347
00:40:59,935 --> 00:41:10,555
It's very much. Yeah yeah yeah.

348
00:41:11,475 --> 00:41:15,605
That's for the. Yes. Talking about the transmission of the virus.

349
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:19,555
Is it okay to refer to the study that's mainly on Fox documentaries?

350
00:41:19,585 --> 00:41:23,575
Yes. But then they actually had. Yeah. Yeah. You can poll from whenever you want.

351
00:41:24,345 --> 00:41:28,335
Yeah. What?
