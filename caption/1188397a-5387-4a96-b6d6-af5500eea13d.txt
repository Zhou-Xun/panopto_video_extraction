1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:08,010
Recording. You guys get your slides. Yeah.

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,890
However, it's been has been being weird. Can you hear us? Okay? I don't know what's what's wrong with this owl camera?

3
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,510
Last time I got frozen, doing, like, some really weird gesture.

4
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:27,390
So let me see your wrist. Is it okay?

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,540
I just stopped and restarted the video. Something about the Panopto freaked out the video?

6
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,100
I think so. Okay. Yeah. When in doubt, turn it off and turn it back on.

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:52,380
Welcome to the witness. And I apologize for being all the way back here to my peers about the fact that I needed a place to.

8
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:22,970
Even. Anyone want to answer some emails for me?

9
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,540
Yeah. We can currently go to it. Great.

10
00:01:29,140 --> 00:02:41,400
And. It's.

11
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,730
Waiting around for that moment of. Jacob.

12
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,020
That's one. Is that good?

13
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:16,370
Because zoom or oak. Way back there.

14
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:23,470
Can you hear us? Yeah. Okay. All right.

15
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:29,290
So our group had lung cancer. And so here's just a table of contents of what we're going to be covering today.

16
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:35,920
So to start off, we're just going to talk a little bit about what lung cancer is and the current trends that we see.

17
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,150
So currently there are two main types of lung cancer.

18
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,840
There's non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer.

19
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:52,720
Non-small cell lung cancer makes up around 85% of all of the lung cancers, while small cell lung cancer only makes up around 15%.

20
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:59,110
So looking here, you can see that there are three main subtypes of the small cell non-small cell lung cancer.

21
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:05,739
The first one is adenocarcinoma, which is actually the most common type of lung cancer all together.

22
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,770
That makes up around 40% of all lung cancers.

23
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,060
This can usually be found on the outer, outer edges of the lungs.

24
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,850
And it's more slowly growing and it's it's slow developing and grows a lot slower.

25
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,850
The next type is squamous cell carcinoma,

26
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:30,429
and this one usually has earlier symptoms and is beginning in the bronchial tube region as opposed to the outer regions.

27
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,910
But overall, it's still a little bit more slower growing then.

28
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,129
Small cell lung cancers are the last type is large cell carcinoma.

29
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:49,720
And this one grows more rapidly out of the non-small cell lung cancers, and it begins on the outer edges of the lungs, as adenocarcinoma does as well.

30
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,970
It's just less common. Moving on to small cell lung cancer.

31
00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:01,600
On the right is called cell carcinoma. And it's given this name because it gives the appearance of oats.

32
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:10,270
And this can usually be found in the bronchial tubes. And this type of cancer is much more aggressive than non-small cell lung cancer.

33
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,700
The symptoms appear very quickly and rapidly,

34
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:20,460
and it can grow to surrounding lymph nodes and other organs a lot faster than non-small cell lung cancer would.

35
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:30,400
So overall, non-small cell lung cancer is a more common type, but small cell lung cancer is much more rapid.

36
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,840
So moving on to talking about the burden of lung cancer.

37
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:46,510
So in males, 36.3 per 100,000 males do is the incidence rate and 21.9 per 100,000 individuals is the mortality rate for males.

38
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,610
And lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in males in the United States.

39
00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:01,479
Moving on to females, we can see that it's not much slower between females and males because 30.4 per 100,000

40
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:08,260
individuals for the incidence rate and the mortality rate is 16.4 per 100,000 individuals.

41
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:16,329
So looking at this over time, we can see that from 1975 to around 1990s for both males and females,

42
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:23,230
the mortality rate has been increasing and then around the 1990 it slowly started to decrease.

43
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,260
And as you can see, the mortality rate between males and females is becoming much closer to each other.

44
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:37,960
But males has always been higher than females due to higher smoking rates in males to females.

45
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:46,870
So looking globally, we can see that the Western Pacific region does have the highest incidence and mortality rate,

46
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:54,430
whereas the African region has the smallest incidence and mortality rate.

47
00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:01,299
But as you can see, as the regions go down, the closer the incidence and mortality rate are,

48
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:08,230
whereas the higher on the on the graph it is, the bigger the difference between the incidence and mortality rate is.

49
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:18,520
So looking into the future, what we can see is that in developing countries they're all likely to continue being a decrease

50
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,040
in the incidence and mortality rates for developed countries such as the United States,

51
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:32,710
whereas in developing countries the burden, the incidence and mortality rate will continue to increase a little bit more over time.

52
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:45,090
Okay. So the risk factors for lung cancer, a risk factor, something that increases your chances of developing a disease.

53
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,600
So the number one risk factor for lung cancer is tobacco smoking.

54
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:56,910
Tobacco smoking contributes to 80 or 90% of the lung cancer deaths in the United States from women and men, respectively.

55
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:03,209
If you're a man who smokes, you're 23 times more likely to develop lung cancer than if you didn't smoke.

56
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,750
And then for being a woman, you're 13 times more likely.

57
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:14,160
And additionally, secondhand smoking also is a risk factor. It's not associated with a 25% chance increased risk.

58
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,180
The second leading cause or a risk factor for developing lung cancer in the U.S. is radon.

59
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:27,300
Radon can be found in like surfaces or like areas like near the ground.

60
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:33,030
So like cellars and basements and things like that. And basically what radon does is it like sheds,

61
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:41,760
like radioactive particles when it decays and those particles can reach your lungs and coat those like cells of the lungs,

62
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:46,740
which can then cause damage. So long term radon exposure has the increased risk.

63
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,030
And then think about environmental exposures.

64
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:58,680
So silica, this is found in rocks. And so basically it causes like an inflammatory response.

65
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,880
But people who work with like rock solid construction workers, mining workers,

66
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,379
bricklaying workers, they're going to be at an increased chance of exposing themselves to silica.

67
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,710
So therefore, it could have it increased chance of getting lung cancer.

68
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:18,510
Arsenic is another environmental exposure. This one, it's a group borne carcinogen.

69
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:25,830
And it's known for causing lung cancer tumors. And that can be ingested through like water.

70
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,620
Air. Yeah. And then improper diet.

71
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,030
This is going to have a little more limited evidence,

72
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:39,060
but it has been shown that low levels of vitamin C and high levels of beta carotene that can have something to do with your risk factor.

73
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,970
And just like with most chronic diseases, alcohol consumption is a risk factor for lung cancer as well.

74
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,309
And the family history is kind of an interesting one because if you have a family history of lung cancer,

75
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,840
you have a two times more chance of developing it, but it's not genetic.

76
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:02,540
So I think that could contribute to that would be like if the secondhand smoke and so if your household is smoking, you could be exposed to that.

77
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:09,780
Or like if your parents smoke, you might be more likely to reduce that habit or if you live in a house with radon just like your parents do.

78
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:17,610
So that's kind of where that comes into play. So then on the contrary, protective factors, most of them kind of surround the smoking.

79
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:23,130
So either quit smoking or is the best the better option would be to never smoke at all.

80
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:29,860
And then if you are someone who has that like high risk your job to try to limit your workplace exposures.

81
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:29,640
So prevention for lung cancer, like a lot of other things, can be split into three different levels primary, secondary and tertiary.

82
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:40,130
So primary prevention is generally the avoidance of smoking or the use of other smoking tobacco products in.

83
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,140
Additionally, if someone already smokes.

84
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:51,360
Primary prevention would include stop smoking if an individual still has no signs or diagnosis of lung cancer.

85
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,730
For secondary prevention,

86
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:03,060
it's the effort to identify a health issue in its earliest stage or more likely to prevent the onset of symptoms or worsening conditions.

87
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:12,780
So in the case of lung cancer, the most recommended form of screening, really the only suggested one hour lung CT scans.

88
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:18,180
And basically screening is strongly recommended for older adults,

89
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:23,700
especially those who have a long history of smoking or just in general the past history of smoking,

90
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:29,790
and also adults who do not show signs or symptoms of lung cancer.

91
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:39,330
So during the lung CT scan, an x ray machine uses a low dose of radiation to make a detailed image of the lungs.

92
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:46,800
And while it's very short and none of the screening method places a risk of exposure to radiation on patients,

93
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,440
along with potential follow up tests and further scans that may require more invasive procedures.

94
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,450
But yeah, generally this is the only recommended form of screening for lung cancer.

95
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,219
And then lastly,

96
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:07,950
tertiary carries on into treatment because tertiary prevention is a prevention of worsening symptoms or health outcomes in an individual.

97
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,190
So unlike primary prevention or secondary prevention,

98
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:17,040
it's highly focused on this treatment aspect for something that's already been identified or diagnosed.

99
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:25,200
And in lung cancer, treatment is highly dependent on the stage at which the cancer was identified in an individual.

100
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:33,629
So individuals diagnosed with non so non-small cell lung cancer generally have the option to be treated with surgery,

101
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:40,380
chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a unique combination depending on their individual case.

102
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,330
So also to add smoking cessation,

103
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:54,300
post diagnosis would also be a form of tertiary prevention because it would be stopping smoking before the condition gets worse in an individual.

104
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,340
So for treatment,

105
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:07,770
surgery is like any other cancer treatment when basically the cancer tissue is cut completely out from the body or as best as it can be.

106
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:13,260
Chemotherapy is the use of medicine to shrink the cancer in the body or completely kill it.

107
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,790
And these methods can be given a pill or liquid free of access.

108
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:27,270
There's also radiation therapy, which is the use of high energy rays that specifically target the cancer area of the body to help kill the cancer.

109
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:35,159
There's also targeted therapy, which also uses medicine to potentially block the growth and spread of the cancer cells.

110
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:45,120
And these can also be given in liquid or pill form. Additionally, lung cancer patients also have the option to participate in clinical trials.

111
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,790
If the opportunity were to present itself and they're eligible and able to be at

112
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:59,459
tertiary prevention aside from treatment is both of these and then following treatment,

113
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:05,520
there's also a lot of things to consider with survivorship on how lung cancer patients are affected.

114
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:13,680
So there's a lot of long term effects that can influence the survivorship of patients who have experienced lung cancer in the past.

115
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:23,340
So just start post-treatment burden. Even with an early stage diagnosis, recurrence rates are still considered to be high in lung cancer patients,

116
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:27,600
and oftentimes recurrence happens within the first two years of survivorship.

117
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,950
So because of this,

118
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:39,990
survivors are subject to physical exams and a lot of check ins within the first 3 to 6 months of their two years and then annually thereafter.

119
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:44,909
So there's a lot that can be placed on an individual in terms of going in for

120
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:49,110
checkups and maintaining connection with their treatment teams and doctors,

121
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:58,650
along with the burden of attending these physical exams and check ins is also further exposure to radiation from scans,

122
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,440
along with anxiety, from waiting with test results.

123
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:11,460
And in addition to anxiety about test results, it's common for about 80% of lung cancer patients to experience feelings of stress and depression.

124
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:15,690
So leading into physical effects and mental and emotional effects,

125
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:21,150
all forms of treatment have the potential to decrease the quality of life for a lung cancer patient.

126
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:28,890
As an example, this platinum based chemotherapy can cause neurological issues such as neuropathy, hearing loss and further cognitive decline,

127
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:36,510
as well as chemotherapy and radiation, demonstrate a higher risk of cognitive impairment because of the high incidence of brain metastases.

128
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,960
And then there's also things like immunotherapy, which can lead to other autoimmune related issues.

129
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:48,270
And in general, any cancer places, the human body, under a tremendous amount of stress.

130
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:54,810
And because of this, while treatment often saves lives, it can also alter the quality.

131
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:02,310
There also is a stigma surrounding lung cancer, which can affect lung cancer patients.

132
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,780
So following treatment, individuals often experience a stigma,

133
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:13,440
and it's basically that lung cancer is mostly caused by smoking, which is a preventable behavior.

134
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,300
And because of this, there are many assumptions made that the cancer is self-inflicted.

135
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:23,790
And these same assumptions don't account for the forms of lung cancer that develop, as Alex said,

136
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:29,670
in nonsmokers or in individuals that have absolutely no history of smoking in their life.

137
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:35,730
And the stigma can play a role in the willingness to seek treatment and medical attention,

138
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,590
because it can increase feelings of guilt among other forms of emotional distress.

139
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:45,300
And lastly, persistent tobacco use is a common issue.

140
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:49,859
Along with negative feelings patients already experience.

141
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:57,960
Persistent tobacco use is more common and individuals experiencing lower emotional support during their time of their diagnosis or treatment.

142
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:03,060
So long term cessation of smoking habits can be challenging for individuals,

143
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:09,870
especially survivors of lung cancer who experience high rates of stress following their diagnosis or their treatment.

144
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:19,020
And it's been noted that 40% of smokers quit before having an operation to remove their surgery or their cancer tissue,

145
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:30,270
but have ended up relapsing after their operation. So there's in general a lot of ways that treatment and diagnosis can affect cancer patients.

146
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:40,440
Lung cancer patients in the future. And then start to wrap up the presentation.

147
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:46,110
I'm going to talk about research. So researchers look at like two avenues of where you can go.

148
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:53,190
You can either do early detection research or treatment research. So early detection research obviously will want to try to find lung cancer earlier.

149
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,470
So they're developing a way to look at sputum samples,

150
00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:03,569
which is basically when someone like coughs up mucus and then look at it under a microscope and then try to find the normal cancer cells from there,

151
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:10,020
which is kind of interesting. They're looking at blood samples and there's a specific one I talk about in the next slide called Delfi.

152
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,580
So we'll get to that. And then also they're trying to make advancements.

153
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,810
As we pointed out, there were some flaws with the current CTS treatment.

154
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,940
So finding a better way to redefine that and be able to detect more cancer cases earlier is

155
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:29,370
definitely important to research and thinking about on the other side of the treatment research.

156
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:34,710
So targeted therapies we kind of talked about, those are like the newly research lung cancer drugs.

157
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:41,640
But unfortunately, they are kind of interesting because they don't really do a good job of targeting.

158
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:48,120
They kind of go in and they kill a lot of the cells and some of those are good cells and that can cause a lot of unwanted side effects.

159
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,069
So they want to kind of like redefine these targeted therapies so that they're going in and they're attacking like

160
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:58,290
the tumor specific cells and sparing the good cells so that can better health outcomes for a lot of patients.

161
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:03,969
Okay. So then talking about this Dell for you.

162
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:11,710
So this is an artificial intelligence. What test? Adolphe stands for DNA evaluation of fragments for early interception.

163
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:17,500
So this is kind of newly research and it was developed at the Johns Hopkins Cancer Center.

164
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:24,880
So basically what it does. So what the DNA that sheds from the cancer cells and then like circulates in the bloodstream.

165
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:30,610
The stuff you can go ahead and pick those up by looking at the fragmentation that the DNA has.

166
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:38,530
So they use this artificial intelligence test. They combine it with a protein biomarker and they look at like computer imaging.

167
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:43,780
And they also analyze the risk factors for patients. And doing all of these things combined in their study,

168
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:51,819
they were able to detect 94% of cancers or of cancer cases, lung cancer cases in their 800 person sample.

169
00:26:51,820 --> 00:27:00,370
And this is across all stages and subtypes. So this is really cool brand and could be definitely useful because it's pretty cost effective.

170
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:06,220
It could be broadly accessible, which is important, and they make it sound like it's pretty easy to do.

171
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:14,070
So then on a final note, why is research important, specifically lung cancer research?

172
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:21,360
So it's really important to find these better treatments so that we can increase the survival rate and quality of life for a lot of these patients.

173
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:25,950
And then it's important to increase the number of lung cancer survivors because we want to

174
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:30,870
live longer their future and have a better future for those that are already diagnosed.

175
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:40,170
And then thinking about the specific public health importance of lung cancer research is by studying its impact on large populations.

176
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:48,450
It's going to give us like valuable information that we can apply, like policies and programs that can eventually affect millions of lives.

177
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,330
So, yeah, that's all we have.

178
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:05,810
Do you know if, like the Delta people that you're describing, it's not like is is specifically only being used for lung cancer right now.

179
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:11,930
Actually, so I was looking into this this morning because the initial study that I'm looking at with the Johns Hopkins was just for lung cancer,

180
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,280
but now it's expanded. They're looking at it for up to seven cancers. One of them was breast and colon.

181
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,300
I forget the other ones, but this could be a useful technology for many other ones as well.

182
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,360
That's really, you know,

183
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:30,170
broadly like what that's called that kind of test is looking for DNA fragments in circulation of cancer like the fancy name for it.

184
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:35,210
I don't know if it's a fancy, but the liquid biopsy is the trial again.

185
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,760
Have you guys heard of that before? Liquid biopsy.

186
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:46,220
It's this idea that you'd be able to just take a blood sample and test for circulating tumor DNA and therefore be able to detect cancer.

187
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,910
And I think ideally you'd be able to use it for early detection. It would just be a blood test for cancer.

188
00:28:53,810 --> 00:29:01,340
The trouble that is like how do you figure out which cancer it is that you do like a whole body, like what do you do with that?

189
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:09,829
Like so I think that's part of like making it very I think they're using it for multiple cancers is tricky, right?

190
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:18,409
I think there's different cancers probably shed DNA into circulation at different rates and some of them more than others probably.

191
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:22,160
Right. And some more or less sensitive for different cancers.

192
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:27,020
Then you have all the follow up stuff that you still have to do. So it's definitely a cool idea.

193
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:31,730
It's not super being used in practice yet, but I mean,

194
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:38,090
ideally if you can do it safely and easily and it's really specific, then that would be amazing, right?

195
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:43,250
Because then you would only have to follow up on other people who really do have a cancer.

196
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:49,489
Yeah. So it would be really cool. But that's kind of the idea of a broad topic like health care.

197
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:52,850
If you go to a cancer meeting, you'll see a lot of stuff about liquid biopsy, liquid biopsy.

198
00:29:52,850 --> 00:30:00,500
That's what that is. They're trying to find ways to find all the cancers, any cancer in a blood sample.

199
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:21,930
With. So I don't think we did, but I, I kind of remember it.

200
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:31,020
So it's a 56% survival rate if it's diagnosed with early, but only 16% of cases are diagnosed early.

201
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:36,300
So the survival rate would go down that depending on when you were diagnosed, but pretty good survival rate.

202
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:46,110
Yeah. Hopefully that's changing with with the screening. And so I want to go back, I want to make sure I understand what you said.

203
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:50,740
So I think this was for Alex's part. Alex, you hear me?

204
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:57,510
I want to go back to the disparity slide that you have.

205
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,820
That one somewhere. Here you go.

206
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:13,079
So here you you show these slides. And then you said something on the next slide about how potentially these disparities

207
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:21,120
could be explained by differences in differences in screening rates across groups.

208
00:31:22,350 --> 00:32:25,350
So you elaborate on that a little bit. I guess I just want to point out the U.S. market differences between blacks and

209
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:29,880
non-Hispanic whites for either incident or mortality here in these recent years.

210
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:35,330
Like, What's wrong? Yeah.

211
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:44,320
So I to me it looks a lot like the way that black lines are very similar here for both its mortality

212
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,720
rate and the big differences seem to be lower rates in some of these other routes compared to what.

213
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:58,819
Would you agree? So I think the disparities are coming down a bit.

214
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:05,960
But the ones that still exist, I think are more obvious when you when you split the sexes.

215
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:11,510
And I think you still have some disparities in smoking rates, certainly by race, ethnicity.

216
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:19,100
I think you're right. I think the point about the screening requirements is interesting and there's a

217
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,540
whole lot of stuff about that I wouldn't have expected you guys to get into,

218
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:30,709
but like differences like menthol cigarets are much more commonly used in black black populations.

219
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:35,430
Right. And are those worse for lung cancer?

220
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:38,059
There's been a lot of research and debate about that.

221
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:47,990
And you're right that they may so differently, which puts them maybe under the threshold for like the pack years for screening and that kind of thing.

222
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:53,600
So I think some of that has been addressed because they've recently changed the screening requirement for screening.

223
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:59,510
They recently lowered the package requirements to be screened in 2021, I believe.

224
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:07,010
So I think they're trying to address some of that. Any other questions?

225
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:41,650
All right. Good job, guys. Then I would say, okay.

226
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:49,350
Hi. Question.

227
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:56,260
Would have thought. Do you want one of us it?

228
00:34:56,290 --> 00:35:01,510
Yeah. All right. We have to start concert.

229
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:20,500
Yeah. We're so close.

230
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:25,340
We're so close to Turkey. Yeah, you're right.

231
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,400
Yeah, I guess Turkey will pass.

232
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:35,220
That's. My son.

233
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:52,840
All. I said, Well, we gave you five, but you were two, right?

234
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:04,910
And you literally scraped up all the ready with and he was like, I saw it all, I.

235
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:18,190
Okay. So we're going to be talking about cervical cancer today.

236
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:26,930
And I'm Alisyn, Alex. I'm Priyanka and Jake's online stuff.

237
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,629
So we just want to note that it's not just women who get cervical cancer, but anyone who has a cervix,

238
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:45,400
including transgender individuals, non-binary folks and intersex people.

239
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,900
Much of the research we found use the term women when talking about the disease.

240
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:59,830
Therefore, we have mirrored some of this language in our presentation in terms in terms of statistics and just noting that research throughout.

241
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:09,850
So this is a road map of our presentation. It's pretty much laid out similarly to the paper discussing the disease burden, risk factors,

242
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,550
disparities upwards, treatment and survivorship, as well as ongoing research in the future.

243
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:25,420
So when looking at the disease, we're going to dive into the current burden both nationally and globally.

244
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:31,030
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women globally and the

245
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:34,510
leading cause of cancer related deaths for women in developing countries.

246
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:40,960
There are immense disparities that exist amongst who is diagnosed as cervical cancer on a national and global scale.

247
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:48,100
Taking a closer look at the U.S. Cervical cancer is a persisting health issue,

248
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:53,319
we can see and both of these are map displays and the majority of cases are

249
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,070
found to be linked with individuals residing in medically underserved areas,

250
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:04,420
which is therefore linked to poverty, race, ethnicity and health disparities as well as social determinants of health within these areas.

251
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:12,159
Cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates for South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi exceed the national rates,

252
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:19,549
with African-American women accounting for much of this difference. In 2018 alone.

253
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:25,970
When looking at the worldwide scale, over half a million individuals with services were diagnosed with cervical cancer,

254
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:36,590
resulting in over 300,000 deaths worldwide. Of these deaths, 90% of them were due to cervical cancer in low to middle income countries.

255
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:44,550
We can take a closer look at these disparities through these health statistics.

256
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:57,180
People who develop cancer in lower and middle income countries are point 7% higher than those in developing or higher income countries,

257
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:05,160
with the rate being point 9% in higher income countries and 1.6% in lower, middle, lower and middle income countries.

258
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:15,240
Among the mortality deaths due to cervical cancer are point 6% higher in lower and middle income countries compared to those of developing nations,

259
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:22,890
with higher income countries being at 43% and lower middle income countries being 8.9% of the population.

260
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:28,860
Mortality rates in lower and middle income countries can be up to 18 times higher.

261
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:32,520
So this is the greatest health disparities that we're seeing is that developing nations

262
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:39,260
are really seeing a heavier burden of cervical cancer deaths and diagnosed disease.

263
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:44,720
And now we're going to talk a little bit more about the risk factors and causes of the.

264
00:39:52,000 --> 00:42:17,389
She? So not trying to get in a little bit more to the disparities and social

265
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:23,750
determinants that impact the rates of incidence and mortality for cervical cancer.

266
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:29,240
So first, we start off with looking at rates globally and like we talked about earlier.

267
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:36,140
As you can see, 85% of new cases occur in low and middle income countries.

268
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:43,520
And actually, for 39 of these countries, cervical cancer is actually the most common cancer.

269
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:50,750
And of all of these cases, 90% of them occur and 8% of deaths occur in low and middle income countries,

270
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:56,120
which is almost three times the rate of high income countries according to global can.

271
00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:03,320
And then looking more specifically, the highest burden of cervical cancer is seen in East and sub-Saharan Africa.

272
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:15,080
And this rate right here on the screen, the 27.6 deaths per 100,000 is compared to the less than two deaths per 100,000 in Western Europe.

273
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:25,490
So some of the major contributing factors to these rates are access, like we talked about, access to screening services and vaccines for HPV.

274
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,909
When it comes to screening, less developed countries mostly rely on pap smears, which are a little bit less sensitive.

275
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:37,220
And then more recently, they've been relying on visual inspections of the cervix with acetic acid,

276
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,600
like we talked about in class a couple of weeks ago.

277
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:50,510
And this is especially due to the limited access to HPV vaccines and other primary preventative methods like condoms or dental dams.

278
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:58,790
And currently, when looking at the HPV vaccination rates provided by the W.H.O. from 2015 to 2021,

279
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:04,099
you see a jump from 5% to about 26% of women receiving their first dose.

280
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:08,840
So that's not even completing the entire regimen. That's just the first dose that's in the African region.

281
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:19,310
And then in comparison in the Americas, it actually dropped from 59% to 51% from 2015 to 2021.

282
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:29,450
And there are often financial barriers and infrastructure issues in health care systems in areas like Eastern Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.

283
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:36,349
And you also see this frequently in Southeast Asian countries that contribute to low vaccination rates and

284
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:43,010
interventions to improve these vaccinations have found a lot of success with school based intervention programs.

285
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,590
Two of them were actually launched in Rwanda and South Africa, and both of them saw really great success.

286
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:57,950
I believe success rates were somewhere around like 96, 97% of all the young girls finishing at least their first dose of the HPV vaccination.

287
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:03,920
But one thing that I wanted to note that I found in my research was something to be considered in,

288
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:09,860
especially these regions that have reduced access to screening and vaccination services is that there

289
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:17,660
may already be several generations of women living there that have already tested positive for HPV,

290
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:21,710
the HPV infection, or have already been diagnosed with cervical cancer.

291
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:26,600
So not only is it important to get these screening and vaccine services out to them,

292
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:33,920
but also getting them care after diagnosis and making sure that's consistent and beneficial for them.

293
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:40,640
And then so turning to the United States, there are multiple factors that contribute to disparities in cervical cancer rates.

294
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:44,600
And I want to start off by talking about the racial disparities.

295
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:47,870
So although rates generally in the U.S. have been declining,

296
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:55,880
there are racial disparities that perpetuate cervical cancer burden specifically for African-American women and nonwhite non white Hispanic women.

297
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:03,740
So specifically, Hispanic women are diagnosed with cancer almost twice as frequently as non-Hispanic white women are.

298
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:11,660
And as you can see on that chart, African and African-American women are also diagnosed at a rate about 1.5 times greater than white women.

299
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:13,790
And then when you look at the mortality rates,

300
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:23,310
you see that black women are dying from cervical cancer twice as frequently as white women and white women are also,

301
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:31,160
which is also the double double the rate of the mortality. And white women are also likely to be diagnosed at an earlier age than minority women.

302
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:40,370
And this is likely due to disparities in screening services and generally access of gynecology, gynecological care for black women.

303
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:50,870
And talking into more of the details of why these why this impacts rates is that the this is often

304
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:55,790
caused by the existing medical racism that impacts access to care and the level of quality of care.

305
00:46:56,270 --> 00:47:01,460
And barriers often include inadequate access to affordable and consistent reproductive health care,

306
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:07,850
lack of gynecological care, lack of transportation in rural counties, and lack of information.

307
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:12,530
And historically, this has also led to distrust of the medical system by minority.

308
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:19,849
Which may also impact the willingness of women of color to seek care, which leads to less frequent screening,

309
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:24,350
later diagnosis of cancer and worse quality of services for minority patients.

310
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:31,820
So socioeconomic status also carries a major impact on access to cervical cancer prevention and screening resources.

311
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,860
One study that I found actually looked at these cervical cancer rates between neighborhoods,

312
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:41,540
different neighborhoods of different standards in New York City.

313
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:49,160
And the study found that New York's lowest socioeconomic status neighborhoods had cervical cancer incidence rates

314
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:58,490
that were 73% higher than the mostly white and highest socioeconomic statuses status neighborhoods in New York City.

315
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:04,280
And some contributing factors are the reduced access to vaccines and screening due to financial barriers,

316
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:08,420
as well as the affordability of getting cancer care after diagnosis.

317
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:17,090
And medically uninsured women also have a lower cancer screening rates and often present at lower stages of disease.

318
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:24,620
And a lack of adequate health insurance is generally considered to be a major socioeconomic burden for receiving adequate health care.

319
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,920
And then looking geographically, finally, like Ali mentioned earlier,

320
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:35,780
southern and more rural states often see higher incidence and mortality rates than urban northern states.

321
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:42,230
And according to the CDC, age adjusted rates of cervical cancer is almost double for these southern states.

322
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:49,340
So we see around a range of 9.5 to 10.1 cases per 100,000 in southern states like Texas and Alabama.

323
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:59,630
And on the other hand, you see a rate of around 4.8 to 5.2 cases per 100,000 in northern more urban states like Massachusetts and Michigan.

324
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:05,360
And this is also due to disparities in access to care regionally and the accessibility of getting those services.

325
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:09,440
So it can be hard to get to appointments consistently or see a medical professional

326
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,100
in a timely manner because health care facilities are usually farther away,

327
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:16,760
harder to access, and not usually open after standard working hours.

328
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:21,680
And it's also important to note that all three of these factors coincide with each other

329
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:27,050
and often compound on each other when exacerbating the burden of cervical cancer on women.

330
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:32,690
And then I'm a little bit more into the prevention efforts for cervical cancer.

331
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:41,090
So starting off with primary prevention. Primary prevention efforts aim to stop the biological onset of cervical cancer by targeting HPV infection,

332
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,900
which, as we know, is estimated to cause up to 90% of cervical cancers.

333
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:52,910
And so these public health initiatives include widespread vaccination against HPV, as well as behavioral education surrounding safe sex practices.

334
00:49:53,720 --> 00:50:01,400
And like other immunizations against viral infections, HPV vaccines stimulate the body to produce antibodies that in the future,

335
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,210
encounters with HPV will bind to the virus and prevent it from infecting cells.

336
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:13,370
So the vaccine for HPV first became available in the early 2000, and now 98 countries have implemented vaccination programs,

337
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,500
although there is a larger concentration of HPV vaccination efforts in developed nations.

338
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:23,960
And then 60% of the American target population have received at least one dose.

339
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:31,160
And then, in comparison to no other developed nation, about 80% of the Australian population or target population have received at least one dose.

340
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:38,570
And then, as was mentioned earlier, the largest parity between who's getting vaccinated based on the country.

341
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:42,860
And so far, only 13% of the world's target population being vaccinated.

342
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:47,840
And some studies estimating as low as 2% of Africa's target population being vaccinated.

343
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:55,730
Although, however, it should be noted that target population is different for almost every study, and so global comparison is not always easy.

344
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,970
Additionally, while only people with a cervix can get cervical cancer,

345
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:05,359
still important to vaccinate everyone in order to limit the transit transmission of HPV to people who do have a cervix,

346
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:11,570
as well as HPV can cause other types of cancer. So overall, in the 20 years that the vaccine has been available,

347
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:16,580
there have been important strides to vaccinate the population, but still a lot of work left to be done.

348
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:22,430
And it's important to continue the vaccination efforts because of its effectiveness in preventing HPV infection.

349
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:30,020
So the vaccination of HPV has only been in effect for about 20 years, and the population to be vaccinated is typically very young.

350
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:37,070
This means that not enough time has passed for us to see a lot of the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing cervical cancer today.

351
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:41,660
But something that we can see is the effectiveness of HPV infection.

352
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:47,090
So this meta analysis study examined the effectiveness in the HPV vaccine by

353
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:51,770
comparing HPV infection rates between PRE-VACCINATION and post vaccination periods.

354
00:51:52,430 --> 00:52:00,080
And it was between girls aged 13 to 19. And it showed that the overall prevalence of HPV types 16 and 18,

355
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:05,720
decreased significantly by 64% in a post vaccination period compared to the Pre-vaccination period.

356
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:10,790
It was important to note that this specific result is only for these two types of HPV.

357
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:15,680
However, it is these two types of HPV that account for about 70% of cervical cancers.

358
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:22,760
So this shows that there's a lot of promise that these vaccination efforts will have an impact down the road on the

359
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:29,750
incidence of cervical cancer due to their being less than vaccinated from HPV and then moving on to secondary prevention.

360
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:37,070
So secondary prevention efforts aim to aim in the early pre-symptomatic detection by the presence of HPV,

361
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:41,480
DNA, pre-cancerous lesions, or early onset cervical cancer at the population level.

362
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:48,320
And there are multiple methods that are used. And here I have a chart that highlights three of the approaches that are commonly used.

363
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:55,370
And so in most developed nations, the first cervical cancer screening that became widely used was the pap smear.

364
00:52:55,910 --> 00:53:01,820
And in the pap smear, there's a sample of cells taken from a person's cervix and is then examined by a pathologist in a lab.

365
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:10,130
And this is widely used because the pap smear is simple and safe to test, although the test has a high specificity which makes false positives rare.

366
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:18,140
However, the test is a sensitivity as low as 52% in some studies, which is encourage the research, development and use of alternative tests.

367
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:22,100
One of these alternative tests is the HPV DNA screening.

368
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:29,120
And this test does not check for the presence of cancerous cells, but it checks for the presence of HPV, DNA within cervical cells.

369
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:36,650
And so the test is performed similarly by sampling the cervix and then in a lab looking for the HPV DNA.

370
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:42,110
But it has a high sensitivity. About 94.6% is its biggest difference from the pap smear.

371
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,820
And then third, with via or a visual inspection with a C acetic acid,

372
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:51,049
a health care professional applies diluted white vinegar to the cervix and is able

373
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:55,970
to identify and then intervene upon our abnormal cells because they respond to the

374
00:53:55,970 --> 00:54:00,950
acid by turning white and via is especially useful in low and middle income countries

375
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:05,240
because it's safe and effective even when resources are not always available.

376
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:11,570
And additionally, while not listed here, another screening method is liquid based cytology as opposed to the others.

377
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:15,170
And how would you method and pap smear? And so unlike the conventional pap smear,

378
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:20,540
it involves making out suspension of cells from the sample and then using it to make a thin layer

379
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:26,240
of cells slide for examination and is thought to be more effective than the traditional pap smear.

380
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,760
Well. And then in the US,

381
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:39,140
the USPSTF recommends that women age 21 to 29 years old receive pap smears every three

382
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:43,190
years and that women aged 30 to 65 years old receive pap smears every three years.

383
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:46,690
HPV, DNA testing every five years or cotesting every five years.

384
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:54,410
And so the longer gap of time recommended between testing for HPV, DNA is a result of its higher sensitivity as opposed to the pap smear.

385
00:54:55,490 --> 00:55:03,290
And then we had the global recommendations. So Pap smears and HPV, DNA testing are currently the recommended tools in high resource settings.

386
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:10,570
But in lower income countries, there are barriers to using these tools and achieving successful cervical cancer screening programs.

387
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:19,820
So these barriers include the need for frequent visits and for complex human, technological and systematic resources that can always be matched.

388
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:27,790
And so this is why the W.H.O. recommends that women in low and middle income countries have HPV, DNA testing when resources are available.

389
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:33,050
But when resources are not available, they recommend using via instead of passengers.

390
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:38,480
And then even with tests recommended specifically for low and middle income countries,

391
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:42,800
there are cultural barriers involved with women having cervical screenings completed by others.

392
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:47,450
And this has led to development of new tests, such as the hair swab, which allow for cell sampling.

393
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:53,180
Yet this cultural barrier still impacts the success of cervical cancer screening in many developed nations.

394
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:57,080
Additionally, all the screening methods I mentioned are not diagnostic.

395
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:01,970
And so after these screenings, there would be biopsies for proper diagnosis, which would then lead to treatment.

396
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:11,570
Yeah. So next we're going to dive into treatment and survivorship and the existing methods that exist.

397
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:16,040
Treatment for cervical cancer can vary among those diagnosed.

398
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,860
Depending on the stage and grade of the cancer in the body,

399
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:24,740
most women will undergo either radical surgery, radiation therapy or chemotherapy as treatment.

400
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:32,060
In 2015, there were over 200,000 cervical cancer survivors in the US who each phase their own

401
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:37,040
healing journeys based around healing journeys filled with victories and also challenges.

402
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:47,810
Some of these challenges that exist in the short in the short term include emotional, cognitive and social dysfunction and menopausal symptoms.

403
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:58,820
And some of the medium to longer term effects include bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunction and psychological or psychosocial issues.

404
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:05,809
These psychosocial challenges may include mood and stress disorders, body image and fear of cancer.

405
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:08,480
Reoccurrence among survivors,

406
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:18,440
there's noted to be a worse outcome for or survivorship experience with healing for younger patients and during hospitalization.

407
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:25,430
But these effects significantly improve by 3 to 6 months following treatment.

408
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:39,710
So one existing method that actually just came up pretty recently is bevacizumab, which is an antigenic agent,

409
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:47,000
and antigenic agents are usually anti and geodetic agents are usually additions to chemotherapy.

410
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:50,930
And what it does is it inhibits angiogenesis in cancer,

411
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:58,280
which helps to fight specifically late stages of cancer and reduce the likelihood of recurrence after patients reach remission.

412
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:06,650
So one particular one is specifically this one is specifically targets the vascular endothelial growth factor two.

413
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:12,380
And this is specifically helped with tumor shrinkage and delaying the progression of cancer in a lot of women.

414
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:17,570
And it's actually the first of its kind to show significant efficacy with cervical cancer.

415
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:22,430
And when this treatment is combined with platinum based chemotherapy,

416
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:28,430
one study found that it helped to extend overall survival beyond 12 months for cancer patients.

417
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:33,620
So it's currently the front line treatment for a lot of women and works very well.

418
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:41,390
But the drug is also incredibly expensive, so it is relatively cost prohibitive to many,

419
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:49,280
which presents itself as a barrier to like we talked about the disparities earlier to women who have lower access or are not insured.

420
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:59,570
And this may be more difficult to implement globally as a form of care, but for now it works effectively for the people who are able to afford it.

421
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:08,260
And now we're Jake is going to talk about ongoing research a little bit.

422
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:04,130
Yeah. So in addition to Russians spectroscopy,

423
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:12,470
there are there continue to be advancements in efforts to increase HPV vaccinations for women in the future under the age of 18,

424
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:19,249
increase HPV screening for women over the age of 30, continue regular pap smears,

425
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:26,420
as well as some of these other screening of cervical cancer detection, as well as continue opportunistic screening,

426
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:35,270
which basically is when people the services are in health care settings to either supply them with this HPV vaccine or these screenings,

427
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:39,679
especially if they live in rural or medically underserved areas so that they don't

428
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:43,520
have to return to get some of these screenings done or get this vaccination,

429
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:47,540
but do it instead when they are in these health care settings already.

430
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:56,060
And then two major health priorities that we want to leave you with include resource allocation of HPV vaccines,

431
01:03:56,330 --> 01:04:01,130
screening health and additional health care access within these low to middle income countries,

432
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:08,410
as this is where the greatest burden for cervical cancer exists, as well as technical innovation, new, rapid,

433
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:15,200
cost effective and sensitive technologies to better screen for HPV and cervical cancer in the future.

434
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:22,309
Researchers believe that the adaptation of new technologies and updated screening strategies will improve the impact that poverty, race,

435
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:29,180
ethnicity and social determinants have on cancer related deaths and reduce the global health burden of cervical cancer in the future.

436
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:43,200
Thank you. And these are resources. Everyone has a sense.

437
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:54,920
I have a couple of clarifications, questions I want to ask.

438
01:04:55,130 --> 01:05:01,100
So I think it is, Jake, you said that if more than 90% of cancer, cervical cancers are caused by HPV.

439
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:10,960
Is that right? Is that what you said? So I would push back on that a little bit and say 100% you.

440
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:20,830
This is the one cancer where, yes, it is, because it is a necessary cause.

441
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:26,290
Now, not every woman who gets infected with a high risk type of HPV will ever be

442
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:32,590
having a persistent chronic infection and therefore getting cervical cancer.

443
01:05:32,610 --> 01:05:48,090
Right. So there's some pieces there. But you have to have a high risk HPV infection because her pants are required to go back to life of her.

444
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:51,840
Why were you so prevalent to the US? There is a map.

445
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:04,540
That's why the titles of those two things. Cancer mortality rates by county.

446
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:16,360
It's just 1970 U.S. population. This is service era white females, 1970, 98, old white and black rates.

447
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:20,440
Okay. And that is that prevalence of the children prevalent.

448
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:27,570
This is. It says mortality rate and mortality rate there.

449
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:32,750
So not trying to pick on you guys. This is really hard, right?

450
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:38,999
Because all of these things are like specific definitions that mean something specific to just everybody.

451
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,290
When you're talking and when you're putting up slides, it's really easy to like say the wrong things.

452
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:47,700
So this is looking at mortality rather than prevalence, which is actually, I think a more.

453
01:06:49,390 --> 01:06:55,240
Maybe if more public health relevance measure for what you guys are talking about,

454
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:59,550
which is, you know, secondary prevention and improving screening or something like that.

455
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:03,070
Right. So I think this is great picture. I think you just have to be a little more precise.

456
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:07,749
And the other thing I'm going to pick on a little bit too, because it really has dropped.

457
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:12,129
So there's not a lot of I need to ask questions about, but everyone is doing this.

458
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:15,130
It's not you. I mean, you as an example, everyone is doing that.

459
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:19,690
Your titles are small, your ledges are small.

460
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:24,880
Take a little bit of time and orient me better to these pictures.

461
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:32,260
You see, I'm saying like say on the left, we have a picture that is showing you the mortality of white women.

462
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:40,010
Yeah. So here you can see the differences between mortality rates in white women and black women in the United States.

463
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:45,229
As you can see, the scale goes from it's a little hard for you, but the scale goes from purple,

464
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:49,250
which is quite high all the way down to green, which is pretty low.

465
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:53,780
So you see a lot of green in white women on the left.

466
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:57,070
Purple is the highest rate and that is in black women on the right.

467
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:04,400
So as you can see, there are there are geographic differences, heart rates and also overall mortality rate, something like that.

468
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,760
Also, I mean, kind of similarly when you show the bar graph of the different races.

469
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:19,330
Little orientation, as you can see non-Hispanic white to show all that on the left is a kind of solid gray.

470
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:28,629
And we're going to compare some of these other racial ethnic groups, particularly Hispanics, which is the round the half versus the vertical.

471
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:32,140
You know, the diagonal answers is the vertical line for black women.

472
01:08:32,230 --> 01:08:36,610
Right. And as you can see. All right. So just everybody is doing this.

473
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:40,420
All right. I do it, too, when I give a talk and I'm really into it.

474
01:08:40,810 --> 01:08:46,720
It's a skill that you have to develop a little bit. Taking the time because you looked at this, you know what it says.

475
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:53,380
Your audience doesn't necessarily know what it says and they are reading everything on the slide to be hard.

476
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:57,190
So just taking a minute to orient them to what you want them to see.

477
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:02,790
Yes, definitely. Yeah, that's just a for everybody. It's not just you guys.

478
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:07,520
You're the example, but it's for everybody. Right. You did a really nice job. I guess the questions.

479
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:13,340
Everybody wants to leave early Thanksgiving. Okay.

480
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:25,520
All right, everybody, have a great travel plan.

481
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:30,830
If you got you're being here. Don't forget to get credit for your presence.

482
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:37,490
Sign in over there. I forgot to bring the real sign in sheet, but you can use the Yankee one today.

483
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:42,050
He's bad guys.
