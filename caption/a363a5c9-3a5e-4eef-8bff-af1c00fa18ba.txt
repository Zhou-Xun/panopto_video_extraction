1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,470
This is the second part of the lecture.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:15,080
Now we are going to have a student presentation man who is going to talk about our game pass diet, some discussion about that topic there.

3
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:20,160
And then just let me make sure that it's a recording. Yes, it's a recording then.

4
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:24,270
Uh. Okay.

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,780
So my name is sure.

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:34,320
We already know each other. And my topic for today is the pasta diet during human evolution.

7
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,940
Oh, so here are the allies.

8
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,999
So we will start with a brief introduction of the realistic age and any old age,

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,620
and then we will talk about the two different dyes and then we will talk about the lines of evidence or celestial plastic and the Neolithic ideas.

10
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,100
And those three points are the three lines of evidence.

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:08,730
So on the family, we will talk about the Neolithic revolution and then the dietary changes and then the evidence.

12
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,930
Okay, so so this page,

13
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,740
the it just like our introduction to the people that I think age A's know as the old

14
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:27,380
stone age during this time early humans or the hunters or the gatherers were nomads,

15
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:32,340
so they didn't have permanent houses. So they used to live in the caves.

16
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,910
So because of that, they had to move from one place to another place where the food was.

17
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:49,140
Also at that time, the tool was made up of stones and animal bones, so they were used for hunting birds.

18
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,720
Wild animals are cutting these and here leathers.

19
00:01:52,380 --> 00:02:01,500
Also here in this age, the weather was very cold, so clothing were made from were so which is a view of the animals.

20
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,810
And then the plastic age and the Neolithic age were kind of similar, but still a little bit different.

21
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:20,190
Life changed a lot from the Neolithic age to the Neolithic age in terms of technology and culture.

22
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,970
This is mainly because of the agriculture revolution.

23
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,260
So we will talk about that revolution later today.

24
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:35,670
And so for the Neolithic age, we it's called the new Stone Age, or some people call it that.

25
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:44,580
So every time people started to kind of the way to land and the beginning to domestic cattle, sheep and goats and maybe other animals.

26
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:58,860
So so at the time so they have permanent houses and most of the houses were made from wood, our bricks, and they started to use clothes.

27
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,909
They're made by the skin of the animals. Quick question.

28
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,920
Do you remember doing agriculture or did you need it more or less?

29
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:21,040
When agriculture, when people started to domesticate plants around like a million years.

30
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:37,270
We want less than that. Says, Well, 544 and I don't remember this 100 and we think it is and I think the audience evidence is about $6,000.

31
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:44,290
And I was like 10,000 because that 10,000 was Dallas Ace Ice Age.

32
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:54,610
So just and then after that time was, you know yeah the reason and then I thought it was keep in mind when we talk about that,

33
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,829
we've been doing hypotheses that that's immoral,

34
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:07,540
that when all the famines and the selection for genes are related to body weight, that really would be happening.

35
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,360
So I don't think BRICS existed at this time.

36
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,740
So they were making bricks, but it's like still sometimes we don't like straw.

37
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:29,330
But their bricks are not our bricks. Embracing the place they were in comes from.

38
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:36,800
You just keep pushing the clay, mixing with the straw to make a little bit harder like that, Google told me.

39
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,750
I don't know. Maybe. I don't know if you are.

40
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,820
I know about it. Maybe more recent, but because I know down.

41
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,980
It would take more reason that that may be me, but we have had a good closure.

42
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,160
But the bars or just the things you've seen?

43
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,180
Yes. Some kind of break yet. More reason than that.

44
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,140
Right? Yeah. Yeah, about that by illustration.

45
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:12,960
Okay. So and then we would move on to different days.

46
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:20,660
So for the period that they died, they mean the their meals were mainly based on meat.

47
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:25,020
So they eat smile meals like rats and squirrels.

48
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:30,440
They also eat a really large animals and they also eat organs like bread.

49
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,080
So they work in your heart because of their high nutritional nature.

50
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:48,330
And also they owe eating their it become common in the lakes the wage and the fishing is also common even though they eat a lot of meat,

51
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,560
but they also eat seasonal vegetables and fruits.

52
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,720
But at that time, the lot like the vegetables they breathe.

53
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:04,920
So the lettuce was prickly and the potatoes were the size of peanuts and generally close to the size of berries.

54
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:11,100
But for some of those fruits, it kind of similar to what we eat today like always.

55
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,250
And also, do you have that? Because I don't see it is that reference.

56
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,810
Oh, I can. Okay. Maybe I'll on that. Yep. Okay.

57
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,090
Yeah. I don't know why it doesn't show. Okay. Yeah.

58
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:42,209
And so for this Neolithic diet, so people start to cultivate lands and develop small scale farms and agree the first plant based food to,

59
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,920
say, stone human begin to grow cereals.

60
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:55,170
Yeah, you're right on the lentils, beans and peas. So they at this time, they still ate animals like this don't eat meat.

61
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:06,270
But they started to grow more vegetables and fruit because of the animal models together to help grow food so this small picture can show.

62
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,500
So this pie, most were used for all fields and provided food.

63
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:22,310
And on the bottom it says year America in the Americans Neolithic human grows strawberries and pineapples and the people.

64
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:34,890
So your Asia heavy animals are very common and you make your the Mediterranean Sea humus grow face grapes and the olives.

65
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:44,400
And I this time people, they scour the use of spices, so they use the spices to flavor meat.

66
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:53,879
More importantly, they found the they made the dairy products for which is the first time appeared

67
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,140
in the human diets as two things happened during the agricultural auction.

68
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,850
This so hard to see. So the first one is humans, domesticated cows and it goes for milk.

69
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:14,190
And then the second one is human called the digest milk. But in the paleo living time, humans were lactose intolerant.

70
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:20,940
Yeah, I know. You remember. In one of our first classes, we look into the.

71
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:30,390
The frequency of the lactase, the Anita diet related to a lactase persistence in human populations.

72
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:37,349
And we saw that it is more frequent in European northern populations and that's also, you see more frequent,

73
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:43,680
I think in the region with the Middle East, and that would be related to selection for the ability to use dairy.

74
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:49,400
That's true. Mm hmm. Now, I read that these are just recent paper.

75
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:58,019
Yeah, I think it was published a couple of months ago. Um, then I didn't have time to put it in the in the readings,

76
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:06,300
but I've also seen that there is evidence that lactase persistence is not only related to the ability of consuming dairy,

77
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:13,530
but there are some genetic variant that is also related to the ability to fight infections,

78
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:26,160
and that gene could be related to some kind of immune function or during during time of maybe scarcity of resources when

79
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:33,569
people have the only access to food that they have worked any problems then are people without the early were more likely

80
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:41,580
for example to diarrhea or eating do it for due to starvation then is quite interesting that it could be dairy all with but

81
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:50,580
also related to a factor B side question for people with lactose because we see intolerance so they don't have the gene.

82
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:59,890
Crude lactase an enzyme so that people who have like lactose sensitivity where that falls kind of somewhere in the middle.

83
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:07,360
Do they lack the will yet is not because they like bought all we money we have we have the gene.

84
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,110
What what happened is that some form time during that what you end up in that you started

85
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:18,610
off great the sensitivity kind of falls somewhere and so all right because some people get,

86
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:25,629
you know, how sensitive that they are totally in the minor enough which I'm going to research

87
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,620
decline and then you know next week because I imagine that could be some because they are

88
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:35,020
also differing values of like these greatest that the differentiation yet and also can

89
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:41,050
be related to that degree for that being is praised and what okay things that might.

90
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,060
Yeah, I think so. And some people are very sensitive.

91
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:57,350
He showed the earliest proof that the earliest Greeks were founded.

92
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,000
Or like still early from something called the Whigs.

93
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:07,070
Oh, so rich. Oh, okay.

94
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:14,450
Yeah, well, I went to this little club of them to provide you how we might provide you about that would be related to these issues.

95
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:23,390
Okay. Hmm. Okay. So. So we are going to talk about the lines of evidence to us as we do that big.

96
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,710
Your lack of bias. So those are three of three lies.

97
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:33,799
The first one is morphological changes and the second was archeological material evidence.

98
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,360
The third one is that their measurement of die from the bone castrate.

99
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,750
I think we already talk about this in the first Harvard class.

100
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:50,270
Okay. So four. So they are to me in morphological trance.

101
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:54,800
They're all the time in the illusion of the whole human eye line.

102
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:00,650
So this first one is a humorous crystallization of mandible and the other cranial features.

103
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:15,350
So in the early, also early humans such as Australia, Australia, low places since I don't know how to pronounce the word.

104
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,650
Okay. So you observe it. Yeah.

105
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:30,769
So such as those two groups, those two people are characterized by two mass mandibles, and the more, the more robust a species.

106
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:36,589
How significant muscle attachment. So those features are also found in gorillas.

107
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:46,940
We who have entirely vegetarian diet and require the large mandibles and the strong cranium muscles for the crushing and upgrading of plant food.

108
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:53,930
But later on, the fish with our lives pronounced in the subsequent species,

109
00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:05,510
many researchers interpret the mandible realization as being due to a ubiquitous consumption of meat which lies fibrous than plant food.

110
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,870
And therefore, is it really easy to take it?

111
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:20,209
And also, researchers have argued that there is a link between the meat consumption and this the second to the second temporal trend,

112
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:25,100
which is the increasing process. We will talk about that in the next slide.

113
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,930
I think next next week we will discuss that. The brain size.

114
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:39,910
Yeah. In the next slide. So so also for those animals with larger brains, the research found out that larger breasts,

115
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,190
he means a greater intelligence, but the larger rats are expansive in terms of energy needs.

116
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:51,079
So the higher energy needs, if larger breasts required,

117
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:57,240
cooled by cool cooking meat by the consumption me, which is more energy efficient food than the plants.

118
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,690
And so this is like the second part.

119
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:08,460
So the second one is the increase in size, which would reflect the well,

120
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:15,799
the capacity and the evidence from the analogy with modern primates such as

121
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,900
chimpanzees show the increase in brain size has been linked to increased intelligence,

122
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:26,900
which implies increasing use of tools for the collection and the processing of the food.

123
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,060
And so this a second lapse of the evidence.

124
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:43,440
So we know that organic materials are extremely unlikely to survive this,

125
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:50,380
in part so we do not have any plans or animal remains from the evolution high were.

126
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:58,600
So we do how one artifact hat that does survive which is the stone tools is not always the

127
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:09,970
first tool that can be shown to have been created by the human the human guy who made that.

128
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:20,890
Okay. So so which is the really simple way industrial powers, grabbers, they operate in Africa.

129
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:30,010
We found them at the so called home bases from the time period of East Africa.

130
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:39,790
This is this what we know so far. We don't know the specific uses of the tools, but we know those tools,

131
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:50,530
probably how multiple uses and study how be should the majority of the of the tools are query for hunting and poaching game.

132
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,870
Oh. So this is the last line of the evidence.

133
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:06,670
We talk about the stable isotope so we can see it has the carbon and nitrogen.

134
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:20,350
So we use this isotope to to derive to measure the die from the eye from the.

135
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:33,490
So we used to stabilize all of the elements such as carbon and nitrogen to the right measure of the past,

136
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,170
to diet throughout the chemical analysis of surviving time.

137
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,129
So primarily we use bone ecology and the tooth enamel.

138
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:51,900
So the ratio of the carbon and nitrogen in bone college reflects the value of dietary protein.

139
00:16:52,950 --> 00:17:02,660
So after we measure so after we measure the values, we can determine the sources of the evidence.

140
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,360
The average death for a protein over the long time.

141
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:12,080
And we also can differentiate the different proteins.

142
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:26,310
And then we know that the three people, ones we just talk about is and we know the type of animals that consume them and check the label of proteins.

143
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,059
So we also used to,

144
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:44,610
in our enamel hedgehog say a positive value which reflects blood by carbon evaluated contribution from Lopez carbohydrates and protein.

145
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,700
Therefore, the while you kind of reflect on total diet.

146
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:55,530
Oh yeah he had important to remember the what information having given that you can type of evidence

147
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:06,900
the morphology what evidence relies the then technique of where also the high level remain

148
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:11,309
because they are all giving us complementary evidence and we are trying to we're trying to

149
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:18,600
reconstruct the past diet based on that type of evidence that any of these areas have is trends,

150
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,340
limitations in suggesting what you do about that.

151
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:31,020
So if the blood bicarb gets high. I.

152
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:44,489
What I mean the sort of that so it's so it says it reflects the diet if it's high.

153
00:18:44,490 --> 00:19:01,060
But does that mean that it's either doesn't that I have a kind I know because it could make you more protein calcium level below.

154
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:12,930
Yeah but it should be reflecting the is from tooth but where represent that do you find that in.

155
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:20,250
I can pick him apart. Yes, I know about that victory.

156
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:31,230
That's important. But the fact is, I think it's the first time he's had another type of maybe where we can repeat with me,

157
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:39,260
yes, we have an F, but they have a lot of carbon there.

158
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,860
Then maybe they have a larger variety of them.

159
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,780
Let me look at what I let you know. Yeah. Okay.

160
00:19:51,310 --> 00:20:01,690
Okay. So for the last part of my presentation, I will talk about the agriculture revolution because a change is what we eat.

161
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,629
So when we say when we talk about agricultural revolution,

162
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:16,570
we also means the Neolithic revolution because people started to cultivate food

163
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:22,600
and the more they started to eat more vegetable during this time many years ago,

164
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:34,360
because of the climate change or the commemoration, humor in the Near East began to cut off paths, and the later on they started to domestic animals.

165
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:42,160
So because of the changes, at least to an increase in the total population and the urbanization.

166
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:53,890
Besides the Near East, the adoption of their culture also occurred in independently in other part of the world.

167
00:20:53,990 --> 00:21:01,320
So age old rice was a domesticated plant and then in the new world as well, some in domestic lands too.

168
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:13,650
So in the whole world we see a gradual spread of agriculture through all the old to the new world, and then we see a increase in the total population.

169
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:22,800
However, starting at this time, due to the changes in diet, we started to see a decline in health.

170
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:29,520
And then we started to see some nutritional disorders.

171
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:43,690
You know what kind of disorder? Yes. Because that thing with when people started to domesticate plants, they that they were just a few plants then.

172
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,970
Now we need to imagine.

173
00:21:47,980 --> 00:22:00,710
And although we know from the evidence that that was and there was you variation of geographic areas and another time it was we know that they were.

174
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:09,850
We know, for example, that we're quite sure they have farming by law funded by the way another group that has to a law doing hunting hunter that is

175
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:21,580
now the the problem with the agricultural when we adapted to depends just a few crops and we were more depending if we have of

176
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:32,500
rain you would double whether it was well was it no farming was was enough food to in that region because now also you would

177
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:39,280
you need to think that people would get this started to be feeds in a certain point to do the farming to protect the growth.

178
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:46,149
And they were not just going, uh, then there was, I know that if we compare them, for example,

179
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:55,010
bombs and again you have what you are group that what farming another another group that we're doing on developing the bomb from the farming group.

180
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,740
They tend to be as more layers.

181
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:06,640
There was also deficiency it being we get warm something that they both deficiencies compared to the humphrey gatherers.

182
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:18,140
Now what is then the question is why would keep doing farming is money money money.

183
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:28,310
It did accelerate our population so just because we were the and we were still reproducing like that and also that at that moment

184
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:36,330
in the stock the more the because we're not we observe that in nonhuman primates that is in chimpanzee we have all certificates.

185
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:39,400
One group, we have a high ranking males.

186
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:48,110
But when the start of agriculture, then the human society started to be more dissatisfied.

187
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:56,900
And then where some people do work. Yes. What do you think foods then what whether people that because the also there was an excess of food eventually

188
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:04,149
and there were a group that were able to participate were not productive activities if any mating or

189
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:15,610
that type of activity that we brought societies soil because that is like freeing up time for women because

190
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:23,600
because I had a gathering of women like brought in a material intake just like to a gathering and stuff.

191
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:32,770
So like, is that one of the reasons that we as a country and yet we were able to be scientists activists were

192
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:38,709
not imitating their work as opposed to the less well it advantages that capability of did we know that

193
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:46,030
one what the exactly event with these and efficiencies human population growth that we know that people

194
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:55,870
in population was growing also went to this got that in another lecture about our immune system.

195
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:05,170
But you can imagine now people living close we grow for the growth of one another to white animal but now where domesticated

196
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:11,890
then there was more risk when you victims or you picked you had you perceive from way animals or domestically only humans.

197
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:18,550
And then what went to this was that in the part about human immune system but yes but also of

198
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:27,700
are equal for you gave for you to to protect that we know it our philosophy eventually science.

199
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:33,310
That's why I think it's so interesting that the food revolution we're having now because.

200
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,310
Society is the stuff. So it's kind of.

201
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:46,840
It's kind of like hyper utilize the system, but it is the base versus it's like the base.

202
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:53,630
Food in the green room. Get the green light and face to face.

203
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:04,220
We got the opinion that, yes, enough of your people green would be in the work to feed the world.

204
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:14,840
Now that he's asking us to think about whether we got the painting that your nephew brought, it is also addiction to food to into to this world.

205
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:24,180
If we are addicted to certain foods, then we are used to it and then we get to the variety is the balance and addiction is that concentrated?

206
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:30,350
We're going away from the phones. Yeah.

207
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:39,470
And also I put that me I have this I look at science.

208
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,900
Okay. Okay.

209
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:51,590
So so in the previous slides, we are to talk about all the changes in our society and our health associated with the adoption of agriculture.

210
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:56,190
And then now we want to see the dietary changes, you know, used.

211
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:04,460
So we have evidence for all human control, all domestication of wild plants and animals.

212
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:14,240
So there is indications are that this is a gradual process in the region as people respond to the climate of valuations.

213
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:23,060
So one theory is that the uncertainty in the availability of foods that the coming changes brought,

214
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:31,940
they may help these people to start to plant crops and to raise their own animals so that they have enough

215
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:40,210
food so they can make sure they have enough food resources and they can no longer rely on the wild food.

216
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:44,780
So they would they would have time to collect in the period of stability.

217
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:50,720
Eventually, they became not dependent on their neo domestication.

218
00:27:51,710 --> 00:28:00,440
So also it is time the wild animals slowly disappeared because of the climate change and maybe because of the overhunting.

219
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:05,360
So platforms become on as city as there are fewer animals to count.

220
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:12,410
Domesticated animals such as sheep goat begin to replace the hungry animal in their diet.

221
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:18,020
But plant food in the form of oleander breath became dead with stables.

222
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,339
So how do we know there?

223
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:36,800
Is that how it changes? So we do have indirect evidence and derive habitus for the indirect evidence studies show or decrease the wild animals.

224
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:44,590
And for the direct evidence we see the generation changes and the changes in of the bones in men.

225
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:59,330
So when we talk about morphology, they are changes in stature and carries rate with the introduction of agriculture in Europe.

226
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:07,460
So they are increasing heart rate associated with the domestication of the rice in South Asia.

227
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:19,580
And then we see the overall decrease in the health and the stature associated with the spread of maize agriculture in North Africa,

228
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:28,760
Central Africa and South and North America, Latin America and Central America and South America.

229
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:36,559
Also, some islanders show that researchers found the remains of domesticated plant that have survived,

230
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:45,170
especially in those dry environments, which also provide evidence of their domestication.

231
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:54,500
So Be says that in many areas we also found the direct, stable isotope evidence of the inner life.

232
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,780
Yeah, I think that's all I have.

233
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:06,069
Questions. Comments. Okay.

234
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,340
Now, that was great. Thank you. Thank you so much. You. Yeah.

235
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:19,750
To summarize. And then just keep in mind what we know about our diet in the past, what kind of evidence we have,

236
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:31,629
um, the strength of imitation multiple variants, um, and what more and I guess just keep evolving.

237
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:39,250
Keep in mind the, the, the less I look a lot of variation over time your graphic.

238
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:45,910
Most likely be before the advent of agriculture or if I what I say to the Indian

239
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:50,070
because they were hunting the Western resources one lady just moved one of place.

240
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,629
Then they went these barriers on diets and now what we the or you can talk now

241
00:30:55,630 --> 00:31:01,900
when you've been in CDs or in in groups and they are more dependent in our

242
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:15,220
own crops now we're looking to get animals that are going to affect our immune system because now we have you hate the infectious agents and you see,

243
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,640
well, well, how do you manage to rule out what you might what you.

244
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:24,249
Yeah. Okay then for next week. Okay, I'm going to post homework for next week as well.

245
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:30,960
We then I will post homework. They would be the all the type of wisdom that we had discussed at the end.

246
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:38,380
So I see hard. And then next week I feel the next topic is brain size evolution.

247
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:45,100
I think even they don't have this too important topic. Then I would just like to the whole piece.

248
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:51,159
Then please read the papers. Feel free to say many, many happy with many comment.

249
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,190
And then I will see your mom. Okay. Thank you, professor.

250
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:54,900
You.
