1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:09,740
Okay. So. Okay, so I got a hint back and you're going to hand me.

2
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:19,780
So I guess it's.

3
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:29,960
What if you a group wants to like your whole life 7 minutes so the other stuff.

4
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:52,790
Yeah. I think I missed my Warren.

5
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,110
Yeah, I mean, I think he would.

6
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,840
Yeah. Great. Yeah, I mean. Okey doke.

7
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:40,500
Now the around. And he becomes a sort of.

8
00:01:53,620 --> 00:02:04,090
And if she does, she.

9
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:18,860
Okay. The prevalence.

10
00:02:51,420 --> 00:03:11,250
And we've been witnessing and waiting, as you know, hundreds of thousands of years say.

11
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:20,110
A little bit of good.

12
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:43,520
Yeah. No, I don't, I think appropriate for The New York Times.

13
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,480
I think it's clever.

14
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:59,580
And I think you can get.

15
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:16,960
You should. I thought you were a unique case.

16
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:30,580
Thank you. In.

17
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:46,520
Thanks so much for torturing me.

18
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,660
You know, I.

19
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:48,680
Okay. Just before you said, I want you to get anybody here to give you an example.

20
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,560
Uh oh. Your pussy cat.

21
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:02,830
Oh, you Kevin. Yeah, right. Sorry. I just misread. All right.

22
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,530
I'm sorry. It's not until you're there actually handed over.

23
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:23,380
Okay. So I'm just kind of, you know, what did it again?

24
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,150
There's a new pen. Yes.

25
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:42,980
Okay. So. Me mean 65.

26
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,020
Aviation 17. Kind of put yourself on the curve there.

27
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,910
So a couple of things. Remember, this is only 20% of the grade and it's a hard exam.

28
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:03,559
I recognize that. So, you know, I'm a little a little cagey about how I'm going to actually be doing the grading on the end.

29
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:10,890
But but basically, everybody in here has got to some flavor of a, B or better with a large majority of you having A or better.

30
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:16,430
So don't don't panic if you got in the 16th, let's say, on this and this exam.

31
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:23,120
So I think in retrospect was probably a bit harder, even though tend to tend to hard exams.

32
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,690
But let's go ahead and go over.

33
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:33,979
It kind of hit the key points because there were a few things I think that I thought would be the people really should have mastered.

34
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:39,770
And there was some some shakiness on that. So. Okay.

35
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:49,250
So for the first problem, I would just ask you to compute me if I gave you that, give me the truth.

36
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:58,909
Right. So we're in our potential outcome setting, not necessarily randomized where we sort of, you know,

37
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:04,730
have have you now are in this like position of knowing the potential outcomes in both arms.

38
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,820
So as you compute the observed treatment effect.

39
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:20,750
So basically that means you go through and everybody who's one, you observe that for the treated group and then for the control group,

40
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:27,140
the outcome is whatever is here and you look at the difference in that and get 3.76.

41
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:37,120
So. Okay. But then for the average causal treatment effect, now you have to look at the mean at all.

42
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:47,270
Potential outcomes in each treatment are kind of ignored for treatment assignment and you get a small about 2.6.

43
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:59,709
Okay. Then I asked you to compute the ace among the treated, so it's basically the same thing you did before,

44
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,200
but now you're just among the people that were assigned to treatment.

45
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:12,160
So you get a number that's pretty, pretty similar to the observed treatment effect.

46
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:22,900
Again, you're looking at the the difference here. So, you know, to four, 6 to 4.

47
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:29,290
So I'm just dividing by the number of people assigned because the mean.

48
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,050
Right. Only two of the people get treated. Okay.

49
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,870
So any questions about that piece?

50
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,450
Very is good on that. This is it is real fundamental.

51
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:48,030
So you've got to make sure you're you you had issues on things you know, that you understand it now.

52
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,520
And finally, the commentary was incredibly kind of generous on this.

53
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:04,290
But the basic idea here is, is that, you know, obviously, the the observed treatment affects bigger than the causal treatment effect.

54
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,459
Why is that the case? Well, essentially, you have nonrandomized treatment.

55
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:23,760
So basically, everybody has sort of a sort of a larger outcome under treatment is so this is like

56
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,490
a decline let's say in pain scores is is assigned to is a is assigned to treatment.

57
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:42,150
So you're essentially don't have a randomized assignment and you're getting the sort of larger treatment effects.

58
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:48,990
The individuals who have larger treatment effects are actually the ones who are who are assigned to the treatment.

59
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:55,890
And so you get you get this sort of what looks like maybe a bit of bias, little sample.

60
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,820
We're selling population. Okay.

61
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:10,240
So questions on that. Okay.

62
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:19,240
Now then part two basically took the same data, but now we had a sort of a measure as to whether the the headache was severe.

63
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:27,640
So where X is or is are covered here.

64
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:33,639
I asked for evidence of confounding. Probably the easiest way to do this since you know,

65
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:39,910
the since you actually know this truth here is you can look and see what the treatment effect

66
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:44,230
is among the individuals assigned to treatment and the individuals assigned to control.

67
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,350
Right. If this were truly randomized to these be equal.

68
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:57,190
And then similarly among who gets assigned to what I'm sorry, among those that are that are have high headaches versus those who have low headaches.

69
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,200
So, I mean, sorry. So let me take that back so that, that, that is something that would occur.

70
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:08,230
Um, you know, this is, this is just the way the world is.

71
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,920
But the issue is here that we the, a, the assignment,

72
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:21,069
this is what we would like to have balance in X that that the assignment is, is imbalanced, right?

73
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,330
So the subjects that are sort of severe headaches are all assigned to treatment,

74
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:33,490
whereas those who don't have severe headaches are less, you know, having less than 30, 50 chance of being assigned to treatment.

75
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,360
So X is associated with both the causal effective treatment.

76
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:50,770
That's just the way again, that's sort of like that's something that as a as a designer of the study, you have no control over.

77
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,110
But it but it's also assigned it's also associated with the treatment assignment.

78
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:02,500
So it's essentially a confounder, right? There's sort of arrows going in both to the outcome and to the assignment.

79
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,260
So that's why we get this sort of outsized effect.

80
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:13,660
When you look at the observed means. Right. The assignment is is.

81
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,370
It's associated with with X. I mean, that's another way to look at it.

82
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:31,540
So. Okay. So any questions on that one?

83
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,680
Okay. So all right. So number three, definitely give me a little bit harder here.

84
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:47,960
So we're kind of returning to this example of causal effects in the presence of noncompliance or principal stratification example worked on.

85
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:55,080
And it actually turns out that we could actually get estimates in our, in our example that we used in our,

86
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:02,250
in our class notes non parametric like if we assume randomize if we have since we have randomized treatment assignment and

87
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:08,790
if we assume month the and the exclusion restriction so we don't actually have to resort to the full easing approach.

88
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:23,580
So my first question was basically to sort of get all the other components we need for our hour or two to obtain our or our case.

89
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:29,940
And it starts with getting the distribution of the compliance classes or estimates of that distribution of the compliance classes.

90
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:38,010
So again, price of CS or compliance price of all these takers, price of never takers.

91
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:45,780
So right in that corresponds to these potential outcomes for treatment taken given assignment.

92
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:52,620
So, so if you follow your assignment with your treatment, taking your employer,

93
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,989
if you always take the treatment regardless of assignment, then you're always taken and you never take it.

94
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:10,680
You're never take it. So the first key issue in this is to understand that these because assignments randomized the distribution of the always

95
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:20,250
in the never takers is going to be the same in each of the treatment assignment in each of the treatment groups.

96
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:26,700
So we can just look at the proportion of people who took.

97
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,910
The treatment, even though they were randomized to control.

98
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,239
And similarly, the portion of the people who did not take the treatment,

99
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,820
even though they were randomized to treatment, they get estimates of price of possible ampicillin.

100
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:57,240
So basically it's basically all becomes 15 out of 15 plus 22 and PI seven becomes eight out of eight plus 26.

101
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,940
Eight over eight plus 26. See, we look at the marginal council on this one.

102
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:10,670
This is 34 is 37. So it's 15 over 37 and eight over 34.

103
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:18,140
Once you have that, of course they have to add to one so you can compute your compliance from that.

104
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:31,160
So the two key things are randomization. That means we can just look at the abstracted serve distribution here to get possible in

105
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:37,020
place and and the fact that the probability that to some to one we don't have the virus.

106
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:43,060
Right there's only three classes got two of them. When you go to the probabilities, you can get the third by.

107
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,530
Something for a minute. Sort of mix on this.

108
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:08,480
Okay. Now, then, for the next step, we had to actually get these.

109
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:14,389
We wanted to get these means of the ultimately be the always takers and the never takers.

110
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:18,920
But I guess, I mean, of the of the players in the treatment of players in the control to get the case.

111
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:32,510
But I think for the first part of that sanction, I realize that it was requested.

112
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:45,680
But but we can also get possibilities of in so, so possible basically means because we don't have any difference,

113
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,940
right, between the means and treatment control if you're an always take or never taker.

114
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:57,350
So for for Landis available and then the so that we can just look at the means of the wise in

115
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:03,379
the in the groups that correspond to that so right so basically everybody again randomization.

116
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:08,390
So we know that the number takers in this group are representative of all and there were takers.

117
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:16,940
So we can just look at it the mean within that and since there's no discrepancy between the two we can just use.

118
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,190
Essentially why subzero.

119
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:32,110
You get an estimate of that from just a by zero one so these are the individuals that were assigned to control and took the treatment.

120
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:40,060
And similarly, we do the same thing now for individuals that were assigned to treatment but took the control.

121
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:48,580
So that gives us an estimate of 5 to 7 pretty good on there.

122
00:18:50,080 --> 00:19:02,500
That's actually really needed for the case. But. But then now for the case, it's a little more work.

123
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,690
So basically you have to sort of go back to the mixture components, right?

124
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,430
So basically the people that are assigned to.

125
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:27,830
To get the compliance factor, to get the essence of the mean and or compliance under the players assigned to treatment.

126
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:33,620
Right. So that's a mixture. We can look at the people assigned to treatment in their lives.

127
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,190
So that's a mixture of compliance.

128
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,210
Right. And always takers.

129
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,480
So we need to isolate this piece here.

130
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:55,610
So if we solve for that and do the algebra right, we can bring multiply by the denominator,

131
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:02,660
gives us that subtract off this piece here and divide by its component to give us that piece there.

132
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,410
So we know all these things, right? We know we've gotten estimates of this.

133
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:20,969
So. We observe that and we have an estimate of this rate from the fact that these things are equal, so they're just price of oil.

134
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,500
So I think the that we do believe that some sorry the way Mr. Nelson.

135
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:38,850
All right. The Winsome. Maybe her.

136
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:54,879
Two zero. I think this is a typo.

137
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,030
I think this actually is the correct number. But I'll double check that.

138
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:11,080
That should be. Y y pa zero one.

139
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:37,330
And then you can plug in replies, which was the question.

140
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,530
So this should be White Bar zero one, right?

141
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:48,730
Because this is our estimate of the means of why one makes the always takers.

142
00:21:52,840 --> 00:22:02,880
I suppose to double check that math. This should be my bar one zero down here.

143
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:19,690
So we basically play the same game for solving for the expected value of like zero the player group.

144
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,770
It's a mixture of of can players and never takers.

145
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:31,240
Now for the subjects that were assigned to control and did not take it.

146
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:47,160
And then once we have those two, we could subtract them to get the case. Because we're able to be kind exclusion restriction.

147
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:58,310
The fact that we're one of the necessity allows us to essentially estimate every quantity here except for the the one we need this little piece here.

148
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:06,990
These are all more forms of data and the same thing on the.

149
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:31,940
On the. On the other. On the other. You know, if she's about that, you might need to do.

150
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:39,120
The key thing, right? This is the mixture piece, right? The people that decide the treatment take it.

151
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:45,570
They could be either compliant or never take it. Always take care. People are assigned to control and don't take it to be a compliant or never take.

152
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:57,920
All right. So final issue where these might differ.

153
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,370
Maybe it's because I need to hear my solution, but.

154
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:07,759
But it's not going to look exactly the same because there are sort of parametric assumptions of normality with a constant

155
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,100
residual variance in fitting the model that we're not remaking with a non parametric approach to the weighting of these things,

156
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:18,110
maybe slightly differently. We do the mixtures and the pies will be slightly different.

157
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,950
I think I could see the PIs don't quite line up and either hold it quite close.

158
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,920
So. Those people had that part for before.

159
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:37,630
Definitely too hard. Should not have included this. But you know, it's always good to have a challenging problem.

160
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:47,000
It's probably a little bit challenging. So so basically at one point,

161
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:55,159
we had sort of said that that this would be an instrumental variable setting and that of the two stage lease terms approach that our

162
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:05,770
estimate or that we get when we regress Y on the predicted values of X with the predicted values of X are from the regression of X on Z,

163
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:13,340
which is our instrument that that estimate or that least squares estimate is also equal to the

164
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:19,430
covariance between Y and Z and the covariance between X as long as the conditions are met.

165
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:29,930
And I give people a little hint here, basically reminding you how regression works in terms of co variances and variances.

166
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:50,150
So I think look, I think the correct proof is basically here, which basically starts with showing that you can rewrite XY hat right as x bar had.

167
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:59,400
Times this covariance of the the variance of the consumers z bar.

168
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:10,760
So so then when we go to look at the overall mean of the X.

169
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,490
That's right. That's just going to turn out to be X bar.

170
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:21,960
You plug this in. Right. Which is something this up over all the ends.

171
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,490
So we get some cancelations here.

172
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:32,340
Well, actually, this this thing just becomes zero because we're going to be sending this over the ice.

173
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:37,410
So we just we just let it go with the next bar. So.

174
00:26:46,920 --> 00:27:00,120
So the next day I had an ASX bar, I had then becomes this covariance of x, y, z variance of z times this right because we're essentially.

175
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:09,680
We when we go back up to excise, subtract off this quantity here, we end up knocking off this X bar.

176
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:18,430
And then we just have this piece left over here. So which is just going to be this plus this component here.

177
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:24,580
So when we then go in to plug in.

178
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,759
So if we go back to our our two stage lead squares, estimate our beta half right,

179
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:39,340
which is going to be now the covariance between Y and X hat over the variance of x hat.

180
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:48,310
And we just plug in these quantities here for these differences between XY and the mean of X.

181
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:54,820
I had an image of x I had. Then we end up with this somewhat messy equation here.

182
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:01,630
But replacing this now has the covariance of x and y.

183
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:12,280
And this is the variance I'm sorry, the convergence of X and Z, and this is the variance of Z and taking the reciprocal right.

184
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:18,040
We get this part here for the numerator, this part here for the denominator,

185
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:26,950
and everything cancels out except for these these two covering covariance and these are estimating covariance right from the data.

186
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:46,739
So. So basically when we go and we start fiddling with this Ixi hat minus X hat bar, which we need down here for the two stage,

187
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:53,100
these squares estimate or we can see, we can write it in terms of these variances and cover instances of X and Z.

188
00:28:54,300 --> 00:29:00,030
And then we plug that in to the two stage least squares estimate or we get a lot of cancelation and we're just left with these currencies.

189
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:08,440
So. So the alternative version I also accepted.

190
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,990
Right to starts by writing this out.

191
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:25,239
The true covariance now in terms of the actual not the estimated but the true coefficients associated the two stage.

192
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,480
These course estimate are plus this epsilon term.

193
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:33,970
Right. So basically that's a constant by assumption.

194
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:38,920
These epsilon is here, but the core correlation means they are.

195
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,860
The covariance means you get epsilon of zero. So that leaves us with this piece here.

196
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:49,149
So you can rewrite it like this and now you plug in oh four naught.

197
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,410
Had an alpha one here die.

198
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:59,680
But there's no error term here, right? Because this is just the estimated value treating this as a constant.

199
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:04,030
Then we're left with this, which you can then.

200
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:10,900
So back here, this all starts off over here.

201
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:26,800
So in rewriting of one hand as the covariance of X and Z with the variance, z approach will lower cases since these are estimated values.

202
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,060
Right. Because it's an estimated alpha one and these are the true values.

203
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:35,790
So you end up with the true value of this over the estimated value.

204
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:39,130
That's right. Which is what we're after pretty much.

205
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:49,180
So so basically you sort of put a hat on that that everything becomes becomes the the estimated values.

206
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,740
I don't think this is quite correct because it kind of mixes the population and super population quantities.

207
00:30:54,310 --> 00:31:00,219
I can't quite figure out exactly what's but what we're sort of doing wrong here in this process.

208
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:10,350
But but it kind of gets at the same at the same point. So so I think that's those are basically sort of like this.

209
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:17,250
This seems to be sort of entirely coherent. So.

210
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:30,349
Right. Right. But that was basically the same point.

211
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:34,040
I mean, some. All right.

212
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:39,930
So some folks just plugged in, wrote down this covariance here with just X.

213
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,830
And that's not correct because that's not what Y is, is if you.

214
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,960
In which case, this epsilon number has this. Has this.

215
00:31:54,550 --> 00:32:03,970
You know, we're all, you know, has this it's no longer the cover instrument or zero so we can't just kind of get away with yeah,

216
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:07,720
you've got to do some extra, extra bit to kind of get everything cancel out here.

217
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:17,919
And the same thing up here. If you sort of start working up here and just write better, what hand is x minus x bar?

218
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,280
That's not right because it's not what the Tuesdays at least cause us to be. Excuse me.

219
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:35,210
Excuse me. X had. Right.

220
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:39,860
Questions about that. Chew on a little bit.

221
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,920
All right, last question. This was a kind of a two liner.

222
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:01,840
A lot of folks struggled with this. I know it's kind of was kind of the last metro we covered.

223
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:09,850
So maybe it's not surprising, but. But basically, you were just show the total effect of and exposure to some of the natural,

224
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:14,350
direct and indirect effects, an older model with continuous medium or a continuous outcome.

225
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:25,000
Right. So basically our natural indirect effect, if we write this in terms of potential outcomes and what the subtext of it for us, we can see it.

226
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:32,590
Right. So this is basically so again, we're in this situation,

227
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,510
we're looking at mediation where we assume that we can independently manipulate the treatment and the mediator.

228
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:48,129
So we have a potential outcome for Y given treatment and the mediator set to its

229
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:57,700
level would have another control versus Y where the treatment is set to control.

230
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,230
And again, the mediator is a value under control. The natural indirect effect.

231
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:12,459
Right. Just reverses this around. So now we're kind of keeping treatment level constant at the treatment and then we're letting the mediator

232
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,330
switch between the meet the value would have under treatment and the value would have under control.

233
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:24,430
Right? So the direct effect, basically the effect of the treatment that doesn't go through the mediator because we're holding the media constant.

234
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:31,150
You could do it at either level, but we're going to hold it for the definition of the natural artifact we're going to call the control level.

235
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:38,320
And then simply for the indirect effect, right? Hold treatment constant again, either level or consume.

236
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,310
It's like treatment versus control and then changing the mediator.

237
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:49,719
So that's just the definitions of these. So expectation linear function, right?

238
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:58,330
So you can basically see that the this piece is going to cancel with this.

239
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:11,080
And so I'm left with this effective value of Y given a and M today minus Y had a star in some star.

240
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:19,570
So that's just the total effect, right? Because the mediator is whatever gets under that assignment.

241
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:27,490
So the total effect is basically the use what you would observe had you been assigned true to treatment.

242
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:36,040
So the mediator, of course takes on its value, the treatment and then minus the outcome control.

243
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:45,970
So you could you could also think of of. Right.

244
00:35:46,060 --> 00:36:08,110
So basically we drop. Right, as long as the mediator in the treatment of the same values and this goes back to the similar potential outcome.

245
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:17,350
We're not worrying about the mediators independently. So some folks went through and did the extra piece of trying to work this out.

246
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:24,400
Assuming it's a little strong because this actually makes no assumptions right about how I am relating to y.

247
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:32,490
So if you go a little further and make these these assumptions that the expectations are linear in and right,

248
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,570
so that kind of models will work out before you can also get the same result.

249
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:40,590
It takes a lot more algebra, but it's not necessary.

250
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:49,640
You just go from this. So. But except accepted that even slightly more restrictive.

251
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,860
Yes or no.

252
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:14,480
The question is that this is a. Well, I think it is kind of linear in the sense that that we're going to assume that, you know, you may be correct.

253
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:21,719
I think that that we do need linearity. No, you don't.

254
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,140
Because this is entirely defined as potential outcomes. So.

255
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:40,060
Yeah. So probably don't even need this. It's probably unnecessary for this.

256
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,650
For this proof, although it's only worth the works.

257
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:50,800
The you do it it's kind of continuous meter to use outcome because we want to define the expectations in terms of the differences in the ways.

258
00:37:52,200 --> 00:38:03,080
So. Okay.

259
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:23,650
The questions. All right.

260
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:31,060
Happy to work one on one. Yes. So how is the derivation of a question for a different from the one we.

261
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:41,130
But why is it different? But I don't think that I don't think we did the same thing in class.

262
00:38:49,320 --> 00:39:01,410
We did do something similar to it. Did we? Yeah. We didn't like the alternative approach, something similar.

263
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:06,670
Okay. So. All right. Well, we do have xherdan.

264
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,790
Yeah. Well, that's that's the sort of a key piece.

265
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:32,790
Yes. I did try to double check.

266
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:47,730
We hadn't gone through this in class, so. All right.

267
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:52,680
Well, in any event, this is the proposed solution.

268
00:39:53,610 --> 00:40:01,180
I think the hint would be with the right thing. Okay.

269
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:15,070
Okay. So, again, happy to discuss specifics. I'm going to move on here, though.

270
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:31,110
So. They did want to do a little follow up.

271
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:49,670
We did a fairly long derivation. Down here to show that the natural and direct effect bias can be computed in this quantity here,

272
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:57,710
where the delta and gamma are essentially sensitivity parameters.

273
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:21,090
So. It's kind of got a little wrong footed on this part.

274
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:26,370
We don't think I'm kind of really concerned about the detail. It's a true natural, direct effect.

275
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:33,740
And there's no one there, right, in terms of these potential outcomes.

276
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:42,030
And the me to. Right.

277
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:55,220
So to estimate this sort of unobservable Y right, this is where we have treatment and then the median or the full value,

278
00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:05,570
we're actually going to look at our model or model for Y given an X, and then we're here to average over and it's going to control that support.

279
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:17,100
And it was a little fuzzy on. And then, of course, this here, the biggest walkout.

280
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:28,530
The bias in print is the smarter.

281
00:43:44,120 --> 00:44:02,529
It's just the difference in peace, right? So that's just the confrontation through the pages of your favorite book.

282
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:11,190
And then in that, we just boil it down to this here.

283
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:14,980
This is just looking at one slice.

284
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:49,460
So you use binary. Then we get these Delta terms, which essentially is sort of the arrow that goes by.

285
00:44:54,710 --> 00:45:07,600
One of. Treatment.

286
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,730
The garment is the part that goes. They?

287
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:54,460
They deserve to nail their first part down to make a difficult political.

288
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:46,930
To make this 100% clear, right? This matters versus the.

289
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:55,109
True. Okay.

290
00:46:55,110 --> 00:47:02,710
So. All right.

291
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:09,610
So I want to kind of go through an example in part because it's this sort of delta gamma stuff has been very vague.

292
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:14,980
And I wanted to at least go through one little example to kind of show how you might sort of try to put that into practice.

293
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:20,800
So there are examples in the text.

294
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:25,270
So certainly welcome to read those. I just kind of cooked up a little different one here.

295
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:36,520
So I'm going to go back to this situation where we're sort of looking at the mediator effect of adult poverty,

296
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:43,570
I'm sorry, to the effect of childhood poverty on survival as mediated by adult poverty.

297
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:50,350
So just start out with the effect of childhood poverty on survival.

298
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:52,720
So 35 years later,

299
00:47:54,220 --> 00:48:06,870
doing some kind of adjustment for some basic sort of age and race things where you want to sort of think of that as mediators or a confounders,

300
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,230
I think is another issue. But anyway, what?

301
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:11,470
This is what I've just done here.

302
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:41,030
So definitely see an effect, although it's not really quite significant of childhood poverty and survival comes close,

303
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:47,220
basically about a 16% drop in survival.

304
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:52,590
Odds of having experienced childhood poverty.

305
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:04,060
So if we want to try to just do a little bit of so the first thing going to do is look at a sensitivity analysis for the actual overall effect.

306
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:11,890
Not going to worry about mediation at the moment. So we have a binary outcome here.

307
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:16,720
We have a binary exposure of interest.

308
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:24,070
So I'm going to work with this sort of bias on this odds ratio measure.

309
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:27,130
So in order to compute this,

310
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:39,040
I've got to have this gamma function which essentially looks at how this one kind of unobserved confounder might affect survival,

311
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:48,820
having experienced childhood poverty, and then how this unobserved confounder is associated with child poverty itself.

312
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:56,900
Right. Certainly the odds essentially of a view the odds ratio of.

313
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:08,850
Well, no. The ratio, the probabilities of you pitiable one given experiencing child poverty and not experiencing child poverty,

314
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:20,520
controlling for all other X is going away here. So so Gamma essentially is this increase in the probability that life associated with you,

315
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:30,600
maybe some measured positive measure or negative measure of social capital not captured by gender, age, race.

316
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:36,180
But we also might expect, since the exposure is poverty,

317
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:45,419
we might expect that this this you is is that the that that if we think of you as sort of a measure of social capital,

318
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,900
that maybe it's it's probability is less than one. Right.

319
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:58,290
So, I mean, the probability of of you being able to one is smaller if you're in treatment that if you're a control condition.

320
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:03,600
So you're less likely to have some kind of like baseline social capital measure.

321
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:10,560
But if you're experiencing child poverty versus you're not.

322
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:24,820
So. So that gives us some idea about how we want to sort of consider sort of gamma or consider this ratio here.

323
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:31,450
And if we think of gamma is our is our social capital measure, right?

324
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:39,220
So it is the fact that if you all of the things being equal, even if you experience childhood poverty, you're going to do better if it's you.

325
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:46,960
But if you experience better, you're probably less likely to have this this sort of an observed kind of equal one.

326
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:54,550
So so this gives us some sense that we like sort of gammas to be bigger than one,

327
00:51:54,670 --> 00:52:01,420
let's say, yeah, we want this numerator probability to be smaller than the denominator.

328
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:05,050
Probability could conceivably flip that around.

329
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:09,219
But I do think you'd always want these sort of gammas of these.

330
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:19,000
You'd be going in different directions since this is an increase in survival or this is a, this is the numerator survival given that you as one.

331
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:25,820
So. All right.

332
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:30,210
I think me a little air here I may have flipped these the yes and no here I think.

333
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:55,290
Go check this. But. But. So basically sort of the ratios here.

334
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:05,130
So most of the current observed confounders, we sort of have sort of differences between like one half and one.

335
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:12,990
Right in terms of the observed confounders, but maybe a little less, little less than one half to approximately one.

336
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:21,620
So the sort of difference in the the rates of the observed excess by treatment.

337
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:33,000
So if we think about how we might want to have this, these is the sort of you began sort of this pretend social capital measure here.

338
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:37,710
You know, maybe having a really, really small doesn't make sense.

339
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:43,679
We sort of want it to be less than one, but maybe put in an upper bound of one half one.

340
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:50,580
This may make some sense, since it would have to be a really extremely different measure.

341
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:54,210
It would be a more extreme measure than the kind of things we're observing.

342
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:11,160
So then for Gamma, we can note that the actual probability of survival is about 80%, so the log odds of survival is about 1.44.

343
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:20,720
And if we go back and look at how these other things predict log odds of survival,

344
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:24,890
they sort of run between like point one, point six on the absolute value scale.

345
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:41,679
So. So that would lead to a log.

346
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:49,390
Odds of survival of 0.14 and .154 equals zero equals one.

347
00:54:53,190 --> 00:55:03,790
I'm sorry. Right.

348
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:15,160
So basically, if the if the overall probability of recall one is around 2.5, then if I work my way backwards to compute the.

349
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:22,330
The long odds of survival under you equal to zero and you equal one.

350
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:39,720
I would get. .139.149 if the log odds ratio is 0.1 and .14.

351
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:50,690
Yeah. In .14.175.

352
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:54,260
A lot of guys ratio is this point six. Yes.

353
00:55:54,900 --> 00:56:03,080
Yeah. You go back to the previous slide 34 and explain the intuition between the last comma there and that.

354
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:14,930
Right. So and I think I've got these flipped around, but essentially the odds of being female and in poverty about 1 to 1.

355
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:21,229
Right. There's no difference. So the probabilities are basically equal here.

356
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:28,490
The probability is about one 40%, and here the probability is about 60%.

357
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:35,000
So that they just sort of said one half is sort of been a reasonable measure.

358
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:50,950
So in the end, I want to convert these back off the log odds back to the original probability scales.

359
00:56:52,000 --> 00:57:03,159
So that would suggest that if I compare the log odds .149, compute the probability for that relative to the probability of the log odds.

360
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:07,720
And so I will .39. I get a difference in probabilities of about 2%.

361
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:12,310
And then if I can do this back.

362
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:15,100
Again for the.

363
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:27,500
To the actual probability from all gods at 1.75 with the actual probability of gods of 1.14, I get a probability ratio of about 12% or 1.1 to.

364
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:36,780
So these kind of give me low end and high end measures for Gamma, right.

365
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:41,390
Because I mean, here I'm trying to compute. Compute the schema.

366
00:57:46,960 --> 00:58:06,100
So. So I said Gamma to 1.011.12 and I took an intermediate value of 1.16.

367
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:20,610
And therefore these probabilities. I sort of used about 0.4 versus 0.6.3 versus point three.

368
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:30,809
The versus 0.67. So I end up with y one, two, three, four or five, essentially a three by two or six different sensitivity parameters.

369
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:42,180
And I look at here. So I plug those in and I'm keeping this constant for X.

370
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:45,150
So essentially can compute.

371
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:05,540
So I take you take one plus one minus one times this probability for a one plus one minus one, this probability for a star.

372
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:10,579
And I compute my bias. So I plug it in.

373
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:16,280
I get, you know, pretty, very, very small values when Gamma is basically one.

374
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:22,910
And the biggest value when I have the sort of largest unmeasured confounding

375
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:28,070
from the confounder to the outcome and from the confounder to the treatment,

376
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:32,420
although still the bias is not even 4%.

377
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:45,480
So given the corrected odds ratios and the intervals here I basically got from bootstrapping.

378
00:59:48,570 --> 01:00:01,260
So, so basically this this estimated reduction in survival, odds of 60% would still be sort of 12% or more under the range considered.

379
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:06,140
So we didn't quite. And obviously, I'm getting things moving things even closer.

380
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:13,020
The capacity increases any increases are moving things in closer to one.

381
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:18,870
But but, you know, it doesn't it doesn't make a radical change.

382
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:26,730
So my unmeasured confounding gets big here.

383
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:33,650
My predicted effect gets a little bit smaller, although it's not too dramatic.

384
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:40,760
And actually I take that back I think the right because I'm not I'm not worried about experience.

385
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:44,630
So all you have to do is take the odds ratio and.

386
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:51,910
At one point, 1.2.3.

387
01:00:55,060 --> 01:01:00,379
And so there's no source sensitivity analysis. So there's no fixing.

388
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:14,880
This is going to say what happened. No.

389
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:37,600
So if we think about this doubling of the rates of pew pew giving treatment versus peer view giving control is 2.3 versus .67 then I'm sorry.

390
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:46,009
So just more generally, if we if we think about the doubling of the rate between you and exposure in the unexposed,

391
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:57,070
we can actually work our way back to sort of see what the what the value of Gamma would be needed to completely eliminate this, this, this bias.

392
01:01:57,890 --> 01:02:07,080
So. What?

393
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:20,030
So I tell people to one.

394
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:29,310
And. I'm sorry.

395
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:42,830
So we want essentially the bias to sort of cancel out if it's peacekeeping.

396
01:03:45,190 --> 01:04:06,050
So you have these people. Which other than. Pursuing her wants to piece of you to.

397
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:55,820
Right. So basically just bring that up over there. They're there.

398
01:04:56,580 --> 01:05:29,290
This. Here. Okay.

399
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:35,970
So. Here.

400
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:41,240
You know, you hear that exact.

401
01:05:51,490 --> 01:06:25,910
Just. Well, it seems to be in a here.

402
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:54,310
The two observations this piece of news here and then that.

403
01:06:55,980 --> 01:07:01,620
When is. This is.

404
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:06,190
Exactly, yeah. So Pamela said.

405
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:35,600
So this is the general form of if I assume that this ratio, you can generalize it on that.

406
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:45,070
But just at outset on how to convert from a given odds ratio and it's given.

407
01:07:49,460 --> 01:08:01,300
So. Baseline view in your treatment to how how big this bias term would have to be.

408
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:09,749
Or to embrace the effect. So explicitly.

409
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:14,250
The assumption that we're making about you is that it's twice as big.

410
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:21,500
Right. Okay. Right. Is.

411
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:50,470
So if we are sort of plug in, you know, or or similar,

412
01:08:50,670 --> 01:08:59,150
similar unbiased odds ratio of 24 and let's just suppose .33 should correspond to .67 down here.

413
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:10,880
Then basically this, this gamma would have to be 1.71, which we kind of see is pretty unrealistically large given the sort of initial work we did.

414
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:18,229
So we saw like huge potential confounders here, then maybe this would be more realistic.

415
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:25,690
But. But it's. It's in order for the bias to essentially equal the odds ratio.

416
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:32,430
And it's going to have to. You would have to watch GMA.

417
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:40,400
So again, if you converted that back to Giffords system,

418
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:50,400
survival rates would be something that's causing the survival to drop from 90% to 50% or 80% to 45% to eliminate the sort of treatment effect.

419
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:53,490
And that seems pretty unrealistic.

420
01:09:54,990 --> 01:10:01,979
So I guess we conclude it's unlikely the entire effect of the child poverty can be explained by the measure confounder,

421
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:06,870
although maybe a moderate fraction and up to 25% might be.

422
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:18,480
So you might remember we talked early on about smoking, causal effect, smoking on lung cancer deaths.

423
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:26,430
Is basically the exact same kind of argument you would use here except there that you would probably get it might be ten.

424
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:37,140
So. Okay.

425
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:58,800
All right. So try to. So that was the total treatment effect.

426
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:07,979
So now I want to kind of look at unmeasured confounders for mediation and we'll focus on the natural, direct effect, right?

427
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:16,740
So this would be the effect of child poverty on survival.

428
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:22,190
That's not mediated through experience with all poverty. So.

429
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:33,510
I guess I decided to just go ahead and crank this out from first principles just to kind of show how this could work.

430
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:43,170
So first of all, I have my fit of adult poverty on child poverty controlling for these covariates.

431
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:57,959
So that gives us essentially alpha, not Alpha one, and then the alpha twos and then for the betas, right?

432
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:11,250
So this is modeling poverty on childhood poverty, I'm sorry, survival on child poverty, adult poverty, the interaction between the two.

433
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:16,530
Right? So this is my exposure, my mediator and the interaction and the covariance.

434
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:27,870
So the. Services paid to assist.

435
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:33,920
I'm sorry. It's been two and this has been three, right.

436
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:38,659
Sorry. Beta two and then beta three.

437
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:45,820
The interaction down here. Which.

438
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:52,249
In terms of the indexing in our systems.

439
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:58,700
Beta one, beta two, beta three. This.

440
01:13:01,690 --> 01:13:15,620
And bear fruit. Check that.

441
01:13:36,150 --> 01:13:49,410
Okay. So, um, so to get this overall natural direct effect averaging over X, I just computed this natural direct effect of X in the formula up here.

442
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:57,000
And this took the mean right over that. Give me about 0.89.

443
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:09,610
And so the Gammas as PS, I'm just going to sort of pull out from my previous, previous work, previous work before.

444
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:21,059
So I guess so I'm going to set things to sort of 0.3 and point 23.

445
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:24,090
3.6 and then.

446
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:31,210
Allow for him. Well.

447
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:41,340
So essentially to allow for an approximate doubling. Between any star.

448
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,170
I guess there's a little bit of let's see here for complexity.

449
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:57,550
They have the mediator value, right. So I'm not going to worry too much about this coat.

450
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:03,260
This you might be dependent on them. You kind of want it just to depend on money here.

451
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:14,290
So once I have all those pieces I can compute.

452
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:24,610
b0b one's a b twos. I just put that in there.

453
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:38,990
And then I'm going to go back to compute my bias adjusted basis from an actual direct effect.

454
01:15:44,420 --> 01:16:01,490
So I go through. And compute those are Baidu Tilda's or Baidu T's here and get my natural direct effect.

455
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:11,280
The bias adjustment. So let's see here.

456
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:20,850
No. So this is for. I think I need the gamma.

457
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:27,030
This is for this particular set of gamers. Right these values here.

458
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:32,550
And then I want to do the same thing for a new set of games here.

459
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:42,300
Has been a slightly different result. So variance estimation can be conducted by a bootstrap.

460
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:54,930
I'm not going to get into all the details on that. It's it's better we sample residuals for the X's, for the regression parameters,

461
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:58,770
but then we sample the X's for the estimation of the variability bias correction itself.

462
01:17:00,270 --> 01:17:12,570
So basically this code is doing the re sampling of the of the residuals and then re computing.

463
01:17:13,470 --> 01:17:20,250
My data is based on that and then the ends based on the re sampling of the entire axes.

464
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:33,180
So going through and pulling this into a table, basically our natural direct effect, again,

465
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:40,350
kind of diminishes as we allow for more and more observable sort of confounding on the mediator.

466
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:51,719
Residual error, no increases. It was never it always included in one.

467
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:54,930
So there was there's not an issue. We've really been strong enough to go for that.

468
01:17:57,690 --> 01:18:03,149
So we concluded it's would be unlikely.

469
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:07,860
This effect can be entirely explained through this unmeasured confounder,

470
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:17,190
although maybe a third of it could be if we sort of look at, you know, sort of 11 versus 7.5 here, kind of get that reduction.

471
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:24,440
So I know we're at time, so stop.

472
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:30,620
So this is basically all of this is as a means of of of trying to sort of account for

473
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:38,600
this this potential confounding in the in the meantime on the effect of the mediators.

474
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:45,200
So I sort of focused on the on the natural direct effect here.

475
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:52,990
The same argument can be done for the natural indirect effects.

476
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,060
You can kind of work out exactly the same way. Right.

477
01:18:57,140 --> 01:19:01,260
Because these these estimate these bias. Right.

478
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:06,160
These things can be used to compute the bias for any debate as you want to.

479
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:10,730
So so you can kind of go or however you want to go with it.

480
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:17,120
So so this kind of covers the cases that we need to consider here.

481
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:24,320
Okay. So this kind of deals with our sort of simple mediation setting.

482
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:28,160
We're going to go on to look at how things think about multiple mediators.

483
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:33,710
And that's also going to be we're going to look in an alternative. We kind of focused on this model based approach.

484
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:41,630
We're going to look at more of a leading based approach to think about mediation and then also tie it back to instrumental variables as well.

485
01:19:42,170 --> 01:19:50,899
So I think it's probably up to the to the next break and I'll try to get back to these comments.

486
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:58,160
I spoke with a lot of you, I think a lot of a lot of really cool ideas here. I'll give these back the money, but definitely ones.

487
01:19:58,830 --> 01:20:04,250
So any comments I of kind of to incorporate that.

488
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:06,340
All right.
