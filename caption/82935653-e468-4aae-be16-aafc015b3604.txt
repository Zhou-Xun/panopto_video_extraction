00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:17,390
Hello, Peter Jacobson. We're continuing now with our initial version of the US health care delivery system.

2
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,920
Let's turn to how the system is structured.

3
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,050
Three entities can are responsible for delivering health care.

4
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:37,670
First, you would go to a physician. The surgeon is normally your first contact for getting health care if needed.

5
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,390
You might go to a hospital for inpatient care.

6
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,490
Another point of entry would be through a managed care organization.

7
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:59,810
What distinguish a managed care organization is that an entity that can mine the insurance and health care delivery functions into one organization.

8
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,980
Some of them are known as health maintenance organizations,

9
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:16,100
and health maintenance organizations can either employ physicians or contract with independent physician practice associations.

10
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:26,960
IPA is. If we look at the pyramid from the bottom to the top, it gives you a sense of how we think about the structure.

11
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:36,890
Health promotion is essentially a function provided by the public health system that delivers education to the public.

12
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,940
Primary care is in general acute care.

13
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,850
When you get sick, you have the flu.

14
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:59,210
You get coverage from a primary care surgeon or other practitioner, community hospitals or hospital who provide primary and secondary care.

15
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:11,180
Inpatient care. Tertiary hospitals on the find hospital that have more specialized caring can provide services for cancer,

16
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:16,460
for cardiology, for other high technology problem problems.

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,310
Academic medical centers provide the most complex care and tend to be very highly specialized.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,750
And we look at the structure in a little more detail.

19
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,560
We can start with health systems, sometimes known as integrated delivery systems.

20
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:44,090
Health systems really tend to be comprised of multiple hospitals.

21
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:50,900
Help bring a sample. And the Trinity Health Care System has about 100 hospitals.

22
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,900
Catholic health initiatives in Catholic Health West also have about that many.

23
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,470
But you can have smaller integrated systems.

24
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:13,300
For example, any number of persons from 4 to 10 hospitals and new systems can be integrated in two way horizontally.

25
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:24,390
So, you know, the bar with the building across here means that you have multiple hospitals and outpatient facilities.

26
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:31,700
So you have not just one hospital, not one outpatient facility, but a number of them.

27
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:44,180
You can also be integrated vertically, and that would mean you have in addition to the hospital, you won't have a rehabilitation center.

28
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,930
You can have a post-acute care facility.

29
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:56,990
I have a patient release from the hospital. And then on the bottom, the bed would be long term care, a nursing home, for example.

30
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:05,480
So you have integrated health systems and it's one part of the structure and part you know what I mentioned before,

31
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:11,180
that most health care is provided on a fee for service basis.

32
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:18,460
You have commercial insurance plan. Aetna, Blue Cross, Blue Shield, commercial insurance.

33
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,280
And you have preferred provider organizations.

34
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:34,360
And what those do, they provide health care services to the health system or part of the health system at a lower cost name.

35
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:43,820
Preferred providers negotiate a lower rate and reimbursement in return for more patients that they can serve.

36
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:52,430
Now, one difference between the fee for service system and managed care is that in a managed care system,

37
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:02,270
you pay a monthly premium insurance premium for all of your care and you don't pay on a fee for service basis.

38
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:12,470
So managed care systems are designed to provide the highest quality of care at the lowest cost and at the lowest level needed.

39
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:22,070
The incentives in managed care are therefore very different from the incentives in the fee for service system.

40
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:30,800
Now, one way in which the system has consolidated, you know, through joint venture between hospital and home,

41
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:40,250
they can be for specialty care center, cardiology, nuclear thinking or cancer.

42
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:47,030
And you have a joint venture design between the heart and to provide that care.

43
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:57,740
Another entity for doing that in an accountable care organization which emerged out of the Affordable Care Act in an accountable care organization.

44
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:06,770
And the hospitals are given incentives to provide care at a lower cost when they do so.

45
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,910
They save money and they share in the savings.
