1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:09,840
He's based ascertainment study a case mis ascertainment study is used to study transmission of infectious diseases within

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,710
close contacts of close contacts of an index case are enrolled and follow it forward for a predetermined set of time.

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,080
The study size is much smaller than that of a prospective cohort study.

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:30,929
The reason this is not a case control study, right, is you are enrolling people who have your outcome, your cases or index cases.

5
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,079
You're also enrolling people who do not yet have your outcome and you're looking

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,470
for them to potentially have the outcome right there being selected based on that.

7
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:43,469
So it's kind of not neither here nor there. In a way, you're partially selected selecting on them already,

8
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,450
having the outcome of interest and partially selecting them not yet having the outcome of interest.

9
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,110
There's usually other criteria that you put into place too, because you don't want transmission for the most part to have already occurred.

10
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:01,529
Right. So you might say nobody else could have been sick with the symptoms in the last two weeks because you don't want to catch the index person.

11
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,470
You don't want them to actually be the last person in their house that's going to get the disease right.

12
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,440
You want to you want them to be the first person.

13
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,700
So case based ascertainment studies are really useful for examining transmission under real world conditions.

14
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,180
You can calculate a household secondary attack rate. You can calculate other attack rates as well.

15
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,880
The secondary attack rate is the number of contacts who develop disease divided by the total number of contacts.

16
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,609
You can calculate the serial interval.

17
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:36,180
Remember we said we cared about that right at the time from symptom onset in an index case to symptom onset in a secondary case.

18
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,690
It's used as generation. Time in models is the success of time between cases.

19
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:48,870
Remember, we really need that to figure out they are not based on the population patterns.

20
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,530
You can calculate the effective reproductive number.

21
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:58,410
You can examine asymptomatic infections and determinants of asymptomatic infections because it's much easier to

22
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:03,900
identify those asymptomatic infections when they occur because you've got that kind of small captive audience.

23
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,990
So here is an example case ascertainment ascertainment study.

24
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,800
It's a household transmission study. These are people down in Nicaragua.

25
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:23,280
This was my study that's been going for a number of years. So we take people in a household where one person has flu or COVID.

26
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:30,299
This is actually the flu design. We take a blood sample from everybody in the household and then respiratory samples

27
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,470
every 2 to 3 days along with the symptom diary and then a final blood sample.

28
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:41,130
And what we're trying to see is who gets influenza, you know, and who and and why, essentially.

29
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:49,440
We can look on a lot of different things. One of the things that we've used this study to look at is to look at antibodies and specifically

30
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,259
like things other than antibodies to the flu vaccine is designed to elicit antibodies,

31
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,260
but like it's not as effective as we would like.

32
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:04,050
So there's an idea of maybe we could make a better flu vaccine that's more effective, that lasts for longer.

33
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:10,800
And so then the question is, are there other correlates of protection that we would like to have?

34
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:21,830
So looking at things like viral shedding, symptomology, etc., we actually use that design to look at this PCR confirmed infection,

35
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:29,250
different antibodies, and found that the aging stock, which is a part of the flu vaccine, that doesn't change very much compared to the head changes.

36
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,750
A lot structures is less well correlated with protection.

37
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:41,550
So potential target for like next generation flu vaccines or universal flu vaccines.

38
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:50,550
So case ascertainment studies are really useful for determining the effectiveness of preventative measures as well as interventions.

39
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,680
It's more efficient since the participants are in close contact with an index case.

40
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,690
So they're about to be exposed, right?

41
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:05,579
Or it's at least much more likely that that they're going to be exposed than like a general cohort where you're just

42
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:14,280
enrolling the entire population in if you're looking at interventions than you would usually then randomize and cluster.

43
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,049
So the whole household would get the intervention. But it does depend a little bit on what the intervention is like.

44
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:23,760
You might randomize them all to do lots of hand-washing or wear masks around their house or something like that.

45
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:32,190
So transmission studies or these case ascertainment studies have been incredibly useful during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

46
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:39,090
We figured out the serial interval using them. We looked at transmission early on and continued to as the variants emerged.

47
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,510
Looking at transmissibility. So what affects how likely somebody is to transmit on the virus?

48
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,549
Right. And also what affects susceptibility if you're or you're exposed or potentially exposed,

49
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,050
what affects how likely you are to get sick and how sick you might get.

50
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,610
But if the spectrum of disease correlates of protection.

51
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:08,010
For SARS-CoV-2. And I think this is our last study design.

52
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,130
It might be human challenge.

53
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:18,000
So human challenge studies are where infections are deliberately induced under controlled circumstances, typically in patient circumstances,

54
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,690
meaning that you're going to enroll a bunch of people, you're going to take them usually into like a kind of a hospital like setting.

55
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:30,660
Right. And you're purposely going to infect them or purposely expose them, right?

56
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,139
It's a little bit different than our case after case study. It's such a routine study.

57
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:40,379
It's almost as close as you can get to a human challenge study while not actually intervening right.

58
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:46,140
In your case ascertained study. The argument is kind of like those people who are going to be in that house will be exposed anyways.

59
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,650
Right. So we're not causing them to be exposed here.

60
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,480
We are exposing them on purpose, right. Or potentially exposing them on purpose.

61
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:03,660
They're usually done for infection or they are done for infections that are typically self-limiting or can be fully treated in a short period of time.

62
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:12,210
They're used to study the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, rats of infection, and then to evaluate initial efficacy of vaccines.

63
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:23,880
Prior to phase two studies, there were a lot of discussion, although it didn't happen when when the the first RNA vaccines were.

64
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:35,140
You know, we're going into phase two trials. There was a big discussion of like maybe maybe they should put be put in human challenge studies.

65
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,920
And then, of course, there's a lot of concern, right,

66
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:44,500
because there's human challenge studies to speed up that evaluation of the vaccine, which is great.

67
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:51,850
Right. But then you would be purposely exposing somebody to something that potentially could be fatal.

68
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,570
Right. So and we didn't know how well the vaccines would work.

69
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:04,540
So human challenge studies have been used in vaccine development for malaria.

70
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,060
There's a nice review of that here.

71
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:15,970
They challenge they're going to screen as soon as somebody turns positive before they get really sick, they're going to go and treat the person right.

72
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:21,340
You need to make sure it's it's treatable. So there you go.

73
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,440
They had these really famous human challenge studies. There's some YouTube videos out there that I still like.

74
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,229
Even though I've seen them multiple times over the last ten years, I still find them very funny because there were some studies that were done,

75
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:42,309
the first to look at flu transmission and they kind of attenuated the virus a bit.

76
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,760
It was like an older virus. They weren't really attenuating it, but it was an older virus anyways.

77
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:53,110
They were they were okay. It like infecting people if they kind of basically put the flu virus in like essentially kind of lay back,

78
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,690
you take a pipette mean if you're familiar with that,

79
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,210
then you put a bunch of flu virus into the nose, but way more than you would ever be exposed to in real life.

80
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,669
Right. But the people wouldn't get very sick. Right. Like most of the people didn't even get like a fever cough.

81
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:13,660
They were like, you know, maybe they got infected. But anyway, so there was a famous and famous human challenge studies where they they did that.

82
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:20,290
And then they wanted to look at how flu transmitted, kind of figuring out the route of transmission or how, you know, and to do that,

83
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,710
they would do that by like putting in different interventions occurring,

84
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:32,529
but they didn't actually manage to get any onward transmission, which is really interesting.

85
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,649
So there are these great like well great might be a strong word,

86
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:41,200
but YouTube videos of people like in bathroom stalls that are in these studies, you know,

87
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,079
with their conspiracy theories about like what this is really all about because like they were

88
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,970
told that they were going to be exposed to flu and might get sick and and nobody was sick,

89
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:56,530
you know, quote unquote flu. So just done that kind of interesting and funny.

90
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:05,620
But there you go. So human challenge studies, you know, if it's self-limiting or adequately treatable,

91
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:12,639
something like the common cold, a lot of RSV challenge studies there, coronavirus like endemic coronavirus,

92
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,209
common cold coronavirus as well and studies that have been done cholera, malaria, then, you know,

93
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:23,710
you're you're okay ethically to do those as long as you make sure that the

94
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:28,180
the group that you're enrolling is is low risk and the protections in place.

95
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:40,150
But of course, as you you increase the possibility of chronic disease or risk or get into the category of risk or serious morbidity and mortality,

96
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,190
then generally it becomes not okay, right. Obviously to do human trials and study.

97
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:51,220
So. So there's a framework for evaluating the ethics of human challenge studies.

98
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:57,910
And one of the questions is it's scientific. Is the scientific rationale for using the challenge model acceptable?

99
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,320
Are the risks acceptable? Are the discomforts acceptable?

100
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,580
Does the challenge experiment enroll subjects from a vulnerable population?

101
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,770
A lot of these challenges,

102
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:16,240
you still have to kind of question it because they're enrolling a bunch of students who might need the money that the flu study,

103
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:20,290
that one flu study, they paid people. Not that one. Actually, it was a different in the U.S. and Virginia.

104
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:27,070
They paid people $10,000 to go in and get infected with flu.

105
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,999
And most people didn't even get a fever or cough. Right.

106
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,210
And then you just had to, like, hang out there for 12 days and watch TV and, you know, not in fact, anybody else.

107
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,679
Right. So there are some questions about like, is that ethical?

108
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:50,010
I don't know. Right. Probably a bunch of you were thinking, well, I would go I about to be free over over the winter break like that.

109
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:57,460
But yeah. So they pay, they can pay a lot of money for these studies. And so then it becomes questionable about whether or not it is ethical to do it.

110
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,650
Does the informed consent process adequately inform subjects about risks and discomforts?

111
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:10,720
Is the financial compensation reasonable? Is the study compatible with subjects rights to withdraw from participation at any time?

112
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,170
That, you know, may not be the case because you can't necessarily lead?

113
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,990
Like, for example, if you go into like an RSV human challenge study, they've had a lot of those,

114
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,629
you know, RSV in adults usually or in healthy young adults is usually not severe.

115
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,750
It's it's pretty. Mild, most often kind of mild cold like symptoms.

116
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:35,090
Right. But they don't want you walking out and then infecting a baby who might get a little worried.

117
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,890
So there you go. All right.

118
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:44,450
So with that, that is the end of the infectious disease lecture.

119
00:11:44,960 --> 00:12:01,450
Are there any questions? Well, then it is the end of section one outside of the review session, which will happen Thursday and then the the final.

120
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,980
So hopefully you learned a lot about epidemiology and enjoyed the class.

121
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:20,810
And there you go. And I and Katie will stick around in case there any questions for a few minutes.
