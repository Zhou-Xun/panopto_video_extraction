1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,263
In this session we'll learn about research questions and methods for

2
00:00:05,263 --> 00:00:07,478
genetic association studies.

3
00:00:07,478 --> 00:00:12,443
Learning objectives include describe each of the five aspects of the QMSSI

4
00:00:12,443 --> 00:00:13,321
framework.

5
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:17,081
Recognized the characteristics of well written and

6
00:00:17,081 --> 00:00:23,320
poorly written research questions, define reliability and validity, identify and

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,225
describe methods for measuring genetic data and describe genotype imputation.

8
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:35,791
Genetic association studies or really any type of scientific study that you want to

9
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:42,180
conduct can be planned and analyzed using the QMSSI research framework.

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:49,876
The acronym stands for question, measure, sampling, statistics and inferences.

11
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,671
I really like this framework because it's actually really difficult in

12
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:59,431
scientific studies to get your question, measure, sampling statistics and

13
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:02,270
inferences to all line up very well together.

14
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:08,826
But you really have to in order to have a well designed and informative study.

15
00:01:08,826 --> 00:01:13,710
First, let's start with the question the research question.

16
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,371
So like with any epidemiologic study a well developed question leads

17
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:21,907
to a well developed and logically executed study and

18
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:27,160
the study question will specifically identify the population of interest.

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:33,029
So this could be with respect to things like age, race, gender or geographics.

20
00:01:33,029 --> 00:01:37,784
The specific phenotype that's being studied and whether the study

21
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:42,793
will look at specific genes with biological or positional relevance or

22
00:01:42,793 --> 00:01:47,644
if it will agnostically search for new genomic regions of interest.

23
00:01:47,644 --> 00:01:50,351
Like a genome wide association study.

24
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,555
So for example if I ask you the research question for

25
00:01:55,555 --> 00:02:00,500
a study of interest and you say are there any genes associated with heart

26
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,570
disease that really isn't as descriptive as it could be.

27
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:09,360
So for example a better study question would be within

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,060
African American men and women over the age of 50.

29
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,330
So that's describing the population.

30
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,305
Are there any SNPs within genes of the renin-angiotensin system

31
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:26,642
that's describing the specific genetic factors that we're looking

32
00:02:26,642 --> 00:02:32,090
at including snips and whether it's within a candidate region or not.

33
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,720
So here it is the renin-angiotensin region.

34
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,621
Or if its genome wide which which here it isn't.

35
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,200
Are there any SNPs that are associated with ever having had a myocardial

36
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,511
infarction or an MI?

37
00:02:46,511 --> 00:02:47,709
That's a heart attack.

38
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,837
So you've got your population of interest,

39
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,150
you've got what is the genetic polymorphism.

40
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:01,490
What the genomic region you're looking in or is it genome wide?

41
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:06,292
And here is the specific phenotype or trait of interest.

42
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,760
Next we'll talk about measures.

43
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,260
We're gonna talk about measures for both the phenotype and

44
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,990
the genotype, the genetic polymorphisms and

45
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,060
the outcome of phenotype of interest obviously must be measurable.

46
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,728
And we have to make sure that when we're measuring them,

47
00:03:24,728 --> 00:03:29,689
the measuring method that we use are is valid and reliable and

48
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:34,661
after obtaining the measurements we have to describe them.

49
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:41,420
So for measuring the phenotype you may know a little bit about this.

50
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,226
We need to think about both reliability and validity.

51
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:48,339
So reliability is talking about consistency,

52
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:53,340
how consistent is a certain method in measuring the phenotype of interest.

53
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,423
So if we do the measurement a lot of times, how close will the values be?

54
00:03:58,423 --> 00:04:02,557
Validity is actually how well does the measurement represent

55
00:04:02,557 --> 00:04:04,560
the phenomenon of interest.

56
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,162
So are we really measuring what we think we're measuring and

57
00:04:08,162 --> 00:04:10,007
those are not the same things.

58
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:13,820
And up here you can kind of use this bullseye example to say,

59
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,721
okay if we have a method it could be reliable, but not valid.

60
00:04:17,721 --> 00:04:19,869
So you get the same results every time, but

61
00:04:19,869 --> 00:04:23,470
they're not actually measuring what you wanted to measure.

62
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:28,448
It could be valid, but not reliable so it's measuring

63
00:04:28,448 --> 00:04:33,752
what you wanted to measure, but there's a lot of noise and

64
00:04:33,752 --> 00:04:38,000
so it's not consistent in your measurement.

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,804
It could be neither valid nor reliable or

66
00:04:40,804 --> 00:04:44,771
here's what we're aiming for both valid and reliable.

67
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,431
There are some trade offs when we're thinking about the pluses and

68
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:54,360
minuses of measuring quantitative versus qualitative phenotype.

69
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,092
So qualitative remember is a discontinuous phenotype.

70
00:04:58,092 --> 00:05:01,022
It's got discrete phenotypic classes and

71
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:04,445
could use a threshold to classify the phenotype.

72
00:05:04,445 --> 00:05:09,400
The downsides are that it might be arbitrary to determine that threshold.

73
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,127
And so information could be lost in the categorization and

74
00:05:13,127 --> 00:05:17,710
that could reduce your power to detect an association.

75
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,840
The other thing though that's kind of a positive is that measurement error might

76
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,130
impact that classification less than if you're looking at quantitative traits.

77
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,406
Quantitative traits remember have continuous variation and

78
00:05:31,406 --> 00:05:33,050
the measures form a spectrum.

79
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,161
So the plus side is that there are no thresholds.

80
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:40,857
And so you're allowed you can measure the entire variability

81
00:05:40,857 --> 00:05:43,220
within the trade of interest.

82
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,893
So it uses all the available information that increases power.

83
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:51,246
But on the other hand, if the measurement is imprecise,

84
00:05:51,246 --> 00:05:56,792
we actually lose power because we have a lot of noise in the measurement.

85
00:05:56,792 --> 00:06:00,116
So when you're thinking about going quantitative versus qualitative,

86
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:01,841
these are some things to think about.

87
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:11,080
When you measure your phenotype, if you have a quantitative trait, you're gonna

88
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,590
wanna look at the distribution of your quantitative trait in your study sample.

89
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,270
So you can make this sort of histogram to show

90
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:26,220
what the trait values look like in your study.

91
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,220
And you can look at the distribution and you can notice if it's sort of normally

92
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,387
distributed if it has some kind of skew and you can use descriptive

93
00:06:35,387 --> 00:06:40,191
statistics to characterize that sort of the mean and standard deviation.

94
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:46,759
If you have qualitative phenotype, you will want to know how

95
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:52,351
are the thresholds determined for those qualitative traits.

96
00:06:52,351 --> 00:06:56,873
So make sure you have a really good understanding of how that definition was

97
00:06:56,873 --> 00:06:58,106
operationalized.

98
00:06:58,106 --> 00:07:02,369
And then once you have your phenotype you can look at the frequency distribution of

99
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:04,116
your outcome in the population.

100
00:07:04,116 --> 00:07:06,744
So for example, if you have a yes no trait,

101
00:07:06,744 --> 00:07:11,070
what percentage of people have the trait and what percentage don't.

102
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:16,507
And you can also look at it differentially by things like age groups or

103
00:07:16,507 --> 00:07:22,528
sex or race, ethnicity or other factors that you think might be important.

104
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:27,439
In terms of measuring genetic polymorphisms I wanna cue into a couple

105
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:29,150
of different methods.

106
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:34,852
So the big distinction right now is between using genotyping

107
00:07:34,852 --> 00:07:41,226
platforms like micro arrays versus sequencing the entire genome or

108
00:07:41,226 --> 00:07:45,390
using DNA sequencing on part of the genome.

109
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:50,600
So micro arrays are basically what people call SNPs chips.

110
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,163
So there are a set of snips that are measured.

111
00:07:54,163 --> 00:07:56,251
There are a couple of different kinds.

112
00:07:56,251 --> 00:08:01,459
So the GWAS arrays you've got SNPs sort of across the entire genome

113
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:06,590
mostly tag snips which I'm gonna talk about more in a little bit.

114
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:12,347
And so these are forming a backbone to do a whole genome association study.

115
00:08:12,347 --> 00:08:15,235
Exome arrays are primarily snips or

116
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:19,768
rare variants that are within coding regions of a gene.

117
00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:22,499
And so this is really only looking at the exome or

118
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:25,039
the 2% of the genome that codes for genes.

119
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,480
And then you have disease specific or clinical arrays.

120
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,778
And so these are SNPs or variants selected from a set of candidate genes,

121
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:35,445
genes identified through genome wide association studies or

122
00:08:35,445 --> 00:08:39,550
clinical databases that you want to test in your sample of interest.

123
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:43,152
It's kind of a custom chip.

124
00:08:43,152 --> 00:08:45,790
You can also use DNA sequencing.

125
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,930
And remember that's when we measure every single base in the region that we're

126
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,820
interested in.

127
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,714
So you can sequence the entire exome, so

128
00:08:53,714 --> 00:08:59,336
that's called whole exome sequencing or you can sequence the entire genome,

129
00:08:59,336 --> 00:09:04,128
all 33 billion base pairs and that's whole genome sequencing.

130
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:07,401
If we're thinking about doing GWAS arrays,

131
00:09:07,401 --> 00:09:11,535
one thing we have to think about is designing our chips and

132
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:15,950
choosing the SNPs that go on our chips are really important.

133
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,580
And so we wanted to choose well our tag SNPs so

134
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,120
remember tag SNPs are mile markers across the genome.

135
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,300
They're selected to capture genetic variation within a genomic region.

136
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,891
So within haplotype blocks and they're based on that concept of linkages,

137
00:09:33,891 --> 00:09:39,080
equilibrium the pattern of correlation among SNPs in close chromosomal proximity.

138
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,234
Right, so what we wanna do is look at the linkage to see equilibrium

139
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:49,758
within a haplotype block or a region and select SNPs that are gonna tag or

140
00:09:49,758 --> 00:09:53,930
capture the variability in that region of interest.

141
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:59,873
And of course because different ethnic groups or race ethnicities or different

142
00:09:59,873 --> 00:10:05,474
genetic ancestries have different linkage to see equilibrium patterns.

143
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:09,696
The tag SNPs for each of those groups are going to

144
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:14,523
be different when we have genome arrays.

145
00:10:14,523 --> 00:10:19,660
What we wanna do is amplify the genomic region that contains the SNPs of interest.

146
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,931
And if we're doing a genome wide association study that will be the whole

147
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:24,510
genome.

148
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:29,086
Then we want to separate and detect each of the two alleles for each SNP.

149
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:33,910
And so there are some common methods, there are methods that are used

150
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:38,748
when you have a small number of specific SNPs like primer extension.

151
00:10:38,748 --> 00:10:43,567
But then there's also two main methods chip hybridization from

152
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:46,341
after metrics and the ligation FSA.

153
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:53,254
From alumina that are more commonly used now for the SNP chips of interest.

154
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,223
So let's talk first about the chip hybridization method

155
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,660
that's used by the company at the metrics.

156
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:04,204
So the alfa metrics genotyping chip talking

157
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:09,720
specifically about the Affymetrix 6.0 chip.

158
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,060
It holds 25-mer probe sets.

159
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:18,170
So that means that the probes are 25 DNA bases long.

160
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:22,951
And they're shown here as 7-mer probe sets of seven.

161
00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:26,350
But just imagine that these are 25 bases long.

162
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,550
And for each of the SNPs of interest there are four probe sets.

163
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:35,180
There's one base that differs across those four probe sets.

164
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:41,152
One of them has the A base one is the T one is the C and one has the G.

165
00:11:41,152 --> 00:11:46,051
And the 25-mer probe sets are what is on this chip.

166
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:51,491
So imagine here you've got DNA probes in a corner of the Affymetrix array and

167
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:55,500
you've got lots of different probe sets on your array.

168
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,643
And so here imagine this is a 25-mer probe and

169
00:11:59,643 --> 00:12:05,670
in the middle is in the place in red is where the DNA sequence can vary.

170
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:10,596
So these probes have a C, the one next to them might have A,

171
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,825
the one next to them might have a T etc.

172
00:12:13,825 --> 00:12:18,983
Okay so what happens is that DNA from your sample is fragmented or

173
00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:20,910
cut into small pieces.

174
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,530
It's labeled with a fluorescent marker called biotin and

175
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,900
it's washed over this chip.

176
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,445
Okay then what happens is when you rinse off the chip,

177
00:12:32,445 --> 00:12:36,788
the biotin labeled DNA fragments that hybridize or

178
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:40,021
that perfectly match a probe remain.

179
00:12:40,021 --> 00:12:43,851
And then a fluorescent stain is washed over the chip which sticks to the biotin.

180
00:12:43,851 --> 00:12:49,090
So the biotin is essentially acts as a fluorescent label at that point.

181
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,759
And so what happens is that, let's say this is one SNP of interest and

182
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:55,250
you've got these four different probe sets.

183
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,600
And what you find is that your biotin labeled DNA is

184
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,620
sticking to the probe that has a C.

185
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,630
And it's sticking to the probe that has a T.

186
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:11,305
And so you know that for this person they have their heterozygus.

187
00:13:11,305 --> 00:13:17,086
And they have an allele all at one on one of their chromosomes and A, G, L, E L.

188
00:13:17,086 --> 00:13:20,735
At one of their chromosomes at the SNP of interest.

189
00:13:20,735 --> 00:13:26,574
And this is how we get the genotype for chip hybridization.

190
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:31,782
Another way that's really common is done by the Alumina Company

191
00:13:31,782 --> 00:13:37,880
which is the company that does most of the genotyping at this point in time.

192
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,105
It's called the ligation essay.

193
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:44,800
And so what alumina does is it has 50-mer probes.

194
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,040
So the probes are 50 bases long.

195
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,005
They're attached to tiny little silica beads on the slide and

196
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:55,201
the DNA from the sample is fragmented and washed over the slide and

197
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,970
labeled nucleotides are actually added.

198
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,867
And the DNA polymerase is used to extend the sequence

199
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:06,547
of the fragmented DNA by a single base.

200
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:13,043
Or I'm sorry the DNA polymerase extends the probe by a single base and

201
00:14:13,043 --> 00:14:17,090
then the slide is analyzed with a scanner.

202
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:22,019
So you've got your genomic DNA and it's amplified by PCR

203
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:26,350
it's fragmented and it's washed over the chip.

204
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:31,619
Here's the DNA from someone and here's a probe that's sticking

205
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:36,418
to the sequence right before the SNP that we wanna measure.

206
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:42,030
Okay then the DNA polymerase is gonna come and add one base to this probe.

207
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:46,880
And the base that it adds is gonna depend on what the person has at this SNP.

208
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,520
So this person has a teal at the SNP and so the base that's added as an A.

209
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,382
And then after this reaction is done we can read was it

210
00:14:57,382 --> 00:15:01,757
a green base or a red base that was added And

211
00:15:01,757 --> 00:15:06,485
we can tell what the person's genotype is at this particular snip.

212
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:09,353
Here are some examples of of platforms.

213
00:15:09,353 --> 00:15:11,252
These are a little bit older.

214
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:16,807
But this afro metrics was one of the main human genome wide snipper

215
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:22,363
raise When we first started doing genetic association studies.

216
00:15:22,363 --> 00:15:29,237
So there was about 900,000 snips on the arrays.

217
00:15:29,237 --> 00:15:36,795
The minor allele frequency is about 20% on average.

218
00:15:36,795 --> 00:15:40,512
So you've got snips that are pretty common for the most part on this array.

219
00:15:40,512 --> 00:15:44,272
And that's good because their tag snips and so

220
00:15:44,272 --> 00:15:48,425
tag snips are usually more of the common variants.

221
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:53,019
Notice that the that these metrics differ.

222
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:58,193
So the minor little frequencies on average differ if you're looking at for

223
00:15:58,193 --> 00:16:00,589
asians, Africans or caucasians.

224
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:06,583
And that has to do with you know the concept of genetic ancestry and

225
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,632
how the even for common variants,

226
00:16:09,632 --> 00:16:15,229
the allele frequencies do differ across ethnic populations.

227
00:16:15,229 --> 00:16:18,182
The number of markers per sample on the aluminum one M.

228
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:20,703
Is about 1.2 million.

229
00:16:20,703 --> 00:16:22,777
The genomic coverage.

230
00:16:22,777 --> 00:16:28,088
This is giving you an idea of how well it tags variability in different populations.

231
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:33,146
And so in CEU which is the European population

232
00:16:33,146 --> 00:16:37,412
it has a median R squared of 0.96.

233
00:16:37,412 --> 00:16:42,288
And so it's capturing a lot of the variability across the genome in

234
00:16:42,288 --> 00:16:45,606
the YRI or the African ancestry population.

235
00:16:45,606 --> 00:16:48,145
The average R squared is 0.86.

236
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:53,274
And that means that and it's much lower because this chip doesn't

237
00:16:53,274 --> 00:16:58,591
capture the variability in the african ancestry populations as well

238
00:16:58,591 --> 00:17:04,272
because again that population is more diverse and so it's more difficult

239
00:17:04,272 --> 00:17:10,440
to capture variability in that population because it just has more diversity.

240
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,768
I think one thing to point out about this is that these early

241
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:21,012
chips didn't have a ton of like protein coding changes.

242
00:17:21,012 --> 00:17:24,166
So here non synonymous snips,

243
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:30,124
there was only about 20,000 captured on this chip.

244
00:17:30,124 --> 00:17:35,361
A little bit more recent chips like the aluminum multiethnic

245
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:40,506
global array has for example, 1.8 million markers.

246
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:44,478
And we're seeing here that actually there's about

247
00:17:44,478 --> 00:17:47,826
424,000 markers Within the Exxon.

248
00:17:47,826 --> 00:17:53,830
So the coding regions of genes, we see 20,000 nonsense markers.

249
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:58,903
So these are ones that actually truncate the protein, but

250
00:17:58,903 --> 00:18:03,989
332,000 amino acid changes or mis sense markers.

251
00:18:03,989 --> 00:18:08,702
And so we get more a much more in depth coverage of

252
00:18:08,702 --> 00:18:13,979
the Islamic regions and more more rare variants and

253
00:18:13,979 --> 00:18:18,471
things that we think are actually important for

254
00:18:18,471 --> 00:18:23,299
protein function as well as that backbone that will

255
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:27,139
allow us to tag snips across the genome.

256
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,750
This is a multi ethnic array.

257
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:34,705
And so what's nice about this is that it has much bigger coverage,

258
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:39,429
not just in the european ancestry but also in many other

259
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:44,051
ancestry populations when you get your genotyping,

260
00:18:44,051 --> 00:18:47,968
it's important to really understand that.

261
00:18:47,968 --> 00:18:53,026
Calling the genotype sor assigning genotype is a little

262
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:58,082
more tricky than you might think so for a specific snip,

263
00:18:58,082 --> 00:19:02,063
for example, in in the Affymetrix chip,

264
00:19:02,063 --> 00:19:09,509
these are the plots that you get related to the signal intensities of each allele.

265
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:12,306
So if you imagine your snip of interest,

266
00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:15,856
you have two different alleles that are possible.

267
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:20,351
We're going to call them the allele and the B allele.

268
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:28,414
This plot is measuring the intensity of the khalil a signal versus the llB signal.

269
00:19:28,414 --> 00:19:31,648
So you can see there are three different groups of people.

270
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:33,980
The samples fall in three different categories.

271
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:39,641
The red have almost entirely all their signal is a So

272
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:45,443
that means these are probably a homo cycles in blue.

273
00:19:45,443 --> 00:19:47,444
Almost all of their signal is for

274
00:19:47,444 --> 00:19:50,863
a little B until these are probably be be homo zygotes.

275
00:19:50,863 --> 00:19:55,963
And the ones in green are hetero cigarettes, they have one copy of A and

276
00:19:55,963 --> 00:20:00,995
one copy of a will be, this is a really nice cluster plot for the snip.

277
00:20:00,995 --> 00:20:03,306
Another snip might have more difficulty.

278
00:20:03,306 --> 00:20:08,535
So if you look down here, you can see that it's having the algorithm

279
00:20:08,535 --> 00:20:14,867
is having a hard time deciding whether some of these people are hetero zygotes or

280
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:20,041
homo zygotes and it really has to do with the algorithm algorithm.

281
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:25,507
And the way that this the way that this program calls Jenna types.

282
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:28,757
And so these here you see some people who are miscalled.

283
00:20:28,757 --> 00:20:31,307
So these are probably hetero zygotes but

284
00:20:31,307 --> 00:20:35,432
they're being called as a a homo zygotes and these ones in black,

285
00:20:35,432 --> 00:20:40,775
the algorithm has decided not to call them because they kind of don't fit anything.

286
00:20:40,775 --> 00:20:45,106
So you have to be a little bit careful and you have to make sure that your

287
00:20:45,106 --> 00:20:49,527
genotyping algorithm you're calling algorithm is doing a good job.

288
00:20:49,527 --> 00:20:54,336
The other thing that's really interesting about genotype data is that you

289
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,397
can look at the plots of the B allele frequency.

290
00:20:57,397 --> 00:21:00,182
So remember we've got the alien and the B allele.

291
00:21:00,182 --> 00:21:03,665
We can look at the plot of the B allele frequency from 0 to 1.

292
00:21:03,665 --> 00:21:07,577
So this is where you have almost no blu L signal intensity.

293
00:21:07,577 --> 00:21:11,911
And this is where you have almost all be a little signal intensity.

294
00:21:11,911 --> 00:21:15,031
And you can look across the chromosome And

295
00:21:15,031 --> 00:21:21,020
each of the dots on this plot represents a single snip and this is for one person.

296
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,132
So this is one person chromosome part of their chromosome.

297
00:21:25,132 --> 00:21:28,752
Here's chromosome 22 for a single person.

298
00:21:28,752 --> 00:21:33,739
And you can see here that this area in blue, you've got snips that looked to be

299
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:37,141
a a homo zegas snips that looked to be heterosexual.

300
00:21:37,141 --> 00:21:41,334
And snips that look to BBB homo in this region where in red,

301
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:45,114
you can see that this hetero zygote line is missing.

302
00:21:45,114 --> 00:21:48,833
There aren't any snips almost that appear to be heterosexual.

303
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:53,647
And that means that one of the chromosomes for this person probably had a deletion.

304
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:57,211
And so this part of the chromosome was missing.

305
00:21:57,211 --> 00:22:02,182
And so the person was being called either as an a homo zygote or

306
00:22:02,182 --> 00:22:07,448
BB homo zygote depending on the level that they had on their other

307
00:22:07,448 --> 00:22:12,244
chromosome in this sense, the person had a duplication.

308
00:22:12,244 --> 00:22:17,076
So in this area of the chromosome you actually see four lines a a homo

309
00:22:17,076 --> 00:22:21,234
BB homo sagas and then you've got these other two lines.

310
00:22:21,234 --> 00:22:25,718
And what has happened is that one of the person's chromosomes actually had

311
00:22:25,718 --> 00:22:26,725
a duplication.

312
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:32,297
So you've got basically an alil that gets called twice and

313
00:22:32,297 --> 00:22:35,473
in a little that gets called once.

314
00:22:35,473 --> 00:22:40,193
So the duplicated chromosomes will look like it is essentially having

315
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:44,361
twice the influence as the chromosome without duplication.

316
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:50,095
And so so here what is probably happening is that the person has the a little

317
00:22:50,095 --> 00:22:56,556
on their chromosome that's duplicated and the billy on the chromosome that's not.

318
00:22:56,556 --> 00:23:01,596
So you get two copies of a essentially and one copy of B.

319
00:23:01,596 --> 00:23:05,629
So you can find deletions and duplications

320
00:23:05,629 --> 00:23:10,451
in the chromosome using these bl frequency plots.

321
00:23:10,451 --> 00:23:13,930
There's post genotyping quality control for micro array data,

322
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,457
that's really important.

323
00:23:15,457 --> 00:23:20,266
So, quality control metrics include things like excluding snips

324
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:22,038
that have a low call rate.

325
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:27,897
So if you have a call rate of 95% for a particular snip, it means that 5%

326
00:23:27,897 --> 00:23:33,483
of your calls are missing or 5% of your sample didn't get a genotype.

327
00:23:33,483 --> 00:23:38,496
That means that that snip is probably not called very well and you might want

328
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:43,840
to throw it out, you should also look at the hardy Weinberg p value in controls.

329
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,941
If you have a case control study or the full sample, if you have a cohort study,

330
00:23:47,941 --> 00:23:50,862
if you find snips that are really out of hardy Weinberg,

331
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,058
you'll probably want to throw them out.

332
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:58,131
If you find snip, like if you find that all your snips are out of hardy Weinberg,

333
00:23:58,131 --> 00:24:02,101
you probably have an issue with population stratification.

334
00:24:02,101 --> 00:24:07,069
You're gonna wanna Analyze carefully the snips that have a lower minor

335
00:24:07,069 --> 00:24:10,642
allele frequency less than 1% or less than 5%.

336
00:24:10,642 --> 00:24:14,756
Because probably there aren't a lot of people in your sample

337
00:24:14,756 --> 00:24:18,963
then that have the more rare genotype or the more rarely eels.

338
00:24:18,963 --> 00:24:23,342
And so you won't have power to do a good association between that

339
00:24:23,342 --> 00:24:26,598
particular snip and your outcome of interest.

340
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:29,154
You also want to look across individuals and

341
00:24:29,154 --> 00:24:33,589
you're gonna want to exclude individuals that have a low call rate as well.

342
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:37,376
So if you could only call 95% of the steps for a particular sample,

343
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,331
there might be a problem with that person's sample.

344
00:24:40,331 --> 00:24:41,551
It might be contaminated.

345
00:24:41,551 --> 00:24:43,516
It might have a low signal.

346
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:45,169
You want to throw them out.

347
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:47,998
You're gonna wanna look for people who might be related

348
00:24:47,998 --> 00:24:50,958
to others within your sample that you didn't know about.

349
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:56,166
We call that cryptic relatedness, we want to check their genetic sex with their

350
00:24:56,166 --> 00:25:01,155
phenotype IQ sex that they self reported or that the interviewer recorded.

351
00:25:01,155 --> 00:25:05,920
To make sure that there's no swaps in the DNA sample.

352
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,397
And if you're looking at the exome chip you're gonna wanna look for

353
00:25:09,397 --> 00:25:11,417
people who have a lot of singleton's.

354
00:25:11,417 --> 00:25:16,268
So singleton's are when you are the only person in your sample

355
00:25:16,268 --> 00:25:18,697
that has a particular appeal.

356
00:25:18,697 --> 00:25:24,226
And if you have a lot if you have that happening a lot for

357
00:25:24,226 --> 00:25:31,887
an individual it could be that there's a problem with their genetic data.

358
00:25:31,887 --> 00:25:37,620
The last thing I want to talk about is genotype imputation for micro array data.

359
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:43,021
So here we're going to use the genotype from our sample and we're going to combine

360
00:25:43,021 --> 00:25:48,045
them with measured snips and the haplotype structure of reference panels.

361
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:52,897
Externally like the HapMap, the 1000 genomes project

362
00:25:52,897 --> 00:25:58,819
the haplotype reference consortium or TOPMed to estimate unmeasured or

363
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:02,809
missing genotype from your sample of interest.

364
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:07,393
Imputation is really important and it's done all the time because it

365
00:26:07,393 --> 00:26:12,055
can boost the power of GWAS by increasing the number of steps that we can

366
00:26:12,055 --> 00:26:16,417
actually examine in our own population and across populations.

367
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:19,326
And it fills in missing genotype data.

368
00:26:19,326 --> 00:26:23,974
The key here is that imputation really allows for combining genome wide

369
00:26:23,974 --> 00:26:28,399
association study results from different genotyping platforms.

370
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:34,001
And that's really important because we want to not only study the genetic

371
00:26:34,001 --> 00:26:39,060
associations within our samples of interest but we want to combine

372
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:44,235
them with the results from other study cohorts and replicate them.

373
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:48,459
So the idea behind imputation is this you've got different

374
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:51,846
genotyping platforms the Affymetrix 500.

375
00:26:51,846 --> 00:26:54,980
The Affymetrix 6.0 the aluminum one M.

376
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,312
They all contain different TagSNPs.

377
00:26:58,312 --> 00:27:00,576
So in some region of interest,

378
00:27:00,576 --> 00:27:06,508
let's say the Affy500K contains this TagSNPs this TagSNPs and this TagSNP.

379
00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:10,529
And the Illumina1M Contains these three tag snips but

380
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:16,309
not this one contains this one but not these two and it contains these, right?

381
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:20,859
So you've got different tag snips that are actually being measured by each of these

382
00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:22,159
different platforms.

383
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,893
But what you wanna do is you want to actually put the results together

384
00:27:26,893 --> 00:27:31,641
across studies that have used different genotyping platforms.

385
00:27:31,641 --> 00:27:36,361
And so the question is, can we fill in this missing data.

386
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:39,844
So for people who are genotype on the Affy500 K.

387
00:27:39,844 --> 00:27:43,165
Can I impute people's Jenna types for this snip?

388
00:27:43,165 --> 00:27:45,405
Rs 23625.

389
00:27:45,405 --> 00:27:47,661
Which wasn't actually measured.

390
00:27:48,452 --> 00:27:52,858
And for the Illumina1M can I impute these snips?

391
00:27:52,858 --> 00:27:56,206
And we'll do that using the reference panel.

392
00:27:56,206 --> 00:28:01,323
An external reference panel that's actually been

393
00:28:01,323 --> 00:28:05,381
genotype at all of these different love side.

394
00:28:05,992 --> 00:28:09,354
We're thinking about genotype imputation here.

395
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,220
So here is where you've got your study sample.

396
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,246
And so this is a person that you've genotype,

397
00:28:15,246 --> 00:28:17,739
three different snips in this study.

398
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:20,307
And these are the persons two chromosomes.

399
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:25,599
So they at the first chromosome, they have the haplotype AAA at these three snips.

400
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,536
And on the second chromosome they have haplotype GCA.

401
00:28:29,995 --> 00:28:34,394
So what we want to do is look in the reference haplotype from some

402
00:28:34,394 --> 00:28:35,726
reference panel.

403
00:28:35,726 --> 00:28:38,555
So for example this is looking at the haplotype or

404
00:28:38,555 --> 00:28:40,904
the 1000 genomes reference panel.

405
00:28:40,904 --> 00:28:45,282
And here's a bunch of chromosomes from people who are in that reference panel.

406
00:28:45,282 --> 00:28:52,877
So this first chromosome has haplotype ACA ACG.

407
00:28:52,877 --> 00:28:57,865
At those three snips that doesn't match either of the chromosomes in our sample.

408
00:28:57,865 --> 00:29:02,845
What we want to do is find haplotype within this 1000 genomes reference

409
00:29:02,845 --> 00:29:06,322
panel that's been genotype that all these snips and

410
00:29:06,322 --> 00:29:10,447
see if we can find a chromosome that matches our study sample.

411
00:29:10,447 --> 00:29:12,418
So what what what did we find?

412
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:16,437
So we found a chromosome that's a A A.

413
00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:20,488
Okay this has haplotype A.

414
00:29:20,488 --> 00:29:21,952
At the three snips.

415
00:29:21,952 --> 00:29:26,944
And so we're gonna say this is the chromosome that most closely

416
00:29:26,944 --> 00:29:31,500
matches what we have on the first chromosome of our sample.

417
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,478
Then we don't see haplotype GCA.

418
00:29:34,478 --> 00:29:36,485
Anywhere in the reference panel.

419
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:41,056
But we do see G and C together and

420
00:29:41,056 --> 00:29:46,131
then we see a another chromosome.

421
00:29:46,131 --> 00:29:50,460
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna look for the chromosomes and

422
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,712
the reference sample that best match the patterning that we see in

423
00:29:54,712 --> 00:29:57,049
the haplotype of our individuals.

424
00:29:57,049 --> 00:30:01,881
And from that we're gonna fill in the genotype that we're missing

425
00:30:01,881 --> 00:30:03,873
in our sample of interest.

426
00:30:03,873 --> 00:30:09,937
So for this a a a haplotype, this person we're gonna fill in and

427
00:30:09,937 --> 00:30:16,019
say we think they have genotype CGAGATCT in this region, right?

428
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:21,053
So we're using the haplotype structure of this reference panel and

429
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:25,924
we're using it to impute or infer the genotype sat nearby snips.

430
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:30,852
And this this imputation is actually quite complicated.

431
00:30:30,852 --> 00:30:34,928
It's it looks at all of the potential haplotype

432
00:30:34,928 --> 00:30:39,205
chromosomes that match your sample of interest.

433
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:42,522
And so this is just a very simplified version.

434
00:30:42,522 --> 00:30:47,573
But essentially what it's doing is it's looking for those haplotype

435
00:30:47,573 --> 00:30:52,288
that match each sample and it fills in the rest of those genotype data.

436
00:30:52,804 --> 00:30:57,394
Finally, when we have our genetic polymorphisms we're gonna want to

437
00:30:57,394 --> 00:31:00,291
calculate different metrics around them.

438
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:03,758
So for every snip we're gonna calculate the allele frequency and

439
00:31:03,758 --> 00:31:05,971
the genotype frequencies in our sample.

440
00:31:05,971 --> 00:31:08,648
We might want to calculate haplotype frequencies.

441
00:31:08,648 --> 00:31:13,073
We're definitely going to calculate hardy Weinberg equilibrium for

442
00:31:13,073 --> 00:31:15,776
each of our steps of that we've measured.

443
00:31:15,776 --> 00:31:20,165
We can also calculate linkage disequilibrium among snips in our sample

444
00:31:20,165 --> 00:31:24,930
and we can ask if any of these measures vary by some kind of population groups.

445
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:29,760
So for example do they vary by different age, different sects,

446
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,092
different race ethnic group.

447
00:31:32,092 --> 00:31:34,335
If you do have multiple race, ethnic groups,

448
00:31:34,335 --> 00:31:38,031
you will definitely expect your illegal and genotype frequencies to vary.

449
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:44,489
We can talk in the next section about how we handle

450
00:31:44,489 --> 00:31:48,010
ancestral differences in genetics
