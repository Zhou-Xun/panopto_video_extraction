1
00:00:09,454 --> 00:00:14,524
Today, we're going to discuss the three phase model of motivational interviewing.

2
00:00:14,524 --> 00:00:18,090
Which essentially means what do I do when with my client?

3
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,332
How do I sequence my approach?

4
00:00:20,332 --> 00:00:25,340
We're gonna find a three phase model and then we're going to spend

5
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,984
a little time helping with a phase one skill called shared agenda setting.

6
00:00:30,984 --> 00:00:35,079
Here you see the three phases, explore, guide and chose.

7
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:40,577
During each phase, there are different skills that come to the fore.

8
00:00:40,577 --> 00:00:43,233
For example, during the explorer phase,

9
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:46,641
you spend a fair bit of your time listening and asking.

10
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:51,313
You're trying to gather the person's history but notice how the font for

11
00:00:51,313 --> 00:00:54,790
listening is a little bit larger than the asking font.

12
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:00,282
That's because we wanna emphasize reflective, listening over questions.

13
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:04,020
In the guiding phase we're gonna be building discrepancy and we'll talk

14
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,817
about how we're going to do that in a few minutes and during the choosing and

15
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:11,878
acting phase, that's where you might be giving some information and advice.

16
00:01:11,878 --> 00:01:15,864
Now the sequence of the three phases is important,

17
00:01:15,864 --> 00:01:19,304
particularly where we do the choose phase.

18
00:01:19,304 --> 00:01:23,679
One of the biggest mistakes we often make in health counseling is jumping to how

19
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:24,284
too soon.

20
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:28,890
In other words, jumping to the choose phase before you've really adequately

21
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,201
completed the exploring guide phase.

22
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:34,150
The sequence of exploring guide is less important.

23
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,757
You can in fact bounce around between exploring guide.

24
00:01:36,757 --> 00:01:42,376
The key though is not to jump to choose before you've completed those two phases.

25
00:01:42,376 --> 00:01:47,092
Here's a quick overview of the primary objectives and

26
00:01:47,092 --> 00:01:50,072
strategies for the three phases.

27
00:01:50,072 --> 00:01:53,255
Now, let's drill down into them.

28
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:56,569
Let's start with the explore phase.

29
00:01:56,569 --> 00:02:01,624
The primary objective during the explore phase is to comfort the afflicted,

30
00:02:01,624 --> 00:02:04,201
remember that from a few sessions ago.

31
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:09,290
That means, let's build rapport, let's show that we're empathetic,

32
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:14,796
let's establish the fact that we're gonna use a lot of reflective statements.

33
00:02:14,796 --> 00:02:19,493
Not a lot of advice or information exchanged during this phase.

34
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:21,749
During this phase we wanna obtain a history.

35
00:02:21,749 --> 00:02:25,376
We wanna understand how long have you been doing the behavior and

36
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:27,198
what have you tried in the past.

37
00:02:27,198 --> 00:02:30,319
Then we'll do some collaborative agenda setting.

38
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,645
In a few minutes, we'll give you a specific strategy we use called

39
00:02:34,645 --> 00:02:37,359
the Report Card to help you achieve that.

40
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:42,199
Phase two guiding, here we're primarily trying to afflict the comfortable.

41
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:47,020
We're trying to build a discrepancy between their current behavior and

42
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,084
their roles goals and values.

43
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:54,600
We wanna create a dramatic tension that this person who they wanna be on earth is

44
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,783
not meant to be a smoker, or this person is meant to be healthier and we're

45
00:02:59,783 --> 00:03:05,323
trying to align positive health behaviors with these roles goals and values.

46
00:03:05,323 --> 00:03:09,835
To help achieve the elicitation of change talk we have several tried and

47
00:03:09,835 --> 00:03:13,680
true strategies that we'll talk about later in the course.

48
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,433
This includes the readiness, rulers, importance and confidence, and

49
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:20,228
the values and strengths clarification activities.

50
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:25,240
Towards the end of phase two, we spin the balls and what do we mean?

51
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,595
We summarize, the person's story, here's where you are, here's you'd like to be,

52
00:03:29,595 --> 00:03:32,611
here are your pros, here are your cons, here are your fears,

53
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:34,028
here are your aspirations.

54
00:03:34,028 --> 00:03:36,265
And then we say, where does that leave you?

55
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:39,170
What small change might you be willing to make?

56
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:43,177
Now, if they're willing to commit to even a small change,

57
00:03:43,177 --> 00:03:45,111
we progress to phase three.

58
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:48,835
During phase three, we now are doing how strategies.

59
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:52,596
This is where your cognitive behavioral techniques come in.

60
00:03:52,596 --> 00:03:56,788
This might include setting goals, doing an action plan,

61
00:03:56,788 --> 00:04:02,006
coming up with a self monitoring plan, and discussing reinforcement or

62
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:05,357
contingencies that may follow the behavior.

63
00:04:05,357 --> 00:04:06,718
Let's go back and

64
00:04:06,718 --> 00:04:12,084
talk a little bit more about the agenda setting phase one strategies.

65
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:17,609
As we mentioned, one of the goals of phase one is to get a pretty good handle

66
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:23,492
of their history and that might include how often do you do the behavior like for

67
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:27,973
example, how often do you smoke, or drink, or exercise?

68
00:04:27,973 --> 00:04:29,278
What is the duration?

69
00:04:29,278 --> 00:04:32,252
For how long have you been doing this?

70
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:35,841
What have you tried in the past to change this?

71
00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:39,541
Where would you like to be in a month or six months from now?

72
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:42,179
And where do you think you are?

73
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:44,853
A very nice strategy that has worked for

74
00:04:44,853 --> 00:04:49,482
us in several studies is this report card that you see on the screen.

75
00:04:49,482 --> 00:04:55,584
Here, we list of potential behaviors that we might wanna address during a session.

76
00:04:55,584 --> 00:05:00,471
This particular report card you could see is related to chronic disease

77
00:05:00,471 --> 00:05:02,351
like obesity or diabetes.

78
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:06,175
And here the person is filled out with the red xs and

79
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:10,556
now the clinician would give some structured feedback.

80
00:05:10,556 --> 00:05:13,105
It might sound something like this.

81
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:17,588
You seem to be doing pretty well with exercise, screen time and fruit intake.

82
00:05:17,588 --> 00:05:21,600
However, you seem to be struggling just a bit with your medication and

83
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,360
eating whole grains, sweetened beverages, portion size and emotional eating.

84
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,913
And then we have a focusing question.

85
00:05:27,913 --> 00:05:31,055
And it's not all of these, you pick the one that you feel it's best for

86
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:31,855
the situation but

87
00:05:31,855 --> 00:05:34,903
it might be something like which of these we wanna talk about today.

88
00:05:34,903 --> 00:05:37,318
Where do you see possibly making a change?

89
00:05:37,318 --> 00:05:39,089
Where do you wanna start?

90
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:43,709
This is a wonderful strategy to quickly focus the conversation of

91
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:46,988
what behavior are we actually talking about?

92
00:05:46,988 --> 00:05:50,107
So today, we've defined the three phase model and

93
00:05:50,107 --> 00:05:52,727
explain the sequence of the three phases.

94
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:56,909
We've also described some strategies you can use during the phase

95
00:05:56,909 --> 00:06:01,399
one exploring phase to help decide what behavior are we talking about?

96
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:06,266
Where should we start your behavior change journey.
