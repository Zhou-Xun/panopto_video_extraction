1
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:10,496
After watching this video,

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:15,110
you will be able to describe
the structure of our research article.

3
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,026
At this point in your studies in your
career, you have probably read many

4
00:00:19,026 --> 00:00:24,200
research articles and you have realized
that they all have one common structure.

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:30,136
They'll have these sections that confirmed
the skeleton of the article, an abstract

6
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:37,230
introduction, or background methods,
verceles discussion and references.

7
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,847
Those sections are actually a little
amplified when you're preparing

8
00:00:40,847 --> 00:00:43,320
the article for submission.

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,240
For example, you have to have a title page
separated from the rest of the article,

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,253
and you need also to add
an announcement section.

11
00:00:51,253 --> 00:00:54,857
And tables and figures usually
go to the end of the article,

12
00:00:54,857 --> 00:00:59,270
not invaded in the article,
with a figure legends actually separated.

13
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,431
Also, if you're planning to submit
some supplemental material,

14
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:08,110
they should also go separately.

15
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,309
Whenever you have to submit a manuscript,
you need to read instructions for

16
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:14,484
authors for that particular journal.

17
00:01:14,484 --> 00:01:17,280
Seriously, you need to free them.

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,711
Because even there are a few things that
are usually common, many things actually,

19
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:28,374
through all of them like submitting in the
whole space, adding work, count of report,

20
00:01:28,374 --> 00:01:33,444
funding among orders, the truth is that
every journal has its own pickiness.

21
00:01:33,444 --> 00:01:36,290
For example, footnotes.

22
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:40,526
Footnotes through the tables can be
reported using different formats.

23
00:01:40,526 --> 00:01:46,090
For example, the general nutrition
asks you to use numbers like here.

24
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:53,134
However, the American Journal of
Epidemiology wants you to use letters.

25
00:01:53,134 --> 00:01:55,287
Wants you to use symbols.

26
00:01:55,287 --> 00:02:03,140
And yes, you need to know
the correct order of the symbols.

27
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,767
And there is more and more and more, every
journal wants you to provide different

28
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:12,413
information in the title page, the type
of asset may be different or structure.

29
00:02:12,413 --> 00:02:16,300
The references have different styles.

30
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,409
So at this point, anyone can be
desperate with so many details, but

31
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:27,240
don't worry, eventually, just amid more
articles, you will get used to that.

32
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:33,106
One final pickiness that I wanted to
comment is about the Journal Epidemiology,

33
00:02:33,106 --> 00:02:37,680
which discourage the use or
abuse of P values.

34
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,830
This doesn't mean that you
cannot report P values,

35
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,906
but as you will see in this course,

36
00:02:42,906 --> 00:02:48,990
you have to be careful about interpreting
results only based on P values.

37
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,839
Okay, so enough for picking this, let's
go back to this section of an article for

38
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:54,628
summation.

39
00:02:54,628 --> 00:02:56,865
As you start to prepare the article,

40
00:02:56,865 --> 00:02:59,906
this is the order in which
the elements should go.

41
00:02:59,906 --> 00:03:02,148
But as you work on your article, clearly,

42
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,516
you don't start the house from the roof,
and

43
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:10,280
you're not going to prepare a house when
you still don't even have results, right?

44
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,989
So the sequence of writing
sections is a slightly different.

45
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:17,771
Usually you start with getting
your tables and figures ready.

46
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:22,307
Then you write the text of the results
based on your tables and figures, and

47
00:03:22,307 --> 00:03:25,272
then there's no really
thread roller how to do.

48
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:29,896
But you can move into writing the methods
and then the in journal discussion for

49
00:03:29,896 --> 00:03:30,535
example.

50
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:34,938
So the final thing that you will write
will be definitely the abstract once

51
00:03:34,938 --> 00:03:36,722
everything else is reading.

52
00:03:36,722 --> 00:03:41,565
And also highly recommended that you use
a reference manager software to insert

53
00:03:41,565 --> 00:03:45,360
your references as you write.

54
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,772
When writing research articles, remember
also that short is better than long.

55
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,889
As I wrote in the previous slide,

56
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:57,620
discussion should not be longer
than four pages of double space.

57
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,837
Same for introductions, they should
not be longer than one and a half or

58
00:04:01,837 --> 00:04:04,620
two at most pages.

59
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,303
When drafting your research,

60
00:04:06,303 --> 00:04:09,938
article is very important to
follow this throw recommendations.

61
00:04:09,938 --> 00:04:14,257
STROBE stands for a Strengthening
the Reporting of Observational Studies in

62
00:04:14,257 --> 00:04:19,800
epidemiology and you can check the STROBE
recommendations in your materials.

63
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,519
And finally, very important, try to be
polish when people in a manuscript and

64
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,886
avoid being a sloppy.

65
00:04:25,886 --> 00:04:28,817
If you sent tables that
are not well-formatted or

66
00:04:28,817 --> 00:04:33,633
takes that has many typos, reviewers may
look at your manuscript suspiciously,

67
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:36,214
because after all, a very sloppy writing,

68
00:04:36,214 --> 00:04:41,850
they may think as well that you
were sloppy doing your research.

69
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,544
So in summary, in this video,

70
00:04:43,544 --> 00:04:46,552
we learn about the structure
of our research article.

71
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:51,819
In the next video, we will learn
about our first table, table one.
