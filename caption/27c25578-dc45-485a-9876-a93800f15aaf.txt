00:00:05,384 --> 00:00:09,345
Hello, today's lecture will
cover inference for binary and

2
00:00:09,345 --> 00:00:13,775
categorical outcomes using
the chi-squared test of association.

3
00:00:13,775 --> 00:00:17,108
We first return to the example
that we used in our lecture for

4
00:00:17,108 --> 00:00:20,030
a two sample test of proportions.

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,950
In this example,
we had two populations of interest,

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,360
a population of infants who were
exposed to an intervention, and

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,620
a population of infants who were not
exposed to the intervention, the controls.

8
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,660
And we follow these infants for

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:37,460
two years to observe how many infants
in each population develop cavities.

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,280
We have the following hypotheses in
a chi-squared test of association.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,750
The null hypothesis says that
the developing caries is independent

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,520
of receiving the intervention.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,110
The intervention has no relationship to
whether or not an infant develops caries.

14
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,460
If this is true, then we return to
the null hypothesis in the two sample test

15
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,130
of proportions that the two populations
have the same risk of caries.

16
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,872
P1 is equal to P2.

17
00:01:04,872 --> 00:01:08,887
The alternative is that developing
caries is associated with receiving

18
00:01:08,887 --> 00:01:13,293
the intervention, or that the intervention
has something to do with whether or

19
00:01:13,293 --> 00:01:15,100
not an infant develops caries.

20
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,045
If the alternative is true, then the two
populations must have different risks of

21
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:21,910
caries, and therefore,
P1 is not equal to P2,

22
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:27,560
which is the same alternative hypothesis
in the two sample tests of proportions.

23
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,600
In order to do a chi-squared
Test of Association,

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,970
we first summarize the data differently.

25
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,620
We create what we call a two
by two contingency table.

26
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:40,220
We have two rows denoting whether the
infant belonged to the intervention arm,

27
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,870
or the control arm.

28
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,530
And we have two columns denoting whether
or not the infant developed caries or not.

29
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,150
So each of the 104 infants
in my total sample

30
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:55,050
will be summarized in one cell of
this 2 x 2 table denoting whether or

31
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:59,210
not the they have caries and
in which population they belongs to.

32
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,160
We have 68 infants in
the intervention group and

33
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,430
we have 36 infants in
the control group in our sample.

34
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:12,615
Of the 68 infants we had 6 developing
caries and 62 who did not.

35
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:18,880
And in the other sample, we had 10
developing caries and 26 who did not.

36
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,980
Up until now, we have talked about test
statistics that take the familiar form

37
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,370
of a ratio of a signal to a noise.

38
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,810
However, for this statistics in
the chi-square test of association,

39
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,125
the computation will be slightly
different and it will actually be a sum

40
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:38,910
of signal to noise ratios among the four
cells in the contingency table.

41
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,260
In other words, if we compare our
observed two by two contingency table,

42
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,090
to one that would be expected to
occur if the null hypothesis is true,

43
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,440
how different are they?

44
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,400
So we have to figure out how would we
determine what table would be expected

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,890
when the null hypothesis is true?

46
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,910
We have to redistribute the 104 subjects
in our sample into the four cells

47
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,820
assuming that the intervention has
nothing to do with caries risk.

48
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,540
Let us start with the upper left
hand cell of our contingency

49
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,788
table where we had six infants in
the intervention arm who developed caries.

50
00:03:12,788 --> 00:03:16,580
If the null hypothesis is true,

51
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,620
then the probability that any one of
the 104 infants falls into this cell,

52
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,990
the probability that they develop caries
and that they are in the intervention

53
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:30,330
group is simply the product of
these two individual probabilities.

54
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,640
The probability of developing
caries times the probability

55
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,900
of receiving the intervention.

56
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,590
However, we do not know what
these two probabilities are so

57
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,630
again we will use the data
to estimate them.

58
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,500
The probability of developing
caries is 16 out of 104.

59
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,070
Again if the null hypothesis is true,

60
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:54,350
I can assume that all 104 infants in
my sample belong to a single group.

61
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,126
And among these 104 infants,

62
00:03:56,126 --> 00:03:59,890
there were 16 of them circled in green,
who developed caries.

63
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:04,790
Therefore, the risk of developing
caries is approximately 16/104.

64
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,520
Like wise, the probability of receiving
the intervention is 68 out of 104.

65
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,930
Again, of the 104 infants,
a total of 68 of them received

66
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,450
the intervention again
highlighted by the green circle.

67
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,230
Therefore, we have a total of 104
times those two probabilities

68
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,200
leading to 10.5 infants who
would be expected to be seen in

69
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,800
the upper left hand cell if
the null hypothesis is true.

70
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,930
It should be noted that
these computations are not

71
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:37,000
going to match plausible reality and
we may obtain numbers that are fractions.

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,540
So, all that we have 10.5 infants,
the computation will work,

73
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,320
although this number would not
seem biologically plausible.

74
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,760
So, we do this computation for
all four cells, so that for

75
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,790
any observed cell count in a 2 by 2
contingency table, this corresponding

76
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:58,300
expected cell count is simply the row
total, times the column total.

77
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,080
Divided by the total sample size.

78
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,841
Again in the computation I just showed
you, we have 16 which is the column total,

79
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:11,635
times 68, the row total,
divided by the overall total of 104.

80
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:14,090
So therefore, again here are my data.

81
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:18,160
Here are the 104 infants summarized by
whether or not they have caries and

82
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,740
which group they belong to.

83
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,680
If the null hypothesis were true,

84
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,850
I should see a redistribution of
the 104 subjects with these 4 numbers.

85
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,560
This is what I would expect to see
if the null hypothesis is true.

86
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,630
So like most hypothesis tests,

87
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,130
I now want to compare my data
to the null hypothesis, and

88
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:42,810
see if there is enough conflict between
them for me to reject the null hypothesis.

89
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,180
The way I do this is to first compare
each cell in the observed table

90
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,820
to each cell in the expected table,
and take the difference.

91
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,990
I then square these differences,
because again,

92
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,510
most computations I don't
care which number is larger.

93
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,980
I would like to get rid
to the negative signs and

94
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,390
the way to do that is to
square all these differences.

95
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,280
Each of these squared differences is
now a signal telling me how different

96
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,850
the observed cell count is
from what should've happened

97
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,010
under the null hypothesis.

98
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,350
Each of those signals is divided
by their corresponding noise,

99
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,090
which in this case is
the expected cell count.

100
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:22,710
I then add all of those values together
to come up with an overall statistic.

101
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,310
And for our example,
that statistic is 6.7.

102
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,050
Again, this number will
vary from sample to sample.

103
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,690
And we need a model to tell me how
unlikely or likely my statistic is

104
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,915
relative to all the possible statistics
that could have been produced.

105
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:43,370
Now, unlike the previous test we've seen,
we do not compare our statistic

106
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,750
to a standard normal distribution
to find the p value.

107
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,530
Instead we have a new model, and

108
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,940
this model is not surprisingly
called a chi-squared distribution.

109
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,090
Recall that when we used
a normal distribution,

110
00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:00,180
there were two parameters that completely
described the distribution, it's mean,

111
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,470
and it's standard deviation.

112
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,460
A chi-squared distribution
has only a single parameter.

113
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,688
We call this parameter
it's degrees of freedom.

114
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:11,320
The appropriate chi-squared distribution

115
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:16,810
to use to compute my p value is
based upon two facts of the data.

116
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,240
The first is the number of
populations that we're comparing, and

117
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,950
the second is the number of categories
in the outcome measured on each subject.

118
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:31,308
The degrees of freedom is then
the product of r-1 times c-1.

119
00:07:31,308 --> 00:07:34,460
Where r is the number of rows
in the contingency table,

120
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,310
which is also the number of populations.

121
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,340
And c is the number of columns
in the contingency table,

122
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,300
which again is the number of
categories in the outcome.

123
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:50,440
So for a 2 x 2 table, the degrees of
freedom will be 1, (2- 1) times (2- 1).

124
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,210
Recall that when we use the normal
distribution as our reference distribution

125
00:07:54,210 --> 00:08:00,450
for the P value, we wanted a statistic
that would be above 2 or below -2, our

126
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:05,460
critical value was around 2 to know that
we would get a P value less than 0.05.

127
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,060
For a 2x2 table when we
have 1 degree of freedom

128
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,160
there is a specific connection
to the normal distribution.

129
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,620
And that our critical value for

130
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:19,470
the chi-squared test will be two squared,
or four.

131
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:23,809
So again, for our example,
we had a test statistic of 6.7.

132
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:25,460
This is definitely larger than four.

133
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,024
The p value will be less than .05.

134
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:32,647
In effect, the right p value is .009,
or basically, .01 So

135
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:36,539
therefore we conclude that we
have a modest evidence that

136
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:41,700
the intervention as an association
with the prevention of caries.

137
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,930
We reject the null hypothesis and

138
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,740
we conclude that there is an association
between these two things.

139
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,570
They are not independent.

140
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,270
And what is important to note.

141
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,550
Is that in our lecture of the two
sample test of proportions,

142
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,920
we reached the very same conclusion.

143
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,890
The two sample test of proportions and
the chi-squared association

144
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:05,478
although computed differently
will lead to the same conclusion.
