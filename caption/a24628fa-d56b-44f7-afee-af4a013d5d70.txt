1
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:15,579
All right. Well, I will get started just so we don't lose any time.

2
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:25,659
I am recording this session in case anyone needs to get caught up or review it later or if anyone has to pop out early.

3
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:33,009
So this session is going to be talking about great scope and canvas and supporting the assessments you want to give.

4
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:41,589
And what I mean by that primarily is we often design our assessments around what the tools can do.

5
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:46,269
And so we're going to talk about a few different things.

6
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:50,049
Let's see. I didn't mean to draw.

7
00:00:55,149 --> 00:01:00,519
So we're going to talk about the features of current assessment types available in canvas.

8
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:05,829
We're going to introduce some of the features of grade scope assessments.

9
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:17,019
And I'm going to let you complete a practice grade scope assignment, and we'll take a look at that submission process,

10
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:25,959
as well as the grading process, and then we'll discuss the steps to implement grade scope into your canvas course.

11
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:38,228
So beginning with the canvas graded assessment options, it's basically what I have here on the screen.

12
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:45,339
You can create an assignment and there's a lot of flexibility of what that assignment submission looks like.

13
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:50,499
Is it a file upload? Is it a text box where students leave comments?

14
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,339
It is a it might be a media assignment where they're recording and submitting something.

15
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:06,399
And this can be an individual assignment. It can be a group assignment, or you can set it up for peer review.

16
00:02:08,109 --> 00:02:18,279
So there's a lot kind of packed into that one assignment tool. Canvas also offers the quiz, which we use a lot for knowledge check quizzes or exams,

17
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:24,519
because it gives us that auto graded feature where we can ask the multiple choice questions, true or false?

18
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:30,269
There's even fill in the blank question types that can all be auto graded,

19
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:38,019
but we can also incorporate open ended questions that we as instructors can go in and view and grade manually.

20
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:47,139
Similarly, with the survey that's using the quiz tool, but you can set a survey up to not have correct answers.

21
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:56,859
So it's more of a feedback or knowledge sharing tool, but we may use this as an assessment.

22
00:02:57,899 --> 00:03:00,899
And then you can also set up discussions to be graded.

23
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:07,779
And so a couple of things I just want to point out about the campus assessment options.

24
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:11,109
We have really great options and the tools are pretty good.

25
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:20,679
But a couple of things here are with assignments, they can be individually submitted or group submitted.

26
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:29,919
It's difficult if you want to give students the option to work alone or to work in teams, you would have to create.

27
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,769
There's some finagling a workaround with that.

28
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:45,129
I also want to point out that the quiz and survey assessment type are the only ones that you really get a deep analytic for.

29
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:52,539
So Canvas will compile a report of what questions students got wrong,

30
00:03:52,809 --> 00:04:04,989
or what percentage of students got this question correct and what were common answers if they were wrong answers, how many students answer those?

31
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:12,699
So you kind of get a look after students. Take an exam using the canvas quiz function of, Oh,

32
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:20,379
these are some items that students were not clear on, but it's only available in the quiz function.

33
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:32,949
So let's talk about some of the features that great scope offers that I think are really sort of standout features and can improve efficiency,

34
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:43,479
give us better analytics and streamline some of this grading and give more a little bit more flexibility where we need it.

35
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:48,158
So here are some grades given a lot of features.

36
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:57,039
These are ones in fact, I've still been switching them out even just this morning of what ones I feel like are most showcase worthy.

37
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:05,499
So one digitally grade handwritten homework or exam submissions.

38
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:11,439
So this is kind of what grade scope was originally built to do.

39
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:16,449
Let you pass out papers in class, maybe an exam on paper.

40
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:24,369
Students write on the paper, you collect it up. But then now you've got, you know, 100 sheets of paper to grade.

41
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:29,379
And one of the things grade scope does is it allows you to take that to sort of a scanner.

42
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:36,309
And a lot of the scanners in our departmental copiers will do bulk scanning and just email it to you as a PDF.

43
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:42,039
You can take all that grade scope as a way to split all those up by student,

44
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:48,759
and then you can digitally score them using some of the grading features we're going to talk about.

45
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:55,739
A unique feature with great scope is grading question by question,

46
00:05:57,239 --> 00:06:03,599
and this is a feature that again is only available in the canvas quiz or survey grading feature.

47
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:10,349
But this basically breaks all items down on a question by question basis.

48
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:15,389
So you're going across the board and not grading by student, but grading by question.

49
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:21,699
This is going to lead to better consistency across greater.

50
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:34,659
Great scope, does a really good job at helping you create that consistency when you have a course with multiple graders.

51
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:42,219
So for really large courses, because it's going to allow all of the graders to see.

52
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:49,319
What kinds of things students are being deducted points for or being awarded points for.

53
00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:53,459
And then what comments are other graders leaving?

54
00:06:54,719 --> 00:07:02,669
And not only can they see that they can actually reuse comments and point adjustment items as they're grading.

55
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:11,129
So that's going to be a timesaver speed greater in canvas has a incorporated a really

56
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:16,319
nice feature where you can save comments that you've made to a comment library,

57
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:26,759
but that's only available to you. Grade scope basically creates a shared comment library that any of your graders can pull from.

58
00:07:30,809 --> 00:07:34,709
Great scope has a really great feature of retroactive scoring changes.

59
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:46,139
So if you're graders and you are going through and maybe change your mind on how many points to deduct or for something that's wrong,

60
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:59,429
if you go in and modify that on the rubric, it will actually retroactively push that update to any other student that also got that point adjustment,

61
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:04,889
either points correct or points incorrect subtracted.

62
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:14,129
So again, a huge time saver. You wouldn't have to go back through Speed Grader and modify all of those scores across the board.

63
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:23,049
I put this one here online worksheets that Steve saved student responses.

64
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:30,699
And I mainly add this because this is something I hear faculty were wondering if it's available in canvas,

65
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:40,329
sort of like you want a quiz function where it sort of type in your answer, answer questions, but that they don't have to complete it in one sitting.

66
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:47,889
They could save it and come back and finish it later. And Great Scoop offers this as an assignment type.

67
00:08:51,739 --> 00:09:02,989
With grade school assignments, you can set them up to be individual or group submission in the way that students could get a choice.

68
00:09:03,859 --> 00:09:07,999
So with just a checkbox in your assignment set up.

69
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:13,789
Sorry. Grade scope will ask students when they upload their document.

70
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:20,449
Do you need to add other team members, group members to this submission yet?

71
00:09:20,619 --> 00:09:24,169
You know, yes or no, pick pick their names if this is a group submission.

72
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:35,569
So it offers a little bit more flexibility if you ever offer sort of that choice for students to work alone or in pairs or in small groups,

73
00:09:37,189 --> 00:09:39,229
which I find is just a very unique feature.

74
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:49,249
Our online program runs and Coursera, our residential program runs in canvas, and these just are not typical options you have available.

75
00:09:51,439 --> 00:09:53,539
Anonymous grading is an option.

76
00:09:53,539 --> 00:10:08,239
It's an option to never see students names, but by default canvas I'm sorry, grade scope sort of doesn't display the student name when you're grading,

77
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:18,199
so you almost have to go over and hover onto the submission to see a tooltip with the student's name.

78
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:27,529
So when we think of equitable grading and sort of maybe not paying attention to which student is submitting and doing the work,

79
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:32,839
just focusing on the responses themselves, that might help.

80
00:10:33,229 --> 00:10:42,239
And again, which is a checkbox you can actually. Make it not possible to see student names during the grading process.

81
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:55,419
On the flipside to anonymous grading, great scoop sets it up to where students don't know which grader graded their work.

82
00:10:56,439 --> 00:11:04,029
And. And this is an interesting feature because there are some cases where a faculty member wants to.

83
00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:12,399
I've heard the word shield. They're guesses or they're graders from.

84
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:22,239
I don't know, being told that maybe they grade too harshly or grade too easy compared to the other graders.

85
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:30,039
Students may start to make those types of comparisons, and the anonymous grading removes that from the student view.

86
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:38,479
Although the faculty member and the other graders. We can always see who has created which items.

87
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,729
So if that sounds like an interesting feature.

88
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:59,619
This might be great. A very unique feature is a I answer grouping or a a I assisted grading tool.

89
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:07,509
This is very unique in that this works best when there is a sort of single correct answer to a question.

90
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:19,839
And this would be if you if students are uploading files where they're answering a question and there's a single correct answer to a question.

91
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,809
You'll have the option. You would have the option to decide whether you want to use a AI assisted grouping.

92
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:35,438
Answer grouping or not. On every question, you would get to decide that on a question by question basis,

93
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:39,339
because some of your questions may have there's a single correct answer to this,

94
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:50,289
whereas others may be more, you know, write a statement or list three things where maybe they might be able to submit different answers.

95
00:12:51,819 --> 00:13:05,649
What the AI assisted answer grouping is going to do is scan all those answers for question to say, and it's going to group like answers.

96
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:15,229
And then what it's going to do is basically compile those for you to review and then you'll be able to

97
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:23,029
basically take all the like answers and grade them in just a few clicks and then basically score like 20,

98
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:31,489
20 instances of question two in just a couple of clicks and then score the outliers independently.

99
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:37,319
So again, things that can kind of expedite your grading process.

100
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:47,879
Great Scoop offers an in platform regrade request option so that you don't have to deal with

101
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:52,919
emails back and forth from students if they have questions about what they may have missed.

102
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:55,409
Right there in the platform,

103
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:11,279
students can sort of request a regrade and they're required to indicate what question and write something about why they think they got this correct.

104
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:15,989
And this regrade request feature is customizable.

105
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:23,129
It can be removed completely where you may get the emails from there or you can set it up to have

106
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:31,049
certain parameters of students can only submit regrade requests between these this date and time.

107
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:35,339
So you can kind of set sort of a hard deadline.

108
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:44,459
And one of the trainers or somebody at a conference, I believe, suggested for when they're doing like exams,

109
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:53,939
for instance, he will make regrade requests don't open until 24 hours after grades have been released.

110
00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:58,199
And he calls that the cooling off period of that way.

111
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:01,619
Students aren't hitting it immediately as they're looking at their results.

112
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:09,959
They kind of have a little time to think about it and then come back and make those regrade requests later if they choose.

113
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:19,589
And then you're going to get really impressive analytics, I guess, based on how you set up your.

114
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:29,909
Assignment, but it has the ability to give you really good analytics about your assignment, how students performed on the overall assignment.

115
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:34,949
But everything you deduct points for or award points for,

116
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:46,139
you're going to have the ability to see how students performed on those items and how many students maybe got this one item wrong.

117
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:51,689
So you're going to be able to drill down on a question by question level and

118
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:59,098
by all of the rubric items which are basically when grade scope says rubric,

119
00:15:59,099 --> 00:16:06,899
it's basically B point adjustments you're making to deduct or add points to a question.

120
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:15,539
So it's really going to help you identify patterns of things that students just aren't getting.

121
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:20,339
But alternatively, the things that they are definitely seem to be getting.

122
00:16:20,909 --> 00:16:25,409
And then you can sort of retool based on that information.

123
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:33,719
Let me know if you have any questions about this. I also have my chat box open.

124
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:43,489
If you don't want to use your microphone. Great scope has five assignment types.

125
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:51,648
I'll try to go through this quickly. It has a homework problem set and this would be a file upload and that would be a

126
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:57,049
file on my computer or maybe a document I scan in if if I'm doing something by hand.

127
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:05,018
To great scope. This would be a free form, variable length assignment.

128
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:12,039
And by variable length I mean one student may be able to do all of the homework in two pages.

129
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:20,919
Another student might take five pages and a couple of scratch paper extra pages there.

130
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:25,599
So what each student submits could be different lengths.

131
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:32,549
The online assignment type. This is what I was talking about with the online worksheet.

132
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:38,729
Look. It looks a lot like an online quiz or a Google form.

133
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:47,999
And students have the ability to save and come back and keep working on it until the due date.

134
00:17:52,209 --> 00:17:57,009
Great scope also offers a bubble sheet exams. This is very much like a Scantron.

135
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:06,039
If you're handing out a paper where the questions are all on paper and you can hand them out a bubble sheet in class,

136
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:15,669
or if your course is online, you can ask them to print out their own bubble sheet or fill it out in a PDF reader.

137
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:25,079
So this is going to accompany a paper exam that contains the questions and submissions are likely going to be scanned,

138
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:27,779
particularly in the case if you're giving this in a classroom.

139
00:18:28,949 --> 00:18:41,259
So you would bulk scan these and again, utilize the grade scope feature that can divide a bulk PDF with all student submissions.

140
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:49,219
With all those scans, it can divide it up by student. It also has an assignment type called exam.

141
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:55,159
And I found that this is actually very similar in the setup,

142
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:04,159
similar to the homework problem set except sort of grade scope is expecting that this is going to be a template document.

143
00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:12,199
It's not going to be variable length. Everyone's going to submit two pages because you're you have them working off a template.

144
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:21,319
You have you had pre-defined question regions, which is going to allow you to take advantage of grouping.

145
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:26,748
And in some cases this might be an instructor uploaded.

146
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:36,799
Like if it's paper and you're collecting it, you might be the one uploading those on behalf of students versus where a homework problem set.

147
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:44,559
The students would be uploading those independently. But I will say all of these the homework and problem.

148
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:50,439
Homework problem, set an exam. It's flexible.

149
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:54,659
You can make adjustments to where they're kind of the same.

150
00:19:54,669 --> 00:20:03,609
They have the same options. So it's mainly about how you're delivering an exam or how you're delivering your homework.

151
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:11,349
And then what I'm not going to be able to talk about today is grade scopes, programing assignments.

152
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:17,109
Students can go in and upload programing files of all different types.

153
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:30,579
And if you want to learn how to build an auto grader, I have some information on how I have a grade scope webinar that talks about how to do that.

154
00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:36,699
Or you can simply use it for manual scoring where you would get to fill out that

155
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:43,329
rubric to get those analytics the same as with all other grade scope assignments.

156
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:55,339
And the programing assignment also allows you to leave sort of inline comments on student programing files so students can upload those.

157
00:20:55,349 --> 00:21:01,619
They can also link up accounts like GitHub and Bitbucket in case they are.

158
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:05,509
Hosting any of their work there.

159
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:19,169
So the main ones we're going to look at today are the homework problems set slash exam and take a look at an online assignment.

160
00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:35,469
So we are going to try it. And you have been invited and I see that you accepted the invitation to a great scope workshop canvas site.

161
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:41,869
So I'm going to ask you to go ahead and navigate there.

162
00:21:46,059 --> 00:22:02,459
And I'm going to pull it up here. And I've populated three different grade scope assignments, samples here right on the home page.

163
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:15,579
So once you're there, if you go and look at the homework assignment, I've shared some instructions here.

164
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:24,749
And this would sort of mimic what you what instructions you would be giving to students for grade school assignment.

165
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:30,449
So I've already set things up on the grade scope side and on the canvas side in this example.

166
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:37,859
We'll back up a little bit later. But I wanted you to get a look at the student experience for this.

167
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:45,949
So if you'll begin by downloading the attached homework document, this is a word doc format.

168
00:22:47,739 --> 00:22:50,329
And go ahead and just type some things in that document.

169
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:58,009
You can answer those questions correctly if you know the answer, or you can just type anything.

170
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,209
And then you're going to want to save as.

171
00:23:11,149 --> 00:23:14,359
A PDF when ready to submit.

172
00:23:14,749 --> 00:23:26,989
One thing about great scope is it accepts two types of formats PDF or image files, and the reason accepts image files is so that students can,

173
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:32,029
if they have a handwritten homework assignment,

174
00:23:32,449 --> 00:23:43,789
they can then take their phone and snap a picture or even download the grade scope app and scan and submit documents that way.

175
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:48,839
Thank you for this homework assignment.

176
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:53,999
In addition to downloading the word doc, saving it as a PDF when you're ready.

177
00:23:54,459 --> 00:24:03,799
There's also some instructions in a video here on what you'll see when you ready, when you're ready to upload this assignment.

178
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:13,429
So I'm going to pause here for a little bit to give you a little time to watch that video.

179
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:17,629
Look at the word document. Add something to the document.

180
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:28,969
And then when you're ready, you can use this low to home work in a new window button to actually launch grade scope so that you can submit.

181
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:39,149
All right, so I'm just going to mute my mic and give you a little time to work on that.

182
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:50,655
But let me know if you have any questions. Excellent.

183
00:25:02,823 --> 00:25:08,853
Once you've finished the homework, you can return to the home page or the assignments page.

184
00:25:10,023 --> 00:25:16,443
And submit the exam. And you can it's actually the same document I've assigned, so you can actually submit it again.

185
00:25:17,913 --> 00:25:28,173
There are some different settings on this assignment on the grade scope side, so you'll see that it is a little bit different to upload.

186
00:25:36,579 --> 00:25:45,819
And then once you've done the exam, take a moment to look and launch and look at the online assignment.

187
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:58,693
Thank you for an engaging with that. First,

188
00:25:58,694 --> 00:26:04,334
what I would like to do is show you some of the grading videos created by grade scope

189
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:08,894
help just because they talk about a lot of the features in a very condensed way.

190
00:26:09,914 --> 00:26:12,224
And I may forget some key items.

191
00:26:13,754 --> 00:26:25,544
So the example, just to show you the context of the grading example you're going to see, they'll be grading something called a midterm,

192
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:32,684
which is basically the document we were just working with, but their document was completed by hand.

193
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:35,834
So all of the submissions are going to be handwritten.

194
00:26:36,914 --> 00:26:42,944
And then what's happened is these were collected, scanned and uploaded by the instructor.

195
00:26:44,494 --> 00:26:51,824
And so we will take a look at the. The steps they're going to go through to grade it.

196
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:59,844
And I am going to make sure my computer. Audio is playing and.

197
00:27:03,234 --> 00:27:07,364
From my home page. Let's select the demo course grade scope one on one.

198
00:27:07,374 --> 00:27:13,104
Let's select the demo midterm. We are currently in the grade submissions tab.

199
00:27:13,434 --> 00:27:16,524
Let's select the question 3.1 and let's start grading.

200
00:27:18,364 --> 00:27:22,264
On the left, we have the current student's answer to the question we are grading.

201
00:27:22,894 --> 00:27:30,244
On the right, we have the rubric which currently has just one entry, which corresponds to the student having the correct answer.

202
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:36,484
The current student indeed has the correct answer, so we can just select the existing entering the rubric.

203
00:27:36,844 --> 00:27:46,294
And we just graded the first student. Now we click the next button and are presented with the next student's answer to this same question.

204
00:27:46,804 --> 00:27:51,514
This student made a mistake. They forgot the electrons around theos.

205
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:54,844
We add a rubric item corresponding to this mistake.

206
00:27:55,294 --> 00:28:03,694
We typed the description for it so students understand what we are marking them off for and we decide to subtract one point for this mistake.

207
00:28:04,294 --> 00:28:08,254
We select this new entry and we just grade that. The second student.

208
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:15,513
We click the next button to move on to the next student. This student has single bonds instead of double bonds.

209
00:28:15,514 --> 00:28:22,114
That's a new type of mistake. We add it into the rubric and for this mistake, we'll subtract two points.

210
00:28:23,164 --> 00:28:27,424
We check it off. The student also forgot the electrons around the oth.

211
00:28:27,544 --> 00:28:33,754
We check that off too, and we click the next button to move on to the next to this student.

212
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:35,314
Forgot the electrons around the house.

213
00:28:35,614 --> 00:28:43,564
This is a mistake we've seen before, so we simply marked the corresponding rubric entry and we are done with grading this student coming.

214
00:28:43,564 --> 00:28:48,604
To think of it, getting the bonds wrong is a much bigger mistake than forgetting the electrons.

215
00:28:49,084 --> 00:28:53,944
So subtracting a full point for just forgetting the electrons might be a little much.

216
00:28:54,274 --> 00:29:00,214
So let's change it in to only subtracting 0.5 points and let's change the text.

217
00:29:00,214 --> 00:29:10,144
To clarify, we deem it only a minor error. These changes will apply to all students, including retroactively to the students we already graded.

218
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:20,674
Great. Some things that I want to point out here.

219
00:29:22,674 --> 00:29:32,024
I'm going to. Use my.

220
00:29:33,864 --> 00:29:39,384
See if I can use a drawing tool for this. One thing I wanted to point out.

221
00:29:40,434 --> 00:29:47,394
It's a little difficult to see, but notice you don't. You didn't see the student's name anywhere on this page.

222
00:29:47,724 --> 00:29:54,053
And so, like I mentioned, great scope. Does it make it clear whose assignment you're grading?

223
00:29:54,054 --> 00:29:57,594
Because it's just zoomed in to the question.

224
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:01,914
And again, this is used a template.

225
00:30:02,214 --> 00:30:08,574
And so it's just zooming into the area the instructor has designated the answer will appear in.

226
00:30:09,144 --> 00:30:18,414
If I were to hover my mouse over in the lower left corner of the screen while I'm grading.

227
00:30:18,564 --> 00:30:22,944
Grade scope would tell me the name of the student that I'm currently on.

228
00:30:24,264 --> 00:30:27,024
As long as I didn't have anonymous grading enabled.

229
00:30:29,964 --> 00:30:40,404
So I mentioned the term rubric a couple of times when we were just on the PowerPoint slides, but this is what.

230
00:30:42,714 --> 00:30:55,404
Great scope calls its rubric. It's what you're deducting or adding points for, and you can add new rubric items as you go.

231
00:30:55,674 --> 00:31:05,754
And in this example, every time he discovered a new error that a student had made, he would build a rubric item and give it a point deduction value.

232
00:31:07,374 --> 00:31:14,624
Or he would mark it. Correct? And these are the items, correct?

233
00:31:14,634 --> 00:31:22,544
Missing electrons, single bonds. These are the items that are going to start to compile analytics for you so that you'll know.

234
00:31:22,904 --> 00:31:34,844
Wow. Way too many students missed this, you know, had points deducted for not giving double bonds, but giving single bonds instead.

235
00:31:35,384 --> 00:31:41,654
We're going to need to review this or I'll know I can provide some supplementary material for that.

236
00:31:44,924 --> 00:31:50,384
We are also I think we're going to see something about point adjustments in another video,

237
00:31:50,774 --> 00:32:02,084
but here is the comments and what the comments typed here are automatically added into a comments library.

238
00:32:03,044 --> 00:32:09,584
And again, that comments library is going to be accessible by everyone.

239
00:32:09,914 --> 00:32:13,394
Grading Question three on this assignment.

240
00:32:15,944 --> 00:32:22,034
So there is there's going to be coordination between the graders.

241
00:32:22,904 --> 00:32:25,813
Now, in this example, I'm going to go down to the lower right.

242
00:32:25,814 --> 00:32:38,354
And in this example, he was using the next button, which is fine, but in a later video or in some other materials.

243
00:32:39,774 --> 00:32:43,194
You may find they use the next ungraded.

244
00:32:43,554 --> 00:32:50,754
And where this comes in handy is say you have graders working on something at the same time.

245
00:32:51,444 --> 00:32:55,884
I may not want to go to the next student because someone's already graded that one.

246
00:32:56,784 --> 00:33:02,784
I'll go to the next ungraded so that when people are working at the same time, they're not stepping on one another.

247
00:33:02,994 --> 00:33:08,754
Grade scope is going to leapfrog just to the next question.

248
00:33:09,084 --> 00:33:18,864
That hasn't been graded yet. Sorry, not the next question, but then the next student's submission that hasn't been graded yet for this question three.

249
00:33:21,504 --> 00:33:27,804
So I kind of just wanted to point out some of the things that was going on in that. But just to back up a little bit and.

250
00:33:34,204 --> 00:33:42,124
All right, I get my mouse going. Okay.

251
00:33:42,204 --> 00:33:49,134
This is going to cover a keystroke. So if you like working with keystrokes, you can actually work even faster.

252
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:51,563
So let me start this.

253
00:33:51,564 --> 00:33:59,034
Whenever we encounter the same mistake again, we can create especially quickly because all we have to do is mark the corresponding rubric item.

254
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:06,504
Using keyboard shortcuts can make us even faster. The student needs rubric items two and three marked.

255
00:34:07,104 --> 00:34:16,224
We simply tap the numbers two and three on the keyboard to mark them, and we can then simply tap the right arrow key to move on to the next student.

256
00:34:17,244 --> 00:34:21,954
So with just a couple of quick keystrokes, we can create a student who made mistakes we've seen before.

257
00:34:22,674 --> 00:34:26,544
In general, hovering the cursor over buttons will revealed a keyboard shortcut.

258
00:34:27,264 --> 00:34:32,934
For example, hovering over the next button here shows that the right arrow is the keyboard shortcut,

259
00:34:33,414 --> 00:34:39,084
and hovering over the next ungraded button reveals that Z is the corresponding keyboard shortcut.

260
00:34:39,984 --> 00:34:43,914
Here are a few additional keyboard shortcuts on the grading page that you may find useful.

261
00:34:44,604 --> 00:34:49,134
You can press G and F to zoom in and out of the student's admission.

262
00:34:49,764 --> 00:34:59,174
Press R to rotate the submission. Press J and K to go to the next and previous page of a student's submission.

263
00:35:00,044 --> 00:35:05,174
Press the period and comma keys to go up and down the question, outline for the same student,

264
00:35:05,954 --> 00:35:10,664
and press a to view a list of all student submissions for a given question.

265
00:35:17,364 --> 00:35:18,864
Whenever we encounter to see.

266
00:35:19,344 --> 00:35:25,944
So I just wanted to emphasize that it feels like maybe there's a lot going on in there, but keystrokes can make that quicker.

267
00:35:26,604 --> 00:35:30,504
Once you have established those rubric items,

268
00:35:31,044 --> 00:35:40,104
selecting those and I'll just pause to see that you can set up those rubric items before students start submitting.

269
00:35:40,464 --> 00:35:45,774
Or you can wait like in these examples where they are building them as they go,

270
00:35:45,924 --> 00:35:50,904
that where they're sort of responding to the errors that they're seeing.

271
00:35:52,254 --> 00:35:58,954
But there are if there are certain things that you're anticipating or things students are being are told they'll be deducted for.

272
00:35:58,974 --> 00:36:05,974
You can also build those in advance. As well as continue adding on to them while you're grading.

273
00:36:06,094 --> 00:36:15,233
Whenever we encounter the same. I don't know if I'll be able to demo this.

274
00:36:15,234 --> 00:36:23,164
I probably won't have a chance to demo this. So I wanted to put in a video that shows how the air assisted grouping works.

275
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:29,334
And again, this is going to work best when there's a single correct answer.

276
00:36:32,054 --> 00:36:39,554
In this video, we'll take a look at the AI assisted greeting and manual answer grouping tools, which are part of our great scope complete product.

277
00:36:40,274 --> 00:36:48,734
Let's go to the Great Submissions tab and click on a question. We select form answer groups first and now we're prompted to mark the question type.

278
00:36:49,514 --> 00:36:51,074
This question is multiple choice.

279
00:36:51,764 --> 00:36:59,054
We click review answer groups and the great scopes AI processes all of the student submissions into groups of similar answers.

280
00:36:59,954 --> 00:37:10,264
Here the I found six groups. If we want, we can give each group a title, merge it with another group or delete the group.

281
00:37:11,284 --> 00:37:19,924
Let's click and double check that all the answers are the same. So this group looks good and we confirm if there was an answer that didn't belong,

282
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:23,944
we would just hover over it and press the spacebar to remove it from the group.

283
00:37:25,024 --> 00:37:33,284
Let's go through and confirm all of our other groups. All right.

284
00:37:33,314 --> 00:37:38,504
Now, all of our groups are confirmed. Here we see the one answer that we removed earlier.

285
00:37:38,834 --> 00:37:42,554
We can assign this answer back to the correct group by clicking and dragging it.

286
00:37:43,514 --> 00:37:46,544
And now we're done grouping and we can click great answers.

287
00:37:47,204 --> 00:37:50,774
We see that we're now grading the first group, which has four submissions.

288
00:37:51,524 --> 00:37:56,444
Groups will appear in order of group size with the group that has the most submissions appearing first.

289
00:37:57,554 --> 00:38:03,554
Here we see a sample answer from the group. If we wanted to edit the group, we could click on the group name here.

290
00:38:04,154 --> 00:38:10,964
And if we wanted to view all the submissions in this group or grade any submission separately, we could click on submissions here.

291
00:38:11,894 --> 00:38:15,074
This answer is partially incorrect, so we mark that accordingly.

292
00:38:15,764 --> 00:38:23,114
Now when we click next, that rubric item that we just created is automatically applied to all the other three submissions in Group one.

293
00:38:23,984 --> 00:38:32,474
We can now go through grade the rest of the groups. And that's it.

294
00:38:32,864 --> 00:38:35,864
With only a few clicks, we just created 20 submissions.

295
00:38:36,704 --> 00:38:38,864
Let's try grouping and grading another question.

296
00:38:39,374 --> 00:38:46,454
This question is a fill in the blank math question, where students wrote a mathematical response in a fixed answer region like a box or line.

297
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:52,604
Here. The I sorted all student answers into two groups.

298
00:38:53,474 --> 00:38:55,213
If the groupings ever seem inaccurate,

299
00:38:55,214 --> 00:39:01,454
we can improve the AI's accuracy by editing the location of the final answer area, which would reprocess the groups.

300
00:39:02,054 --> 00:39:03,103
In this case, however,

301
00:39:03,104 --> 00:39:10,074
it seems that the air did a good job and we can quickly review these two groups to confirm now that we've confirmed those two groups.

302
00:39:10,094 --> 00:39:12,914
We can see that there were four answers that couldn't be grouped.

303
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:19,574
We can drag and drop the 20 into group one and we can put these two blank answers into a new group.

304
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,324
Let's leave this one answer under groups.

305
00:39:23,144 --> 00:39:30,644
When we click Create Answers, we'll see that we'll be creating three groups, followed by one and group answer so we can quickly go through and grade.

306
00:39:34,764 --> 00:39:39,684
Here's that one group submission at the end, and we're done with this question.

307
00:39:40,824 --> 00:39:47,274
Finally, if we want to create a question that does not match one of the suggested question types such as this geography question,

308
00:39:47,574 --> 00:39:55,154
we can select manual grouping. We can now look through all the submissions and grip similar ones together ourselves.

309
00:39:55,754 --> 00:39:58,964
So let's select all the ones that have South Dakota shaded.

310
00:40:00,884 --> 00:40:05,714
Then click create a group and give it a name. Let's create a few more groups.

311
00:40:09,514 --> 00:40:17,644
From the edit menu here we have the option to edit the group name merge two or more groups together or delete a group and that's it.

312
00:40:17,944 --> 00:40:21,574
Once we're done grouping, we can proceed to grading each group just as we did earlier.

313
00:40:27,824 --> 00:40:31,453
And now she kind of this video passed right by it quickly.

314
00:40:31,454 --> 00:40:39,054
But you do have the ability to not use that at all and just manually grade as we saw in the earlier videos.

315
00:40:41,894 --> 00:40:51,514
But I think it's good to see some options because basically she scored four answers and and did I didn't see how many students there were,

316
00:40:51,974 --> 00:40:57,434
but a whole class worth of you know. Submissions for question three.

317
00:41:00,154 --> 00:41:06,433
In this video we'll take. So we're getting short on time.

318
00:41:06,434 --> 00:41:12,074
But I wanted to talk briefly about how you might go about setting this up in your own canvass site.

319
00:41:13,034 --> 00:41:17,354
So you would create what you would create an assignment.

320
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:23,844
And you would say the submission type to be external tool.

321
00:41:26,224 --> 00:41:35,944
Which gives you that launch this item in grade scope because that submission step and the grading is going to happen in grade scope.

322
00:41:36,904 --> 00:41:44,314
And then when you grade in grade scope, you're going to be given a button that will say post grades to canvas to send them back.

323
00:41:44,854 --> 00:41:52,054
And it's this external grading tool that does that communication between the two platforms.

324
00:41:52,534 --> 00:41:57,304
So if I were building a new one here, I could do.

325
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:07,264
Set the due date. Set the points.

326
00:42:09,524 --> 00:42:12,524
I'll switch to the more options view, which is what I'm more used to.

327
00:42:12,974 --> 00:42:16,214
I'm going to give instructions here.

328
00:42:18,054 --> 00:42:22,884
And maybe support resources if there are questions.

329
00:42:25,894 --> 00:42:29,194
So here's that submission type. It's going to go.

330
00:42:31,494 --> 00:42:36,954
To the external tool option, which gives you a find.

331
00:42:37,584 --> 00:42:43,114
And here's where it sort of gives you all of the other tools that are plugged into canvas.

332
00:42:43,674 --> 00:42:53,484
These are listed in alphabetical order. So down in the G's it's going to be great scope and I'll click select on that.

333
00:42:53,724 --> 00:42:56,764
And I typically use load this tool in a new tab.

334
00:42:56,784 --> 00:43:04,044
That way, it's not trying to squeeze a tool inside of this content area inside of canvas.

335
00:43:04,344 --> 00:43:11,064
I want students to be able to see it as big as they would like, and then I could set my due dates here as normal.

336
00:43:13,364 --> 00:43:20,564
I can save and publish this. And then I'll want to load this in a new window.

337
00:43:23,894 --> 00:43:26,984
Because I need to create a new assignment.

338
00:43:29,744 --> 00:43:35,684
So here I have already created the course because I had those assignments in there.

339
00:43:38,544 --> 00:43:46,224
When I'm ready to build a new assignment, I can use the create assignment button from the grade scope assignment menu.

340
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:55,494
I can also duplicate an assignment, so if I know I want to basically reuse the same settings for an assignment, but maybe just.

341
00:43:57,554 --> 00:44:01,453
Provide a different template and change the due dates a little bit.

342
00:44:01,454 --> 00:44:08,234
I can always duplicate from within my course or duplicate copy it from a different grade scope course.

343
00:44:08,234 --> 00:44:17,474
So if I taught this class last semester, I could copy that course over into this current semester using this duplicate option.

344
00:44:18,074 --> 00:44:25,274
But if I'm creating a new assignment, I get to see my options of what assignment type based on those five we talked about.

345
00:44:27,674 --> 00:44:35,564
I'll do the homework problem set, and it gives you a brief explanation to determine the differences between these.

346
00:44:39,274 --> 00:44:45,604
So I'm going to name these and it always wants a template file.

347
00:44:45,844 --> 00:44:56,884
So in that case, where I gave you a word document, I actually saved that word document as a PDF and uploaded it here as my template,

348
00:44:57,634 --> 00:45:02,384
even though I gave it to you as the as in a word format.

349
00:45:02,404 --> 00:45:05,464
I wanted you to have it in an editable format.

350
00:45:07,544 --> 00:45:11,344
And then who will upload the submissions, the instructor or the student.

351
00:45:11,354 --> 00:45:19,454
So I'm going to leave that to students. I'm going to say they have until from this Friday to next Friday.

352
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:25,754
Do I allow late submissions or not? A time limit.

353
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:30,884
That's a little bit trickier with this assignment type.

354
00:45:32,174 --> 00:45:38,774
But what it would do is start a countdown as soon as a student viewed the assignment information.

355
00:45:41,544 --> 00:45:47,514
And here's where I would set variable length as students are going to submit different page numbers or a template.

356
00:45:49,894 --> 00:45:56,224
And here's you can where you can set enable group submission that will give students the option to indicate

357
00:45:56,464 --> 00:46:01,444
if they're submitting this on their own or if there's any other peers they need to attach to this.

358
00:46:02,014 --> 00:46:11,754
And you can limit that. And allow students to view and download the template in the example I did.

359
00:46:11,774 --> 00:46:20,024
I did not check this because I had already given it to you in a word format, so there wasn't a need for me to share the pdf.

360
00:46:22,484 --> 00:46:30,674
And then I would create that assignment. My second step would be given the pdf I uploaded.

361
00:46:31,124 --> 00:46:35,464
What do I want to score students on? All right.

362
00:46:35,794 --> 00:46:45,094
And so how I basically need to build the questions that I want to grade.

363
00:46:45,814 --> 00:46:50,254
So I'm going to say. Q 1.1.

364
00:46:52,264 --> 00:46:59,924
In a girl of X. Next question.

365
00:47:00,824 --> 00:47:04,474
Q 1.2 derivative.

366
00:47:05,834 --> 00:47:13,114
Again. I'm just using the. Items three is going to be.

367
00:47:14,034 --> 00:47:17,304
Q to geography.

368
00:47:24,284 --> 00:47:29,694
23.1. c02.

369
00:47:31,834 --> 00:47:41,664
Do. And Q3 point to noble gases.

370
00:47:42,534 --> 00:47:56,854
So for a homework. Basically I'm indicating what I want students to tag for me so that grade school will automatically take me to these questions.

371
00:47:59,344 --> 00:48:03,514
Okay. And I guess by default it awarded one point.

372
00:48:04,474 --> 00:48:12,144
So my assignment is five points total. But. This can be modified.

373
00:48:17,484 --> 00:48:24,224
Because in canvas I said that that was a. 50 point.

374
00:48:25,514 --> 00:48:32,984
So in my assignment creation, I've created the outline and I'm going to save that and I'm going to get a little checkbox.

375
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:39,584
But I can always come back to the edit outline to see how I set it up and to make any changes I'd like.

376
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:49,154
The next thing is going to be wait for students to submit so that you can manage the submissions.

377
00:48:49,154 --> 00:48:57,283
Here's where you will see all of the names of students that have submitted and then you're ready to grade the submissions.

378
00:48:57,284 --> 00:49:01,664
And again, these question, this question list. Here is what I generated.

379
00:49:02,894 --> 00:49:13,864
When I created that outline. So it's several steps, but I think there are some aspects that you make up for on the back end.

380
00:49:18,694 --> 00:49:24,004
And so what I wanted to do is share that we are here to offer support.

381
00:49:24,424 --> 00:49:32,373
If you wanted to contact instructional support, we can help you think through whether great scope would be a good fit for any

382
00:49:32,374 --> 00:49:37,564
of your assignments or specific ones that you're interested in trying it with.

383
00:49:37,744 --> 00:49:42,693
We can assist with that those set up steps and help you think through which assignment

384
00:49:42,694 --> 00:49:48,154
type and how to set it up is going to be the easiest for you and your students.

385
00:49:48,874 --> 00:49:52,474
We can offer greater training and support to your teaching team.

386
00:49:53,014 --> 00:50:00,724
And then, of course, to answer any questions as you use the tool or experiment or think about using it.

387
00:50:01,964 --> 00:50:07,064
And then I also just wanted to share some other trainings we have coming up next week.

388
00:50:07,814 --> 00:50:11,654
I'll put them in the chat here on our instructional services calendar.

389
00:50:11,654 --> 00:50:16,304
We're talking about peer review strategies and tools for peer review assignments.

390
00:50:16,994 --> 00:50:18,054
What are new quizzes?

391
00:50:18,074 --> 00:50:27,344
If you've seen the new quizzes option, when you've added a quiz in a canvas site, we're going to talk about what that tool is and how it's different.

392
00:50:28,004 --> 00:50:35,834
And then we're going to talk about building community through discussion tools we have available and which one is the best fit for,

393
00:50:36,404 --> 00:50:44,414
for your course and what you're trying to achieve. So thank you so much again for coming.

394
00:50:44,434 --> 00:50:52,234
Today, I'm going to share with you the recording and some other resource links, and you should have that later today.

395
00:50:53,434 --> 00:50:57,724
They think they're very much done. Thank you so much.

396
00:50:57,754 --> 00:51:00,394
Have a great rest of your day. It a bang.
