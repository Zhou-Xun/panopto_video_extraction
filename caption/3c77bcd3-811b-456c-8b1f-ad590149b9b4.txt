Welcome to the Epidemiology Department Math Module series, Probability Rules.

2
00:00:06,662 --> 00:00:08,910
My name is Miatta Buxton and

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:14,795
I am an assistant research scientist in the Epidemiology Department.

4
00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:21,318
This unit extends foundational probability concepts and

5
00:00:21,318 --> 00:00:28,384
covers rules of probability used to solve a range of problems.

6
00:00:28,384 --> 00:00:34,794
Before we get started, I want to remind you to view the videos that are listed on

7
00:00:34,794 --> 00:00:41,711
this modules page to become familiar with background information on probability.

8
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:46,403
If you can't, I encourage you to watch a number of the videos

9
00:00:46,403 --> 00:00:49,264
before proceeding with this video.

10
00:00:49,264 --> 00:00:54,121
The objective of this module is to cover important rules

11
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:59,077
that I used in probability and the goal is that by the end of

12
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:03,829
this unit you will be able to first explain addition and

13
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:08,892
multiplication rules of probability and then also be able

14
00:01:08,892 --> 00:01:15,541
to identify the rule of probability that is needed to solve a given problem.

15
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:22,118
And lastly apply the rules of probability to solve problems.

16
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:25,762
A quick recap of the definition of probability from

17
00:01:25,762 --> 00:01:28,729
the introduction to probability video,

18
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:33,487
probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event happening.

19
00:01:33,487 --> 00:01:39,687
So essence when we calculate probability forgiving event,

20
00:01:39,687 --> 00:01:44,425
we are trying to understand how likely it is for

21
00:01:44,425 --> 00:01:49,058
that particular event of interest to occur.

22
00:01:49,058 --> 00:01:55,657
So far, we have covered finding the probability of single events,

23
00:01:55,657 --> 00:02:03,783
for example, picking a single ball out of a box of many balls or rolling affair die.

24
00:02:03,783 --> 00:02:08,067
But we can also calculate the probability of more than one event.

25
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:12,409
And to be able to do this, we have to know the rules that guy

26
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:16,307
calculating the probability of multiple events.

27
00:02:16,307 --> 00:02:19,640
So let's take a look at the first rule,

28
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,794
the multiplication rule or the intersection probability.

29
00:02:24,794 --> 00:02:32,225
The multiplication rule allows for calculation of joint probabilities and

30
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:36,750
they are indicated by the use of the word and for

31
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,248
example the probability of A and B.

32
00:02:40,248 --> 00:02:44,976
So you can calculate the probability of multiple

33
00:02:44,976 --> 00:02:49,942
events that are either independent or dependent.

34
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:56,397
Two events are said to be independent if they do not affect each other.

35
00:02:56,397 --> 00:03:00,026
So for example, rolling two dice and

36
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:04,953
getting three on one die and four on the other die.

37
00:03:04,953 --> 00:03:08,349
If events A and B are independent,

38
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:14,321
then the probability that they both occur equals the product

39
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:19,135
of the probability of A and the probability of B.

40
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:24,719
And this is donated in this blue text

41
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:30,651
box shown on your screen where in P( A and

42
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:36,077
B) = P(A) multiplied by P(B).

43
00:03:36,077 --> 00:03:39,672
On the other hand,

44
00:03:39,672 --> 00:03:45,737
if events A and B are dependent,

45
00:03:45,737 --> 00:03:50,681
then the probability that

46
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:56,523
they both occur equals P( A and

47
00:03:56,523 --> 00:04:03,728
B) = P(A) multiply by P(B|A).

48
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:08,864
So here, the location is a little bit different because

49
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:13,793
you see the probability of B a vertical bar and then A.

50
00:04:13,793 --> 00:04:18,604
Here this part of the equation denotes the probability

51
00:04:18,604 --> 00:04:23,213
that B occurs, giving that A has already occurred.

52
00:04:23,213 --> 00:04:27,379
This is called a conditional probability because we

53
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:32,309
are setting a condition that A has to occur before B can occur.

54
00:04:32,309 --> 00:04:38,507
So two events are dependent if they do affect each other.

55
00:04:38,507 --> 00:04:39,656
For example,

56
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:45,127
picking two balls in succession without replacing the first ball.

57
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:51,671
So we'll review a couple of examples to demonstrate the multiplication rule.

58
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:54,291
The first example is asking for

59
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:59,942
the probability of getting three and four when two dice at rolled.

60
00:04:59,942 --> 00:05:03,346
These are considered independent events,

61
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:08,131
since each does not interfere with whether the other occurs.

62
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:14,158
So we'll use the formula for independent events,

63
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:20,478
which is P( A and B) = P(A) multiplied by P(B).

64
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,800
So we can use that formula to set up our problems to represent

65
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,918
the information given in the problem, in the question.

66
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:35,783
So we know that each standard die has six numbers, so

67
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:42,431
the probability of getting a three on the first die is actually 1/6.

68
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:47,224
Similarly, the probability of getting of four on

69
00:05:47,224 --> 00:05:52,245
the second die is also 1/6 since there's a single

70
00:05:52,245 --> 00:05:57,054
four on a die and a total of six possible outcomes.

71
00:05:57,054 --> 00:06:00,779
The probability of getting a three and

72
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:05,560
four from rolling to dice is actually 1/36.

73
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,620
So we multiply the probability of each one, and

74
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:15,203
we obtain an answer by multiplying the numerator by numerator and

75
00:06:15,203 --> 00:06:17,959
a denominator by denominator.

76
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:23,150
So our answer is 1/36.

77
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,219
For our second example, we want to know the probability of

78
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:34,115
choosing a yellow ball on the first pick and a green ball on the second

79
00:06:34,115 --> 00:06:39,503
pick from a box that has two yellow balls and three green ball.

80
00:06:39,503 --> 00:06:44,287
These events are dependent because they do affect each

81
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:49,180
other after the first boss selected it is not replaced.

82
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,965
Therefore, the total number of outcomes becomes four instead of

83
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:56,841
five that we originally started with.

84
00:06:56,841 --> 00:07:00,718
So using the formula for dependent events,

85
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:05,853
the probability of drawing a yellow ball is 2/5 because

86
00:07:05,853 --> 00:07:10,280
we have two yellow balls and a total of five balls.

87
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,735
However, the probability of drawing a green ball,

88
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:20,911
given that we have already drawn a yellow ball is now 3/4 because we did

89
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:25,994
not replace the yellow ball that we do at the first drawing.

90
00:07:25,994 --> 00:07:30,752
So now the probability has changed to 3/4,

91
00:07:30,752 --> 00:07:36,731
which is different from the first probability of 2/5.

92
00:07:36,731 --> 00:07:40,996
So if we multiply numerator by numerator and

93
00:07:40,996 --> 00:07:45,503
denominator by denominator we get 6/20.

94
00:07:45,503 --> 00:07:50,833
Which we can reduce further by dividing by two and

95
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:55,390
then we get 3/10 as our final answer.

96
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:03,108
Next we will move to the second category of rules that guide probability problems.

97
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:09,167
And this is the additional rule, which is also referred to as the union probability.

98
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:15,620
And this allows for the calculation of the probability for more than one event.

99
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,963
These events may be exclusive or not exclusive.

100
00:08:19,963 --> 00:08:24,707
The events are described using or so

101
00:08:24,707 --> 00:08:30,725
an example would be the probability of A or B.

102
00:08:30,725 --> 00:08:35,710
So there are rules for exclusive events and for two events to be exclusive,

103
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,598
they are exclusive if both cannot happen at the same time.

104
00:08:39,598 --> 00:08:43,542
For example, you cannot rule of four and

105
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:47,259
a five at the same time on a single die.

106
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:53,657
So the rule for exclusive events is that the probability of A or

107
00:08:53,657 --> 00:08:59,821
B is equal to the probability of a plus the probability of B.

108
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:03,140
Whereas, there are rules for

109
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,920
nonexclusive events states if events A and

110
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,292
B are non exclusive, then the probability that either or

111
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:20,156
both of them occurs equals the probability of A or B.

112
00:09:20,156 --> 00:09:27,260
In this case will be the P(A) + P(B)- P(A and

113
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,850
B) and you'll see that in an example.

114
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,756
So two events are considered to be non exclusive if both

115
00:09:37,756 --> 00:09:40,964
events can happen at the same time.

116
00:09:40,964 --> 00:09:48,465
So for example, rolling an even number and rolling a multiple of two on a single die.

117
00:09:48,465 --> 00:09:50,465
So we'll now go over two examples.

118
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:54,695
One will cover the rule for exclusive events and

119
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:58,829
the other will focus on nonexclusive events.

120
00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:05,787
The first example as to calculate the probability of picking an orange or

121
00:10:05,787 --> 00:10:12,971
red ball if the ball is randomly drawn from a box containing 10 red balls,

122
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:18,577
30 white balls, 20 blue balls and 15 orange balls.

123
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:24,804
So in this case we use the formula for exclusive events.

124
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:29,896
And we first will calculate the probability of picking

125
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:36,105
an orange ball which is 15 over the total number of balls we have.

126
00:10:36,105 --> 00:10:39,336
In this case we have a total of 75 balls.

127
00:10:39,336 --> 00:10:44,388
So if you do the math you get 0.2.

128
00:10:44,388 --> 00:10:50,883
Next we'll calculate the probability of selecting a red ball.

129
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:55,862
We have 10 balls, so it would be 10 balls divided

130
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:59,604
by the total of 75 balls that we have.

131
00:10:59,604 --> 00:11:03,344
In this case the answer Is gonna be 0.13.

132
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:07,964
And when we do act the two probabilities which would

133
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:12,694
be the probability of drawing an orange or red ball,

134
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:19,051
you have your answer being 0.33, so that's 0.2 + 0.13.

135
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:23,826
For your final answer of 0.33.

136
00:11:23,826 --> 00:11:28,299
Next we'll move on to the fourth example which is

137
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:33,109
the second example for addition of probabilities.

138
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:38,329
So this example is asking for the probability of rolling

139
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:43,668
an even number that is a multiple of three on the same die.

140
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:48,484
So in this case we're gonna use the formula for nonexclusive event.

141
00:11:48,484 --> 00:11:54,025
Where we have the P(A or

142
00:11:54,025 --> 00:12:03,178
B) = P(A) + P(B)- P(A and B).

143
00:12:03,178 --> 00:12:06,983
I know it's a mouthful but we'll walk through it and

144
00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:09,327
you understand how this works.

145
00:12:09,327 --> 00:12:14,687
So the probability of getting an even number from a single

146
00:12:14,687 --> 00:12:20,158
roll of a die is actually 3/6 because you have 1 to 6 and

147
00:12:20,158 --> 00:12:24,979
you have three even numbers you have 2, 4 and 6.

148
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:30,906
So the probability of rolling an even number

149
00:12:30,906 --> 00:12:37,804
is actually 3/6 which you can reduce to 1/2.

150
00:12:37,804 --> 00:12:40,696
Next we want to understand or

151
00:12:40,696 --> 00:12:46,001
find the probability of having a multiple of three.

152
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:48,669
So you know you have six numbers and

153
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:53,648
only two numbers from those six numbers are multiples of three.

154
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,809
So you have three and you have six.

155
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:02,451
So in this case the probability of getting a multiple

156
00:13:02,451 --> 00:13:07,848
of three is 2/6 which can be reduced to 1/3.

157
00:13:07,848 --> 00:13:12,885
Then finally we want to find the probability of

158
00:13:12,885 --> 00:13:18,448
rolling an even number that is a multiple of three.

159
00:13:18,448 --> 00:13:21,624
So we can only obtain an even number and

160
00:13:21,624 --> 00:13:26,696
a multiple of three on a single roll of a die by rolling of six.

161
00:13:26,696 --> 00:13:29,798
There are three even numbers 2, 4 and

162
00:13:29,798 --> 00:13:35,062
6 the only multiple of three from this list of even numbers is six.

163
00:13:35,062 --> 00:13:42,379
Therefore, the probability of rolling on six is actually 1/6.

164
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:45,360
So now we've gotten the probabilities for

165
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,931
the individual components and now we need to solve the equation.

166
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:54,595
So this is the equation rating out using the specific

167
00:13:54,595 --> 00:13:58,416
information provided for this question.

168
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:04,931
And we see that once we replace the description

169
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:09,942
with their actual probabilities we

170
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:16,468
have 3/6 + 2/6- 3/6 times 2/6.

171
00:14:16,468 --> 00:14:21,703
So if we add the first part of the equation, we get 5/6 and

172
00:14:21,703 --> 00:14:28,198
then once we do the multiplication on the second part of the question we get

173
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:35,011
6/36 meaning we've multiplied 3 times 2 so numerator to numerator and

174
00:14:35,011 --> 00:14:40,511
then 6 times 6 denominator to denominator, so we get 36.

175
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:46,267
So now we have 5/6- 1/6.

176
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:50,960
And because these fractions have the same denominator we

177
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,859
are able to directly subtract one fraction from the other.

178
00:14:55,859 --> 00:15:00,502
So in this case the answer will be 4/6, or

179
00:15:00,502 --> 00:15:06,534
if we reduce it further we get 2/3 as our final answer.

180
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:13,832
So this unit has covered multiplication and addition rules for probability.

181
00:15:13,832 --> 00:15:20,307
And we've also covered exclusive events, nonexclusive events and

182
00:15:20,307 --> 00:15:24,666
then also dependent and independent events.

183
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:30,842
So hopefully this was a quick snapshot of these rules and how they apply.

184
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:35,742
But you will have an opportunity to the practice in events

185
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:39,532
your understanding of the material cover.

186
00:15:39,532 --> 00:15:44,353
So I encourage you to visit Canvas to find the practice quiz and

187
00:15:44,353 --> 00:15:47,971
it's gonna be titled probability of rules and

188
00:15:47,971 --> 00:15:53,071
there you are going to be able to have opportunity the practice and

189
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:55,965
apply the material as your own pace.

190
00:15:55,965 --> 00:16:00,030
The answers will be available after you complete the quiz and

191
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:05,067
you may take the quiz as many times as you like.
