1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,520
Right. Oh, God.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,560
No virus. No virus is a hot topic.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,909
I was going to bring a couple of slides on that, but bring it up.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,940
Bring it after Thanksgiving.

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,370
Yeah. Everybody see that announcement adenovirus and give us address is one of the it's a

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:28,880
super interesting problem because if we were to go ahead and test everybody on campus,

7
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:35,180
I mean, it would be incredibly high. It's it's a if you can it's super, super common.

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,580
It's almost always super, super mild. But then it shuts.

9
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:46,100
After you are after you're infected, it shuts for a really long time.

10
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,600
It can sit for over a month or more. So for PCR, you pick it up for a really long time.

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:57,140
So they actually don't like to put it on diagnostic panels because so many people are positive for the virus even when they're asymptomatic.

12
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:06,230
But Adenoviruses also tricky because it's not in almost all of the respiratory viruses we've been working on this class are RNA viruses,

13
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:11,330
and the virus is a DNA virus and it's fairly hardy.

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,359
It can stay on surfaces for a long time.

15
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:26,719
There's a lot of history of adenovirus in military barracks, causing very protracted long outbreaks because it has respiratory routes of transmission,

16
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,930
but it also likely has contact roots of transmission as well.

17
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:39,049
So really interesting virus. I'll bring I'll bring some stuff when we come back from Thanksgiving, more stuff on the antivirus plus part.

18
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:45,020
Old man just sent me a paper from like, I don't know, it's like the sixties, the editor.

19
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:52,280
So I'll be we'll bring that to you. So, yes, super interesting virus.

20
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,559
Anybody what is the what is the temperature talking about adenovirus on campus.

21
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,150
Of course, you're all grad students, so I don't know that you're hanging out in South Quad.

22
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:12,320
Maybe you are. But I'm just I'm registered for an undergraduate class, and I've heard a lot of sick undergrads the past few.

23
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:19,310
Yeah. I don't know if it's all virus, but I know it is.

24
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:26,200
Yeah, I think some of it is for sure. Yeah. I'm happy to be there.

25
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:34,490
And I think is, uh, I don't know how much is out there versus how much I just know.

26
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,510
But yeah, yeah. There is a, there isn't kids like it is.

27
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,650
Some of it is one of these situations where you know,

28
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,139
they have a really low threshold for testing for when you see a bunch of illnesses

29
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,320
on a team because you don't want to give it to the other teams and stuff like that.

30
00:02:52,190 --> 00:03:03,360
Um. Yeah. I also caught students four or five, like a sixth of my classes every day.

31
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,150
I also have a bunch six student u h s.

32
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,560
So we have actually been seeing the feed of a virus outbreak since like September.

33
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:21,690
So I was kind of shocked when it just came out like last week with Lake Michigan that I was like, Oh, I thought this was old news.

34
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,100
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And with the U.

35
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:32,879
H. S data is, you know, sort of sort of interesting because we usually see really high, high rates of virus around this time period.

36
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,930
But they've been taping it and and looking at streams and stuff to it.

37
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,649
Yeah. It's, it's this weird balance, you know, because I think that a lot of people in the surveillance world,

38
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:50,760
their first impulse is to say, oh, well, you're it's it's over surveillance like now that COVID is over.

39
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,240
But there's definitely some pretty like pretty sick people.

40
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,860
It could be that there's just so much that these rare events are kind of rising to the top as well.

41
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,270
Yeah. Plus, there's probably all sorts other stuff. So doing.

42
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,770
All right, I am going to make my second.

43
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:22,079
Is this my second or my third attempt at doing the herpes virus? There's the one that didn't get recorded.

44
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,069
So it's at least my third attempt at the herpes virus workshop.

45
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:34,650
And I have a battery in the microphone side out of the shot and I have albuterol and given we're going to do it.

46
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:41,729
So it's funny that this is this for some reason is like lecture.

47
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:49,110
That's been my Achilles heel, given that I studied herpes viruses for so many years and they're like some of my favorites.

48
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:56,909
But rates, herpes viruses, we've got different categories of herpes viruses.

49
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,760
This is a remember that this is a DNA virus. Double stranded DNA genome.

50
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,870
Double stranded DNA genome means it's going to be incredibly, incredibly stable and it's going to be rather hardy.

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,280
It does have an envelope.

52
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:23,489
So, you know, it's going to be rather hardy in the context where the infections are actually possible because it's an enveloped virus.

53
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,500
We actually, though, don't see a whole lot of transmission outside of its normal transmission system.

54
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:35,070
So we see, for instance, transmission through bodily fluids or transmission through contact mediated transmission.

55
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,399
We don't see a lot of transmission through situations.

56
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:46,320
For instance, the classic example here is like the gym towel or the wet towel that's herpes transmit through through that.

57
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:54,600
And then those sorts of fomite sorts of transmission are tend to be rather uncommon with herpes.

58
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:02,340
I will show you an exception, but we tend to see it more through direct contact or through bodily fluid transmission.

59
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:10,760
So we've got the alphas, the betas and the games and the human viruses.

60
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,819
Remember I mentioned before that the games tend to be very slow growing viruses

61
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,810
to the point where it made it even difficult to identify the Epstein-Barr virus,

62
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:30,650
actually identify it in culture. The Alphas tend to be the more quick growing, highly virulent,

63
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:38,390
more often seen in muc octavius infections for the alpha slots HSV one, HSV two, herpes simplex one and two.

64
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:50,990
Um, the all of these viruses though notice that they are common in the fact that they establish latency.

65
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:58,940
So you do not clear a herpes virus infection once you get a herpes virus infection because in order for that to happen,

66
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,920
you'd have to clear all of the cells that had established a latent infection.

67
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:10,340
So as they say in the herpes clinic I used to work in, herpes is forever.

68
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:19,160
It's the gift that keeps on giving. It is it is always it is a chronic infection once it's established because of this latency.

69
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:32,150
So you have different cell patterns in which latency can be established depending on the group of herpes viruses as well.

70
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:40,250
So the key to understanding the replication, I'm not going to ask you to memorize this whole thing,

71
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,260
but you're going to have it with you in case you need it.

72
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:54,610
You'll have internet slides, but herpes virus replication, so entry can be fusion or it can be through end of psychosis.

73
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:02,690
And at this and so the cell the cell and initial entry process,

74
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:13,010
the NUCLEOCAPSID is then going to be translated or kind of transported then to the eventually to the nucleus.

75
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:21,800
Once it gets to the nucleus, you have this circle formation of the genome happening at that point.

76
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:29,960
This circumcised genome that's formed in the nucleus then is going to start producing transcripts,

77
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,440
and these transcripts are then going to start producing proteins.

78
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:42,590
Now, remember, I've told you a few times that DNA viruses tend to have these very systematic and procedural processes,

79
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:51,709
so their production of proteins over time. So you have these intermediate early phase proteins that are produced, you have these early phase proteins,

80
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,610
they're produced, and then you have these late phase proteins that are produced over time.

81
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:01,520
And these you see this gets quite complex in terms of how how the process happens.

82
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:14,400
At some point, it's then going to establish latency.

83
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:25,350
And latency is the point at which the virus is no longer producing new copies of itself, but it's still in this cell in a stable formation,

84
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:31,050
and it can reactivate to the point where it produces new copies of itself at a later point.

85
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:37,000
Now, we used to say that latent herpes viruses didn't do any like.

86
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,920
It was just it didn't do much else.

87
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:53,280
But now we know that herpes virus genomes do protect do kind of produce these latency associated transcripts.

88
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,469
During that latent phase, it is still producing transcripts and proteins.

89
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:04,350
We actually think that these proteins play some sort of role in stopping apoptosis from happening,

90
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:14,070
like maintaining kind of blocking the process that the cell could use to destroy itself and thus destroying the latent virus genome that's in there,

91
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:21,659
and specifically of a varicella zoster virus.

92
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:29,190
It's a herpes virus. When it expresses latent associated latency, associated translates that all inhibit interferon alpha.

93
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:41,819
Now some of these latency associated transcripts in these proteins, they've also been associated with, you know, herpes viruses.

94
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:49,200
Some herpes viruses are linked to the development of cancer. And it's these transcripts and the proteins from these transcripts that are then

95
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:55,170
are then linked to these herpes virus associated cancers that specifically,

96
00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:00,569
for instance, with EBV, Epstein-Barr virus and with Kaposi sarcoma,

97
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:06,720
it's probably the latency process that then leads to those those cancer manifestations.

98
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:24,910
For reactivation, you know, from a latent Ellington status of the virus, you can then have a go into reactivation.

99
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:33,910
Now, reactivation is often a response to some sort of stressor or or kind of cellular level trauma.

100
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,380
So you can have stimulation by radiate radiation trauma, hyperthermia, hypoxia, immunosuppression.

101
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:49,090
Immunosuppression is something we see very, very commonly or we see this happen commonly in people who are immunosuppressed.

102
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:59,980
So if you think about how Kaposi sarcoma, when we learned about the first characterization of HIV and Kaposi sarcoma,

103
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,550
what it was, these clusters of Kaposi's sarcoma that people were noticing.

104
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:11,440
And it's because the immunosuppression caused by the HIV alert basically created

105
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,570
the stressor to allow the reactivation of these latent transcripts of chaos.

106
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:24,310
So people had HIV AIDS. They had probably carried it for years and years and years prior to getting infected with HIV.

107
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:32,140
It was immunosuppression of HIV that allowed the chaos a lot of the 88 to then start to replicate even more,

108
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:38,680
creating all of the the the manifestations of Kaposi sarcoma that people were seeing.

109
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:47,590
So when this this is kind of the like very technical official list, but radiation,

110
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,399
what they mean by radiation, oftentimes just simply sunlight can cause reactivation.

111
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:01,810
So if people have, for instance, HSV one or two linked to their oral mucosa,

112
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:10,000
you can actually have reactivation based on exposure to TV, right through that, through exposure to sunlight.

113
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:24,509
So when you have this kind of establishment of latency and this reactivation in herpes simplex virus,

114
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:30,240
you see this through this axonal transport on the neural ganglia.

115
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,880
And so if you look at this whole process, you have this initial entry happening here.

116
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:44,130
You have an initial lesion that for you may or may not have an initial primary lesion that forms when an entry happens.

117
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:55,770
Then you have an infection entering the ganglia and it's going to settle in the nerves near the spine so that when recurrence happens.

118
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:03,090
So basically, well, first, the sight that the initial reflex fractions of your contact mediated transmission,

119
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:11,980
you have contact that deposits virus on the skin right here, the nerve that's closest to that site on the skin where that deposit has happened.

120
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,920
That's the nerve that you're going to have the virus travel along.

121
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:25,260
So this means that the virus itself is going to come down and establish latency and nerves that are near the spine.

122
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:30,329
And those circular genomes that we looked at in the earlier slide,

123
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:35,370
when reactivation happens, you basically have the circular genomes, produce new variants.

124
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:42,270
Those virions are going to travel back up that same nerve and create another secondary lesion,

125
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:46,710
a recurrent lesion at that point right here to release the virus.

126
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:53,010
Now, there may or may not be a lesion, to be honest. We know that shedding happens even when there's no visible lesion.

127
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:56,940
There might be lesions that are so small that you don't view it.

128
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:02,310
But notice it comes all the way back here. So it's very interesting.

129
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:10,040
The molecular epidemiology of this virus is very, very interesting because you have you had this first arm,

130
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:17,159
this first entry, and then you've got this circular DNA that's sitting in there.

131
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,750
And it's not changing because it's latent. So you're not having a molecular therapy.

132
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,080
You're not having it change over and over, over time.

133
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,760
So the variation in a single person that could be infected for decades,

134
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,710
but they have the same base genome that's always been used to produce those variants.

135
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:39,750
So the if you're kind of monitoring one person over time,

136
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:47,340
the genes that you see in their virus over time is going to be really the change that's occurring during that single reactivation event,

137
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:56,210
not the change that occurs during their whole life span because they've got this stable, single construct that's in there,

138
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,049
you know that that all of their reactivation is always kind of come back to that same genome to be created.

139
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:06,090
Does that make sense? So it's a very like strange molecular epidemiology pattern over time.

140
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:14,850
Yes. Replication happening there. So you have replication you do have replication happening during the reactivation event.

141
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:21,240
But once the reactivation of that concludes, you're still back at that starting genome.

142
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:27,180
So that second reactivation event starts again at that like that initial genome

143
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,040
again and then has that replication it doesn't pick up from the last replication.

144
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:40,649
Now the exception to that would be if somebody were to auto inoculate themselves and start a new infection in their body.

145
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,250
But that would happen at a second site.

146
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:51,570
So sometimes people by auto populate their fingers or eyes and that kind of starts a whole new fresh process, if that makes sense.

147
00:16:52,570 --> 00:17:03,110
Yeah. So here's an example of what this nerve process looks like.

148
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:08,299
You've got your incoming HSV one variant and you've got retrograde transport

149
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:16,850
of the caps to the capsids and kind of takes it back to where it forms this,

150
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:23,750
the circular genome. And then in the event of of reactivation,

151
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:33,620
you see these variants are produced in these variants are then pushed back up to a retrograde back to the surface.

152
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:40,670
And then you're shedding these variants from kind of from the the axon terminals right there.

153
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:51,000
So with HSV one and HSV two and I talk about HSV one versus HSV two a little bit more in a second.

154
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:57,220
You know, there was a lot of work for a long time, really focused on the lesions.

155
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,899
So how often do lesions happen on the skin and lesion recurrences?

156
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:08,310
And with the observation that lesion recurrences tend to always happen in the same spot.

157
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:15,760
So you have a recurrent lesion coming going from the same spot, which makes sense because that's that nearest nerve is the nerve that was infected.

158
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,810
That's where that spot is coming in going from.

159
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:29,030
But the more that people looked into this over time, the more that they realized that reactivation in HSV two can actually be very, very frequent.

160
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:37,160
It can happen pretty often. Whether or not there's a visible lesion present, you can't have virus come through the nerve to the surface.

161
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:46,750
And so here is just an interesting study that was done where they mapped out when lesions were occurring,

162
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:56,410
but then when culture positivity was happening as well and then looking at it like PCR detection over time.

163
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:02,989
So you have these very low levels of virus being released even though you're having not

164
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:09,170
always having culture detection and your lesion is even during a smaller period of time.

165
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:19,040
I actually had a classmate when I was working in this research group that was doing geospatial

166
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:27,230
mapping of reactivation patterns and shading using like a very mildly sticky contact paper.

167
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,460
So really impressive participants in this research study.

168
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:36,140
But they were like being they were like topologically mapping where this because the setting will tend

169
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:41,600
to stay in very similar topological patterns over the area of the skin where you have more reactivation.

170
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,480
So most for all.

171
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:57,090
Your classes are going to tell you that HSV one is an oral herpes virus and HSV two is a is a genital herpes virus.

172
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:07,620
This is not a hard and fast rule in HSV two virus can infect the mucosa in the oral regions.

173
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,760
You can have HSV one infect mucosa and genital region.

174
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:21,920
There are no there are some studies that suggest that that it's better, you know,

175
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:30,840
that there's it's actually a very kind of there are some studies that say that HSV one is better at infecting the oral sex and worse in,

176
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,670
frankly, genital sites and vice versa.

177
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:39,390
And then there are some studies that say that they have pretty, pretty equal ability to affect each side if given kind of the equal chance.

178
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:48,990
And then there's also studies that kind of say whether reactivation might be more or less likely in those different body sites.

179
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:57,990
What is likely also playing into this? It is just simply an epidemiologic pattern that there was oral enough oral,

180
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:08,160
oral contact to allow HSV one that had emerged in that space to continue in genital genital contact to allow HSV two to emerge in that space.

181
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:16,079
When we saw, you know, we've seen shifts over time epidemiologically in sexual behavior by generation.

182
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,950
And you will actually see that HSV, the HSV one,

183
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:30,809
HSV two distribution by body site will change by birth cohort by generation to depending on sexual behavior patterns in different countries,

184
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:38,790
different communities and different generations. So which sort of suggests that there are there's an epidemiologic component to this

185
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:45,270
this kind of dogma that HSV one is the oral virus and HSV two is the genital virus.

186
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,640
All right.

187
00:21:50,660 --> 00:22:05,540
Moving on to herpes zoster or a V, so latency and reactivation is going to be similarly also a pattern with varicella zoster virus or herpes zoster.

188
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:14,630
This is a virus where you can have inoculation happening actually orally,

189
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,200
but will then lead to lesions in the skin where when you have a primary infection,

190
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:27,110
you can have skin lesions happening, you can have virus being released from the skin.

191
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:37,910
Again, you're having that retrograde transport to the spinal cord area and then react in a latency established and then a reactivation happening.

192
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:43,759
And then you can have a reactivated skin infection and this is what is a zoster.

193
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:52,490
So zoster is when you've got this, this area of the skin that's inflamed where you've got a dermatol and you have lesions happening.

194
00:22:52,730 --> 00:23:01,880
But it tends to be one area of the skin and not a full body activation like you see when you have a primary skin infection with PCV.

195
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:12,880
So the. Viral factors here.

196
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:24,260
Just sort of it's sort of interesting to kind of think about how easy the spreads like releases from this skid and spreads here.

197
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:31,660
So you have a lot of like skin level. You've got basically the T cells are able to carry the virus around.

198
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:37,420
And then you've got all these skin level like cytokines and various interferons that

199
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:43,480
are trying to then prevent the release of the virus when they get to the skin as well.

200
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:51,370
So Wacom more complicated than you need to know, but it really is that the degree to which of the infection is going to lead to skin

201
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:57,489
shedding has to do with immune factors that are happening in in the epidermis,

202
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:05,490
like in the skin layer to prevent that. So the.

203
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:17,609
See. So the specific incidence rate of herpes zoster in North America,

204
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:30,059
Europe and and Asia Pacific is kind of an interesting pattern in that it's very consistent across many different areas that with

205
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:39,110
many different kind of histories of exposure and uses and uses a vaccine that you sort of see that it's as people get older,

206
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:43,650
that's where you see the zoster really happening.

207
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:48,750
So that reactivation event is really very clearly connected to age in many different settings.

208
00:24:54,040 --> 00:25:14,590
So as we sort of think about transmission, you know, most of most of herpes virus transmission is going to occur by asymptomatic shedding.

209
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:23,889
We now know based on like a lot of epidemiologic studies looking at it and transmission occurs, as I mentioned,

210
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:28,750
by direct because it's an envelope to virus, most transmission is going to occur by direct contact.

211
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:38,290
You may have some close range, close range kind of coughing spread that you'll see, for instance, with the PCV or EBV.

212
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:46,060
But for the most part, you're going to have this is a virus that works better because with direct contact, because it's an involved virus.

213
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:57,600
For many of these viruses, particularly for the simplex viruses, the direct symptoms are going to be the lesions.

214
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:06,000
So you're going to have the skin presentation of what you have all of the skin so that those are the pathogenic effects that you're seeing.

215
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:12,690
And particularly for the simplex viruses, the pathogenic the symptoms that you see are these skin lesions that are being

216
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:18,600
created because of the the destruction that the virus is doing to the skin cells.

217
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:24,299
Now you're going to have all of these other effects. You can have anemia, exhausted, all these areas.

218
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:29,040
And these are due to the immune the like very vigorous immune response of the virus is going to induce.

219
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,590
You also may have fever that marks that primary thing.

220
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:39,300
So. And it's skipping back now.

221
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:45,740
Now, moving away from this sort of latency and and nerve travel patterns.

222
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,700
Let's have a little bit more about the like the clinical epidemiology and what that looks like.

223
00:26:53,090 --> 00:27:01,250
So the for herpes simplex virus, the most common presentation you'll see are these oral lesions in these genital lesions.

224
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:05,690
But there are a number of uncommon presentations as well.

225
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:16,490
So HSV keratitis HSV Whitlow is when you've got three below as when you've got infection, HIV keratitis, you get infection in the eye.

226
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:20,240
You can have actually corneal blindness result from that.

227
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:28,940
HSV Whitlow is actually herpes infection of the tip of the finger and that's often caused betwee from auto inoculation.

228
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,950
So somebody having the virus in a different body site and then inoculating their finger to the point of they get infected.

229
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:43,550
It's interesting that your and your immune system doesn't block that. And it's a rare event when it happens.

230
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:48,980
But it is it is possible for people to to reinfect themselves with their own virus.

231
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,720
Herpes. Glad it's Hurum. Does anybody know what herpes gladiator is?

232
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,660
Herpes. That is horrendous infection, herpes, infection in wrestlers.

233
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,280
And it happens so frequently that it has its own negative.

234
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:17,000
So this is outbreak of herpes, that time in a high school wrestling camp, I believe it was in Wisconsin.

235
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:30,480
If I remember, it was either Wisconsin or Minnesota. So I 60 out of 175 wrestlers at this wrestling camp ended up getting herpes from each other,

236
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:36,000
25% amongst the lightweight wrestlers, 67% amongst the heavyweight wrestlers.

237
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:41,190
So funny. But actually this Adebolajo a top.

238
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:45,850
He's the guy that started the tests negative designed for flu vaccine research.

239
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:53,700
This is one this was like one of his early projects at the CDC when he was like in ice was was investigating herpes

240
00:28:53,700 --> 00:29:07,050
gladiator weren't super so close contact and like moist sweaty environments like really high risk of herpes transmission.

241
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:12,160
So. Okay.

242
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:21,580
So one of the things, you know is I mentioned that HIV,

243
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:33,370
the immune suppression that's caused by HIV can cause more reactivation of HSV and other herpes viruses as well.

244
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:46,750
There's been also a lot of work to see if if somebody who is HIV positive may be more susceptible to getting HIV in the first place.

245
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:55,209
And some of the theories around this have been really around whether the the disruption of the

246
00:29:55,210 --> 00:30:03,220
mucosa allows basically reduces your mucosal barrier or ability to block HIV transmission.

247
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:18,010
So here we see this, this. This is a partner study where we've we know the the partner status of the with we've got to support our partners.

248
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:22,580
Basically you've got somebody with HIV and somebody without HIV in a partnership.

249
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:33,200
And then depending on whether or not the partner, the susceptible the person who's HIV negative has HSV two or not,

250
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:39,680
there was this differential per contact the probability that they get HIV from their infected partner.

251
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,860
So all seropositivity was.

252
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:57,859
So right here is the comparison to basically look at everybody who is seropositive compared that

253
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:08,000
association with acquisition compared to people who were seronegative with no genital ulcer disease.

254
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:13,820
But the highest risk were among people who were. It's starts a lot of combinations.

255
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,410
It's like it's like a logic puzzle here.

256
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:21,890
But the highest risk is seen around people who are HSV two seropositive with genital alternatively ulcer disease.

257
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:29,629
So it's not just the fact that you have a latent or non latent herpes simplex virus.

258
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:40,310
Two, it's not just that you have been infected with herpes, it's actually even though there is some increased risk of your seropositive lot,

259
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:45,770
it is actively having that genital ulcer disease that increases the risk of HIV one transmission.

260
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:52,490
So there is likely some part of that reactivation that is increasing the less the

261
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,930
risk of HIV one transmission in actually when you've got genital ulcer disease.

262
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:59,690
So when you have an active lesion happening on the skin,

263
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:07,760
you actually have a recruitment of a lot of immune cells that come to the skin, come to that site of release of the virus.

264
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:17,540
And because of that, it actually may be drawing susceptible scalp cells closer to the point of where HIV one is being introduced into the body.

265
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:24,499
And so it's it's those cells that are particularly susceptible being infected by HIV.

266
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:32,989
One are actually being drawn to that site of introduction. This is more data on that.

267
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:38,959
I'm not going to go over that. You've got it if you want to see it. That sort of more data on looking at it.

268
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,270
It was from an epidemiologic perspective,

269
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:52,580
you can imagine where the populations of people that are HIV and HCV co-infected there may be epidemiologic bias that happens.

270
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:59,120
And so it was it was sort of a different quite a difficult question to piece out at first because this co-infection,

271
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,420
you also have just these intersections of these infections.

272
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:08,150
Both of these infections are more common in people with higher risk sexual behavior.

273
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:16,850
And so it was this question of was was this epidemiologic phenomenon that we were seeing higher rates of HIV in people with HSV two,

274
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:26,570
or was it actually biologic connection? And so this is a paper here that where they started to tease out controlling for age and sexual behavior,

275
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,590
both in the general population and in commercial sex workers.

276
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:43,280
It's so it's suspected that the proportion that's attributable found the population a triple risk percentage of HIV

277
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:54,830
that's attributable to people having HSV two and therefore having an increased risk of HIV is on this scale right here.

278
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:05,510
So if everyone in a population has aged HSV two is how you read this about 50% of the HIV

279
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:09,830
in that population is going to be attributable to the fact that HSV to increase the risk.

280
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:19,430
So this is a really important component to you know, there's been HSV vaccine efforts going on for a really long time.

281
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:23,990
And it is a you know, it's an incredibly common virus.

282
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:30,650
It is a virus where most of the people that have HSV two do not know that they have HSV two.

283
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,300
So HSV one is incredibly common, like over 80% of people have it.

284
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:41,750
HSV two is less common, but it's, you know, mostly goes undetected to the individual that has it.

285
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:49,040
And so it has been debated at its value as a vaccine target has been debated over time.

286
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,690
Is is is this mostly a virus where the stigma is worse than anything?

287
00:34:53,700 --> 00:35:00,049
Were there actual you know rare we have severe events happening from a herpes simplex virus infection very rare.

288
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,130
You're not going to have that very often.

289
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:07,900
Now, obviously, we've talked about earlier that it's important to prevent transmission during the birth process.

290
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:15,140
So we have a focus on pregnancy. But, you know, why do we need a wide population vaccination strategy?

291
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:20,540
And this is one of the reasons why that's been promoted is because of the co-infection

292
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:27,560
with HIV can be so damaging and because it increases people's risk of acquiring HIV.

293
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:37,700
This sort of supports the case for it being a vaccine target. So sort of this interesting way of thinking about why the why for vaccination.

294
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:53,700
All right. So, EBV, we've already talked about the most common cause of infectious mononucleosis.

295
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:00,299
And highest in that 15 to 24 year old range.

296
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,050
But there might be some bit of ascertainment bias in those population numbers.

297
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:14,960
We talked about the discovery, Epstein-Barr virus, I don't think I mentioned named after Sir Epstein and Dr. Yvonne Barr.

298
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:18,360
I don't know why she didn't become a sir or lady or whatever.

299
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:30,270
She didn't get knighted by your guess is as good as mine, but discovered by the two of them as cause of Burkitt lymphoma,

300
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:35,249
possibly also a cause of Hodgkin's, cause of some cases of heart in football.

301
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:39,940
My knees or Ferndale carcinoma. All right.

302
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:47,680
Let me now move into some of the clinical aspects of some of the other herpes viruses as well.

303
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,540
I to start with varicella. So this is this is me with chickenpox.

304
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:57,370
How many people do this every year? How many people in the past have I check a box? All right.

305
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:02,860
Here at like less than half now, every year it gets down just a little bit more.

306
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,140
Oh, I should have. I saw the scar from this pox right there.

307
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:15,160
And this is my little brother. And he had to think of this sister.

308
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:23,649
And my sister is not in this picture because she did not get chickenpox categorized as an adult.

309
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:27,700
She ended up staying in a different part of the house area.

310
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:38,620
So prior to the vaccine era, varicella was causing about 2 to 3 hospitalizations per 1000 cases per year in healthy children,

311
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:43,719
but many, many more hospitalizations per thousand cases per year in adults.

312
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:50,530
If you get chickenpox for the first time as a kid, as you can see here, you just you look like this.

313
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:56,590
You feel better in a little while. If you get chickenpox for the first time as an adult, it can be much more severe.

314
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:02,200
So you see, it's been we've learned about other viruses that act this way, too,

315
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:09,100
that if you delay onset of first primary infection to adult, then you have much, much more of a severe reaction.

316
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:19,600
So most of the the the deaths are in interestingly, in immunocompromised children and adults.

317
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:35,010
But these deaths were quite rare. Now the so that this is the kind of regular chicken pox era initial varicella vaccine preventing in children.

318
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:47,070
But then you also have a herpes zoster vaccine that's administered in 60 plus years of age for shingles, for post herpetic neuralgia.

319
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:56,580
To prevent these these reactivation events where you've got pain and you may have dermatitis or that physical disruption of the skin.

320
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:07,840
Also in our tour of the herpes viruses, we also have HIV six or six disease.

321
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:17,380
So this affects nine over 90% of people in childhood, follows this pattern of herpes virus as being incredibly, incredibly common in humans.

322
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,610
It causes rhodiola causes kind of like this pinkish.

323
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:30,760
And it may cause this this kind of rash pattern to kids as well usually causes a pretty mild fever.

324
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:36,639
One of the reasons that we pay a lot of attention to age 86,

325
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:43,360
even though it's just sort of like one in the list of child regular childhood illnesses, is that when someone becomes immunocompromised,

326
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:49,450
particularly if they're having a transplant like a bone marrow transplant or they're severely immunocompromised for other reasons,

327
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,230
HIV six can reactivate and can cause disseminated disease.

328
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:06,280
And so it is interesting to understand from how people get it as a kid, to understand what their risk might be as an adult later.

329
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:15,310
Because as you can see, this is a cumulative curve of who has had primary HSV six infection over time.

330
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:21,130
And you see by month 21, 70% of the kids already have it.

331
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:33,129
One of the ways to study viruses like this, when you've got a virus that is incredibly common and it is can establish

332
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:38,920
latency and it's very it can you can have it detected for a really long time.

333
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:46,360
So you don't know if detection indicates primary infection or not is to use a a case crossover design.

334
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:53,439
And so why don't you just see this? This is not something that we use as often with some of the viruses that we've talked about

335
00:40:53,440 --> 00:41:00,460
beforehand that aren't aren't as common or as kind of a characteristic acute illness.

336
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:13,389
Now, this was done the study was done in response to the fact that, you know, it used to be so common and can be very persistent and detected.

337
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:22,299
It is there was a lot of debate as to what HSV six did cause other than that classic rash presentation because,

338
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,840
you know, there's so many kids have fevers all the time.

339
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:29,349
There's so many symptoms that kids you can tell if they were just sick with

340
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:32,920
something else and they had to be six at the same time or what is actually cause.

341
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,270
So this is an example of an individual level case crossover study.

342
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:41,770
You actually saw what the investigator did.

343
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:45,280
She took actually the characteristics of the illness that happened.

344
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,980
So she was testing them weekly from birth to see when at age 56 showed up in their saliva.

345
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,689
HSV six tends to shed very actively, some for saliva.

346
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:59,259
Actually, there's papers that show that saliva sharing behaviors.

347
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:03,040
So when parents like clean up of clean up the pacifier in their own mouth,

348
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,220
put it in their kid's mouth, that's how kids end up getting into sex, things like that.

349
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:13,119
Everybody's going to get it eventually of it because of saliva. I can tell that many people have kids.

350
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:19,569
It happens all the time. So you anyway.

351
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:28,690
So you take that illness before age sex six happens the first illness or ADHD sex was detected and then take the illness after that and compare.

352
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:34,120
So these are comparing kids. Is it just among the landscape of childhood illnesses,

353
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:40,359
comparing kids to themselves and that illness where they had h h v sex, they were more likely to have a fever.

354
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,409
They're more likely to be fussy. They had a rhinovirus and all the illnesses.

355
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:50,500
It wasn't that different because kids always have runny noses, cough a similar vomiting was similar, but they had more diarrhea.

356
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:56,140
Rash Roseann was that rash, that other kind of characteristic rash presentation.

357
00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:03,310
And they were more likely to go to the doctor, which is probably reflecting the height of the fever that they were having with fever, diarrhea.

358
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:07,190
So sort of an interesting way to think about, you know,

359
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:15,430
how do you piece apart when you've got your case definitions kind of made up of things that happened very frequently, very commonly in these kids.

360
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:19,180
One way to sort of approach that and then of the methods perspective.

361
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:33,030
A rape in 1828. Kaposi's sarcoma, which we've already read this paper on the Baron before.

362
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,610
So but it's typically asymptomatic.

363
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:46,200
And it was characterized in the 1950s in subsaharan Africa and then became the very sort of obvious.

364
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:52,740
It was not really understood how common it was until immunosuppression for the HIV epidemic

365
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:59,640
made it clear how much Kaposi's sarcoma was or how much HIV aids was actually circulating.

366
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,540
Oh. All right.

367
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:09,990
Quick note about therapies.

368
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:20,070
So it's like live your valacyclovir gang cycle where there are a number of antiviral therapies that are available for herpes viruses.

369
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:25,019
We are getting into an area of this class as we get into herpes viruses,

370
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:30,509
and then after Thanksgiving we'll get into HIV and hepatitis and we're getting into

371
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:36,390
areas where there are antivirals are going to become more of a theme going forward.

372
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:47,640
But for the antiviral therapies for HCV, it's important to understand that they act on the DNA polymerase.

373
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:56,850
They can inhibit DNA replication, but because that's how they work, they're really only useful at changing the course of a reactivation.

374
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:01,070
They're not going to cure somebody of these viruses.

375
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:05,970
They don't have any impact on the latent form of the virus whatsoever.

376
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:12,600
So that latent form, where it's producing the transcripts, it's not going to clear it at all.

377
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,550
So it can reduce shedding. It can suppress reactivation.

378
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:20,960
It can make him less likely to have lesions.

379
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:24,690
It can make you less likely to transmit it to somebody else.

380
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:32,310
But it is not going to change the course of having HSV in and of itself.

381
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:42,480
And I think this probably contributes to the level of stigma that you see because there's not really a clearance available through antivirals.

382
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,200
Okay. Any questions about herpes? I'm really excited. This.

383
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:54,160
Okay. Excellent.

384
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:57,460
I'm going to the next move. How am I doing on time? I'm ready to move.

385
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:04,440
Do a little bit on norovirus and rotavirus and then turn it over to you to discuss the papers.

386
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:15,830
Is anybody planning on going on a cruise for you or if you were, are you still planning on going on a cruise?

387
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:24,050
I have many. There are many reasons that I don't trust cruises, not just norovirus.

388
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,700
All right. Rotavirus is the star of rotavirus is first.

389
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:36,349
Rotavirus is are non enveloped viruses.

390
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:45,710
They are a double stranded RNA genome. They are part of the they're part of real viruses in the air and icosahedron capsid.

391
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:51,800
They are a segmented genome and they're called respiratory enteric orphaned viruses.

392
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:56,870
Interesting enough their name for that way because they were discovered by Sabin.

393
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:00,320
I remember him from the polio virus conversation.

394
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:10,430
Several colleagues in the 1950s were taking a whole bunch of respiratory and enteric specimens and in people

395
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:19,910
that either had no symptoms or they had symptoms and they didn't have any any other virus isolated and found,

396
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:24,740
they discovered these viruses as kind of a virus hunting exercise.

397
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:25,999
Interestingly,

398
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:33,020
the first real viruses were discovered in people that had very mild symptoms and probably because they were shedding post a different illness.

399
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:38,390
But it's interesting, it stands there and we sort of think about these as enteroviruses now.

400
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:41,989
But they started out being called respiratorie enteric viruses.

401
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:48,130
So leaving leaving all the options open. Here is this.

402
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:53,540
This looks like. So it is rotavirus.

403
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:58,770
It's called rotavirus because it looks like a wheel with spokes coming out of it.

404
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:06,990
When you actually look at it. The structure of retroviruses in general have these three concentric protein layers.

405
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:12,980
Not just that initial protein shell. You've actually got different layers of the proteins going on top.

406
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:18,350
Although replication is taking place in the cytoplasm.

407
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:25,400
You actually have replication happening inside the capsid itself.

408
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:32,840
So the hole that virion capsid is in the cytoplasm, but the replication is happening inside an intact capsid.

409
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:41,480
And then, let's see, it's probably all I'm going to get into for this one.

410
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:47,120
We don't need to get into the endoplasmic reticulum today. All right.

411
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:51,590
So what does rotavirus look like from an epidemiologic perspective?

412
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:59,330
So rotavirus transmission is transmitted through fecal oral or oral oral patterns.

413
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:07,549
And it when we talk about these viruses that not just not just can be detected through the GI tract,

414
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:13,520
but can be spread through the GI tract in a way that maintains viability to infect somebody else.

415
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:20,749
It is these non envelope proteins that are not envelope to viruses that tend to

416
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:26,030
be building to do that because they have that physically hardy aspect to it.

417
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:30,860
It resists inactivation by typical chlorine treatment levels.

418
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:41,060
So you eliminating rotavirus, if you're having a big outbreak, is a bigger kind of sanitation task than if you than other viruses.

419
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:49,560
And it actually causes a pretty phenomenal level of disease and childhood deaths worldwide.

420
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:56,960
Even if it's not a major cause of death in the United States, it's typically seen in very young children.

421
00:49:57,110 --> 00:50:02,930
It's often can be asymptomatic in adults. And we do see it happens seasonally.

422
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:07,430
Incubation is rather short, 24 to 48 hours.

423
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:12,530
And rotavirus is characterized when it does happen.

424
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:17,960
It's characterized by just that incredible and sudden onset of symptoms.

425
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:23,380
It happens really fast. It could include fever.

426
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:32,510
It tends to be pretty self-limited. But it is in a short incubation period and then an incredibly sudden onset of vomiting and diarrhea.

427
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:45,290
Pre vaccine era. This is the kind of health care burden that was observed by rotavirus before we had the vaccine, the United States.

428
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:49,820
So annual direct and indirect costs. It was not causing a lot of deaths.

429
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,390
It was causing a fair number of hospitalizations because of dehydration.

430
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,790
But the annual direct and indirect costs were about a million,

431
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:07,310
$1,000,000,000 annually because of just the care that was needed to kind of treat all the dehydration and and supportive care.

432
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:23,900
In more recent eras. Now we see a real kind of concentration of the impact of the disease elsewhere in the world,

433
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:31,190
particularly, we see it around Abuja, we see it around Africa.

434
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:45,460
So there are no available vaccines or sorry, no available antivirals for rotavirus, but there are vaccines available for rotavirus.

435
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:51,430
There is both a monovalent vaccine.

436
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:57,549
That's an attenuated live vaccine. This one is monovalent.

437
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:04,360
And you know, they get away with it being monovalent because it's a live vaccine and it has attenuated replication.

438
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:12,340
It probably is creating a level of mucosal immunity when it's used that it has cross-protection between strains as part of that vaccine.

439
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:21,910
And then there's rote attack, which is a multivalent vaccine, where it's basically this bovine backbone,

440
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:28,630
and then it contains this surface protein, this VP seven protein for every serotype that's included in the vaccine.

441
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:36,459
So it's sort of this combined it's a combined virus that's sort of in reverse,

442
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:40,180
engineered to include a whole bunch of proteins from other retroviruses.

443
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:52,569
So the first generation vaccine was available in 1998, and it was, however,

444
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:58,570
quickly found in post-marketing surveillance to lead to increased risk of intussusception,

445
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:04,720
which is like a physical symptom that happens in the GI tract.

446
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:10,000
And so it was a is a rare event, one per 10,000 vaccines, but it was withdrawn.

447
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,450
Russia was withdrawn at that point. And so then that led to these second generation vaccines that we have now.

448
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:26,940
And you can see what happened once once rotavirus vaccine started being introduced.

449
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:32,700
So you see 27 right here. You really see this blunting of this these seasonal curves over time.

450
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:39,330
It wasn't a complete eradication, but you do see that that one thing goes down from that height of the peaks that it had prior to.

451
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:55,830
Interestingly, in Ontario, they introduced they had a publicly funded vaccine campaign for children who were 2 to 4 months of age.

452
00:53:55,830 --> 00:54:05,610
So they paid for the vaccines 2 to 4 months of age. And they saw that when the 2 to 4 month olds, when their curves under 12 months of age came down,

453
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:11,249
the 12 to 23 month olds, their curves came down, too, because their siblings were no longer getting rotavirus.

454
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:16,200
So it was like it was interrupting the transmission system. So this is we'll talk about this more, which I bet you shouldn't be,

455
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:24,599
but there are several places in virus epidemiology where you can see herd immunity happening very, very quickly, very dramatically.

456
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:37,710
And this is one of those examples. And this is just showing kind of the overall reduction that was happening after made this program across all years.

457
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:44,610
I mean, we even see reductions happening in adults and elderly adults because they were stopping the infection from happening and the youngest kids.

458
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:51,959
I'm going to skip the seizures to give us some time to go to Nora.

459
00:54:51,960 --> 00:55:00,210
So rotavirus has been linked and some viruses have been linked to febrile seizures in infants and anti if seizures mean that so well.

460
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:04,080
So when the vaccinations started, we started to see seizures go down also.

461
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:06,840
All right.

462
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:17,910
Norovirus, also an intra virus that this is a health severity virus that a real virus, but again, does not have an envelope icosahedron virus.

463
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,740
Single stranded RNA instead of a double stranded RNA.

464
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:34,590
And it has these two differentiated genotype groups with some kind of variations of these emerging in recent decades.

465
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:44,080
Norwalk the Norwalk strain comes from so we don't try not to name strains after locations anymore.

466
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:51,300
Norwalk is named after Ohio. So that's fun fact if you are.

467
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:55,010
Oh, we're going right on Ohio State Michigan game.

468
00:55:55,020 --> 00:56:02,040
Okay. We're going to go for. Okay. So it is it is named after in Ohio at this time.

469
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:08,699
That's right. Before Thanksgiving. I just made the connection. We had to do this before the Ohio State gives you a very so here is what norovirus

470
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:12,300
looks like in a stool specimen from a patient with acute gastroenteritis.

471
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:17,459
And again, I just love these pictures that have all this virus like clustered in there.

472
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:21,240
So look at all those variants. You see how incredibly infectious it can be.

473
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:31,650
If you have contact with with stool in somebody who is infected, I'm going to skip through the replication pathway.

474
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:39,060
It is basically binds, enters and you've got cytoplasmic replication happening.

475
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:46,139
Norwalk virus. Okay. Here's a picture actually. I was at a I was on a trip going to an influenza meeting.

476
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:52,620
That's the back of Arnold Badger's head right there. I think they're like, okay, oh, they needed a fixer.

477
00:56:54,390 --> 00:57:00,420
So it was first discovered in northern Ohio in 1968 in an outbreak cluster in the school.

478
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:04,260
At the time, there was no culture option.

479
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:10,320
It was clear from the epidemiologic data that there was an outbreak that was happening, but there was no way to actually isolate the virus.

480
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:17,370
So what they did is they found they took samples from the people in the outbreak and they did a

481
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:24,599
human challenge and passage study using this sample of the enteric samples from the outbreak.

482
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:31,680
So they inoculated volunteers to see if they got sick with the same things that the people from the original breakouts again.

483
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:36,240
And remember, this is fecal oral transmission. So do the math individually.

484
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:42,550
All right. It's incredibly acid stable. It requires similarity.

485
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:48,270
Rotavirus requires more chlorine than you need. We never really needed to it to inactivate it, in fact, in various systems.

486
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:57,180
And also, this is the thing to remember, norovirus, it does not respond well to alcohol based hand sanitizers.

487
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:06,220
So if you are working in a setting, in an infection control role and it is alcohol based, hand is very intense.

488
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:13,620
Although I suppose if you are having spread of interrogatories, you got to switch to soap and water or add soap and water to the alcohol based.

489
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:22,430
Strategies. So point source outbreaks are very, very common.

490
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:28,550
They look like a very classic point source outbreak of that really kind of sharp, clean epi curve.

491
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:36,379
And fecal oral transmission is typically actually through the aerosolization of

492
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:42,410
the the virus is probably the most likely route of transmission that happens.

493
00:58:43,370 --> 00:58:51,590
And you can have transmission on surfaces because it's so hard to kill from surfaces characteristic of this virus.

494
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:58,430
Under 100 viral particles are need for transmission. So you need very little to be able to establish an infection of a new person.

495
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:05,770
It is one of the most common causes of foodborne illnesses.

496
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:11,820
So 48% of foodborne outbreaks are suspected to be from raw virus.

497
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:20,560
And this is so interesting here is they sort of took the burden of norovirus in the U.S. and backed out this estimate of lifetime risk of norovirus.

498
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:25,050
And when you get down to this illness thing down here, it's more than 100%.

499
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:30,100
It's estimated that most people have norovirus about five times on average in their life.

500
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,760
And about 50% of people will go to the doctor for norovirus is simply.

501
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:40,600
So here is what the infection timing looks like.

502
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:46,600
There is very little long lasting immunity. Adults have a consistently high level of susceptibility.

503
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:52,209
There are vaccines in development. The vaccines are tricky because with that kind of reinfection pattern,

504
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:56,770
the vaccine is going to have to basically do better than actual infection to protect people for very long.

505
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:02,170
All right. So with that, I'm going to actually,

506
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:13,749
I'm going to just for the interest of time and wondering if I'm not going to do I'm going to break up the workgroups so that we don't

507
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:22,990
have to reassess or just kind of break into groups based on where you're sitting into groups of three or four or two or whatever works.

508
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:28,900
And the same has to be open the reporting.
