1
00:00:01,046 --> 00:00:04,839
This video will be on sensitivity analysis.

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,591
When we're doing sensitivity analysis, we're evaluating uncertainty and

3
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:10,139
reporting it and assessing it.

4
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,137
So why are we even doing this?

5
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:16,020
Oftentimes maybe when you get your basic case results, you might find out,

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,824
for example, if the intervention is cost effective.

7
00:00:18,824 --> 00:00:21,938
So what why do we need to do anything else?

8
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,517
Well, in this example here,

9
00:00:23,517 --> 00:00:28,391
maybe if our cost effectiveness ratio is $40,000 per qaly, it's cost effective.

10
00:00:28,391 --> 00:00:31,677
But maybe if some of our assumptions were slightly different,

11
00:00:31,677 --> 00:00:34,779
maybe the intervention would no longer be cost effective.

12
00:00:34,779 --> 00:00:38,883
And so we might want to be interested in that understand what is making our

13
00:00:38,883 --> 00:00:41,049
intervention cost effective or not?

14
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:44,021
And what might potentially change that.

15
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:46,127
There are a couple different types of uncertainty and

16
00:00:46,127 --> 00:00:47,403
cost effectiveness analysis.

17
00:00:47,403 --> 00:00:50,154
There's uncertainty about parameters.

18
00:00:50,154 --> 00:00:53,016
This is the most commonly discussed source of uncertainty and

19
00:00:53,016 --> 00:00:54,508
will focus this on the lecture.

20
00:00:54,508 --> 00:00:58,089
That's things like the parameters like the cost of something,

21
00:00:58,089 --> 00:01:01,735
the probability of something, the relative risk of something,

22
00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:04,673
the utility associated with the health condition.

23
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:06,302
Those are all parameters.

24
00:01:06,302 --> 00:01:10,362
There might also be additional uncertainty about the overall model,

25
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:13,801
about how the model is structured and how it's analyzed and

26
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:16,435
it's much more difficult to quantify this.

27
00:01:16,435 --> 00:01:17,490
Just in this example,

28
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,715
from the Wilkinson Article you may have read earlier this semester.

29
00:01:20,715 --> 00:01:25,488
We can think about this was an example of an intervention to prevent

30
00:01:25,488 --> 00:01:28,396
HIV transmission from other children.

31
00:01:28,396 --> 00:01:33,412
And so they built a simple model here where we start with without 1,000 HIV

32
00:01:33,412 --> 00:01:38,286
infected mothers and then some of them may or may not receive prenatal care.

33
00:01:38,286 --> 00:01:42,631
If they don't receive prenatal care, they might be born with HIV,

34
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:45,080
20% vertical transmission rate.

35
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,038
And if they do receive prenatal care, they may receive medications or

36
00:01:49,038 --> 00:01:50,589
not receive medications.

37
00:01:50,589 --> 00:01:54,703
And if they don't receive medications, they still have that 20% vertical

38
00:01:54,703 --> 00:01:59,211
transmission rate, but the medication reduces the vertical transmission in half.

39
00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:01,754
So if they do receive the medication management,

40
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,817
they have a lower chance of getting HIV.

41
00:02:03,817 --> 00:02:06,495
And so this model was designed to figure out how

42
00:02:06,495 --> 00:02:11,178
effective would this prenatal care intervention be at reducing HIV infection.

43
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:13,457
There are a lot of types of uncertainty present here.

44
00:02:13,457 --> 00:02:16,898
For example, what fraction of women receive prenatal care?

45
00:02:16,898 --> 00:02:20,149
Really, that's maybe more of the decision.

46
00:02:20,149 --> 00:02:24,088
But also what's the vertical transmission rate with and without the medication?

47
00:02:24,088 --> 00:02:30,976
If women receive prenatal care, what's the chance that they will receive medication?

48
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:35,350
These are all just a few examples of some of the things you might be

49
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,647
uncertain about.

50
00:02:36,647 --> 00:02:38,343
So, this parameter uncertainty.

51
00:02:38,343 --> 00:02:42,897
When we assess this, our goal is to measure how much uncertainty is associated

52
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:46,968
with all these parameter assumptions we have and synthesize them into

53
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:50,835
some measure of uncertainty about the cost effectiveness ratio.

54
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:53,260
Depends on the type of study we're doing.

55
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,744
If you actually are doing a study based off of trial data,

56
00:02:56,744 --> 00:03:00,967
you can just use the uncertainty associated with the trial results.

57
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:05,991
But often times we're doing these cost effectiveness analyses using mathematical

58
00:03:05,991 --> 00:03:10,586
models and so what we'll do, what we'll see next, then the approaches next

59
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:15,269
will be more appropriate for studying uncertainty and mathematical models.

60
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:17,386
So we'll do sensitivity analysis today,

61
00:03:17,386 --> 00:03:20,282
while several different types of sensitivity analysis.

62
00:03:20,282 --> 00:03:24,863
One way sensitivity analysis is multi-way sensitivity analysis two way one way,

63
00:03:24,863 --> 00:03:26,047
two way, multi way.

64
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:31,075
Also, Monte Carlo simulation is another type of sensitivity analysis.

65
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:34,842
So, sensitivity analysis, our advantage here is simplicity.

66
00:03:34,842 --> 00:03:38,049
We're just varying things, seeing what the results are.

67
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:41,642
It does leave some discretion to the analyst to choose what range is

68
00:03:41,642 --> 00:03:42,291
to look at.

69
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,243
So that can be an advantage or disadvantage.

70
00:03:45,243 --> 00:03:49,215
The most common types are one way and two way sensitivity analysis and

71
00:03:49,215 --> 00:03:52,933
people also can do a threshold analysis which will review here.

72
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:56,401
So here's a very simple example of a one way sensitivity analysis.

73
00:03:56,401 --> 00:04:02,040
The red row represents our base case assumptions of $300 in costs and

74
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,209
0.05 quality gain and that is the health effect.

75
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,285
So that gives us cost effectiveness ratio of $6,000 per qaly.

76
00:04:10,285 --> 00:04:14,419
But we can see what does this look like if our cost changes?

77
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:18,781
So in the top row, our incremental cost is only $100.

78
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:22,075
So that gives us a cost effectiveness ratio of $2,000 per qaly.

79
00:04:22,075 --> 00:04:24,749
And if our incremental costs instead is $500,

80
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:28,306
then our cost effectiveness ratio is $10,000 per quality.

81
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:29,947
It's a very simple example but

82
00:04:29,947 --> 00:04:34,437
showing how the cost effectiveness ratio changes if one of our assumption changes.

83
00:04:34,437 --> 00:04:37,249
Now two way sensitivity analysis looks something like that.

84
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:41,644
So we have on this example to a sensitivity analysis,

85
00:04:41,644 --> 00:04:44,175
varying the costs and the health effects.

86
00:04:44,175 --> 00:04:48,876
We have different rows representing different qaly adjusted life year

87
00:04:48,876 --> 00:04:51,474
increases from 0.01 to 0.10.

88
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:56,873
And then on the columns we have costs one from 100 to 500.

89
00:04:56,873 --> 00:05:02,086
You can see our base case was the red here, $300 cost, 0 .05 qaly increase.

90
00:05:02,086 --> 00:05:06,385
And we can see how the cost effectiveness ratio changes as these two

91
00:05:06,385 --> 00:05:07,782
parameters change.

92
00:05:07,782 --> 00:05:12,428
So here we can see maybe the worst case scenario here with a small quality

93
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:14,142
increase in a large cost.

94
00:05:14,142 --> 00:05:17,822
We have $50,000 per qaly.

95
00:05:17,822 --> 00:05:22,777
A threshold analysis is something that we can do to figure out at

96
00:05:22,777 --> 00:05:27,929
what point might this intervention no longer be cost effective.

97
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:31,970
And then the other type of sensitivity analysis is Monte Carlo simulation.

98
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:37,154
This is simultaneously varying all parameters at the same

99
00:05:37,154 --> 00:05:43,196
time to get a sense of overall uncertainty for the entire analysis.

100
00:05:43,196 --> 00:05:48,988
And for this we assume distributions for each parameter that are uncertain and

101
00:05:48,988 --> 00:05:53,113
do some random simulation and repeat this many times and

102
00:05:53,113 --> 00:05:58,485
get a sense of get a cloud of cost effectiveness analyses and estimates.

103
00:05:58,485 --> 00:06:01,182
So for example in a static analysis,

104
00:06:01,182 --> 00:06:06,754
we plug in our numbers some inputs about dollars, risks, quality of life.

105
00:06:06,754 --> 00:06:11,230
And we get an output something like $35,000 per quality adjusted life here.

106
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,867
Monte Carlo simulation.

107
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:18,277
Every single input is a distribution and we can output that is a distribution.

108
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:23,215
That's well a distribution of what those costs and qualities would be.

109
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:26,356
Where do we get those distribution parameters for our inputs?

110
00:06:26,356 --> 00:06:29,693
Well, it could be from previous studies or databases,

111
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:33,812
looking at what their confidence intervals are on the input values.

112
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:37,482
We can talk to experts to get their opinion about what potential distributions

113
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:38,435
arranges might be.

114
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:41,520
And finally the analysts on assumptions.

115
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,515
So for example, here's what some results might look like.

116
00:06:44,515 --> 00:06:48,480
With maybe just a simple example with 100 simulations.

117
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:54,291
This is that that same example with a mean of about 0.05 qalys gained and

118
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,331
$300 cost increase.

119
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:58,954
And we can see here we've got a bunch of dots.

120
00:06:58,954 --> 00:07:01,662
Some are actually cost saving.

121
00:07:01,662 --> 00:07:04,389
We have one or two that are cost saving.

122
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:06,782
Most all of these are adding costs.

123
00:07:06,782 --> 00:07:11,386
And what we can do is we can create a 95% confidence interval.

124
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:15,373
If we swing these little bars around,

125
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:21,860
we can see this line represents let's say $500 per qaly.

126
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,641
And in this case 2.5% of the points are below that line.

127
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:31,328
And we can swing another line down here until we have 2.5% of our points on

128
00:07:31,328 --> 00:07:33,316
the left hand side of this line.

129
00:07:33,316 --> 00:07:37,638
So what remains between these two white lines is

130
00:07:37,638 --> 00:07:41,644
our basically 95% of our distribution.

131
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:46,386
So here we might say our confidence interval is in the cost of effectiveness

132
00:07:46,386 --> 00:07:49,925
ratios is somewhere between 500 dollars per qaly and

133
00:07:49,925 --> 00:07:54,894
35,000 dollars per qaly because 2.5% lie on this side of the line and

134
00:07:54,894 --> 00:07:58,682
2.5% line this side of that cost effectiveness ratio.

135
00:07:58,682 --> 00:08:03,286
Now, oftentimes what we do with this Monte Carlo simulations create something called

136
00:08:03,286 --> 00:08:05,695
a cost effectiveness acceptability curve.

137
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:09,079
This cost effective acceptability curve shows the probability that

138
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:12,239
a cost effectiveness ratio would fall below at any given value.

139
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:15,426
And it displays even more information than a simple confidence in role.

140
00:08:15,426 --> 00:08:18,268
So, let's look at a simple example here.

141
00:08:18,268 --> 00:08:22,521
That's this is the same data set here with that cloud of outcomes based on

142
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:24,275
the Monte Carlo simulation.

143
00:08:24,275 --> 00:08:28,935
And as we swing our line around, we have different ratios.

144
00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:32,339
So here we'd say I'm not willing to pay anything for qalys.

145
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:37,192
So I, and as the swings around now, all of a sudden I would be able to

146
00:08:37,192 --> 00:08:41,734
pay an infinite amount of money for qaly adjusted life years.

147
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:46,356
And what we can see here is, for example, this is about 10%,

148
00:08:46,356 --> 00:08:48,935
was about 2000 hours per qaly.

149
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:52,652
At about we were pretty sure that there's a 10% chance our cost

150
00:08:52,652 --> 00:08:55,774
effective ratio was less than $2,000 per qaly.

151
00:08:55,774 --> 00:08:59,870
We're about 50% sure our cost effective ratio is below 60 or

152
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,965
sorry, $6,000 per qaly.

153
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:03,518
What about 90% sure?

154
00:09:03,518 --> 00:09:07,381
Our cost effectiveness ratio is below $15,000 per qaly.

155
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,557
And what we can do is as we swing that line around,

156
00:09:10,557 --> 00:09:12,652
we can create a curve like this.

157
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:18,415
What this curve tells us is for any willingness to pay per qaly.

158
00:09:18,415 --> 00:09:23,690
What's the the probability that our cost effectiveness ratio is below that?

159
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:29,874
So, for example, here we might say, if we're willing to pay $10,000 per qaly,

160
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:34,822
go up here on the line and maybe there's 70 or 80% chance that are we

161
00:09:34,822 --> 00:09:39,788
think our cost effectiveness ratio is below $10,000 per qaly.

162
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:43,816
So this this curve here tells us basically the probability that

163
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:48,685
the intervention is cost effective at any given cost effectiveness ratio.

164
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:52,005
So instead of being just two data points, the 2.5% and

165
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:56,683
97.5% just giving those too little data points here, it's giving us entire

166
00:09:56,683 --> 00:10:00,777
distribution of what we think that cost effectiveness ratio might be.

167
00:10:00,777 --> 00:10:04,850
So this is that cost of these are called cost effectiveness acceptability curves.

168
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,259
Again, for any willingness to pay,

169
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:11,933
they tell us the probability that our intervention is cost effective.

170
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:17,202
So in this example, maybe 2% chance is cost saving, 10% chance is less than

171
00:10:17,202 --> 00:10:22,626
$2,000 per qaly, 50% chance that were less than $6,000 per qaly,

172
00:10:22,626 --> 00:10:26,587
90% chance that were less than $15,000 per qaly.

173
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:31,303
So Monte Carlo simulations are used to create that cost effective

174
00:10:31,303 --> 00:10:33,024
acceptability curve.

175
00:10:33,024 --> 00:10:37,776
So all those these previous things are looking at how we can vary

176
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:42,621
our parameter assumptions to see how our parameter assumptions

177
00:10:42,621 --> 00:10:45,864
affect our overall sense of uncertainty.

178
00:10:45,864 --> 00:10:51,421
But the next thing is that you should be aware of is model uncertainty.

179
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:55,130
So let's say I'm doing an analysis of HIV interventions.

180
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,048
I could potentially build three different types of models.

181
00:10:58,048 --> 00:11:01,456
Could build model one where we just look at people as being infected or

182
00:11:01,456 --> 00:11:02,236
not infected.

183
00:11:02,236 --> 00:11:07,933
I could build model two where people could be infected and have two different

184
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:13,376
categories of CD4 counts, CD4 counts above 200 and below 200.

185
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:17,885
Or I could build a model three where I have people is either not infected and

186
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,882
have four different categories of CD4 counts.

187
00:11:20,882 --> 00:11:23,680
Now that choice of model, whether I use model one, two,

188
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,842
three is something up to the analyst who's doing the cost effectiveness analysis.

189
00:11:27,842 --> 00:11:32,213
And if you structure your analysis in different ways, it could potentially

190
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:35,982
give you different results for your cost effectiveness ratios.

191
00:11:35,982 --> 00:11:41,584
So again remember HIV there are different ways we could characterize your

192
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:47,562
HIV progression and the choice of model can potentially affect your results.

193
00:11:47,562 --> 00:11:52,340
Unfortunately, there is no easy method for assessing model uncertainty,

194
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,935
how the choice of the model affects the overall results.

195
00:11:55,935 --> 00:12:00,301
The only solution to this is to actually build each individual model and

196
00:12:00,301 --> 00:12:02,494
compare and contrast the results.

197
00:12:02,494 --> 00:12:04,887
That's difficult to do and it's rarely done.

198
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:09,870
So as you're reading a cost effectiveness analysis, I think you should be aware and

199
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,658
look at how people have built their models and just be aware if you

200
00:12:13,658 --> 00:12:18,293
think it reasonably if is reasonably an accurate representation of reality,

201
00:12:18,293 --> 00:12:20,353
then great don't worry about it.

202
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:25,051
But if you think that it really is missing some key important attributes of

203
00:12:25,051 --> 00:12:27,931
that disease or how the intervention works,

204
00:12:27,931 --> 00:12:31,063
then you wanna be a little more skeptical of the.

205
00:12:31,063 --> 00:12:32,946
And that's it for sensitivity analysis.
