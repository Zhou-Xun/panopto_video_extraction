1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,580
What has driven this movement for environmental justice?

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,540
Simply stated, it's all about health. People came to that

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,700
first, people of color environmental summit determined to find the answers,

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:24,960
the remedies, the support, and commitment to change what communities at the ground level were experiencing.

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:35,070
It was at that 1991 meeting where I was able to sit with folks from all over the country, people from California,

6
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:44,940
folks from Texas, folks from Chicago, where housing, public housing was built on toxic waste by the housing

7
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:54,900
urban and development departments at the federal government, folks who lived near the Mexican border who were experiencing

8
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:03,960
very unusual cancers and health impacts, and believe that their children,

9
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,810
their families were sick because a water quality issues.

10
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:16,930
I met people from Savannah, Georgia, who could no longer

11
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:26,930
baptized in the Savannah River, because of how polluted the Savannah River had become due to petrochemical manufacturing.

12
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:38,450
People from Hawaii and Alaska showed up to this meeting just determined to stop the nonsense around

13
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:43,460
the burden that they were experiencing in their own communities. It was all about health.

14
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:52,600
I will also mention that most of the folks who showed up were women, women who primarily were the caretakers,

15
00:01:52,600 --> 00:02:05,300
and just saw firsthand these issues in their own families and households, and not very different from Lois Gibbs out of Love Canal. People,

16
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,770
women were just concerned and wanted to make a change.

17
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:19,310
So we all convened in Washington, D.C. and we convened around, you know, what to do to improve quality of life and health in our communities.

18
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,650
So why don't we talk a little bit about the definition of health.

19
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:30,380
Most of you have chosen public health as a focus, particularly with FPHLP.

20
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:40,340
So health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.

21
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,330
This really just kind of brings in to view, and you all know this

22
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:58,250
because this is your area, that stress factors where you live impact the quality of your life.

23
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:07,070
It impacts your mental health is social well-being. It impacts everything about a human being,

24
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:16,160
and achieving health is critical in ensuring that everyone gets to live out their life once they get this earthly realm

25
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,420
in a way that they can fulfill whatever purpose

26
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:27,080
they have to make it a good place to live while they're here.

27
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:36,890
And when you have the disproportionate issues that I described earlier in communities, oftentimes that's interrupted,

28
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:42,740
that's  interfered with. So

29
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:53,300
the idea of addressing health and the environment or environmental justice during that 1991 event,

30
00:03:53,300 --> 00:04:03,890
we begin to define what the environment meant for people on the ground of people disproportionately impacted by environmental problems.

31
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:11,810
And this definition, this defining of the environment, was starkly different from mainstream environmentalism

32
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:22,040
if you will, the number one difference is that it brought people into the environment as a priority.

33
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:31,000
So the environment for the environmental justice community is where we live, where we work, where we play.

34
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:40,950
I like to add where we pray, where we learn, it is the physical and natural world, it's just not about

35
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:55,200
air, land and water in the way that perhaps a lot of the environmental mainstream organizations define it or the protection of nature,

36
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,300
which are all key and important,

37
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:08,250
but if we don't think about human beings in the priority to ensure that they also are protected, then we're missing something

38
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:19,210
as a human race. So I'll talk a little bit later about the principles of environmental justice,

39
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:27,310
but this is what is key. You might see on the left hand side of those people laying down on the road,

40
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:36,700
that was Warren County, North Carolina. That was the day they decided to stop trucks rolling in with more PCBs

41
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:44,920
Environmental justice embraces the principle that all people and communities are entitled to equal protection of our environmental health,

42
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:50,210
employment, education, housing, transportation and civil rights laws.

43
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:55,660
You might be thinking, what's this got to do, what does this have to do at all with the environment,

44
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:03,250
that's not the environment? It is if you consider where people live, if you consider how people get around,

45
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:09,790
if you if you consider employment, educational and housing opportunities, it's all of that,

46
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:19,150
and that's what makes the environmental justice sometimes hard to embrace, because when you're seeking something as broad as that,

47
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:30,540
you get to touch every area that has been a negative barrier for people to thrive in your lives and in their communities.

48
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:38,700
So one of the things, just going back to

49
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:45,150
what were some of the key things as we begin to think about environmental justice,

50
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:53,280
it really became clear that although Dr. Martin Luther King may not have the title,

51
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,520
what he was doing when he supported the garbage workers in 1968 as environmental justice,

52
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:11,550
that's what he was doing, quite honestly, demanding essential workers that they were treated with respect, that civil rights,

53
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:19,890
they were entitled to those, that they were entitled to wages that they could support themselves and their families.

54
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:30,710
That's environmental justice as well. So it's a movement that's been taking place for a long time.

55
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:41,540
And just a little example of some of the key issues that took place that led up to the movement.

56
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,920
So this is a good place to stop.
