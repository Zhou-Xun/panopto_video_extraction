1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,350
45 minutes in. Is that right? Yeah.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,170
An hour. Okay. And it goes from 1130, right?

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:19,590
I didn't feel like 11 or 1150 there, but I was there.

4
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,660
There's certain moments that might be there or.

5
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:58,450
Think she just like, you know, she's earned a doctorate in this dissertation, and so she had to hustle like a producer.

6
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:17,590
It's okay. Hopefully this person is with you. She's interested.

7
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,820
You guys are most of people here already or what's going on?

8
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:36,830
People. There's still a few people who have been around for about.

9
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,120
Okay. While we're waiting for some other folks to trickle in.

10
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,190
So I'll introduce myself. But then if you guys would be willing to, can you introduce yourselves?

11
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,400
What department you're in, what your program is? Give me, like, a little rundown of who's in the room.

12
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,840
So I'm Grace Hopper. I'm a research assistant professor at the Institute for Social Research, where PHILIPPa is.

13
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:15,970
I think you guys know, she asked me to get a lecture today because it's Yom Kippur, but she's really excited about your guys class.

14
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:22,030
She tells me great things about I'm pumped to be here. So if you could just give me your name, we'll start over here.

15
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:30,010
Department. You know the good stuff. My name is Chatham and I'm a second year MBA student in general epidemiology.

16
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,610
Okay, tell me, because every department has changed since I trained here.

17
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:42,670
So you can get a master's in general at the hospital levy and also environmental at the global.

18
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,299
Global, yes. So your your actual MPH is in one of those substantive areas.

19
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:55,030
So yeah, it's like we are in the job and I mean, I think that's the majority part of the department.

20
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:06,130
But you can like specialize now. Yeah, but it's like if you chose to be a general contractor, you cannot change your track after you got to here.

21
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,370
So is this a good change or. I don't know.

22
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,740
But you can do. I think you could do.

23
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:19,930
I didn't do my a feature I did at Columbia, but I remember my students back in the day saying you could choose like two tracks at the hospital levy.

24
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,650
I think that. But anyways, that's interesting. Okay. Thank you.

25
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,590
Nice to meet you. Nice to go ahead. I'm Victoria.

26
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:37,570
I'm a second year general and I write thesis on presidential race, racial segregation and epigenetic age exoneration.

27
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,050
Very cool. Who do you work with? Kelly Borkowski. Oh, not you again.

28
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:48,190
So, yeah, right now, people that I know. Yeah, well, I'm a second year MPH general of history.

29
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:59,250
Okay. What was your work in going to something to do with the ACA and how it affected health care access to like.

30
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:07,899
Seeing? I don't know. We're just I'm just getting into, like, that whole AC stuff.

31
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:14,170
I remember. And I used to lecture on that in an undergrad class here, and it was just passed in, like just getting on board.

32
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,520
So now it's interesting to see the aftermath of that, but that's super cool.

33
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:29,560
Okay. I'm helping and I study in the College of Pharmacy and master student in pharmacy or in speech at pharmacy.

34
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:41,710
Cool. Yeah. What brought you here? Because I was writing about clinical pharmacy and we are going to do research about dementia and.

35
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,770
Yeah, nice. That's really interesting. And let's hear you. Affirmative action.

36
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,700
Okay, cool. I'm a I'm a medical student,

37
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:57,459
so I finished three years already going into emergency medicine during a one year MPH in general and then going back to work here.

38
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,840
And then I'll go to everything you're doing. Residency in emergency medicine.

39
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,840
Yeah, that's really cool. I'm.

40
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,170
I'm a stay here in three words.

41
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:17,010
This is going to be in the nutrition space. And so I'm actually working my role at the actual endocrinologist.

42
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:26,920
And so. That's. No. How that impacts our capacity and future as something that's really hot.

43
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,680
Nutrition is a this is a good spot to be for nutrition right now.

44
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,160
I think right now especially, it's like a very yeah, yeah.

45
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,870
Now I feel like it's kind of kind of got up and coming in the last few years.

46
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:51,310
Yeah, that's really cool. Also enjoyed your presentation as we got. Your third your P so you already did your exams.

47
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,260
Yes. Congratulations.

48
00:07:54,340 --> 00:08:01,419
I have a little bit of PTSD when I went downstairs because the last time I was there was when I did my qualifying exams in that computer lab.

49
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:08,620
And I don't know how they do it now, but they didn't let you out of it. And I was like, Oh, I have been down here before and it was traumatic.

50
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:15,130
But in my case, what's your research on working in depression and suicide among the population?

51
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,269
That's. Who do you work with, Brianna? Oh, nice.

52
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,790
Since he said. Yeah, he notices that. And that's really cool. Yeah.

53
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,960
Um, my name's Marsha. I'm a fourth year Ph.D. student.

54
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,400
Wow. Okay, I my research is looking at how this theory.

55
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,270
That's been part of their information. And I work with them, I think.

56
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,160
I guess she told me about your mother. Yes. That's super cool.

57
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:45,370
Yeah. I hope to see her on stage sometime. She trained me too.

58
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,400
So you're in good hands? Yeah. That's really cool.

59
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,190
Yeah. You know, now we are very second year student general.

60
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,790
AP General. Hey, what do you. What are you interested in?

61
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:03,320
What's your reasoning? I have no idea that it was just accurate for being an MPH suit.

62
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:13,730
I didn't have a clue. I was like tired and I was just like I was promotion three revolutions and I was like, Oh, that's me over there.

63
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:18,880
But if I go to interview, I do that. Probably not so.

64
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:30,219
Okay. Okay, that's cool. I'm sure he said he was doing it because he was like, Oh, this is a close friend and collaborator of my very cool.

65
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:38,920
We have an one together right now that we're just getting off the ground and focusing on some stuff in terms some cognitive aging.

66
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:46,209
I think she might have mentioned you to me to connect with my new postdoc while we both have sex.

67
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,390
You are? Yeah. I'm trying to remember all the people she's talking about.

68
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,840
She's got a great lab group. It sounds great. That's really cool.

69
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:57,399
Hi, my name is Alisha. And also to hear Coach Justin.

70
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,479
And what was that? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

71
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,660
So all the small circle is a very small circle.

72
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:12,680
Yes. Yeah. Um, my, so my research is doing kind of like, um, genomics and AP genomics and various outcomes.

73
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:21,340
So not really like one specific outcomes, but that yeah. Depending on what they don't get enzyme right now and that is methylation risk scores.

74
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,450
Yeah. Yes, that seems really alexion's.

75
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,260
And then just see how alcohol drinking can play a role in that.

76
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,980
So that's my in one of your dissertation. That's really cool.

77
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:38,990
I was going to ask you. Oh, I was just talking again about this stuff.

78
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:44,570
Oh, what dataset do you use? Um, so if anyone is interested.

79
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,930
Okay.

80
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:55,670
So I think for two and three, maybe last month, maybe also visual aids, but on other things, yeah, I've never worked with Lassie, but I wanted to.

81
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,540
It sounds super interesting. So complex. Yeah. More complex in nature.

82
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,330
US. Yes. Oh, man. Okay, that is a little disturbing.

83
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,800
That includes the Indian culture. That's why it's so hard. Yeah.

84
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:10,480
Yeah. Oh, man. Okay, well, I look forward to hearing more about your worldview.

85
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,070
So. So today we're in talk about immune aging and the intersection with the social environment.

86
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:21,200
This is the work that I do primarily, although my work touches on a lot of different domains, which I'll get into.

87
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,309
Um, actually I'll get into that right now because I want to start with a little bit different.

88
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,810
So this is what we're gonna basically talk about with a few caveats here.

89
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:34,490
What I want this to be is very useful to you guys and thinking about your own work and how this applies,

90
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:40,190
meaning you guys are thinking about biomarkers of aging or biomarkers in some capacity.

91
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,819
And and if you're not thinking about it, a lot of people in EPI are thinking about it.

92
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,979
And there's a little bit of the wild, wild west right now with people doing biomarker research and what does it mean

93
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,490
and what does it not mean and how do we understand aging in this framework?

94
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,450
So I hone in on the immune system, which is what I'm going to focus on today.

95
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:04,150
But I don't this doesn't need to be formal. I want you guys to be able to ask me questions and stop me and interrupt me if something's not clear.

96
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,540
You want to know more about something? I, I may not always know the answer.

97
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:16,520
I tell my students in my lab this all the time, but I am happy to dialog also if you have questions about career stuff or PhDs or impeaches.

98
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,439
I've been in this world for quite a while now and have been at lots of different institutions.

99
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:29,179
So happy to take questions like that too. Um, anyways, so give you a bit of background in my my training.

100
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,110
So I train, I do my PhD MPH at Columbia in general.

101
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,340
B And then I did my Ph.D. here because I wanted to do social epidemiology,

102
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:43,159
but I wanted to do social epidemiology of infectious disease, which was really not a thing when I was doing my training.

103
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,930
So I kind of there is one other person here that was doing that work, Allison Aiello, and then she moved.

104
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:53,780
And anyway, she's ended up being a very close collaborator of mine for almost ten years,

105
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,590
but so I trained in infectious disease and social, social epi.

106
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:05,419
And then this got me thinking as I think you'll get a clue in what I talk about today of like the ways that infections aid your immune system.

107
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,829
And then what does immune aging mean for for health and wellness throughout the life course

108
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:15,020
for age related decline and disease and particularly destructive disparities in that.

109
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,920
So for me, the real goal here is where the intersection of these three domains me and I think that's really where there's

110
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:26,360
opportunity to not only document disparities because I don't think we need to document disparities anymore.

111
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:34,249
I think we need to start thinking about how to disrupt those. And so that for me happens in this intersection of really understanding how infectious

112
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,610
disease relates to the social environment and then how that is aging your body.

113
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:42,680
So that's a little bit of background in my work, what I want to start today.

114
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:48,320
So I need a couple of people who are willing to scribe for me and we'll use that back whiteboard.

115
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,220
So I want to make this a little bit more interactive just because that's more fun for me.

116
00:13:52,220 --> 00:14:02,450
And I want to get you know, I want this to be a dialog between us. So anybody in ready volunteer to write on life work for me is not that scary.

117
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:07,180
Come on, hurry. One more person. Great.

118
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:11,390
Awesome. So all the cracked up that I need to know.

119
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,780
Guys, get up. Anything I have to answer for this question.

120
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:21,589
Well, I'm going to have everybody answer. So one of the things I wanted to and I was reading your comments that you guys made on the paper,

121
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:27,169
that flip assignments were brilliant comments, by the way, but there's a lot of stuff happening in this domain.

122
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:32,690
And so I want to know, so first of all, let's let's look at this first question and I'll like on the left, what's your name again?

123
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,609
Okay. Cliche. Yeah. Can you can you write down so what do we know about immune biomarkers?

124
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,360
And there's not a wrong answer here. I just want to know what you know. What have you heard about them?

125
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,730
You develop antibodies after infection.

126
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,950
Racing up antibodies after infection. That seems to be a hot topic right now.

127
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,360
Also important to differentiate which types of antibodies.

128
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:09,760
So like eggs are like typically represent like historical exposure, whereas our genes are like acutely present reacting to an infection.

129
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:14,020
Yep, I did your stadium. This is a big topic in our lives right now.

130
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:27,240
Yeah. What else? Have you ever heard I mean, biomarkers like what's the context that you've heard of in?

131
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,850
CFP. Yep. Great. Put it up there. Social scientists love CFP.

132
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:46,550
It's like measured in every population based study right now. CFP. I think the stress parts of the stress, it's an inflammatory one.

133
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,610
I'm going to say that with a large asterisk. It's an inflammatory cytokine.

134
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:58,600
There's a lot of caveats to that. And the other questions physicians like are just like tells you nothing.

135
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,080
And it's all it's elevated and like just too many things.

136
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,610
Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. And that's problematic for me. Yeah.

137
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:12,830
I got a one woman mission to change what social scientists think about therapy, but sometimes you just have to play nice and maybe.

138
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:18,320
Yes. What else? Okay.

139
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,710
We're right in your name. Victoria okay, second question.

140
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,910
What do you know about Buy American Beijing? What have you heard? So, what are you guys doing?

141
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:31,989
Epigenetic work. Biomarker making or no? Methylation.

142
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:36,620
Yeah. Telomeres.

143
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,700
Telomeres? Yep. A lot of work on telomeres being done here.

144
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:59,200
I was going to add one more space on imagination because I know some people use algorithms to think about the kinds of like in imagination age.

145
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:05,170
Thank you. What you did is like you do a regression and you have age elevations.

146
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:11,830
That's right. You are past the age of actual age.

147
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:20,030
Yeah. If you if you ever want to really hear me rant, have you give a lecture about clocks and algorithms and what they can and cannot tell you?

148
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,950
But yes, algorithms, clocks, all big things right now.

149
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,100
Have you guys watched on Netflix group with Gwyneth?

150
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:34,540
I don't recommend very upset, but there's an episode about this where there's a really prominent colleague of ours on there.

151
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:40,060
It's a really entertaining Friday night. If you'd like to watch it.

152
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,660
It's I'm it's I'm like eating. You'll know you'll know it anyways.

153
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:49,390
Yes. Algorithms, clocks, DNA, methylation. What else about biomarkers of aging baby?

154
00:17:53,770 --> 00:18:01,060
Okay. So let's let's keep the pink going. So what are your questions about this domain of epidemiology or aging research?

155
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:11,929
And like, there's not a there's not a damn question here. Like I started from zero here and this is a very evolving field.

156
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:22,909
So what are your questions? Sometimes the question be like is this is sort of specificity in the sense that

157
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:28,580
like we study epigenome and the genome and the effect size is so minuscule.

158
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:36,530
Like what are we actually looking for? What are we actually looking for and what do we what is the signal that we see actually mean?

159
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:47,300
I think like, yeah, how would you distill that to something you have right down to size affect size of the brain effect size and sample size.

160
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,620
Okay. You social scientists in the room. What questions do you have about this?

161
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,870
I know one of the big questions that I really struggle with is,

162
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:10,030
does this actually help us reduce inequities in health or does it actually promote them?

163
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:21,580
Does it like a question that I struggle with a lot is does this fall into kind of biology izing race or does it help us actually debunk that?

164
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:37,340
Same with gender. I've kind of already alluded to this, but like, why isn't there better integration with, like, physicians to kind of like.

165
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,300
Like, there's so much like, brainpower and time being put into this just to, like, ensure that everyone's on the same page like you.

166
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:49,459
Yeah. From a path that. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Why isn't there more integration of medicine in clinical?

167
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,520
Clinical? Yeah, it's a great question.

168
00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:02,000
Anything else? Okay.

169
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,420
Scribes Thank you so much for helping me out and for being willing to write for us.

170
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:11,640
The reason I do this is because there's so much that there is so much happening in this area.

171
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:16,680
There's so much information being just dumped into it that it's helpful, I think,

172
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:24,749
to get on the same page just to kind of get your brain going and my brain going on this and you know how that goes.

173
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:31,489
So stop me at any time. I have a bunch of slides, but if we don't get through all of them, then that's fine.

174
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:36,450
And I'd rather this be useful to you and kind of engage with you on questions that you have.

175
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:44,370
Okay. So to give you a bit of guiding questions, just to further prime your thinking that we're going to address today, so what is the purpose?

176
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:50,579
And I think this a little bit came up in kind of the philosophical effect size sample size question, but what is why zoom in on biology?

177
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,110
Why is this a useful endeavor? And if so, for me, I'm like a health equity scholar, right?

178
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:02,940
Is this a useful thing for health equity scholars to do? And I should tell you that I am constantly having this existential crisis in my own work.

179
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,470
Why should we care specifically about the immune system? What does it tell us?

180
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,799
How does the immune system relate to the social environment? Is there more to the immune system than inflammation?

181
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:19,230
And let me just sub that in. Is there more to the immune system than CRP answers?

182
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:25,889
Yes, but it's and how can we integrate the immune system biomarkers into the social sciences?

183
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:30,720
And let me actually make a caveat to here to how can we thoughtfully integrate this?

184
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:38,490
So it's not just about can we put a biomarker in a regression model that we thoughtfully thinking about the ways that these two relate to each other?

185
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,959
So these are the kinds of questions I want you to be thinking about when when I'm showing you some

186
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,080
of the some of the work that we're doing and some of this background out of the immune system.

187
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:52,649
So this is a paper from a collaborator, my Kathy Harris, and she and Tom McDaid,

188
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,700
who's a big person, has always been a big person in biomarkers for decades.

189
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,999
Now he's at Chicago. They put out this paper.

190
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,590
It's really, really good called a bio social approach to human development for behavioral health.

191
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:09,240
And they give this this conceptual diagram, which I found really helpful.

192
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:16,350
This is about really about thinking about vital social processes, which is one way to kind of categorize this work over the life course.

193
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,820
And they have this two domains or on the bottom here is the biological domain.

194
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:27,140
And it varies here in in kind of degrees of specificity or kind of largeness, right.

195
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,129
So it starts here at the genome and epigenome.

196
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:35,040
The biggest category here, it goes all the way down to biochemical messengers or what I would often call biomarkers,

197
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,399
but not always on the top is the analog.

198
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,090
If you're thinking about the social environment starting off at political economy

199
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:45,900
and going down to social structures and stratification neighborhoods in schools,

200
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:51,869
interpersonal relationships and what they do here in this diagram so nicely is they talk about the ways that

201
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:57,180
these two are interacting across a life course to produce the patterns of health and disease that we see.

202
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:03,960
And so if we want to understand late life health outcomes and I'm an aging researcher and you're taking an aging class,

203
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:11,280
then we really need to look across the life course at this interaction between the social structures and the biological structures.

204
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:18,990
How many guys in thinking social IP or social sciences have heard this term embodiment?

205
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:24,450
It feels like it's like one that's becoming more talked about.

206
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:30,480
But a lot of people have talked about inviting me, and I'm going to show us some work that Nancy Krieger has done on it.

207
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:38,549
But I think it's a helpful context for me as a social scientist who's who's kind of spanning this biological spectrum.

208
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:47,730
This really helps me grow on my own work. So she talks about embodiment like this that bodies tell stories about, and that cannot be studied,

209
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:53,910
divorced from the conditions of our existence that often but not always match people's stated accounts.

210
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:59,850
And that people cannot or will not tell either because they're unable, forbidding or choose not to tell.

211
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:07,260
So how I see my job as a social epidemiologist studying kind of biological markers of aging,

212
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:11,249
those kinds of things is to learn how to listen to the stories that people's

213
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,940
bodies are telling and what those stories tell you about their lived experience,

214
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:20,550
about their position in society, about the social things that they have experienced over the life course.

215
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,100
In this way, it kind of tells you the life history.

216
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:29,100
And this is why I think biomarkers are so intriguing to me, because if you know what you're listening for, you know how to read the signals,

217
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:37,500
then maybe you get a little bit of sense of the life history of a person and also how to help you know how to think at a population level.

218
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:43,530
How do we help not people just live longer, but live longer and better and fuller lives that are free of disease?

219
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,630
Okay, so we're being driven to the immune system now.

220
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:53,250
Stop me at any time with questions. So these are like basics of the immune system.

221
00:24:53,250 --> 00:25:00,540
And this is a great diagram that starts here at our kind of largest and most nonspecific parts of the immune system.

222
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:08,720
And it goes to our most specific components and that's really important to the immune system is a really, really vast and complicated system.

223
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:12,320
And the research in this area is changing so quickly.

224
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:20,179
But this is such a this is like kind of a basic primer on it that I think is really helpful, especially when you're reading research,

225
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:24,230
to figure out what the thing that you're reading about where does this fall within this domain.

226
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:33,260
So at its core, the immune system was designed to combat external threats like pathogens and internal threats like cancer.

227
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:37,520
So the whole system is designed with those that kind of purpose in mind.

228
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:43,400
So it can also be triggered by other threats such as malnutrition and stress.

229
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,559
And then stress in this case as a psychosocial stressor could trigger this stress response.

230
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:54,020
But stress in this case is a biological response to a stimulus, to a stressor.

231
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,459
Like I said, social stressors can fit that with that definition as well.

232
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,930
But your immune system is designed and can can be triggered by these events as well.

233
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:09,920
There are any in adaptive immune immune compartments which most people and I think this came up a

234
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:16,790
little bit know a little bit about and there's varying degrees of specificity and the immune response.

235
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:21,440
So up here, when you're thinking about things like the skin barrier,

236
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:26,000
that's an immune response, but it's very nonspecific or you got skin all over your body.

237
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,109
It's it's a very nonspecific barrier, a very important line.

238
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:35,540
But it's it's a barrier for everything. It's not specific to a pathogen or anything like that.

239
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:41,239
When you come down here to inflammation, again, mostly nonspecific.

240
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,330
When you're inflamed, you're typically inflamed over your whole body.

241
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:52,340
When you have elevated biomarkers of inflammation or elevated side effects of inflammation, that's a systemic response.

242
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,879
It's not specific. It's it's helpful.

243
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:04,670
And it's doing its job, but it's systemic. Think about fevers or fevers are a really important, critical immune response that we have.

244
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:10,430
It's nonspecific. So you your body elevates temperature to fight off the pathogen.

245
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:15,799
It's elevated all over it's nonspecific to a region. Now, the caveat to this is if you have a wound,

246
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:22,850
you might actually have it might be high and red and inflamed on that specific site to deal with that particular infection.

247
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:30,590
So as you get down here, then you have this interesting area that I will tell you, this is a huge area for research right now.

248
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:38,300
The the immune cells that act in both the innate and an adaptive immune system like natural killer cells,

249
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:45,139
the complement system, these are all kind of they signal between the innate and adaptive immune system.

250
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:51,740
But the innate immune system will signal, depending on the circumstance, the adaptive immune system to respond.

251
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:55,760
The adaptive immune system is our most specific immune response.

252
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:01,550
This is where you have specific antibodies like idea or idea that are going to be specific to a pathogen.

253
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:10,550
You have B-cell activation which is producing those antibodies, you have T-cell activation which is seeking out and killing a particular pathogen.

254
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:17,860
So when you think about the adaptive immune system, think about specialized immune cells like T cells and B cells.

255
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,880
Question So far. Okay.

256
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,500
Okay. So organs of the immune system. I'll let you take a look here.

257
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:33,780
So, like, bone marrow, for example, is the one in your bone marrow where your B cells are produced.

258
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:39,389
That's your moral immunity. Your T cells are produced in your thymus gland.

259
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:45,990
And this is one of the most exciting points of new research that's being done that I love talking about.

260
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,980
So your famous gland is it's like little planets.

261
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:59,130
It's usually medicine. You have to write about your heart rate. When you're a baby and you're born, it's huge and you can like very visibly see it.

262
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:08,550
So for a long time, the paradigm was that in adults the famous claim was not consistent and now that is being very much challenged.

263
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:13,530
So what happens in the famous gland is it is responsible for outputting a T cells.

264
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,890
And we'll get and we'll get into it for a second of why they need to.

265
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:23,610
T cells are so important. But think of nine t cells as like cells that could respond to anything.

266
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:26,939
They're open. They can deal with new pathogens.

267
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,349
They're not specific to any one thing yet. They're young, they're naive.

268
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:35,520
They're healthy. Your thymus gland is responsible for outputting eight T cells.

269
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:42,599
So when a baby is born, their immune system is now responding to their environment and outputting all these new T cells

270
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,969
out there to deal with the variety of pathogens of babies and little kids are now exposed to.

271
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:52,170
Right, like think you're born and then all kinds of stuff coming your way.

272
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,410
And then think about daycare. It's just a hot zone.

273
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:05,519
But anyways, the thymus gland, once you're born, starts a process called involution, which just means it's shrinking and it starts shrinking.

274
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,139
And as it shrinks, it also decreases the output of T cells.

275
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:18,360
So you have less of those young, fresh T cells coming into your system, to your immune system, in it shrinks a lot after puberty.

276
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,749
That's when you see a huge process. But anyway, so it was it was traditionally thought that this process stopped in like the early

277
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:29,400
twenties and late teens and that these thymus glands were not present in adults.

278
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:37,079
Now, thanks to new technology, we can actually measure naive T cells in the blood of adults and see that the famous screen,

279
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:45,390
whilst very small, is still producing an output in eight T cells, which is great where this comes, whereas this is really interesting to me.

280
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,060
So I used to be a postdoc at Duke.

281
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:58,319
There was a guy there, great, simple, skinny, like bench science, old school in the lab type heavy and he worked at like a BSL four labs.

282
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,299
So it was like a really intense to go visit him.

283
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:06,660
But anyways he developed the technology to figure out if a T cell had been recently immigrated from the famous claim.

284
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:16,770
His work also looked at the ways in which the thymus could acutely invalids like you could shrink and then come back from a stressor.

285
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:27,870
This has huge implications for social science, right? So like if you think about a person undergoing really intense trauma or chronic social stress,

286
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:35,250
like I think about discrimination or the experience of structural racism if your body is responding in a way,

287
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:42,510
if so, this this work, if you carry this out and this hasn't been, you know, where we're so I'm trying to get us to test this in our samples.

288
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:50,399
But anyways, the implications for this is that this is one of the mechanisms that could explain why you see accelerated

289
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,229
immune aging in people that experience chronic stress and chronic strength and trauma and that kind of stuff,

290
00:31:55,230 --> 00:32:02,430
so the immune system can shrink and bounce back and that shrinkage, you know, can be a response to your environment.

291
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:07,380
So that's why I love talking about T cells. I love talking about the thymus clear question so far.

292
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:18,140
Okay. So I, I personally really love thinking about the adaptive immune system the most, the inflammatory system.

293
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,559
You know, sometimes you have to because that's the data that you have in front of you.

294
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,260
But I think the adaptive immune system holds a lot of promise.

295
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:34,610
So the adaptive immune system is basically there for production of pathogen specific antibodies like B-cells in activated lymphocytes,

296
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:42,620
including T cells. And that's considered the cellular immunity is your activated lymphocytes, your humoral immunity is your B cells,

297
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:50,360
and it stores the memory of these pathogenic invaders so that when so the point of the storage and everybody has been talking about this since COVID

298
00:32:50,360 --> 00:33:00,950
vaccines came on the scene right point of the storage is that when you have and this is like the process of like when you see a new infection,

299
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:09,920
so you have this clonal expansion of lymphocytes, you have a differentiation to make them specialized to the specific pathogen that you see.

300
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:15,830
And at each of these phases, your B cell is doing one thing, your antibodies during one thing, your T cells are doing another thing.

301
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:23,779
All this to say that the point of having something like a vaccine or immunity is that this process is very

302
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:29,150
much sped up the next time you see that pathogen so that instead of taking ihc usually t cells are not you,

303
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:36,440
you can't measure them for about two weeks after infection. The point is to make that all quicker so that you deal with the infection very quickly.

304
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:40,040
And that's why you want the memory in your immune system.

305
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:48,140
Questions about that. The problem that we're facing with COVID right now is that the memory is not lasting as long as that we want.

306
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:52,100
And so eventually the hope is that we would have vaccines that would induce longer lasting

307
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,790
immunity so that we wouldn't have to keep getting boosters every three or four months.

308
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,930
Not sure when that's going to happen. Okay.

309
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,190
So now this is this is the area of research that got me into the immune system.

310
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,120
And you guys have a lot of great questions about this in the paper that you read.

311
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,430
So persistent viral infections. And the caveat here is that they're more than a nuisance.

312
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:20,519
So the back story on this. So, yeah, there's this there's a family of herpes viruses, cytomegalovirus being a big one,

313
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:26,370
herpes simplex one into the virus that causes minor Epstein-Barr being one of them.

314
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,500
So the the school of thought for a long time has been that these viruses are a nuisance.

315
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:40,080
And I'm going to tell you why I don't believe that that is the case. So what typically happens?

316
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:47,190
So and I also, Annette, there was a couple people that had questions about congenital C and B or C and B that happens

317
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:51,540
after organ transplantation when you have a kind of newly repopulating immune compartment.

318
00:34:51,840 --> 00:35:02,040
Put those questions to aside for just a second. I'll address that. So what is typically the work that we're doing is based on this hypothesis that

319
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,100
you get infected with one of these herpes viruses early in the life course,

320
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,719
but I'm not talking about congenital C and B right now, but that cypress.

321
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,740
Okay. So you get infected. You get infected with one of these viruses early in the life.

322
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:19,010
Course, you don't ever get rid of it. So that's the thing about these persistent viral infections.

323
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:27,780
These are not ones that you clear. So like people had questions about why not study flu or have studied COVID, SARS-CoV-2 or some of these other ones?

324
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:33,480
Those are really interesting questions. And I think they should be studied in the context of the ways that they take your immune system.

325
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,160
But the reason that we focus on these ones right now is because you don't typically get rid of them.

326
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:43,500
People have lifelong infections and so they're latent, persistent viral infections.

327
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:53,400
So what happens is you get infected virus, replicates your immune system, dumps a ton of resources to tamp that viral infection down.

328
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:59,820
And athletes, it's very, very costly. So you have an enormous T-cell pool that responds.

329
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:06,120
And so you have this huge set of your main T cells that now differentiate to be specific to that pathogen that it's encountering.

330
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:11,610
So for me that when I look at the software, because it's measurements often seem to be cytomegalovirus.

331
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:21,730
So the virus is replicating. Your immune system dumps a bunch of resources in it and it goes into a waiting phase and something triggers reactivation.

332
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:31,840
So you can think of things that could trigger reactivation, stress, malnutrition, and things that make your body think, Oh, crap, I'm in trouble.

333
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:37,390
And that. So how many guys have ever taken final exams? And then you take a break and you get sick.

334
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:43,540
That happened to me every time I got wicked sick after my qualifying exams.

335
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:46,959
So, so much stress, right? So think about that.

336
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:54,250
So your immune system is staving it off and then it's feeling that stress and then things that are that it was keeping it.

337
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:57,340
They can't keep it. They aim more. Yes. I mean, a common.

338
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,420
Yeah, for sure.

339
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:09,819
So about three weeks ago, for out of no reason, I have this severe outbreak of hives and I never had any allergies before and I don't know why.

340
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:18,790
And I took the med and it was under control. And then a couple of days ago I was like barely until I feel I was really tired

341
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:24,220
that day to and then suddenly there's a little high coming out of nowhere again.

342
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:28,300
Yep. And I said, okay, this is like a similar situation of 10 to 20.

343
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,340
Yeah. Broke out, so. Yeah. Okay, I need to sleep. Yeah, right. Your body's saying hello.

344
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:38,410
Yeah, yeah. That's what my. One of my really closest girlfriends, her mom.

345
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:44,410
And so when I tell her about this research, she tells me the story. When she's a kid or my mom, she says, say, you know, stress will kill you.

346
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:49,360
And I'm like, you know what? I can actually prove that that is the case, like stress will kill you.

347
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,540
So anyways, something like what you're talking about, like,

348
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,000
so your body gets triggered by some event that tells your body you're not in tip top shape, right?

349
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,899
Like something is why there is a psychosocial stressor and that's becoming embodied

350
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:06,850
in your systems or in something like nutrition or mental sleep deprivation.

351
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:11,110
And it triggers this reactivation and this whole process starts again.

352
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:13,780
And so you can think about how costly this is, right?

353
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:19,419
And so our hypothesis is that this happens over and over and over again throughout the life course.

354
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:24,820
And so what we see, the patterns that we see, particularly around IPG antibodies, which we'll talk about,

355
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:31,060
is reflecting this lifelong process of latency and reactivation that these far older teammates are going through.

356
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:41,530
And to bring it back to the social sciences, our hypothesis is, is that people that experience persistent disadvantage, whether it's the, you know,

357
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:46,060
the experience of structural racism, sexism or trauma,

358
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:53,050
that they are experiencing this process more frequent frequently and it's aiding their immune systems.

359
00:38:54,790 --> 00:39:01,180
So let me illustrate this. So your thymus gland is is outputting all these naive T cells in yellow, right?

360
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:08,440
Every time it's going through this process where it's having to deal with a new pathogen or like something like a latent pathogen,

361
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:13,510
more of those naive T cells are turning into memory cells that are specific to pathogen.

362
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:21,550
So we're talking about herpes viruses. Every time that one of those herpes viruses pops back up and your body is forced to deal with it again,

363
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:26,110
more of your naive t cell pool is then getting differentiated your memory cells.

364
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:34,209
And so over time you have less naive t cells to deal with new infections and eventually that balance gets really off.

365
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:37,090
And so if you couple that with thinking about the way that your thymus game is

366
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:42,130
already reducing output and the way that that output can be related to stressors,

367
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,659
you can imagine that your your immune compartment,

368
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:53,800
the composition of it starts to change in ways that signal to us that your immune system is aging at a faster rate.

369
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:01,269
That makes sense. So when you have more memory cells, that's when we say, Oh, it's a more aged profile of your immune system.

370
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,300
That's what we mean. It's like when you're thinking about cellular immunity,

371
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:11,890
the balance of memory to naive t cells gets starts to get off because of the experience of your environment.

372
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:18,700
Questions about that. How many guys I've ever encountered.

373
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,930
Literature talking about the vaccines aren't as effective in older people.

374
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:26,919
Like flu vaccine. It's very common. It's because of this rate.

375
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:33,459
They don't have enough native T cells to actually mount the response that they need to deal with a new vaccine.

376
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,700
Because this is what happens with a vaccine is that you're trying to mimic this process

377
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:41,570
without it being a huge infection as you're trying to kind of trick your body into doing it.

378
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:45,730
And so older people typically have less vaccine efficacy because of this.

379
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:53,909
Okay. So that brings me to when I started looking at these persistent viral infections,

380
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:58,620
then it got me thinking, is this actually accelerating the ways that people are aging?

381
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:05,700
And when I was reading the social IP literature, they were all talking about cardiovascular disease and cancers and all these things.

382
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:09,450
And everybody would talk about an inflammatory component to it, right?

383
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:15,610
Cardiovascular disease, everything is about inflammation, CRP, Il6, all of those.

384
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:19,640
And I was thinking, why are those inflammatory biomarkers elevated?

385
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:24,480
There has to be like in my question and I really send my people in department seminars.

386
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,950
People talk about inflammation, I would say, but inflammation is part of the immune system.

387
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:36,719
So what is the immune process that you're capturing? So this that's when persistent viral infections started making a lot of sense to me and as a

388
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,370
as a way that they accelerate biological aging and seem this is the primary example here.

389
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:48,710
So the immune control of the virus is an indicator then of overall immune fitness.

390
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:58,259
So when the immune system is not controlling that virus well or you've had a lifetime of this reactivation process,

391
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:03,850
what you see is elevated R&D levels. It was an engine now T.J.

392
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,700
Well, C.J. was alluding to here the difference between IGG and IDM.

393
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,860
When you see it elevated,

394
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:17,490
it's it tells you something about like your viral the way that your body is dealing with that virus over a long period of time.

395
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:24,780
Whereas in this, the thing that I'm trying to advocate testing now is IDM so that you can adjudicate is this something that

396
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,399
has been latent and you've been dealing with for a while or is it something that's just recently popped up?

397
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,150
And so if you have both IDG, IDM, you can kind of adjudicate that between those two.

398
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:36,960
Most studies, Don, you be lucky if a study has IGG.

399
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,620
Well, so you still have IDM, but I think it would really clarify this process.

400
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:45,630
So when you see somebody with really high titers to IGG, then you can say, okay,

401
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:49,409
their immune system is probably not in great shape because they're no longer

402
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:53,910
able to tamp that down and get it into a latent phase that they can deal with.

403
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:57,780
Well, I wasn't sure about this like the previous slide.

404
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:02,790
So how do you like wrap your head around the couple of possible confounder that

405
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:07,150
like older people's legacies probably are like the most shrunk across their time.

406
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:11,790
And so of course they're going to just be producing like looks like, oh yeah.

407
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:14,189
So I think it's a great point and I wish we had data on it.

408
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:20,429
So the way that we can get around that is there's a lot of studies that like and these are this is where you

409
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:25,650
take the kind of cell biology studies and you rip it up to think about what it would mean in the population.

410
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:34,350
There's a lot of studies that have looked at the the the differentiated T cells and have there's they're very heavily predominantly CMB specific.

411
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:42,090
So you know that it's it's a combination of both because you can see that they have surface markers for a herpes virus.

412
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:46,170
It's a really good question. Also, let me get back to the congenital question real quick.

413
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:53,730
So the predominant work in C and B has long been about understanding mother to child transmission of CB because CB,

414
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:57,990
when it's transfer transmitted like that can be really, really dangerous for the baby.

415
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:02,069
And that's a I mean, that's still see and B,

416
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:10,049
but that's where a lot of the time and the money and the resources have been dumped into because it causes a lot of birth defects and issues around,

417
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:14,459
I think, pre-term, preterm birth and low birth weight, all of that, all the kinds of things that go with that.

418
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,080
So they take that really seriously.

419
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:23,280
But the thought there has a long, long been that CB is not something you should worry about in older children or adults.

420
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:28,350
And so our work is really trying to think about late. Yes, it is still something you should worry about.

421
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:34,680
The other way that it comes up is for people that actually don't have a risk land HIV positive

422
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,810
people and people that go through organ transplantations or bone marrow transplants,

423
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:42,899
anything that is like deeply immunocompromised or you're completely rebuilding our

424
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:47,160
immune system as you're doing it kind of like bone marrow transplants if you get and B,

425
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:53,190
it can be very, very deadly. So that's those two areas where research has been where a lot of this has been.

426
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:59,670
What our group is now advocating for is that we actually need to see a vaccine because it would reduce health inequities writ large,

427
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:03,540
not just in these two specialized cases. That.

428
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:07,260
I don't remember who asked those questions, but they're great questions. Does that answer that?

429
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:17,450
Okay. So in this case, when we see when we use CBD levels, we use them as an indirect measure of immune aging,

430
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:21,540
especially in the context when we don't have the data I like.

431
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,169
So some of it.

432
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:30,420
So the data that we've been using recently, we actually just have a paper that I'm going to submit their answer today that nature has actually tested.

433
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,220
They have T-cell phenotyping.

434
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:37,530
So we're actually able to look at some of these ratios of memory to naive or CD to CD, which is a whole different question.

435
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,260
But when you don't have that and you just had seen V,

436
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,919
you can use it as an indirect measure of immune aging because of the processes that I just outlined.

437
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,370
It's not perfect by any means, and there's a lot of opportunity for confounding,

438
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:56,040
but it's more than what we've had, and it's more than just a couple of inflammatory biomarkers.

439
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:05,600
Okay. So what sorts of patterns then do we see in immune biomarkers across the life course?

440
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:11,240
So we see an increase in inflammation. That's what's termed inflamm.

441
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:12,440
Right.

442
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:20,749
So you generally what you see in your immune system as it ages is it becomes less competent and less sophisticated in the way it deals with things.

443
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:25,700
And part of the way that that shows up is that you have kind of a chronic increasing low grade inflammation.

444
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:30,100
What drives that is still really being debated.

445
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:37,280
But I my thinking is that these processes of dealing with persistent infections may actually be one of the things that drives inflammation.

446
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:42,260
But in general, we see an increase in inflammation across a life course.

447
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:46,910
We see an accumulation of differentiated T cells over naive T cells.

448
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:48,979
Same is true with B cells in natural killer cells.

449
00:46:48,980 --> 00:47:02,660
Actually, you see a decrease in CD4 cells and increase in CD8 T cells and you see less control over persistent viral infections.

450
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:07,130
So C can be in other ones and more antibodies to those.

451
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:12,200
Another interesting example is when people get shingles triggered, right?

452
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:18,260
And later in life that's a latent virus gets triggered by usually related to some kind of stressful experience.

453
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:22,910
And then it boy, it really does a lot of damage. It's really unpleasant, but that's the same kind of process.

454
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:31,640
Okay. So thinking back now to the population level stuff, what are our gaps in understanding of population level immunosuppressants?

455
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,680
So one, as I just kind of alluded to with case question,

456
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:41,780
a lot of the work that that kind of forms our hypothesis has been done in really small

457
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:45,349
samples like the work on the famous gland that you're talking about like in a five,

458
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:51,320
six and you studies, which is not unusual for lab based studies, not unusual for bench science,

459
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:58,879
but for us like thinking about what are the population level patterns, that's really tiny and you really can't draw huge conclusions from that.

460
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:06,020
So that's a really big issue. Nine Representative Samples You guys doing epigenetic aging and methylation stuff.

461
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:09,170
You guys, this is something that is really big in your world right now.

462
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,579
Like, who are the samples that you're deriving your hypotheses from?

463
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:22,880
And they're mostly white samples. And so how does that help you tell a story about people that are, you know, nonwhite, non advantaged populations?

464
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:27,950
We deal with the same stuff in the kind of immune world, right? So like how do we get representative samples?

465
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:35,060
So one of the bigger beefs that I have is that we have really focused on one or two immune

466
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:40,310
biomarkers without understanding the context of how those biomarkers really operate.

467
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:48,590
The immune system is terribly complex system, and I think and I don't want to like trash some people,

468
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,020
I just focus on one or two biomarkers because I've done it too.

469
00:48:52,100 --> 00:49:01,170
I think there's a huge limitation in that a biomarker in its core should be understood as a signal of an underlying processing system.

470
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:05,149
It is not oftentimes, almost always not the end in of itself.

471
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,570
It's a signal and you got to learn how to listen to the signal. What's telling you?

472
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,310
If you have a system as complex as the immune system and you're only picking up one signal,

473
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:17,600
it's going to really limit your ability to understand what's happening to the system as a whole.

474
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:21,350
So a lot of the work in this area is really focused on one or two biomarkers.

475
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:24,050
So I take CRP and IL six, for example.

476
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:32,030
Il6 is more useful than CRP for sure, but both are being are are just talked about solely as inflammatory biomarkers,

477
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:39,260
but they're not always inflammatory. Sometimes they're anti-inflammatory, sometimes they have feedback loops with other cytokines.

478
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:48,980
And so in that way or other interleukins and in that way, you know, so to just treat it as CRP elevated, that's bad.

479
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:53,780
That's not always the case. And so when you just have this one or two biomarkers,

480
00:49:53,780 --> 00:50:01,850
you're picking up on a little teeny tiny bit of the system without the acknowledgment that there's a much more complicated system happening.

481
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:05,450
There have been very little.

482
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:12,829
So in these clinical cohorts, in these small samples, there's been very little attention to sociodemographic differences and markers.

483
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:15,860
And I think that's where the social epi piece comes comes in handy.

484
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:22,350
Okay. So how does the immune system interact with the social environment then?

485
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:29,220
You know what? It's 1050. Do you guys mind if we take a break now and then we'll kind of do this next section?

486
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:34,770
Okay. So what do you typically take a ten minute break? Is that right?

487
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:41,730
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So let's come back at 11 and we'll talk about the interaction with the social environment.

488
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:38,220
I. But the.

489
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:55,360
You. No.

490
00:52:42,510 --> 00:53:02,530
On. Over the course of the trial.

491
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:21,410
Ready. But now in country.

492
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:28,080
At the time, I was just doing something.

493
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:35,160
I had to do something. Yeah, but.

494
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:46,450
Okay. So, you know, you do the best we can, you know, move back to your.

495
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:55,390
Yeah, I think I'm going to do that for seven, eight. So you can see what your name is.

496
00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:59,800
Yeah, I can if I do. You know.

497
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:02,950
You on. Well, I.

498
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:09,030
I. Yes.

499
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:15,430
Okay. I mean, that's like I'm using. And there's really a problem here.

500
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:22,270
Oh, yeah. Yeah. You know, people tend to not change.

501
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:32,290
That's true. It is true. That's what happens to look for the baby.

502
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:41,610
Yeah. You know, I just.

503
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:48,310
I just forgot. I only met a girl that wrote about something like that, which.

504
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:57,160
Yeah, I know most of this stuff, but I like this one, like.

505
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:02,080
Yeah. Oh, is that your what?

506
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:15,370
Oh, I think I was too good at that. Oh. Oh.

507
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,890
It's like the winter weather. Does that, huh?

508
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:27,480
Oh, I. I think. I think it is that all these movies, that's the one doing the on going nature.

509
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:33,530
Well, come on. I think your mother's trying to tell people that.

510
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:41,240
I mean, you know, this was not actually true.

511
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:47,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. These just happens to be some of the stuff.

512
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:58,670
I mean, like, I don't know if there was, like, a poster for this that.

513
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:03,400
It's just too. That was my.

514
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:11,280
This section. Oh, really?

515
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:21,230
Yeah. Yeah. And then I have that.

516
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:37,320
But before you even get there.

517
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:41,400
It's all very tender.

518
00:56:42,060 --> 00:57:04,210
I went out with my teacher completely unable to feel like this one or two more because we just had ten people that really seemed to love teaching.

519
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:09,000
This is. This is, you know.

520
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:20,760
Have you feel like you should have. My mother saved hundreds of.

521
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,840
Okay. Okay. So.

522
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:43,890
Do you guys have to do like papers and exams in this last number of papers?

523
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:50,400
More than more than one. And you're like, all grades.

524
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:55,480
Like to send that? My participation.

525
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:04,380
Yeah. Was a very gracious professor, but as well.

526
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:09,860
Yeah, that's funny. I think what she had us doing, I took her social class, but I.

527
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:14,010
My. It is odd to visit that. Do they still teach social AP?

528
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:18,540
Have you done teachers that well in this grade class.

529
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:22,800
Real quick. Didn't really. Was there like a waitlist for it? Like almost immediately?

530
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:28,049
Wow. Yeah. A substantial I mean, is there a parts one and two?

531
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:34,350
So. I don't think so. I think there is, but I don't think there's a spotlight on anything.

532
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:43,710
Oh, maybe I was her GSI for many years.

533
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:50,850
We had a great time together. She's great. What are the other popular AP courses right now?

534
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:57,120
Um, infectious disease. Oh, Joe. Yeah, I know who's teaching that.

535
00:58:57,570 --> 00:59:00,710
So that's been around forever. I have to revise the teacher for that class.

536
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:08,140
You hear a lot about Joe. Yeah, I saw one that's pretty popular with.

537
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:12,090
Oh, really? Oh. Aubrey teaches sixth. So why now?

538
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:16,720
Do you know a guy named Hal Morgenstern? Yeah.

539
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,080
It's probably Americans now. Okay.

540
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:29,139
I know more concern for you Chicago but it's probably a mayor's was that he was a T top six one for many many years and

541
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:35,470
what he did is he had his own textbook that was in PDF form that you would have to like go to the place and get printed.

542
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:42,970
And then he would put the PDF on the screen and just like lecture the PDF and that's how we learned AP methods.

543
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,750
Oh wow. We be happy here.

544
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:55,080
Aubrey is teaching digitally. That's cool. Another yellow flag.

545
00:59:55,950 --> 01:00:02,480
I have such a limited amount of time that like one of two great socialist approaches to the.

546
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:09,660
I love John Smith, John. That's great.

547
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:13,010
I bet she's a really good teacher. I think she has some other shoulders.

548
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:16,690
You're just not teaching this year because she's on sabbatical.

549
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:29,200
Yes. Another post up for last year. I was teaching on the 15th and then for the next one, 516 actually got one of the materials.

550
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:32,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know who that name.

551
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:37,900
He's engines. He's a producer, you know, Labs as a data analyst.

552
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:45,040
Oh, cool. Yeah. He's also he's also well known for the five assessment Advanced Genomics Class.

553
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:48,420
Oh, that's really cool. We should have a lot of genomics classes.

554
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:51,880
We have such a wealth of people doing that work here. It's amazing.

555
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:59,350
You know, I didn't know when to sign up for classes, so I didn't know there were a lot of the classes were closed.

556
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:03,559
So I ended up signing up for a lot of electives outside of. Like is still in school.

557
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:07,120
Public health. Oh yeah. Yeah. Like there's all disasters.

558
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:10,350
There's a natural disasters course. Been all over that.

559
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:18,850
Sorry. I'm having, like, so much to sell jokes just like me out of a nice infectious disease for emergency response.

560
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:23,440
Who teaches that? I don't even know this person.

561
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,620
Wow. I've always wanted to do not.

562
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:32,800
Not that I ever advocating for there to be a natural disaster.

563
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:39,490
But I've always wanted to do. And like a natural experiment where you look at like different infectious disease outbreaks following,

564
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:43,450
you know, what are the prevalence in the community before and then immediately after?

565
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:49,990
I just think it would be so interesting to see like what outbreaks and what, what communities are vulnerable to an outbreak and.

566
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:59,000
Yeah. One of my undergrads right now is he wants to do a PhD, but he has idea which I think is really cool is to create like a,

567
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:04,120
a vulnerability index at the census track or block group level for communities

568
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:09,159
to see like how vulnerable they are to outbreak at a pandemic or an epidemic.

569
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:16,030
Or I guess in that case and I think it's a really neat idea of like like taking into account like social built environment,

570
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:20,650
all these different dynamics and what makes a community really vulnerable so that we,

571
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:25,780
we often have policymakers come to us and say, your research is nice, but it's not useful.

572
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:31,450
Like, tell us like what we where exactly we need to put resources and what we should be looking for.

573
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,459
Should I start for our research center?

574
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:40,270
And I wasn't I before I was a student here and they're working on that, not for infectious disease, but for flooding.

575
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:45,429
And where is this? It's called the Center for Social Solutions, and it's in Allison.

576
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:49,590
And I'm going to tell him to look this up. Yeah. They're always looking for undergrad research assistance.

577
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:58,180
Center for Social Solutions. Yeah, it's a sociology, sociology and history fact research center.

578
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:04,570
But the actual researchers have their degrees in sustainability and environment.

579
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:10,240
That's cool. The head researcher has his Ph.D. in geography.

580
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,470
Who's the head researcher? Brad Bartels. He just joined, like, last year.

581
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:18,340
Yeah, he's he's from the U.S. government. He was FEMA.

582
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:23,740
And that's super cool. So he does like a census tract.

583
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:30,790
They're literally doing like building out plans, like to create a vulnerability index that is like building level for flooding susceptibility.

584
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:39,040
I got to look this up. This is like perfect. I just listen to something on NPR about, like a project like this to help predict landslides in Alaska.

585
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:43,360
And now they're trying to scale this up, but it's like it's also community based research and like,

586
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:47,410
you know, people science where they're just like sending in data. It's a really idea.

587
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:53,680
I think we could like expand that to outbreaks of infectious diseases anyways.

588
01:03:53,840 --> 01:04:01,090
That's really cool. Okay, let's, let's talk about how the immune system interacts with the social environment.

589
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:06,040
So we've got, we've got a bit of time left. We can end early to whatever you guys wanna do.

590
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:12,100
I have a few studies that I'm going to show from my own work that we can talk about, including the one that you guys read.

591
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:16,050
But also we can, you know, if you have questions or, you know,

592
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:20,049
I know there's a lot of other work that I didn't show here, but I'm happy to talk about that.

593
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:25,240
I have other slides where if you want or if you want to just chat about questions you have, that's fine too.

594
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:29,200
So I'll take you through some of these, but stop me at any point if there's something that you want to talk more about.

595
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:37,959
Okay, so the three examples that I have when I'm not showing here are some like work that we just finished on the neighborhood environment in.

596
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:45,460
This is kind of seen the immune aging but so the fancy new paper that you guys read a paper with another colleague here at

597
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:53,170
Michigan on disability and then on early life trauma and immune function that we're getting ready to resubmit very soon.

598
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:57,310
Okay. So overview of the virus, meaning you guys know the nature.

599
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:02,950
It's a longitudinal cohort study that's housed here at the University of Michigan and it's a wealth of information.

600
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:07,920
So if you're at all interested in social status, so assess how.

601
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:12,550
Health, not just immune health. It's great, but it also is.

602
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:20,000
And so they they they started enrolling people in 1992, but they're enrolled people that are retired or older.

603
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,470
So they have, you know, cohorts that are pre baby boomers kind of thing and they,

604
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,460
they sample them every two years, so they give them more interviews and stuff.

605
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:31,190
So you have a lot of really good longitudinal data that you just don't have in a lot of other studies.

606
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:38,320
It includes right now over 20,000 adults over the age of 50.

607
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:42,110
So sometimes you get a spouse that's not 65, so they get enrolled.

608
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:50,419
The nice thing is, is they did some really groundbreaking work on immune function that no other national cohort study has done,

609
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:53,510
and that's called the venous blood sample or the venous blood study.

610
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:55,070
And so that's what we use a lot.

611
01:05:55,640 --> 01:06:02,690
So we for the current study that we're looking at, we use of actually all three use this venous blood setting in 2016, which I'm hoping to replicate.

612
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:08,210
And then we got social environment data from the Leave Behind survey. So these are just surveys of people, you know,

613
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:12,830
so they people come to their house and interview them or on the phone and then they also leave surveys behind.

614
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:16,430
So we got information from Leave Behind surveys and Life Histories questionnaire.

615
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:20,360
The Life Histories questionnaire, if you're into this sort of stuff,

616
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:26,300
was really cool and asked people to remember like every place they've ever lived who died of what age,

617
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:29,720
all kinds of really rich data that you just often don't have.

618
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,750
And then we got demographic data from some of the core surveys.

619
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:41,059
So the study questions here is adult X associated with immune responses in B and the reason why is for the

620
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:46,190
for the everything I told you before is that an immune response to and B is a proxy measure of immune aging.

621
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:51,709
And the second is parental education associated with immune response among older adults.

622
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:58,100
Net of adults, yes. So basically the question here is which which does parental sex or parental

623
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:03,230
education still matter even if you take control out your individual status?

624
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:13,810
So we had around 8000 participants that we had data on and we categorized the IgG response in Tertiles.

625
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:21,610
And so higher IgG tertiles more seen the antibodies, less immune control, more advanced immune aging.

626
01:07:22,130 --> 01:07:29,470
Okay, so that's how we can interpret that. I will say some of the studies that have you seen, we only rely on a binary indicator of CMB,

627
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:37,240
which I have done before, to what you're losing with that. So you have an unmitigated, honest, you have a lot of people that are infected with CV.

628
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:42,489
So when you only use a binary indicator, you have no indication of how well their immune system is dealing with it.

629
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:46,030
You only know that they've had it or they currently have it, but that's it.

630
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,040
We looked at age, gender, race, ethnicity,

631
01:07:51,430 --> 01:08:00,280
and we did ordered logit models where estimated the odds of being in a higher tertile of C and B response associated with a CSM parental education.

632
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:04,660
Any questions about that? Okay.

633
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:12,790
So here's the big finding here. The lower educational. This is participant level of educational attainment associated with more CV antibodies.

634
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:16,390
We honed in on participant education because this is a retired sample.

635
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:20,650
So we didn't want to focus on income because income is really unstable in a retired sample.

636
01:08:20,650 --> 01:08:28,930
So we thought, all right, let's look at education. So what you see here is those with less than a high school education had a two

637
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:34,240
times increase in odds of being in the next highest tertile of CV response.

638
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:37,900
What I want you to take from this is the gradient, right?

639
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:45,940
This is what you're looking for. A lot of times with CFS, you see a gradient in the response and you see that as people get more educated,

640
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:49,930
the odds of being that next highest, your CV response is reduced.

641
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:56,559
It's all compared to those with a college education or more. In Model two here.

642
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,200
So Model one controls for race, ethnicity and gender.

643
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:05,740
Model two controls for age, race, ethnicity, race, fit, race, ethnicity, gender and parental education.

644
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:13,600
So this answers that question. Okay. Well, how much do we see a signal with individual participant education when we control for parental education?

645
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:18,190
The answer is we still see a signal. It's attenuated, but it's still robust.

646
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:28,290
Yeah. For the education category, you actually have some college in your name.

647
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:34,799
My question is, do you think there's really a systematic difference between some college versus somebody who has

648
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:40,620
a high school degree because some college rather than being equals to have a high school degree.

649
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:45,360
Yeah. So what? So what do you think? That that's not a great question.

650
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:53,040
I remember we had a we talked about education in a previous section of this class, and we don't really see that much of a difference.

651
01:09:53,070 --> 01:09:56,100
What really matters is that whether you have.

652
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:59,910
But what really matters is that degree. Yeah. Right. Right.

653
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:03,629
So there's lots of a colleague of mine on a logical.

654
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:08,160
But she's. She's at a Canadian university.

655
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:12,229
There are many of. She's written a lot about this, like this some college idea.

656
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:16,160
And I thought about it, too. I can't I don't I can't come down on the solid answer.

657
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:23,959
So the stuff that you're talking about is one theory around education, that what matters is kind of the piece of paper.

658
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:30,440
It's like the signal that you got to this next level, right? You have the college degree AP diploma, but you have a high school diploma.

659
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:36,500
There's other schools of thought that what matters is like the actual years of education that you experience,

660
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:41,780
which this these data would suggest that there's something about having some college.

661
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:51,740
What I think is hard about that particular category and when you're coding the interest data is that that some college could mean that you have y or.

662
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:57,110
Yeah. Or if you have an associate's or you've taken a few classes or you've done some trainings.

663
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:04,170
So it could mean that you actually incrementally increase your X in ways that are not, you know,

664
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:11,209
maybe it didn't get reflected in a college degree, but it actually was able to get you a better job or, you know, something like that.

665
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:18,330
So it's hard to say. Also, the other thing to remember is that we're talking about people that are older.

666
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:22,579
So what does that mean? And that in the seventies and eighties. Right.

667
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:28,940
It would be a very, very different question. If you're talking about people, contemporary people, like what would like it.

668
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:38,570
My hypothesis is that a four year college degree matters much more for people in our age categories than it did 50 years ago.

669
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:44,570
It's a really good question. But yeah, I feel like for some college category, it also captures.

670
01:11:46,090 --> 01:11:52,060
Maybe attended college, but it had to drop out or stop due to like carriers like.

671
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:56,260
Yeah. Or childcare or like other financial. Yeah.

672
01:11:56,570 --> 01:12:00,129
Yeah, exactly. And it's hard to know. So honest where to be ever.

673
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:04,840
If you're interested in education, look up on a logical. But see AJ, a CPA.

674
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:13,329
She does a lot of work and she first of all, she has she's got a really good review paper on what education needs and for measurements of education.

675
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:14,440
So if you're interested in that.

676
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:22,540
But she also she's got a lot of work looking at specifically what a some college I and it's really interesting work I,

677
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:26,529
I don't know what to take from it so but it's like, you know,

678
01:12:26,530 --> 01:12:32,260
it's basically what is actually some college signal and there's a lot of complex social processes there.

679
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:42,990
This is the model for parental education. This is model two that has parental and participant education in it.

680
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:47,880
And the model three on the right that takes parental participant education out.

681
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:54,420
What I want you to see if that you see in association with parental education, these are.

682
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:58,020
So think about it. This is like mind blowing feedback, at least for me.

683
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:02,250
These are people mainly 65 and older.

684
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:08,549
Right. You're controlling for their own education and you still see a persistent association

685
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:13,050
with their parents education in the ways that their body is responding to,

686
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:17,640
to be. That's like a 100 year process that we're talking about.

687
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:22,649
I don't know if like I like that's kind of wild.

688
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:25,650
Right? And you still like it's two times the odds, right?

689
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:33,810
So people that had parents with an education of eight years or less compared to those with parents who had more than a high school education,

690
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:37,920
had two times the odds of being in the next highest tertile in the response.

691
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:44,700
That's a pretty robust finding to me. I rarely find things in the in the odds ratio range of two.

692
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:51,170
It's usually like 1.3, 1.2, like, oh, cool.

693
01:13:53,310 --> 01:14:01,830
So you see it like, so this is where you take participant at model three removes participant education.

694
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:06,380
And so this is parental education, right? Self control for the other gender reason.

695
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:12,000
What I notice here is that the association doesn't change much,

696
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:17,280
which tells me that there are two distinct social processes that are interacting with community.

697
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:17,630
Right.

698
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:23,790
There's one that's working through this pathway of parental education, and there's one that's working through this pathway of your own education.

699
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:27,540
And of course, those two things are related, but they're also distinct.

700
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:33,840
And that that is curious to me. And I have never known what to make of those findings, except that they beg a lot more questions.

701
01:14:36,450 --> 01:14:44,009
One of the things that I want to be really critical of, and I wrote this paper, so I feel like I get to be critical of it right now.

702
01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:47,100
That you should be critical of all papers should be critical science.

703
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:52,680
Anyways, so in the address we have a really interesting thing happening with race.

704
01:14:52,710 --> 01:14:59,400
The sample is mostly white. I think something like 70% white is 80% non-Hispanic black.

705
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:06,000
Very little proportion Hispanic. And then there's this other category and a few of you picked up on this issue, too, and I struggle with this.

706
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:15,959
So, first of all, the other category is and that's like a basket of all kinds of different identities that really matter for health.

707
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:20,310
Right? So you have it for people that just categorize Asian as one identity.

708
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:27,150
There are so many different racial ethnic categorizations within that that are really meaningful for the way that you experience the world.

709
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:33,840
So first of all, that's you can't distinguish out here and then you have things like how do you capture native populations?

710
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:38,010
And so this is something that actually my group has written a lot about in the pandemic,

711
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:47,880
is the ways that we have systematically embraced small populations because we say, well, they don't have a statistical sample size.

712
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:54,270
I'm telling you this all to say. This is something I think we should struggle with more in AP.

713
01:15:54,450 --> 01:16:02,700
Right. So we have this the struggle between do we have the sample size enough to look at these associations versus what does it mean if we don't?

714
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:07,380
What is it? What does it mean if we clump everybody in one category of other?

715
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:14,550
So a lot of the work that we've been doing recently has actually stratified models by race

716
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:22,950
and ethnicity to really at least speak to the ways that structural racism is such a pervasive

717
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:27,809
influence that to just control for race is that what you really want to do is kind of try to

718
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:32,130
control out all of these effects of the ways that structural racism influences your body,

719
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:39,180
influences your lived experience. So we've we've advocated for stratifying models a lot of times instead of controlling for race,

720
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:42,180
because I really don't love controlling for race, even though that's what we do here.

721
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:49,259
The struggle that we run against is that we have enormous confidence intervals because you have really, really tiny sample sizes.

722
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:55,440
And so you never see an effect estimate that has in here confidence interval in these groups.

723
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:59,639
And then even even more so even when you do stratified analysis,

724
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:04,470
it still doesn't get to the problem of this other race ethnicity category that you can't disentangle.

725
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:10,920
So I am very critical of this. You know, I think these these associations are really robust.

726
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:16,560
What makes me cringe a little bit when I read this paper is that we controlled for race, ethnicity.

727
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:20,940
I think that we had to in this case for many reasons,

728
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:27,120
because I think we would never have gotten into a journal without thinking about how race was operating.

729
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:31,290
And so we use we control for race as a proxy for race ethnicity in this instance.

730
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:35,340
But most of the time I advocate for stratifying what I mean it's.

731
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:38,670
From this is that you should be critical of the way the ways that people treat race,

732
01:17:38,670 --> 01:17:44,640
ethnicity and models, especially when you're thinking about these kinds of biological processes.

733
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:52,730
Okay. So summaries we see robust associations between educational attainment and CV.

734
01:17:54,050 --> 01:18:00,800
We see no association with adult income. So we did test adult income. But again, adult income in a retiree sample is really unreliable.

735
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:06,409
And we saw direct and indirect associations between parental education and C and B,

736
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:10,040
and I'm going to say maybe so we didn't do a formal mediation analysis.

737
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:17,330
We put parental education in a model with participant education and saw that participant education remained robust.

738
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:21,110
But this is not a formal mediation analysis. So I think that's one interesting.

739
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:30,020
Next step is that you could do a path analysis on these data and see how much of the of the effect of participant education operates,

740
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:38,480
how much of the effect of parental education operates in participant education, and how much is a direct association between parental education and c?

741
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:42,350
B My guess is that there's a large distinct difference between the two.

742
01:18:45,630 --> 01:18:50,340
Okay. This one was done with a colleague of mine, Katie Shani.

743
01:18:50,370 --> 01:18:58,469
If you're interested in disability and kind of the intersection with biomarkers of aging and physical function, you should look her up.

744
01:18:58,470 --> 01:19:04,770
She's wonderful. So we asked a question here and we did just use the seropositivity marker because it was the first time this work had

745
01:19:04,770 --> 01:19:11,700
been done and is seropositive seem to be seropositivity associated with greater prevalence of physical disability.

746
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:17,010
And does this association differ by gender and race ethnicity. So in this paper.

747
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:20,440
So this reflects this is a few years later.

748
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:25,190
This reflects the ways that we have struggled with these questions I just told you about with race, ethnicity.

749
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:30,090
So we thought, how the heck can we do this thoughtfully and ethically?

750
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:37,080
So we found this great paper. And for those of you that are interested in disparities, this is a must have paper.

751
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:40,470
It's called How Do We Assess the Racial Disparity in Health?

752
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:45,329
It's published in the Annals of Epidemiology, and the senior author is a woman named Whitney Robinson,

753
01:19:45,330 --> 01:19:49,500
who is like an incredible scholar thinking about health disparities.

754
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:56,220
And she's an amazing EPI meteorologist. So if you're interested in this work and you want to think, how do I struggle with these questions?

755
01:19:56,550 --> 01:20:00,540
What does it mean when I control for race in a model that is not me? Check her work out.

756
01:20:02,370 --> 01:20:05,340
So we followed their there guidance here.

757
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:15,060
So we looked at sandbag antibodies and you remember what we ended up doing with them, but we mostly focused on seropositivity versus their negativity.

758
01:20:15,570 --> 01:20:20,570
And then we looked at Adele disability as her outcome and we just we made a binary cup point there.

759
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:25,410
If you had any of the ADL disabilities versus nine and then we did porcine

760
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:29,220
binomial models with her best standard errors to estimate the prevalence ratio.

761
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,860
Okay. So this is model one and this is among women.

762
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:44,710
And you know what? I wear my notes here to see. Trying to think what we.

763
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:50,440
Yeah, okay. Model one is age adjusted model two adds race ethnicity.

764
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:56,499
We did a really deep dove into this, looked at interaction terms with race and we followed.

765
01:20:56,500 --> 01:21:02,409
If you check this paper out in the American Journal of Epidemiology, we followed Whitney Robinson's guidance on how to actually discuss this.

766
01:21:02,410 --> 01:21:06,280
So what we did first, and I don't show this here, is we looked at.

767
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:18,670
We looked at it, we did a two by two table where we looked at race and gender and the prevalence of the outcome and the exposure by race and gender.

768
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:27,490
And we we published that. And that was a way for us to say there is it there's already an equity in the distribution of the exposure and the outcome.

769
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:32,440
And so then we followed our analytic strategy from there so that this one feels like

770
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:35,950
a more thoughtful approach to race ethnicity than the previous paper I talked about.

771
01:21:37,090 --> 01:21:44,830
So anyways, this is their to be Seropositivity is associated with prevalent disability among women and you see in this model one,

772
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:51,610
it's associated with a 60% increase in disability and that slowly gets attenuated when you add various things.

773
01:21:51,610 --> 01:21:55,149
And we Kate and I both think that model four and five.

774
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:58,570
So this adds in like health behaviors, all kinds of potential mediators.

775
01:21:59,110 --> 01:22:06,940
We think these are over adjusted because we think that these are things on the causal pathway between C and B in disability.

776
01:22:07,870 --> 01:22:15,719
But. This is the nature of it. Sometimes you have to make reviewers and editors happy and say, okay, we're going to keep poking at this.

777
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:20,790
So we still see a signal, though. You see the confidence intervals go over one.

778
01:22:24,370 --> 01:22:27,700
With men. It was a heck of a messy story.

779
01:22:28,330 --> 01:22:36,370
And you actually see that some suggestion involves two through five that seem to be is associated with a reduced prevalence of disability.

780
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:39,849
And we actually have no idea what is driving this associations.

781
01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:46,780
It's something we're still needling. Our answer to it is actually we're going to look at seeing the ECG instead to say, okay,

782
01:22:46,780 --> 01:22:51,250
there's something there's something we're not seeing, just looking at seropositivity versus negativity.

783
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,620
And we need to look at the continuous antibodies.

784
01:22:56,860 --> 01:23:02,590
So our our takeaways from this study, we're seeing these associated with a greater prevalence of disability among women.

785
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:07,390
And it may serve as a salient mechanism shaping disability risk for women.

786
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:13,599
And that's we didn't want to overshoot this one. You know, this is an example where we didn't see really,

787
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:20,739
really powerful findings and we still chose to publish it because we think it's important to get even findings that are not big out there.

788
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:23,170
So we publish it. But I think there's a lot more.

789
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:30,190
This begs a lot of questions for me, like what's happening is IG am a reliable indicator here, but we're working on it.

790
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:40,540
Okay, this is the paper that we're just finishing up and I want to tell you the story of how this paper came to be so early in the pandemic.

791
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:44,920
I started reading the literature probably starting in 2020, 2021, actually,

792
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:49,899
the massive amount of children that were losing caregivers and parents because of COVID, the women.

793
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:53,110
You'll see the headlines around this super disturbing, right?

794
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:55,810
When you have a million people that have died in the U.S. from COVID,

795
01:23:56,770 --> 01:24:02,260
you need to start thinking about not just the acute consequences, but what are the long term consequences of this.

796
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:07,780
So these headlines started popping up in Philip and I got to talking like,

797
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:14,200
what do you think the effects of losing a parent are going to be for population health 20 years from now or 30 years from now?

798
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:17,250
And these kids that are growing up having endured, you know,

799
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:24,160
not only the traumatic experience that we all went through in a global pandemic, but then on top of it, losing a parent or caregiver.

800
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:27,340
So we thought about ways that we can test this hypothesis.

801
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:32,350
And we, the HRC, has these life histories, questionnaires that ask people, did you experience this,

802
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:37,900
the loss of a parent or caregiver, a parental separation before the age of 16 or 18, depending on the question.

803
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:42,729
So that was our study question Is there association between experiencing parental

804
01:24:42,730 --> 01:24:46,360
death or separation before the age of 16 and immune function in later life?

805
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:52,209
And I will tell you the other thing that kind of informed this work when I was at Duke,

806
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:57,820
used to work with these animal researchers who could do things that we could never do in social science,

807
01:24:57,820 --> 01:25:01,660
where they would like manipulate social status and then test all kinds of stuff.

808
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:07,719
Like they could like say, okay, I'm going to take this baboon and move them from the lowest rank to the highest ranking,

809
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:11,260
this other, so they could test some of these hypotheses that I have,

810
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:18,310
could be very unethical to propose in humans, but they had done work on baboons,

811
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:24,730
in macaques that had been separated from a mother for a certain amount of time and then looked at their immune biomarkers.

812
01:25:24,730 --> 01:25:27,430
And so and I knew, I knew that results in the back of my head.

813
01:25:27,430 --> 01:25:32,590
And so I thought, I wonder if we can start detecting even a slight signal of that in humans.

814
01:25:34,990 --> 01:25:40,780
So here we looked at CV, IBD antibodies, we looked at CRP, we looked at TNF,

815
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:48,819
Alpha and Il6 and I'm going to replicate this now look at C 48 ratios, memory, two naive T cells.

816
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:54,820
So those data were not out yet. This only data that we had, we looked at it stratified.

817
01:25:54,820 --> 01:26:00,130
So this is when I told you about that two way table about the exposure and the outcome by race ethnicity.

818
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:04,730
I published this in this paper as well. So this is, you know,

819
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:08,799
the first thing to notice here are that racialized minority populations have higher

820
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:16,030
levels of severe antibody levels and the inflammatory biomarkers compared to whites.

821
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:23,500
They also had much higher experiences of parental death and separation.

822
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:31,630
So, you know, for non-Hispanic blacks, 34% of them experienced parental death before 16, compared to 17% for whites.

823
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:40,660
When you looking at parental separation, black and Hispanic populations, 42% experience that, 30% of Hispanics compared to 19% of whites.

824
01:26:40,660 --> 01:26:44,500
So you already see the inequity just looking into two by two table.

825
01:26:44,890 --> 01:26:49,900
So anybody tells you that descriptive epidemiology is not worth it. So it's very powerful.

826
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:58,630
So then we looked at models stratified by race and we looked at CV.

827
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:01,960
So this should be adjusted for age and sex.

828
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:09,310
And then I model to, I think, ads. I can't see my notes here, but model two adds, I think health behaviors for remember correctly.

829
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:15,879
But what you see here is that experiencing parental separation is associated with higher mean antibody levels.

830
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:20,700
To seen the most strongly among non-Hispanic blacks.

831
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:26,520
You started seeing a. They know in Hispanics and other races that are very imprecise confidence intervals because of the sample sizes.

832
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:31,350
But you still see a huge signal and whites. So this is experiencing parental death.

833
01:27:32,370 --> 01:27:41,189
This is what it looks like for separation. Again, I mean, I think this one is one of those funny situations.

834
01:27:41,190 --> 01:27:47,610
When you add confounders into a model and it goes away from the null, which I think is an interesting case here.

835
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:58,050
So this when you see a robust association between experiencing parental separation before age 16 and CV in late life,

836
01:27:58,350 --> 01:28:02,879
so think about the span of time between these things. It's kind of crazy to think about.

837
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:07,320
You see an association in rights, although it doesn't really change when you add in potential confounders.

838
01:28:09,150 --> 01:28:13,550
This is for IL six. Does anybody have it?

839
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:20,790
Can anybody make anything of this? So you see a signal in in whites, although it's not very strong.

840
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:24,660
But then in the other populations, you see basically nothing.

841
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:29,750
This is again why I L6 and CRP are very messy biomarkers.

842
01:28:30,690 --> 01:28:34,510
This is IL six looking at experiencing parental separation.

843
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:38,720
This one I noodled for a very long time trying to figure this out.

844
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:42,090
Why do you see an association in the opposite direction?

845
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:47,469
You might have ideas. I don't have an answer.

846
01:28:47,470 --> 01:28:56,590
I'm actually agnostic asking that question. So you see it in the predictable pattern for whites rates.

847
01:28:56,590 --> 01:29:02,060
So higher oral sex associated with experiencing parental death or parental separation.

848
01:29:05,950 --> 01:29:07,850
One of the things I'd love to know. You guys think about this.

849
01:29:07,870 --> 01:29:14,530
One of the things I've been thinking about is selection bias into the jury sample and wonder if the

850
01:29:14,540 --> 01:29:23,169
sample of individuals who make it to age 65 and can be selected into a jury is in some way different,

851
01:29:23,170 --> 01:29:29,620
fundamentally different, and therefore have a robustness to their immune system than the folks that didn't make it to 65.

852
01:29:31,210 --> 01:29:37,090
And you're talking about people who have experienced trauma, intense trauma as a child and making it to 65.

853
01:29:39,670 --> 01:29:42,670
Like, do you think that has merit to it, like selection?

854
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:49,750
I think about selection bias a lot in each of us is definitely an issue for my and one of the papers that I.

855
01:29:51,870 --> 01:29:57,060
And we also found the negative association like those strong negative.

856
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:02,770
Association is like a celebration and the cholesterol and.

857
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:11,850
What was that? What was the exposure? The exposure is by the prefecture, this DNA methylation situation.

858
01:30:12,330 --> 01:30:20,130
Okay. Is this like plastic meets your biological ages, hired you for a magical things like that.

859
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:25,830
And then it's like if you are your body's aging, you have a lower cholesterol.

860
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:29,459
Oh, was cholesterol okay? Yeah. Yeah, at least cholesterol.

861
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:33,990
And then we actually the way if you had accelerated aging, it was associated with lower cholesterol.

862
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:39,300
Yes. And then that finding is actually consistent in many other literatures, too.

863
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:44,940
What do you make of it? Um, we haven't read the conclusion, but I think it's for each of us.

864
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:50,940
So we definitely talk about selection bias, those people who are aged.

865
01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:54,550
Yeah. And this lecture that we. We think is healthy.

866
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,480
Yeah, I think so, too. That's the only thing.

867
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:05,730
I mean, one of the things I've been thinking about is, ah, can you see biomarkers of resilience in the immune system, like something that tells you?

868
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:13,049
And actually I was just looking at some stuff around COVID so I have never had coping with and I was

869
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:17,280
reading something and it was in The Washington Post or The New Yorker about people that have not had cold.

870
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:24,110
It might have like an interesting immune marker. I'm like, or maybe I'm very anal, I don't know.

871
01:31:26,610 --> 01:31:35,820
But I was thinking about like, is there some kind of like and there's also like a really good NPR podcast on rabies in people that survived rabies.

872
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:39,599
They're very special anyways.

873
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:42,629
You get really go down the rabbit hole stuff. But I was thinking,

874
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:46,800
I wonder if there is some kind of biomarker of resilience in the immune system that we don't know

875
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:53,670
yet that tells you like you might actually be different than everybody else or most people.

876
01:31:54,330 --> 01:32:00,210
Yeah, I think I saw an article somewhere about that, about the that people who haven't had COVID,

877
01:32:00,810 --> 01:32:11,850
but I saw a different perspective on it and like I read someone else's perspective on it and that it kind of has like that huge eugenics.

878
01:32:12,030 --> 01:32:20,819
Oh God, really? Because like, you're talking like scientists may be talking about like biological differences between

879
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:25,559
people who haven't had COVID and like biological differences by race kind of thing,

880
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:29,370
like the eugenics. Yeah, that's good to know.

881
01:32:29,370 --> 01:32:32,309
As a caveat, I just have to say at least a headline. Yeah.

882
01:32:32,310 --> 01:32:36,990
I mean, I think one of the things that we struggle with in this work and I think like the epigenetics,

883
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:42,480
what I'm is really struggling with this too is actually not doing anything that can be related to eugenics movement.

884
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:50,010
And that means being really careful about the ways that people interpret your work and whether it's like biology and race or biology.

885
01:32:50,010 --> 01:32:53,690
I think gender I thank you for telling me that and talk this out.

886
01:32:53,700 --> 01:33:00,269
Now, one of the things I want to tell you, like if you're doing this kind of work that you need to struggle with, is that so?

887
01:33:00,270 --> 01:33:04,780
There are sex differences in in the lab workers in immune and hormones and things

888
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:08,620
that also the access and the hormones are all interacting with new system.

889
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:12,300
And so we typically have to control for a proxy for sex.

890
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:18,660
I think what I found really tricky is really being thoughtful about the structural

891
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:24,629
experience of sexism and gender versus controlling for biological effects of sex.

892
01:33:24,630 --> 01:33:31,860
In the same way that I put age into the model to kind of take care of the chronological aging piece to get at what over and above age,

893
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:35,700
if you're doing this kind of work, I want to I want to flag this for you.

894
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:40,770
You have to be really careful about it. And this is like the sex and gender thing is something that we really struggle with in our work.

895
01:33:43,390 --> 01:33:46,950
Anyway. So eugenics thing is really important. That's interesting.

896
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:50,730
Anyway, so this is what we're we wrote this up very,

897
01:33:51,450 --> 01:33:57,029
with a lot of caveats and a lot of we don't know what's happening here because I don't want to say I don't know yet.

898
01:33:57,030 --> 01:34:06,629
I think it needs to be replicated. Yeah. They really want to investigate the non parental social systems that sort of fill that gap.

899
01:34:06,630 --> 01:34:11,970
Because in Maggie's group, before we started all the analysis,

900
01:34:11,970 --> 01:34:20,230
she had us read a bunch of papers and some of them were about the role of churches and religious organizations in Deep South black communities.

901
01:34:20,250 --> 01:34:28,590
Yeah. And like that is not something that in very specific white communities that has more of a strong role, but not generally.

902
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:35,520
Yeah, great. I like it really buffers the of some of the effects of structural racism because there's a community aspect.

903
01:34:35,550 --> 01:34:39,620
Yeah. And especially I think the difference between separation and death of a parent.

904
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:48,840
Yeah. Sort of. I don't know psychologically how you sort of get over that, but I guess that's it's a really good question thing.

905
01:34:49,170 --> 01:34:53,880
So. So the way that I'm approaching this, it's been an interesting journey.

906
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:57,839
So as you know, Phillip was like a hardcore epidemiologist, right?

907
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:03,780
So we really approaches from an epidemiologic frame, which is to say that we looked at this early life exposure and we thought that

908
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:07,170
there was merit in looking at the early exposure in the late like outcome,

909
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:10,860
without trying to look at everything that could mediate that association.

910
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,440
It's a little bit different than what you're talking about, though.

911
01:35:13,950 --> 01:35:20,220
But anyways, the sociologists have really picked on us for not controlling for all of the essential life course mediators.

912
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:24,750
We're like, those are on the periphery of the we think there's value in showing an association

913
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:28,770
between this early life thing and the late like outcome without looking at mediators.

914
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:37,290
So we have like we've got a lot of critics. We got a big criticism from PNAS for this and anyways, we decided to submit it elsewhere.

915
01:35:37,290 --> 01:35:43,799
But this hasn't been a hard battle, but that's separate from what you're talking about, a potential kind of effect modifiers.

916
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:52,620
Like could it be that certain populations have access to different stress buffering supports like churches,

917
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:59,159
which that's been talked a lot about in COVID work? And could that buffer the association?

918
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:02,280
That might be a good follow up paper from this is HHS.

919
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:05,730
Have those data. I don't I work with ACL so I don't know.

920
01:36:05,970 --> 01:36:12,930
Um, but there I yeah, I don't I wonder if there are things that are like, you know,

921
01:36:12,930 --> 01:36:18,540
are you close to relatives or something else, some sort of like informal, like questions that, you know,

922
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:24,089
I had thought about it is that as an actual modifier, you know, instead of a mediator,

923
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:30,950
like something that changes the way that this relationship is playing out, that whole work coming from racism.

924
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:37,739
But if I have to talk to Maggie about this, Maggie's always really fun to actually talk science with and say, What do you think is happening here?

925
01:36:37,740 --> 01:36:40,880
And I love it. When she comes into the office, we talk shop anyways.

926
01:36:40,890 --> 01:36:46,350
That's third point. Okay, so applications to your research, let me leave you with a few considerations here.

927
01:36:47,340 --> 01:36:52,620
When you're doing this kind of work, whether you're talking about immune biomarkers or other biomarkers of aging, you need to be specific.

928
01:36:53,130 --> 01:37:00,270
So we need to talk about the specific pathways that we're looking at, why we think this biomarker is responding to the social environment in this way.

929
01:37:00,570 --> 01:37:09,060
Specificity is very key. So sometimes when you look at these big algorithms, for example, it takes in 27 different markers across the body.

930
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:13,290
There's a benefit to that is that you can kind of see whole body aging.

931
01:37:13,650 --> 01:37:19,770
The downside to that is that you have no idea which body system is driving that association.

932
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:23,550
So there is a there's a really need for specificity in this research.

933
01:37:23,910 --> 01:37:27,420
Remember what biomarkers are that they're signals of an underlying system.

934
01:37:28,140 --> 01:37:35,310
And so remember the system that you're trying to understand in complexity versus clarity.

935
01:37:35,310 --> 01:37:40,380
So sometimes you can't make a complex system more simple, but you can make it more clear.

936
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:44,040
And so sometimes the goal is not to actually simplify it.

937
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:51,840
Sometimes it's to say this is a very complex system, but let's get some clarity on dimensions of the system or pathways in the system that we can.

938
01:37:53,870 --> 01:37:57,139
And I just want to leave you with you know, think back to this paper, McAfee,

939
01:37:57,140 --> 01:38:01,130
Harris and Tom McDade, which, if any, if anything, is of interest to you. This is a good starting point.

940
01:38:03,370 --> 01:38:08,000
Um. Okay. Okay.

941
01:38:08,150 --> 01:38:13,790
So the other thing is get in touch. I have lots of great collaborators, have been great to this work and we've got great funding support.

942
01:38:14,090 --> 01:38:18,310
But mostly I love working with people and hearing new ideas and, you know,

943
01:38:18,380 --> 01:38:22,010
pushing us on ways, different ways to think about this stuff like you guys have done.

944
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:26,509
So if you ever, you know, want to get involved, we're always looking to expand our lab.

945
01:38:26,510 --> 01:38:33,620
So, you know, should be an email or come visit a science or sit in our lab meetings, whatever.

946
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:39,679
And we all love you know, we're a big team. My lab is and we love working with people and helping each other out and pushing each other.

947
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:45,919
So we're always happy to have more people. So with that, we've got a few minutes left.

948
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:52,760
I'm happy to take questions about this work, about social environment, about research or career stuff.

949
01:38:56,010 --> 01:39:01,940
Yeah. So, like, and thinking about you said your lab was, like, pushing for, like, a vaccine for something.

950
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:06,690
Is there, like, a certain hope for, like, making it with.

951
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:18,149
I guess the research is still going on, but like making it go with like the series when kids go in for like they're rubella and measles,

952
01:39:18,150 --> 01:39:24,300
mumps, or would that be like an adult thing? I mean, the way that I got the key to this for adults, that's a good question.

953
01:39:24,310 --> 01:39:31,350
So what am I? Everybody sets in turn working with me this year and she is trying to do like calculate population

954
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:36,270
attributable fractions for what if we had a C and B vaccine among adults and like looking at.

955
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:44,370
So a lot of our work right now is on ADHD risk and dementia and cognitive aging and the effects of immune peripheral meanness in essence on consumers.

956
01:39:45,210 --> 01:39:50,880
And that's what I work on for those days are in lenses that she and I are that's our our grant that we're working on together.

957
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:56,310
And so what we're trying to simulate is if you had a vaccine given to adults,

958
01:39:56,970 --> 01:40:03,810
how much of morbidity mortality associated with each of these cancer ADHD would be reduced with the vaccine?

959
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:09,900
But we hadn't thought about it in kids, and I think there has been some work on kids done.

960
01:40:10,650 --> 01:40:16,470
But what we see is that a lot of those primary infections are happening in teenagers and young adults.

961
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:22,470
I mean, I think it happens in kids, too, but by the time people are in their thirties, there's a huge proportion that are infected.

962
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:30,520
But, you know, I think that would be the follow up work is like what at what age would you need to get a vaccine for it to have the biggest benefit?

963
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:34,410
The problem is, is that like these big drug companies are,

964
01:40:34,470 --> 01:40:45,690
they have the work to use the B vaccines and just hasn't been enough push and demand for them for them to scale it up is infuriating to me.

965
01:40:45,690 --> 01:40:53,729
So that's why we're trying to put out like policy kind of relevant papers like this would be the benefit if you did this to slog right now,

966
01:40:53,730 --> 01:40:58,380
but I'm working on it. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Other questions?

967
01:40:59,430 --> 01:41:05,250
Um, I'm curious. Like, I know that you're kind of, like, limited by what the what the state is that tells you, but like,

968
01:41:05,550 --> 01:41:13,830
looking like why look at territories and why did you instead of looking at like reactivation of the actual CMB,

969
01:41:13,830 --> 01:41:17,070
which would be like the best indicator of like ATM.

970
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:21,780
Yeah. Or like even just clinical like. Yeah.

971
01:41:21,810 --> 01:41:23,700
I mean, idea would be like the way to measure it.

972
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:28,709
But like, I mean, I guess with, you know, start with just like clinical symptoms and then like screening.

973
01:41:28,710 --> 01:41:33,750
But the problem is, is that most of people, they have it like they think they have a cold.

974
01:41:35,330 --> 01:41:39,890
Yeah. You rarely been build a doctor for it unless it was more severe.

975
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:43,940
Yeah, it's just like it's hard. I guess that makes a lot of your problem making up with the fact.

976
01:41:44,180 --> 01:41:51,139
Between, like, titers being low or tires being high because it's like, it's a static snapshot of, like,

977
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:57,230
one moment in time and, like, as long as they're not like the immune system is very good at regulating levels.

978
01:41:57,230 --> 01:42:03,770
And so like as long as there's not reactivation of CMB like the immune system, one could argue that the immune system is doing a good job.

979
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:08,240
Yeah. And so I really don't know that it's not actively replicating.

980
01:42:08,250 --> 01:42:11,340
Yeah. You really don't know unless you know but. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

981
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:14,180
Actually, I think, you know, it's a really good question.

982
01:42:14,180 --> 01:42:19,669
I mean, so I just ran a pilot thing where we were creating like 45 people over the age of 65.

983
01:42:19,670 --> 01:42:25,430
And I had an undergrad who stood at the In Lab Clinic at the Harvard Graduate Center and gave them special of tubes.

984
01:42:25,730 --> 01:42:26,660
And we went the other way.

985
01:42:26,660 --> 01:42:34,520
It was like very I know we had our people all above board, but it felt very shady, like, here are your blood collection tubes.

986
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:37,390
Go take em into the lab and get them filled. Anyways,

987
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:45,860
what we ended up testing is it was the first time that things like that had actually looked at it and it and very few had detectable I can perceive.

988
01:42:45,890 --> 01:42:49,610
Yeah but they did have, you did see big differentials in your eye.

989
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:50,870
Yeah.

990
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:58,640
And we have a few other much smaller samples, like one that was done in the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study that actually has serial testing of it.

991
01:42:59,030 --> 01:43:05,689
You can kind of see it stable and rising, but everything is just a proxy, you know, you're just getting this.

992
01:43:05,690 --> 01:43:09,250
Yeah, I'm taking these single snapshots and saying what you think is happening.

993
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:14,030
Yeah. And I mean, are you going to disappear so fast? Like, that just sounds like the most expensive.

994
01:43:14,060 --> 01:43:22,100
Most time intensive. Although, like, think about if you had an IBM for 8000 people you could really get at.

995
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:26,629
Yeah, it's this process of, you know, latency and reactivation.

996
01:43:26,630 --> 01:43:32,210
It's not a recent infection. Yeah, it's a question I get when I submit my work to like in allergy journals.

997
01:43:32,840 --> 01:43:36,610
The question I get from reviewers a lot is how do you deal with reinfection?

998
01:43:36,650 --> 01:43:43,910
How do you deal with timing of infection? And so I feel like if we have idea and we get a little bit closer, yeah, honestly,

999
01:43:43,910 --> 01:43:50,150
the most compelling stuff is when I see ones that have looked at T-cell phenotypes and specifically look for surface markers,

1000
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:57,380
because when you can say that the pool is 70, like the work that has been done as it's like 70% of T cells are differentiated.

1001
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:05,260
So that feels compelling like you know that your body is like it's overcome with taking care of CP.

1002
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:12,100
It's great questions that we're just chipping away so naturally.

1003
01:44:14,050 --> 01:44:20,940
Other questions, comments, thoughts. Is there any other?

1004
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:27,500
That you found out to be a lifelong, you know.

1005
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:36,080
So the work that we're doing in T-cell phenotyping where we look at ratios of memory to naive cells and Sunni sleeper cells,

1006
01:44:36,350 --> 01:44:40,930
that feels really promising to me. Know that passion is.

1007
01:44:41,290 --> 01:44:46,720
I'm just curious what what technologies can be used to differentiate these two things.

1008
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:51,210
The ninth one in the middle, which is flow cytometry. Yeah.

1009
01:44:51,850 --> 01:44:52,959
And so, you know,

1010
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:59,830
the case so that the like doing it in the interest people is super pricey with do flow on all those people but it it's been incredible.

1011
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:03,740
But the pilot I was just talking about that we ran what we did is.

1012
01:45:04,150 --> 01:45:11,650
So most of these studies have looked at like one herpes virus we looked at for herpes viruses and then did flow cytometry to look at on his license.

1013
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:16,900
It's all cross-sectional, but it's going to provide the preliminary data for a much bigger grant.

1014
01:45:16,930 --> 01:45:22,780
So do you scale this up to basically do flow on a a large sample of people like

1015
01:45:22,780 --> 01:45:27,970
in major us and then to look at viral antibodies to more than just see me.

1016
01:45:28,130 --> 01:45:33,190
Hmm. Yeah. And also to try to see. So what I'm trying to get at is get interested.

1017
01:45:33,190 --> 01:45:36,329
Do a follow up to the 2016 study.

1018
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:42,340
Yes. And then you can kind of look at IBD dynamics and the association with T cell phenotype.

1019
01:45:43,550 --> 01:45:44,650
I don't know someone.

1020
01:45:44,650 --> 01:45:54,010
I forgot his name, but Jan told me about this, that he's trying to work on this data that has longitudinal data on methylation data.

1021
01:45:54,310 --> 01:45:57,330
So usually like in pictures. And he would not only have to let.

1022
01:45:58,040 --> 01:46:03,800
In this cross section. And then he has this, like measure over time that fragile families.

1023
01:46:04,890 --> 01:46:08,000
No, I o maiden with Colter Mitchell.

1024
01:46:08,930 --> 01:46:12,650
Yes. I think he has longitudinal. I think he just had was.

1025
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:18,010
Yes. Something like. Yeah. But it would be really interesting if we had something with the punchline.

1026
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:24,169
So is this any more. Yeah. The thing I just talked to Jen about a couple weeks ago, maybe was last week, is I was saying,

1027
01:46:24,170 --> 01:46:30,290
why don't we do a study where we look at methylation patterns related to viral burden and see if you

1028
01:46:30,290 --> 01:46:35,300
see some differential methylation patterns that might drive the immune response and that you see.

1029
01:46:35,870 --> 01:46:40,640
So I'm trying to do things like combine our two fields. I think I think I sold Jen on it.

1030
01:46:41,780 --> 01:46:45,050
I told her I would write the green if she did it, and she was like, I'm all about that.

1031
01:46:48,770 --> 01:46:53,170
Others that. Yeah.

1032
01:46:53,740 --> 01:47:02,430
I was thinking about. Parental separation before age 16 and the negative association.

1033
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:06,800
And this might be a stretch. Let's hear it.

1034
01:47:09,230 --> 01:47:15,650
I was thinking, like, for non-Hispanic, white, Hispanic and other, race is often negative.

1035
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:22,280
When he is positive. Yeah. I feel like back then, I don't know.

1036
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:28,580
Like in the sixties and seventies, neighborhoods were much more segregated.

1037
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:34,430
Right. And people would live, you know, there was more of a sense of community because,

1038
01:47:34,430 --> 01:47:41,350
you know, in like areas with your with like similar similar backgrounds.

1039
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:48,370
Right. So there might have been like a higher level of community support, so.

1040
01:47:49,010 --> 01:47:53,730
Yeah. Getting to what she was talking about. Yeah. Interesting.

1041
01:47:54,650 --> 01:48:02,660
So would you say that that level of community support buffers the impact of the parental separation?

1042
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:10,370
Maybe. I don't know if it's strong enough to cushion the association with that would be just.

1043
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:14,360
Oh, I love this idea. Okay.

1044
01:48:14,670 --> 01:48:17,720
Um, sorry. Is going to write it down.

1045
01:48:22,930 --> 01:48:29,709
So what I didn't show you is like work that is, I just presented AP checks on neighborhoods and immune aging.

1046
01:48:29,710 --> 01:48:33,010
And so you see really robust associations with neighborhood affluence.

1047
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:41,680
In different new biomarkers. But what we did is we looked at neighborhood at the same time that immune aging or right before it was measured.

1048
01:48:42,190 --> 01:48:48,459
So what I'm thinking is what if we had the life history data and we can link them to the neighborhood they lived in in childhood,

1049
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:54,790
and somehow could use historical census data to get at the level of disadvantage or ratio

1050
01:48:54,790 --> 01:49:00,220
of residential segregation like I think Maggie has measures for that historically to

1051
01:49:00,370 --> 01:49:05,410
to see you were be able to tested it directly but what if we could find a good proxy like

1052
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:10,810
I'm thinking that we could that's a great project to get a student to do it for you.

1053
01:49:12,100 --> 01:49:16,290
That's a really good project. Oh, I love this idea. Thank you guys for this feedback.

1054
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:19,570
I, I need to get this paper back, and it keeps me up at night.

1055
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:26,810
Any other last minute thoughts? Have you thought about selling Lake City for skiing?

1056
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:35,780
Yeah, we have that in in this in this paper that we're doing that I guess we looked at just populations, differences in markers.

1057
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:43,159
Thing is, is when we look at we see much more of a signal looking within the see for compartment in the severe compartment looking

1058
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:49,070
at memory tonight you then you do the this for study which that one has actually been while studying EEG research.

1059
01:49:49,530 --> 01:49:52,879
You see an inversion of that ratio as people age. That's true, right?

1060
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:56,000
Yeah. Because your ticket goes up as you see people working out. Yeah.

1061
01:49:56,420 --> 01:49:58,750
Well, there's been debate about what is the.
