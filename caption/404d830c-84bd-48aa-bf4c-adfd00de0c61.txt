1
00:00:09,928 --> 00:00:14,678
In the amplified negative reflection, what you're doing is exhausting the negativity

2
00:00:14,678 --> 00:00:17,601
so there's nowhere further south the patient can go.

3
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:22,340
You do this in particular where you feel the person is in a yes but spiral.

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,342
So what you do is say things that are so extreme, so negative, so

5
00:00:26,342 --> 00:00:31,840
against change that the patient has almost no choice but to disagree with you.

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,940
So you use language like you see no benefit whatsoever in quitting smoking.

7
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,747
You see no possible way whatsoever in changing your diet,

8
00:00:40,747 --> 00:00:44,641
you're completely satisfied with your weight right now.

9
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:47,716
Now if you are snarky about it or sarcastic,

10
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:53,140
it can blow up your rapport and it can cause some therapeutic damage.

11
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,645
However, try to stay inquisitive and neutral and

12
00:00:56,645 --> 00:01:01,140
that will help avoid that sort of snarky sarcastic tone.

13
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,269
Let's take a look at an amplified negative reflection.

14
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:08,666
>> Yeah, she doesn't have any siblings and

15
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:13,042
playing outside is pretty iffy in our neighborhood.

16
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:18,940
So TV is the cheapest way for me to occupy her without endangering her.

17
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,940
So in the bigger scheme of things it's not all that bad.

18
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,776
So giving up TV seems almost impossible and

19
00:01:26,776 --> 00:01:30,649
you really don't see any other options in the afternoon.

20
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:34,351
And you're not convinced it's doing any harm.

21
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:36,960
>> Doing so seems almost impossible.

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,157
That's an amplified negative reflection.

23
00:01:40,157 --> 00:01:42,135
And finally, the action reflection.

24
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:47,055
Here, you're reflecting back not what the person feels, not necessarily what they

25
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:52,440
think, but what they intend to do, how they go about it, what their goals are.

26
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,989
So this is a moving forward reflection, take a look.

27
00:01:55,989 --> 00:02:00,887
>> We have tried to reduce the amount of television that she watches, but

28
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,554
it has not gone so well.

29
00:02:02,554 --> 00:02:07,476
I mean in the morning, you know, I get up, I take a shower, I get dressed,

30
00:02:07,476 --> 00:02:09,054
I make some breakfast.

31
00:02:09,054 --> 00:02:15,190
And I usually allow her to watch TV so that I can give myself some free time.

32
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:20,144
Now, maybe in the afternoon it may work better because then I can

33
00:02:20,144 --> 00:02:24,440
get her involved in an art or music project.

34
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,072
>> Okay, so

35
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:30,444
getting her involved in something creative in the afternoon might be an option.

36
00:02:30,444 --> 00:02:31,492
>> Yes.

37
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:36,547
>> I think if she exercises more, I think it's gonna happen.

38
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:40,389
>> And I think that now you seem to have found something that might be possible if

39
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:43,283
you could use the treadmill, you say it's downstairs.

40
00:02:43,283 --> 00:02:45,344
It just needs to be put down into usable way.

41
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:47,832
>> Right, into a usable way and plugged in.

42
00:02:47,832 --> 00:02:51,879
>> And finally, let's show you a clip from the movie, The Sixth Sense where Dr.

43
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,652
Bruce Willis is using some pretty high end MI skills.

44
00:02:54,652 --> 00:03:00,246
Take a look at the clip and I'll see you on the other side.

45
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:05,203
>> Hi.

46
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:09,647
Wanna seat?

47
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:19,697
Don't feel like talking today?

48
00:03:19,697 --> 00:03:21,846
Want to play a game?

49
00:03:21,846 --> 00:03:25,253
It's a mind reading game.

50
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:27,348
Here's how it works.

51
00:03:27,348 --> 00:03:29,815
I read your mind.

52
00:03:29,815 --> 00:03:33,948
If what I say is right, you take one step towards the chair.

53
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:39,527
If what I say is wrong, you take one step back towards the doorway.

54
00:03:39,527 --> 00:03:43,063
If you reach the chair, you sit down.

55
00:03:43,063 --> 00:03:47,524
If you reach the door, you can go.

56
00:03:47,524 --> 00:03:58,349
Wanna play?

57
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:05,686
Okay.

58
00:04:05,686 --> 00:04:11,284
>> [NOISE] >> When your mother and

59
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:15,521
father were first divorced,

60
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:20,943
your mom went to see a doctor like me and

61
00:04:20,943 --> 00:04:24,004
he didn't help her.

62
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:41,640
So you think I'm not going to be able to help you.

63
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:47,100
You're worried that she said she told him things.

64
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:59,971
Things she couldn't tell anyone else, secrets.

65
00:04:59,971 --> 00:05:01,660
You have a secret but you don't want to tell me.

66
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:16,034
[MUSIC]

67
00:05:16,034 --> 00:05:18,508
Your dad gave you that watch as a present just before he went away.

68
00:05:18,508 --> 00:05:30,503
[MUSIC]

69
00:05:30,503 --> 00:05:33,418
>> He forgot it in a drawer, doesn't work.

70
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:46,914
[MUSIC]

71
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:52,140
>> You keep pretty quiet in school, but you're a good student.

72
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,877
You've never really been in any serious trouble.

73
00:05:56,877 --> 00:05:58,357
[MUSIC]

74
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:05,304
>> We're supposed to draw a picture,

75
00:06:05,304 --> 00:06:09,477
anything we wanted.

76
00:06:09,477 --> 00:06:18,740
I drew a man, got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver. [MUSIC]

77
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,616
>> You saw that on TV, Cole?

78
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:23,937
[MUSIC]

79
00:06:23,937 --> 00:06:29,212
>> Everyone got upset.

80
00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:32,049
They had a meeting.

81
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:34,740
Mom started crying.

82
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,710
I don't draw like that anymore.

83
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,017
>> How do you draw now?

84
00:06:43,017 --> 00:06:52,840
>> Draw people smiling, dogs running, rainbows.

85
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:59,533
They don't have meetings about rainbows.

86
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:01,182
>> No, I guess they don't.

87
00:07:01,182 --> 00:07:04,691
>> So let's deconstruct what we just saw.

88
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:08,263
So first of all you see in the early part of the clip, Dr.

89
00:07:08,263 --> 00:07:10,863
Willis doing some hypothesis testing.

90
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:14,637
He was testing to figure out why the kid didn't wanna talk.

91
00:07:14,637 --> 00:07:19,440
Clearly the kid was hesitant, resistant, reluctant.

92
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,804
He made two guesses, psychiatrists didn't help your mom, you're scared I won't be

93
00:07:23,804 --> 00:07:28,740
able to help you, and you have a secret that you don't want to share with me.

94
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,183
Both of those were partially correct with the latter one being perhaps more

95
00:07:33,183 --> 00:07:36,540
determinative of the kid's reticence.

96
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,550
The next thing we see is the power of the foul tip.

97
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,318
He made two reflections that were factually incorrect.

98
00:07:43,318 --> 00:07:47,740
One about the watch, one about you never get in trouble at school.

99
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,106
In both cases, the young man simply corrected Dr Willis.

100
00:07:52,106 --> 00:07:53,210
He didn't run out of the room.

101
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,396
He didn't get mad.

102
00:07:54,396 --> 00:07:57,437
He simply said, well, no, here's the facts about the watch and

103
00:07:57,437 --> 00:08:00,108
here's the facts about me getting in trouble in school.

104
00:08:00,108 --> 00:08:02,260
So that will happen to you in clinical practice.

105
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,829
If your reflection is wrong,

106
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:09,640
the patient will almost always simply correct you rather than get angry at you.

107
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:16,140
You also see a really nice downturn at the end of Dr Willis's reflections.

108
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,247
No uptalk from him.

109
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:22,266
And finally, one other aspect of this entire encounter is how Dr.

110
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:25,568
Willis allowed the patient to feel they were driving,

111
00:08:25,568 --> 00:08:28,961
that they were able to get out of the room if they needed.

112
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:30,920
He established an escape hatch.

113
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,272
That's a form of autonomy support that very well aligns with the principles

114
00:08:35,272 --> 00:08:38,270
of self determination we talked about previously.

115
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,237
That ends our session for today.

116
00:08:41,237 --> 00:08:45,406
We've demonstrated the different types of reflective listening and

117
00:08:45,406 --> 00:08:50,697
set us up to begin in future sessions to practice these skills.
