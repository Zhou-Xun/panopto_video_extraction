1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:18,450
And there were. All right.

2
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,470
Good morning, everybody. How's everybody doing?

3
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,020
So. So.

4
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:46,759
Okay, so the goal is to finish our MNC sites today and then we can have just more of a discussion on Thursday with regard to the meta analysis.

5
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,639
And then we'll do like a a case study together. I'm going to get I'm going to make myself a note,

6
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,360
get the rest of the assignments for the semester posted so you can at least see what we have coming up.

7
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,879
And just so you can have access, I don't want to stress you out with them.

8
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,620
They're you know, they're just a couple just low key things that we're going to do.

9
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:17,090
But I want to at least have those up hoping to get the first case study created and posted very soon.

10
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:25,520
Uh, let's see. What else? Oh, tomorrow the nutrition seminar is.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,030
It looks like a physician speaking about diet and heart failure.

12
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,830
I don't know if you guys are able to attend. It is via Zoom. I'm going to watch it just because that'll help.

13
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,880
We're going to do heart failure next week, which will be a recorded lecture for Thursday.

14
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:49,460
So you won't come in to class on Thursday, but I think that would be good in preparation for next week if you can attend.

15
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,530
If not, obviously, no worries. I'm going to attend and see what's kind of new on on that.

16
00:01:54,530 --> 00:02:01,219
And then. Yeah, so does anybody have questions, thoughts, concerns.

17
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:10,220
Yes. So the online lecture this Thursday, next Thursday, next Thursday, this Thursday, we will be here.

18
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,500
We'll do a more of a discussion. There won't be a lecture per se next week.

19
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,860
Thursday, the 17th will be asynchronous, so it'll be prerecorded for you.

20
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,910
Any other questions, thoughts or concerns for the day?

21
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:37,790
Okay. All right. So we left off talking about fiber and heart disease.

22
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,630
Pretty good data to support that link there.

23
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:50,900
Variety of mechanisms, one of which is the ability for soluble fiber, especially to kind of grab on to LDL cholesterol,

24
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:57,200
take it to the liver and and just, you know, excrete through the GI tract.

25
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,000
So that's kind of a wonderful, wonderful advantage of fiber.

26
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,939
So other things that may come up in the literature talk about science with with regard to this index.

27
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:17,089
So that would likely include the glycemic index of a diet can affect health in a variety of ways.

28
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:26,479
Have you looked at other ways that the this is kind of referred to in health in terms of blood sugar control, other disease risk.

29
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,990
So some studies suggest that a low glycemic index diet can help maintain weight loss,

30
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:40,490
whereas a high glycemic index diet increases risk of breast, prostate, colorectal and pancreatic cancer.

31
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,930
Potentially, we'll we'll talk about cancer in a couple of weeks.

32
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:55,370
But there are some studies that demonstrate a high glycemic index diet increases the risk for developing type two diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

33
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,690
So is the potential pathway to cardiovascular disease,

34
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:05,630
I would guess might be through that risk for type two diabetes, or at least definitely enhanced by that.

35
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,320
You guys know which types of foods are considered lower glycemic index.

36
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:18,160
We think about carbohydrate. More complex carbohydrates.

37
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:28,680
So whole grains, brown rice, whole wheat bread, oatmeal, these kind of fiber rich whole grains.

38
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:38,010
There's a lot more than that. But those that have a good source of fiber, other nutrients in it would be considered probably lower glycemic index.

39
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:48,220
So I think we still need some further studies that to. Really look at this relationship before we would actually recommend a specific

40
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,480
diet for our patients with cardiovascular disease or coronary heart disease.

41
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:03,450
Okay. So also, there's just a lot of discordant information out there.

42
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,800
So I want to talk about this first study. Has anybody heard of the peer study?

43
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,060
This is the prospective urban rural epidemiology study.

44
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:24,120
This came out a few days ago cause a lot of kind of buzz because it is a huge case cohort analysis, over 10,000 persons and it's over.

45
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:32,670
It spans many different countries and some of the conclusions that came out of the first few papers from this very large cohort.

46
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:49,390
Showed that actually higher meat intake was associated with less disease risk and carbohydrate intake was associated with more disease risk.

47
00:05:49,750 --> 00:06:01,030
So this caused some issues because the populations that they were looking at and then combining in the analysis were very heterogeneous.

48
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:09,430
So essentially a lot of the feedback that came when they looked into these studies was that those persons

49
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:15,160
that were consuming meat or had access to meat or had the ability to afford meat in these studies,

50
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:21,010
probably also had the ability to access and afford health care.

51
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:30,730
So there was more like a status of socioeconomic situations in those that were consuming carbohydrate as the primary source of the diet,

52
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,300
which a lot of times was like plain white rice was actually more of a marker of a low,

53
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,760
lower socioeconomic status or even situations of poverty, poverty.

54
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:50,610
So it was very confusing in how they grouped together the carbohydrate consumption.

55
00:06:50,620 --> 00:07:00,069
It concluded it included all forms of carbohydrate, so it didn't separate out vegetables and non-starchy vegetables, things like that.

56
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:06,700
It was just one big grouping. So this study is still referenced though, quite a bit.

57
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:15,100
So I think we have to be really careful with these very large global studies, which of course we want,

58
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:23,349
but comparing populations that are so widely different and then making one kind of big

59
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:29,350
conclusion based off of that that is supposed to be generalizable is potentially problematic.

60
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:41,320
So really the total carbohydrate was really oversimplified and maybe was more of a marker of socioeconomic status as opposed to.

61
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:52,260
Believe that the health status of the person. Has anyone seen the Netflix documentary What the Health?

62
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:00,280
What I've watched it to is now it's a couple of years old. What did you guys think of it?

63
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,940
Does anybody want to share what they're just talking about?

64
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:18,840
I know. Yeah. So they do talk about sugar, but they talk a lot about meat and protein.

65
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:25,659
So not even just red meat being really problematic and that carbohydrates really

66
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:32,290
aren't as bad and it's really the protein and the meat that are driving disease risk.

67
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:38,500
If you watch the documentary and we're all kind of well informed individuals,

68
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:44,470
it can be kind of convincing, I have to say, like the people they bring on as these health experts.

69
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:51,700
So I would say if it I think it's still on their watch it but it really explores the links

70
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,950
between the consumption of animal products and disease has come under fire by a lot of health

71
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:03,909
professionals because it is does make some really sensational claims and it's one of which is that

72
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:10,180
one serving of processed meat a day increases the risk of developing type two diabetes by 50%,

73
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,069
or that eating one egg a day is as bad as smoking is as bad as smoking.

74
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,920
Five Cigarets. So these are the types of things. But then they have, you know, physicians and these scientists come on.

75
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,850
So the makers of this documentary are promoters of a vegan lifestyle.

76
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:33,730
So have you seen Cowspiracy or heard of that? These are all little bit old, same kind of group.

77
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,650
So they have a point of view.

78
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:44,440
And again, with nutrition research, you can really cherry pick studies to support whatever point of view you're trying to sell.

79
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:50,290
So pretty effective if you watch it, although you might be thinking that doesn't seem right.

80
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:56,320
It's not right that it's very sensationalized and problematic.

81
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,200
But this was like a huge thing. People were all over this.

82
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:06,630
In the film, several nutrition experts downplay the role of sugar and health in health problems.

83
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,970
You know, that might have been what you they do have a whole section on that.

84
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:14,410
There was another one. Yeah, I got it. Okay.

85
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:21,430
So but this one, they do talk about sugar and instead shift the focus again to animal protein.

86
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:32,740
Ignoring the link between refined carbohydrates and diabetes and heart disease mischaracterizes how particular foods drive disease,

87
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,120
offering a narrow view of the science, again with very cherry picked studies.

88
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:46,359
So I would say, if you're ever interested aboard, check it out and see what you think and see if you find yourself like really.

89
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,599
And then kind of like step back. Like, now this is this is not okay, but this is where a lot of people get their information.

90
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,970
So it can be can be problematic for us as dietitians when we have really divergent

91
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:06,100
claims from really well-designed studies which have methodological problems,

92
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:11,110
and then also different things that are more like a sensationalized documentary.

93
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,600
All right, so let's talk about sugar sweetened beverages.

94
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:25,270
US data has demonstrated demonstrated association between sugar sweetened beverage intake and risk for heart disease.

95
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:30,820
So again, a lot of this data stems from that nurses health study and health professional follow ups.

96
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:37,060
So what's longitudinal cohorts looking at Americans, large population of adults?

97
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,710
So in women participating in the Nurses Health Study,

98
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:49,720
daily consumption of sugar sweetened beverages was significantly associated with increased increased incidence of coronary heart disease.

99
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:57,280
And in the kind of the component that was in males, the health professionals follow up study participants,

100
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:02,229
then the top quartile of sugar sweetened beverages take it up 20% higher relative

101
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:06,250
risk of coronary heart disease compared to those in the bottom quartile.

102
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:16,450
Adult surveys have shown that a reduction of simple carbohydrate intake, particularly in conjunction with weight loss and increased physical activity,

103
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:24,140
can also reduce triglyceride levels, which, again, whether that's an independent risk for cardiovascular disease.

104
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:30,070
Some think yes. Others aren't quite as convinced that that is as potent of a marker.

105
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,729
So clinical trial data has suggested that a reduction in consumption of sugar sweetened

106
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,770
beverages can significantly reduce blood pressure independent of weight gain.

107
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:48,879
So a lot of times we think of the problem with sugar sweetened beverages is that they play a role in the genesis of obesity,

108
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,610
which then kind of leads to these disease outcomes.

109
00:12:52,540 --> 00:13:00,480
So weight gain or weight change kind of is the mediating effect between sugar sweetened beverages and whatever outcome.

110
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,890
But some studies have really shown that there may be actually an independent link.

111
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:12,220
So regardless of any weight change, we're seeing some problems with with sugar sweetened beverages.

112
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:19,209
And then data from our Framingham Heart study has shown that individuals consuming one or

113
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:25,090
more servings of regular soda per day had an increased odds of impaired fasting glucose,

114
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:29,530
higher blood pressure, hypertriglyceridemia, hyper triglyceride,

115
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:35,940
triglyceride edema and low HDL, compared with those consuming less than one drink per day.

116
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:42,069
And that's when they adjusted for other factors because we think, well, this is if they're drinking,

117
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:50,590
sugar sweetened beverages are probably also doing other unhealthy behaviors that the brain data try to control for those.

118
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:56,860
And we can always control for those factors. But they saw that association when adjusting for other covariance.

119
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,500
Okay. So what about bread and processed meat? What have you guys heard?

120
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:19,310
With regard to the link with cardiovascular disease. Increase, increase, increase.

121
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:26,690
What do you think? Does it matter if it's just red meat or processed meat?

122
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:36,020
What if you're eating like a center cut lean piece of steak from a grass fed cow?

123
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:43,880
Does that have to carry the same risk as highly processed hot dogs?

124
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:51,379
Probably not. It's so initially, earlier studies, kind of group things together.

125
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:57,230
It was red and processed and there has been pretty consistent data to support

126
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,920
consumption of red and processed meat leads to increased risk of heart disease.

127
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:10,610
Studies. Now we're kind of separating them out. So they're looking at consumption of red meat, which can have nutrients of value.

128
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:19,890
Like what types of things what types of nutrients might you get from red beans and really good source of iron protein?

129
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,120
Some can have different fatty acid profiles that may be helpful.

130
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:32,730
Also, potentially high amounts of saturated fat, which is why these get why the studies get a little bit difficult to interpret.

131
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,550
So we have seen a greater intake of red meat has been associated with higher risks of

132
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:44,980
cardiovascular disease compared with populations that have very low consumption of red meat.

133
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:55,420
When we kind of separate them out, red and processed meat or red meat and then processed red meat, there have been divergent results.

134
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:02,360
So we see a pretty clear association between processed red meat and heart disease regardless of the outcome,

135
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:13,330
whether it's incidence of incidence of cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular disease events or mortality from cardiovascular disease.

136
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:21,830
So I want to talk a little bit about some of these meta analysis which we will look at.

137
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,160
So the data from the again, the nurses health study,

138
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:31,640
the health professionals follow up study has shown this link between red and processed meat with higher risks of CVD.

139
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,890
Then when we look at that analysis, that group, a lot of different studies together,

140
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:44,060
these have been less clear and that's why there's a lot of different data always coming out like red meat is okay.

141
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:52,669
Red meat's back or it's still bad. So a systematic review and meta analysis of 20 studies examining the relationship of

142
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:58,399
unprocessed and processed red meat as well as total meat consumption with incident,

143
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:07,340
coronary heart disease, stroke and diabetes found no association between incident coronary heart disease with unprocessed red meat,

144
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:12,080
whereas processed meat was associated with a 42% higher risk.

145
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:24,500
So it also again, it could be the outcomes that are studied. Those that group cardiovascular disease or red and processed meat together often show.

146
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,160
Often looking at mortality from cardiovascular disease.

147
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:39,620
And when they look at mortality, they do not see a difference between unprocessed and processed people see an increased risk of mortality.

148
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,499
But when we look at incident coronary heart disease,

149
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:51,770
like a heart attack or evidence of coronary heart disease with in terms of if maybe a patient has atherosclerosis,

150
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:57,380
that's where it helps to kind of separate them out between the unprocessed and processed.

151
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,809
So I would say stay tuned on this.

152
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:08,299
There may be more data to help us clear this up, but in general,

153
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:15,680
we still kind of consider red and processed meat to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

154
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:23,149
So I think until we have much better data to really separate that out and say that unprocessed red meat does not raise risk,

155
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:30,030
it's still kind of put together. All right.

156
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,960
So what about dairy? It is high in saturated fat, potentially.

157
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,630
We don't see a lot of input. If we look at the dietary guidelines are still a big emphasis on consuming low fat dairy.

158
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:52,630
And dairy is probably one of the more controversial food groups to discuss when talking about cardiovascular disease.

159
00:18:54,790 --> 00:19:01,270
So dairy contains saturated fat, but the health effects remain uncertain and I would say controversial.

160
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:12,280
So if we look at studies that look at full fat dairy consumption or saturated fat from dairy sources, it is not consistently linked to higher 66.

161
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:20,170
And anybody think of why that might be, we're just looking at high fat dairy.

162
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:24,190
So it is a big source of saturated fat diets of us adults.

163
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:39,050
Why may we not see this link consistently? What other types of nutrients to get from dairy.

164
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:47,320
It's a good source of protein here that we like to make sure.

165
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:54,760
Yeah, calcium. Yeah. We get minerals, we get live cultures that may help with the microbiome.

166
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,490
It's a good source of protein. So this might be one of those things where there is an overall net benefit.

167
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,110
So the calcium and the minerals, the good protein source,

168
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:14,470
potentially the live cultures kind of outweighs or limits the effects that we might see from the saturated fat.

169
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:25,000
So dairy fat not consistently linked to higher CDB risk and that's that's been found and it's not

170
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,030
consistently linked that's a consistent finding that they can't really look at it or find that association.

171
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:41,520
Okay. So we've talked a lot about like specific nutrients in terms of saturated fatty acids.

172
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,889
Recent epidemiological studies suggest that higher consumption of ultra processed

173
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:52,290
foods or these groups is associated with an increase of cardiovascular disease.

174
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,940
So how are ultra processed foods defined?

175
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,069
They're usually there's a variety of different definitions,

176
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:05,220
but they're made mostly from substances extracted from foods such as fats, starches, added sugars.

177
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:10,829
And they may also contain additives like artificial colors, flavors or stabilizers.

178
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,680
So the key is that they are also very low in nutrients.

179
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,629
So the Framingham Offspring Study found that each daily serving of ultra processed foods was associated

180
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:31,710
with a 7% increased risk of cardiovascular disease and a 9% increased risk of coronary heart disease,

181
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:40,690
specifically with a 5% increase in overall CVD and a 9% increased risk in cardiovascular disease mortality.

182
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,180
So they looked at a bunch of different outcomes. A lot of these percentages are similar.

183
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:55,750
So I think we might see a shift from just talking about saturated fat for percentage of calories

184
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:01,479
from saturated fat to really looking more so at these ultra processed foods that tend to contain

185
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:07,480
saturated fat but also are problematic because they often are high in refined carbohydrate

186
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,160
and very low in other nutrients and potentially high in things like sodium and preservatives.

187
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:18,280
So I would bet maybe that's the direction we'll kind of go in.

188
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,750
That may take a while, though, for the dietary guidelines to catch up with that.

189
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:30,060
Okay. So what about alcohol? With regards to cardiovascular disease.

190
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,380
So there's one chronic disease.

191
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:53,530
I think I can say this with this one chronic disease where we find that consuming alcohol compared to not consuming it is beneficial.

192
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:59,300
What is what is the one chronic disease? Yes.

193
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:13,250
That's not kidney disease. So drinking is potentially protective for heart disease.

194
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,640
It's the only one, every other chronic disease we look at.

195
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,790
Alcohol increases risk. So cancer, liver disease.

196
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:28,790
Although every other chronic disease, you probably find something in the literature.

197
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:35,930
But cardiovascular disease is the only one where we see this protective effect and we see it consistently so.

198
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:42,140
And this is moderate alcohol consumption, so consuming 1 to 2 drinks a day,

199
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:50,930
depending on if you're male or female compared to not drinking has this protective effect with cardiovascular disease.

200
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:57,310
Now, would we recommend people start drinking if they don't already know?

201
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:00,350
Probably not. There's other things they can do.

202
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:08,330
But epidemiological data does indicate that moderate alcohol intake has a protective effect, protective effect on heart disease.

203
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,440
And that is not shown in other chronic diseases like cancer and so on and so forth.

204
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:29,260
So what might what might go along with this if somebody has, like, a glass of red wine at dinner every night.

205
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:37,280
Yeah. Maybe that decreases stress in some people.

206
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,450
Could be. Maybe there is like a stress component. Maybe there is.

207
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:47,780
Yes. Maybe they're like sitting down to a meal and have access to fresh vegetables and other.

208
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,230
I feel like for people have it. That's why it's usually just like more homey feel.

209
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,830
Yeah. What else are they doing? They're taking time out of the day.

210
00:24:54,830 --> 00:25:00,370
Maybe to prepare a healthy meal at home, sit down with and socialize with other people.

211
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:06,200
Yeah. Being able to afford alcohol, being in a higher income bracket, probably.

212
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:10,880
Yeah. You're having a glass of red wine at night. You can afford to do that.

213
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:16,520
And you maybe go for better food, better access to health care.

214
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,349
I mean, all of these things kind of are potentially intertwined.

215
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:30,659
So although we always adjust for things in our studies, like we control for socioeconomic status, again, can we really control for those factors?

216
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,760
You know, we have like one measure. Maybe it's like median household income.

217
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,350
It doesn't tell us the whole story of what these people lives are like.

218
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:49,549
So this is interesting and there are definitely healthful properties and certain types of alcohol, especially red and white wine.

219
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:56,180
But it's really shown for. For any type of alcohol, we've seen that benefit.

220
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:02,490
So that's interesting. But again, we wouldn't recommend people start drinking for it to protect their heart.

221
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:12,120
Okay. So we'll just go through a couple of these other components, nuts.

222
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,260
I think we could add nuts and seeds here.

223
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:20,800
Consumption of nuts that are high in mono or polyunsaturated fatty acids may improve serum cholesterol levels,

224
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:31,660
especially if they're going to replace like refined carbohydrates or if they replace all processed red meat as a protein source.

225
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:37,240
So replacing saturated fat, that's probably going to develop.

226
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,520
So walnuts are particularly helpful. So that's one of the nice that's been studied.

227
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:48,759
More importantly, so a walnut rich diet, we have to look at how that is defined.

228
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:57,640
Maybe it's like an ounce of walnuts in randomized trials has correlated with reductions in total and LDL cholesterol.

229
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:02,500
Almonds may also lower total and LDL cholesterol.

230
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:11,440
And then we've seen similar effects with other nuts, but in particular pistachios, hazelnuts, pecans and macadamia nuts.

231
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:17,770
So again, usually these are going to be nuts that are high in monounsaturated fatty acids.

232
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:24,670
Polyunsaturated fatty acids, high in fiber walnuts are specifically high in omega three fatty acids as well.

233
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:29,920
So it gives you some benefit there. So you may see one that's missing.

234
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:40,540
Peanuts are not on there. Maybe because we consider peanuts a living room, but that's a good one.

235
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:46,809
There are some things like consumption, diet, no cashews,

236
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:57,100
so I don't know why maybe that hasn't been looked at or I'm not sure what the fatty acid profile of cashews are, but those are not on this list.

237
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:06,190
Okay. So what about soy? What do you guys think of?

238
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,809
I always like to. I mean, my patients, the food allergy world.

239
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:15,010
Yes, soy is a top allergen, but a lot of my patients can't have dairy.

240
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:19,270
So sometimes soy is alternative. Parents do not like soy.

241
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:24,040
They do not want their children on soy. What do all of you think about soy?

242
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:35,620
Yeah. So you're here?

243
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,200
Yeah. So I. Okay, so maybe.

244
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:47,720
Sure. Does it matter if it's, like, ultra processed or processed or.

245
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,780
I just know, like, I'd like to person. Okay.

246
00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:04,530
You can write about it too, but it's not the same as after that.

247
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,440
Sure. So digestibility not compatible?

248
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:18,860
Yeah. For a while, there were a lot of studies that, like soy could cause diabetes and all these different things,

249
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,490
especially infants who needed alternative options.

250
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:27,929
So parents are and I know my mom was for a while, too, like, it can mess with your hormones.

251
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:31,309
They say it can cause an imbalance.

252
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:35,750
And what is it like your growth?

253
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:41,930
Yep. Yeah. So they were pretty against it. But a lot more studies have come out saying that that's not true.

254
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:50,530
Yes, that's it. I mean, in terms of my world, that is what I hear is the soy is estrogen.

255
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:54,440
That's how it gets amplified, promotes early onset puberty.

256
00:29:55,370 --> 00:30:03,200
That is not true. But that's there is this kind of soy has been demonized, I think, quite a bit.

257
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:10,790
But soy is an excellent source of protein. It contains isoflavones, which is not necessarily a bad thing.

258
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:15,490
But that's what that's where a lot of this this jargon comes from.

259
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:23,480
So those are phytoestrogens. So they kind of can mimic estrogen in a sense, but doesn't do the same play the same role.

260
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:34,100
So Isoflavones have some properties that are similar to estrogen and may have a small effect on cholesterol levels and inhibition of LPL oxidation.

261
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:43,460
Right? So if we look at the effect of soy consumption alone, it is modest and it may produce a meaningful reduction in total and LDL cholesterol.

262
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:48,220
Most often when combined in the diet with other cholesterol lowering food.

263
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:56,719
So where we really see the benefit with regard to heart disease is when substituting when substituting for animal derived foods,

264
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:05,320
many soy foods and food products are likely to have beneficial effects on lipids and cardiovascular health because they are lower in saturated fats,

265
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,900
high in on saturated fat, and often rich in fiber.

266
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:17,090
So when replacing an animal products that is higher in saturated fat is really where we see the benefit of soy.

267
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:25,810
Yeah, two other places, but the plant or the phytoestrogens.

268
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:31,540
And I'm still kind of confused that the other other foods have these two that are like

269
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:38,460
demonized or does the meat does meat also have like hormones if they're animals?

270
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:48,490
I don't know. Yeah. So the final estrogen, the isoflavones and soy, I think there's like a higher, more measurable amount.

271
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:57,280
I'm sure there are levels in many plant foods especially, but the effect from soy has been studied more closely.

272
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:05,290
So I think that's why we have that information out there and how it's been twisted now that it acts as estrogen.

273
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,310
And that is not true.

274
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:15,700
There was an, I think, something on like soy intake and breast cancer, so especially the breast cancers that are hormone related.

275
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,850
There was a big campaign many years ago to like not eat.

276
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:30,879
So I'd say with increased risk of breast cancer, are these estrogen related breast cancers that's really been found not to be the case.

277
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,190
So most people can safely eat moderate amounts of soy without any problem.

278
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:41,710
And even populations that have very high soy intake tend to have the lowest risk of breast cancer.

279
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:56,260
But again, so lots of misinformation. You see, like milk and meat products, like not treated with certain products that can enhance like the hormones.

280
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:02,400
A lot of that hasn't been linked to like heart disease outcomes humans.

281
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:08,230
But it is a marketing point like we don't treat our cattle with this hormone.

282
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,040
It's it's it's very confusing, though, and a lot of people really latch on to some of that information.

283
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:21,280
Okay. So who has heard of plant sterols and Stanleys?

284
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,970
All right, a couple of you, but you've probably seen a little bit.

285
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:36,700
Have you seen these products? Have you ever wondered like, why are they saying this orange juice is good for our health?

286
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:42,940
Because they've looked into it. Or are you just like, Oh, that's weird that they're like marketing this?

287
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,780
Or why these tough margarines are promoting heart health.

288
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:53,780
It's because they've added these plant sterols and panels for plants.

289
00:33:53,780 --> 00:34:00,310
Spirals are similar in chemical structure to cholesterol differing in their sidechain configuration.

290
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:06,820
So the mechanism by which they lower cholesterol is thought to involve the inhibition of cholesterol absorption.

291
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:14,979
Therefore, these things are added to foods to help promote cholesterol lowering properties.

292
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:19,780
So any foods with plant cereals and channels may lower LDL cholesterol.

293
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:24,459
So you really get the benefit and we'll talk about who benefits from this.

294
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:29,320
We don't want to just make a broad up. I don't want you all to start eating these products.

295
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,070
But persons should have two grams of plant sales, six year olds every day.

296
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:39,279
It, for the most benefit have these foods at meal times or with other foods.

297
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,840
So when eaten with other foods, that's where we see the benefit.

298
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:48,639
So I think that's why sometimes they put them in these tub margins because you're likely to eat that

299
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:55,060
with other foods and they're a little bit more stable in that that form with the with the fat there.

300
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,520
Okay. So ways to add cereals and samples to the eating plan.

301
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:06,660
So this would be if we were talking to a patient that was appropriate to be on these two grams a day,

302
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:11,920
so would be about 2 to 3 tablespoons of margin spread with the certified fats.

303
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:20,110
So Seeds seems a little counterintuitive to be promoting a high fat product.

304
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:27,100
But again, these are going to be primarily polyunsaturated fatty acids that then have these plants added.

305
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,170
They can also drink two cups of orange juice fortified with plant sterols.

306
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,929
Again, a lot of sugar content, excess calories from orange juice as well.

307
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:45,219
But there could be a net benefit with that with these plants sterols or foods fortified with these, for example,

308
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:52,000
they could have yogurt that has the plant sterols, the orange juice and the tablespoon of margarine.

309
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:59,380
So to kind of balance it out, so there's lots of different products out there that have these products added to them.

310
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:05,820
Yeah. He said it when you have a chance and all that helps.

311
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:20,310
It helps block the absorption. It kind of mimics how cholesterol works and therefore it's like inhibits the absorption of dietary cholesterol.

312
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,970
Yeah. And they're not naturally occurring in foods.

313
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:30,390
They are. So some do have them naturally, but probably not enough to get to this like to grow.

314
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:41,500
Okay. So this is just an advisory statement from the Nutrition Committee of the American Heart Association.

315
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:48,100
They concluded that all food, although foods containing these plant sterols and scales,

316
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:55,120
are promising additions to dietary intervention aimed at improving cardiovascular risk profiles.

317
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:59,060
These products should not be used routinely by the general population.

318
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,860
So it's not like all of us should just start consuming these.

319
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:08,890
We don't have enough long term studies to ensure that there's an absence of other adverse effects.

320
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:14,170
So there you should be reserved for adults with hypercholesterolemia or those that

321
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:18,970
have had an after sclerotic event would require lowering of total and LDL levels.

322
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:26,590
So if somebody is prescribed a diet or more specifically lower total LDL levels,

323
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:30,100
they would be the type of person that maybe this would be recommended that.

324
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:38,070
We don't really have enough data to really just have that broad kind of population level use of these products.

325
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,480
So keep an eye out.

326
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:47,910
See if you see other types of things that have these ADD that it may not just be limited to some of those products that I've listed.

327
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:58,090
Okay. So what about fish oil supplements? This data is is interesting.

328
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:05,200
And there always seems to be like a new study that's come out either showing a benefit or maybe no benefit.

329
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:15,820
So that analysis, including seven trials of 662 participants who took either krill oil or probably just placebo.

330
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:23,680
They did find that krill oil supplementation lowered LDL and triglycerides and increased HDL levels.

331
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,170
Compared to a meta analysis. This was looking at 28 trials.

332
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:36,820
The consumption of flax seeds reduced total and LDL cholesterol with no effect on triglycerides and HDL.

333
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,470
So the kind of the plant,

334
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:47,979
the richest plant form of omega three fatty acids could be flax seeds or also algae supplements that may do something similar,

335
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:52,270
but we don't see quite the same effect in these different analysis.

336
00:38:53,890 --> 00:39:00,670
So fish oil supplements are a little bit easier to study compared to like fish intake, right?

337
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:06,190
Because we can just randomize certain people to take the supplement, other folks to not take the supplement.

338
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:17,469
And so usually when there's like a trial that has a vitamin supplement or a medication, we can get pretty good data there for a lot of things.

339
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:26,080
Of course, not everything. So usually that's why we we can get a little bit better conclusions with like something like fish oil supplements.

340
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:37,180
However, this came out a couple of years ago. This was a meta analysis of ten trials and you can see the sample size here was 78,000

341
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:43,300
individuals looking at omega three fatty acid supplement with cardiovascular disease risk.

342
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,990
It's really small. But if we look at the findings,

343
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:57,429
this meta analysis of ten trials with all these participants demonstrated that supplementation with marine derived omega three fatty acids for an

344
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:07,000
average of 4.4 years had no significant association with reductions in fatal or non-fatal coronary heart disease or any major vascular events.

345
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:16,120
So think about the outcomes there. Sometimes we'll look at either blood lipid levels and this is actually looking at hard cardiovascular outcomes.

346
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:25,360
Yeah, so I know that they say, but there are no other sources, good sources of omega threes.

347
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:35,740
So even with supplementing with fish oil, it's like it may not reduce the risk, but there are other benefits.

348
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:39,340
Exactly. Okay. Yeah, there could be benefits to this.

349
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:43,000
And for four years, all of that sounds long.

350
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:51,790
The outcomes are looking at is fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease or any of these are vascular events.

351
00:40:52,390 --> 00:41:01,330
Four years is short. Like really if we're looking for like an actual cardiovascular event, that may not be enough time to really detect that.

352
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:07,900
So always look at what outcome they looked at in how long.

353
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,200
And there may also be other benefits that we see.

354
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:15,220
Maybe that we do see these differences in blood lipid levels,

355
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:21,340
but it takes longer to really see the total benefit of that in terms of these heart outcomes.

356
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:33,340
What do you guys think? As future nutrition professionals, should we recommend fish oil supplements versus eating fish versus something else?

357
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:40,670
What else can we consider here? Yeah.

358
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:50,960
I just feel like. I guess some people don't like it, but yes,

359
00:41:50,960 --> 00:42:00,140
it's really good source of protein minerals in addition to the omega three fatty acids to get enough of the EPA inventory.

360
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:03,170
Sometimes this is an easier way to do it.

361
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:13,190
There can be side effects with control supplements. What else is there?

362
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:21,290
I guess they're kind of looking at like, what is the reason for supplementation if you're giving it to the diet, I guess, right?

363
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:34,730
Yeah. So with this being the DHEA, you know, this might be best for someone that doesn't like fish but is at higher heart risk.

364
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:42,319
Also concerns with sustainability, if likely, if all of us increase our fish consumption,

365
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:47,360
our consumption of fish oil supplements, that is actually problematic.

366
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,549
People are some people are worried about that.

367
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:56,180
And I tend to think it's dietitians that is within our scope to talk about more sustainable eating practices.

368
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:02,209
Other scientific communities don't think that's within her skull that we even need to go there.

369
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:10,190
But our patients want that information. So how to get these nutrients in a more sustainable way?

370
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:18,469
There are different fish and seafood products that are less harmful to the ocean environment, but sometimes that can be difficult.

371
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:26,690
Like mussels, for instance, are very rich sources of omega three fatty acids and can be really sustainably harvested.

372
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:31,190
But are people going to prepare and eat mussels three times a week?

373
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:40,100
I mean, probably not. It's a really tough and a dilemma in terms of looking at the data between fish, fish oil supplements.

374
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:46,850
What is the benefit and then what is the potential harm in terms of environmental risk?

375
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,010
Yeah. Who is this done in the American population?

376
00:43:52,010 --> 00:44:00,160
Well, we don't see as much as other groups of different ethnic groups eat more fish.

377
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:08,750
Yeah. So I guess that would be interesting to compare, like our fish consumption to theirs when fish is more consistent in their diet than it is in.

378
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:18,230
Oh yeah. And I'm not sure where these studies were were taken from probably a combination if it was ten trials.

379
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:26,900
But if they are predominantly U.S. trials, that would be good to know because we don't have as high a fish consumption as other countries.

380
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:32,569
Yeah, so I don't really know what to tell you.

381
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:44,390
With regard to fish oil supplements. I think it could be appropriate for some individuals, but is it routinely recommended?

382
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:50,540
So no, I can't say. I'd have to ask some of my colleagues how often they're actually specifically,

383
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:57,410
we're recommending their patients start on fish oil versus eating more fish versus other interventions.

384
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:06,690
All right. Let's take a look at some dietary patterns. So we've looked at nutrients, looked at different foods in food groups.

385
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,150
Let's look at dietary patterns in general. Okay.

386
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:17,400
So we hear a lot about the Mediterranean diet. There really is no single Mediterranean diet.

387
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:23,100
But typically when we refer to a mediterranean diet, it is high in fruits and vegetables.

388
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:29,610
Whole grains, beans, nuts and seeds includes a lot of olive oil as an important source of fat,

389
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:37,440
typically has low to moderate amounts of fish, poultry and dairy products, and it has low amounts of red meat.

390
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:44,399
So the Mediterranean diet may lower total cholesterol and decrease LDL oxidation,

391
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,140
which again is that kind of key component of that atherosclerotic process.

392
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,890
And it has been associated with lower rates of heart disease.

393
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:57,660
So while the Mediterranean diet does appear to reduce risk of cardiovascular events,

394
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:06,990
it's uncertain whether the cardiovascular benefits are due to these lipid effects or other factors, which we'll talk about.

395
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:15,240
So do we see this lower risk because of this lowering of total and LDL cholesterol or LDL oxidation?

396
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:23,850
That really is not clear. Observational studies have consistently shown that individuals consuming diets high in vegetables

397
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:29,490
and fruits similar to the Mediterranean diet do have a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.

398
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:34,230
There may be benefits to the specific compounds in fruits and vegetables.

399
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:40,810
It's also likely that people that eat more fruits and vegetables tend to eat less red meat and less saturated fat.

400
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:45,000
So kind of like a combination. What foods are replacing those?

401
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:49,010
Now, if you have high amounts of this, what are you then consuming less of?

402
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:54,390
It's all things we have to consider. That's why looking at dietary patterns is particularly helpful.

403
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:03,540
Okay, so in cross-cultural studies, Mediterranean populations that consume high amounts of monounsaturated fats from

404
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:09,150
extra virgin olive oil and nuts appear to be more protected against heart disease.

405
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:15,210
So what else do they have in their diet? We just talked about. But what else?

406
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:22,260
People in these regions where we see this offensive, what else do they have in their diet and what else may they do?

407
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:33,060
Some of these things we've talked about, yeah, whole grains, fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds.

408
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:38,910
Maybe they eat more fish than we tend to do. What else?

409
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:39,930
Maybe this is that.

410
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:50,080
That those diets in populations that tend to have a glass of red wine and thinner tend to walk to the market every day, buy their food fresh.

411
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:57,240
We don't really do that here. We don't have a really walkable country and a lot of fiber.

412
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:03,870
Fiber intake. Yep, definitely. I tend to stay in the element of kind of the valley, I think.

413
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:13,350
Yeah. Like if meal times in let's let's just take like certain European countries like.

414
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:21,059
People go home for lunch, right? They walk home, they get like 2 hours to do lunch and then they go back to work.

415
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:24,870
And it's like a social kind of event with family.

416
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:30,090
You know, this is oversimplifying. Of course, not everybody can do this, but it's like you go home,

417
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:35,850
you get your vegetables fresh, you sit down, enjoy a meal, and then you go back to work.

418
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:44,969
Or sometimes it's like they take a nap before. So there's all these different things that have to do with like the social aspects of living,

419
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:49,200
the community, the stress, just the walking, the movement.

420
00:48:50,790 --> 00:49:03,940
That's really not how our country tends to be a little bit more fast paced, more of a live work type of environment as opposed to work to live.

421
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:12,900
So it's there's all these different aspects that are are features of this type of diet and I would say more of like a lifestyle type of pattern.

422
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:28,800
Okay. Has anybody heard of the premed study, which was a big randomized controlled diet intervention study?

423
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:33,310
And this was kind of like the Darling Dietary Study of the New England Journal of Medicine.

424
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:40,170
So this was a partially randomized trial evaluating that hypothesis that demonstrated that extra virgin olive oil

425
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:48,120
and mixed nuts in combination with the traditional Mediterranean type diet reduced the risk of a composite outcome.

426
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,160
So it looked at heart attack, stroke and death.

427
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:59,999
So this diet, people that were randomized to this diet, that they were given a certain amount of olive oil to consume, they were given mixed nuts.

428
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:08,100
And then in general, they were kind of in this Mediterranean pattern, saw a 30% reduced risk of heart attack, stroke and death.

429
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:13,050
That's a huge reduction from a dietary intervention.

430
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:21,239
So this was like a really groundbreaking study in terms of how we can do a randomized

431
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:27,000
controlled trial with dietary of randomizing people's diet was not perfect.

432
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,050
It was retracted a couple of years ago because there was some issues with the methodology.

433
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:43,110
The authors claim that those issues did not change the outcomes, but for the New England Journal, to retract this study was a pretty big deal.

434
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:47,939
So some argue that we can still look at those conclusions as valid,

435
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:56,070
but there were some potential problems with how they randomized people and who they gave that olive oil and the nuts to.

436
00:50:57,090 --> 00:51:01,139
So really interesting. If you like nutritional epidemiology, maybe you don't.

437
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:04,980
But look into that. That was like a big deal to have that study retracted.

438
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:15,330
Okay. So the what I would like to say about the Mediterranean diet is that any one nutrient doesn't capture the essence of a high quality diet.

439
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:20,370
And we'll discuss what we think as nutrition professionals, what we should be studying.

440
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:27,270
Should we be looking at single nutrients? Should we be looking at foods to look for dietary patterns?

441
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:33,740
What makes the most sense? Okay.

442
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:39,030
Have you guys all heard of the Dash diet? We're going to talk about the dash diet next week because it is.

443
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:47,309
Dietary approaches to stop hypertension. But we actually use the dash diet or the pattern dietary pattern a lot.

444
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:57,719
So not just for people with high blood pressure. The dash diet is essentially rich in fruits and vegetables, high in fiber, moderate and low or not,

445
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:03,060
but dairy products, low in animal protein, low in saturated fat and low in sugar.

446
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,170
So very similar to the Mediterranean diet or pattern.

447
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:15,570
But as we'll break this down next week, on Tuesday to see why it's so different from like just a regular healthful diet,

448
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,490
it contains sources of protein primarily from within.

449
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:27,299
So it says it has been shown to be safe, total and LDL cholesterol also lowers HDL cholesterol.

450
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,750
So that's important to note there. Okay.

451
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:38,940
So we'll stay tuned on the Dash diet, but we use that dietary pattern broadly, I'd say, in the field of nutrition.

452
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:45,080
Okay. What about a vegetarian diet? So essentially a diet.

453
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:50,780
There are different types of vegetarian diets, but it's really a diet that excludes animal flesh.

454
00:52:50,780 --> 00:53:00,060
And then from there, there's different variations. So these vegetarian diets may improve serum lipid profiles.

455
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:09,089
As an example, in a meta analysis of 11 trials comparing meat restricted with omnivorous diets following a vegetarian diet,

456
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:13,590
lowered total LDL cholesterol as well as HDL cholesterol.

457
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:18,840
So similar to that that dash effect with no reduction in serum triglycerides,

458
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:26,639
a modified vegetarian dietary pattern that includes the addition of for cholesterol lowering foods.

459
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:36,390
So plant Stanleys soluble fiber nuts in soy protein may have a larger effect on individuals when they have hyperlipidemia to begin with.

460
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:47,969
So there was a meta analysis of seven randomized trials in, for example, those following that modified dietary pattern I just spoke up for four weeks,

461
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:53,550
had lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides compared to those following this,

462
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:58,200
a diet which is referred to as the National Cholesterol Education Project Diet.

463
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:07,890
So that diet is limits of saturated fat to less than 7% of total calories and limits cholesterol.

464
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:18,749
So the modified dietary or vegetarian diet that had plant Stanley's table fiber nuts and soy protein in addition to a vegetarian lifestyle,

465
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:27,960
was more effective than this kind of what we call this MCP step two diet, which is really restricted on saturated fat and cholesterol.

466
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:38,850
So interesting. And these are can be difficult to study, but we do see an improvement in their lipid profiles.

467
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:46,010
But there also may be health benefits beyond that, of course. All right.

468
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:53,600
So what about low carbohydrate diet? A low carbohydrate diet, of course, varies in the quantity and type of carbohydrates.

469
00:54:53,600 --> 00:55:02,690
But in general, when we think of like a low carbohydrate diet, typically studies, that means that it's 130 grams or less per day.

470
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:13,070
Other studies may define it as less than 100 grams per day, and then very low carbohydrate diet would be less than 60 grams per day.

471
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:23,790
So anybody study the keto diet? Is that that's like less than 30 grams, is it 25 grams?

472
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:31,630
So you can lower that. So these are pretty popular for a lot of people.

473
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:41,860
And low carbohydrate diets may have a beneficial effect on serum lipids, although we think that the effect we see is mediated by what?

474
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:46,750
What do people often why do people often go on a low carbohydrate diet?

475
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:51,400
Weight loss so is affected in weight loss for some people.

476
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:58,389
And that might be kind of help explain the effect we see on blood glucose levels.

477
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:05,770
So whenever I see something, maybe it's that relationship we have like our puzzle pathway of diet and disease.

478
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:10,659
The mediator is on that on the way with that pathway.

479
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:17,110
So we have the diet that benefits weight loss or weight, which then has the impact on the outcome.

480
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:20,080
So it kind of helps explain that relationship.

481
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:29,110
So we think that low carb are some of the benefit we see with regard to blood lipids is in part due to the weight loss that people experience.

482
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:39,010
So in a randomized trial, comparing three dietary patterns to one that was low in fat, a mediterranean diet in a low carbohydrate diet.

483
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:42,460
So those are our three dietary patterns in the trial.

484
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:46,180
This was in 300 adults that were overweight or obese.

485
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:54,399
Weight loss and increased HDL cholesterol occurred occurred in all three groups at two years with

486
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:59,740
the largest weight loss and HDL cholesterol increasing among those with the low carbohydrate diet.

487
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:06,790
So two years is a pretty good that's pretty good. That can be considered long term.

488
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:13,570
So that's an interesting finding that that might have been the most beneficial in

489
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:18,070
terms of the amount of weight loss and the degree to which the HDL increased.

490
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:24,520
So those on the Mediterranean and low carbohydrate diet also had the largest reduction in triglycerides.

491
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:35,710
What do you guys think? Or maybe you don't have thoughts on it, but what is the potential problem with the low carbohydrate diet?

492
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:42,510
Yeah. Not getting potentially not getting enough fiber.

493
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:48,299
A lot of people, if they're especially if they're doing a ketogenic diet, don't they?

494
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:56,790
Just very hesitant to eat any fruit. And they're very selective with the types of vegetables to avoid getting to that carbohydrate level.

495
00:57:56,790 --> 00:58:05,410
So that can affect fiber intake. Yeah, well, your ultimate goal is ketosis, but most people don't understand that.

496
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:12,760
But it can cause other problems like. Can lead to others really severe complications.

497
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:20,059
Yeah, I think the very low carbohydrate diets are effective for some weight loss,

498
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:27,520
so like jumpstarting weight loss can have a pretty profound effect on blood sugar levels if they're diabetic.

499
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:34,290
What about long term sustainability? Has anyone done like a low carb diet?

500
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:42,040
You don't say it's what that will have for what's hard, right?

501
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:53,679
Like it's really hard to stay on. And so I think there may be there may be a place for these diets to maybe jumpstart weight loss,

502
00:58:53,680 --> 00:59:00,850
especially in our population that maybe tried other things and just can't really see results.

503
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:05,679
Like some people really need to see that something is working in order to get motivated.

504
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:13,180
So this can work for some people. I'd say the sustainability is difficult and we don't have a ton of long term studies

505
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:18,459
looking at potential adverse outcomes associated with very low carbohydrate diet.

506
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:22,690
So we'll probably see more of that because they are more popular now.

507
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:32,440
So we might get more data. So yeah, there are some potentially promising health effects, but again,

508
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:39,430
I always worry about long term sustainability and I really hate taking out any one food group.

509
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:44,970
I think that's really, again, just really difficult to maintain.

510
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:49,350
So like something like a very low carbohydrate diet, paleo diet.

511
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:53,830
What's the Whole30 like when you're really removing entire food groups?

512
00:59:55,420 --> 01:00:01,480
It's really hard to stay on that. And I, I think I don't love recommending people to do that.

513
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:13,160
Okay. So let's look at general recommendations. So this is not for people with increased risk or those that have cardiovascular disease.

514
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:17,120
This is just kind of the general population. We'll see what we think about this.

515
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:22,219
So for patients who do not require special diets for existing diseases,

516
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:28,340
it is reasonable to suggest that patients do not focus on trying to restrict total fat intake.

517
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:35,320
Do we agree with that? I think that's probably fair, right?

518
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:42,340
We have pretty good evidence that, you know, we can kind of raise that limit on just focusing on total fact.

519
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:52,000
Instead increased consumption of minimally processed, bioactive rich foods like fruits, nuts, seeds, vegetables, legumes,

520
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:00,190
whole grain products, plant oils, yogurt and seafood, which are linked to lower risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity.

521
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:06,910
Reduced consumption of processed meats and carbohydrate rich foods, high in refined starch,

522
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:14,170
added sugars, trans fats, which really shouldn't be a problem in this country or sodium.

523
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,970
We'll get into sodium next week.

524
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:25,739
Cheese, milk, eggs, poultry and unprocessed red meats may be added in moderation when fats are needed for cooking spreads,

525
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:32,639
sauces, dressings and other uses. We do have pretty good evidence to support the use of plant oils from fruits,

526
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:40,320
seeds and nuts with high amounts of metal and polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially omega three fatty acids.

527
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:43,710
But also those omega six are pretty beneficial as well.

528
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:49,920
So choose foods rich in healthy fats, including nuts, seeds, avocados and fish.

529
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:59,129
So this is kind of like pretty basic general information, like choose Whole Foods to save healthy fats.

530
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:06,150
So sometimes the most boring advice really is the most sound, especially when we're talking about nutrition.

531
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:11,730
Okay, so this is the different fat content of oils.

532
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:22,410
This is an older study, but interesting to look at the different cooking oils that we tend to use both in cooking and then in food processing.

533
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:32,070
You can see the different fatty acids components. So something like olive oil, if you have a good olive oil and you put it in the refrigerator,

534
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:38,490
if somebody's done that or if you have a dressing made with olive oil that's in the refrigerator, what do you see?

535
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:44,370
Yeah, if you get the salad, it doesn't stay like liquid.

536
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:52,680
So that's probably do you know, olive oil does have saturated fat in it, but it also has an abundance of these other fats as well.

537
01:02:55,020 --> 01:03:00,990
So you can see here the ones that will tend to have higher amounts of our polyunsaturated fatty acids.

538
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:14,120
Okay. So again, general recommendations. This is really from the dietary guidelines.

539
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:19,980
So the guidelines advisory committee. So the group the group of experts that then.

540
01:03:21,610 --> 01:03:25,570
Recommend what they think should be put in the guidelines every five years.

541
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:34,480
The report, they recommended no upper limit for total dietary fat in 2015 and then the 2020 cycle did not review that.

542
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:43,830
So the 2020 report emphasized the importance of quality and types of fat and food sources as reflected in the following advice.

543
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:48,700
So still, we have this recommendation for our percentage of calories from saturated fat,

544
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:59,260
so consume less than 10% of calories from saturated fat by replacing them with polyunsaturated fats and only limited evidence.

545
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:02,680
Support of replacing saturated fat with monounsaturated fats.

546
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:06,880
Replacing saturated fat carbohydrate is not recommended.

547
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:13,330
So what happens if we replace saturated fat with refined carbohydrates?

548
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:21,280
We may see a reduction in LDL, but we do not see a decreased risk in heart disease.

549
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,340
And in fact, some states report reported actual increased risk.

550
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:28,650
So the idea is not to replace saturated fat with refined carbohydrates.

551
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:36,370
Even if we see a reduction in LDL, eat little to no trans fats, reduce the intake of calories from solid fats.

552
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:43,209
So kind of getting more into specifics, focusing on foods and people eat foods.

553
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:47,350
That's how they kind of understand this information a little bit better.

554
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:53,469
So reduce intake of calories from cell phone, use plant oils to replace the solid fats,

555
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:58,060
where possible, replace protein foods that are higher in solid fats.

556
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:05,980
So red and processed meats with choices that are lower in solid fats and calories and or our source sources of plant based oils.

557
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:13,630
So these could be seafood, legumes, nuts, seeds, plant oils, soy products, as well as other lean meats and poultry.

558
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:23,100
Okay. So sometimes it's helpful to maybe just make risk based recommendations for our patients.

559
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:29,160
Sometimes this is the better way to go than being totally overwhelming with like trying

560
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:34,890
to instill a dietary pattern on people to give them maybe some places to start.

561
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:41,530
So for individuals with elevated LDL cholesterol and this is this is from up to date,

562
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:48,930
this is kind of like a general consensus of of what the medical community would recommend.

563
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,740
So this is different than like the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

564
01:05:52,740 --> 01:06:03,660
But for individuals with elevated LDL, we advise a reduction in saturated fat and total caloric intake for those with isolated high triglycerides.

565
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:07,680
We advise the low carbohydrate diet to reduce total intake.

566
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:13,950
And for patients who are overweight with elevated triglycerides and or low HDL.

567
01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:20,100
And for patients with prediabetes and fatty liver disease, we typically advise a mediterranean diet.

568
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:25,590
So we use the Mediterranean diet for a whole variety of things.

569
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:32,639
And that is the dietary pattern we recommend for folks with liver disease.

570
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,860
We'll talk about that extensively next semester.

571
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:44,940
So that dietary pattern really applies to potentially a lot of health conditions and just general healthy diet guidance kind of use that.

572
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:55,259
Okay. So now this is more of like what the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics

573
01:06:55,260 --> 01:07:00,810
will recommend and put in our patient education for for heart disease.

574
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:05,550
So this is called the therapeutic lifestyle changes dietary pattern.

575
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:13,950
So TLC diet. And this is the currently accepted nutrition therapy for the prevention of atherosclerosis.

576
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:18,640
And this was developed by a component of the adult treatment panel.

577
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:24,450
So ATB three is something we'll refer to. This is talking about prevention of atherosclerosis.

578
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:30,120
So these are their diet dietary recommendations. So we'll talk about these.

579
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:39,270
So total fat limited to 25 to 35% of total calories, trans fat, zero or as little as possible.

580
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:50,220
Saturated fat, less than 7% of calories. Polyunsaturated fatty acids up to 10% with monounsaturated fatty acids up to 20% of calories.

581
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,220
Carbohydrates 50 to 60%.

582
01:07:53,640 --> 01:08:05,330
Soluble fiber at least 5 to 10 grams per day, with a goal for total fiber to be between 20 and 30 grams protein, approximately 15% of calories.

583
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:09,239
Cholesterol less than 200 milligrams a day. Okay.

584
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:14,820
So let's talk about this. What seems outdated or what would you change?

585
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:24,990
Because this is kind of what we use. Like this is very macro based percentage of calories from different nutrients.

586
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:32,160
This can be very foreign to people for us suggested this is what they should do.

587
01:08:32,190 --> 01:08:36,000
So what would you guys change on this? Yeah.

588
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:49,350
Like not recommend recommend this much probably unsaturated fats because yeah, we don't eat nutrients.

589
01:08:49,350 --> 01:08:53,480
We eat foods that contain nutrients. Like, I really hate this.

590
01:08:53,530 --> 01:09:00,710
Like, this is like, you know, this is what we're encourage society to give to our patients.

591
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:04,410
So I don't even know what that looks like.

592
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:11,520
10% of calories. It is definitely accurate from what we talked about today.

593
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:18,930
Now, unsaturated fatty acids really are shown to have as much of a benefit as polyunsaturated fats.

594
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:26,909
We'll talk about that. Why that might be more on a Thursday would be the type of foods that have saturated fats that we consume.

595
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:31,710
But this is a little bit outdated. This is possibly outdated.

596
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:41,459
This is still really held on to. So the 7% of calories or less saturated fat is a pretty broad is not broad.

597
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:50,730
But that is so widely accepted and recommended also that I would say that may change for purposes of this class.

598
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:58,110
That still is a pretty, pretty common recommendation for heart disease prevention and also treatment.

599
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:08,819
So I agree like shifting trying to translate this more into like foods or like the dietary pattern is the challenge.

600
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:13,140
And that's what I would encourage you to think about as opposed to just these, you know,

601
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:18,330
percentage of calories from such and such nutrients that can be really difficult to do.

602
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:32,100
Okay. So this again is a summary of the nutritional impact of from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Evidence Analysis Library.

603
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:45,360
This is looking at disorders of lipid metabolism. So a cardioprotective dietary pattern can lower LDL cholesterol by 9% to 16% in

604
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:52,590
both people that have normal blood sugar levels and or hyperlipidemia individuals.

605
01:10:53,100 --> 01:11:04,230
And so it can decrease risk for heart disease. So this cardioprotective dietary pattern, the one we just looked at, can lower LDL by 90 to 60%.

606
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:10,860
Plant sterols and channels in the recommended doses can lower total cholesterol by 4 to 11%.

607
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:15,780
LDL cholesterol by this should be 7.5 to 15%.

608
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:20,610
And then beyond that three grams per day, there hasn't been shown to be an additional benefit.

609
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:31,110
So a diet high in total and soluble fiber can reduce total cholesterol by 2% and LDL cholesterol by up to 7%.

610
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:42,540
So if we look at all these components of a diet and how they impact LDL, we can see how that compares to like a step.

611
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:50,430
So these are the higher end of what those studies have shown in terms of each little component here.

612
01:11:50,850 --> 01:12:00,690
So soluble fiber can have a potential 7% reduction in LDL fish oil, maybe 12% plant sterols, up to 15%.

613
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:06,570
That dietary pattern that we just looked at, up to 16% reduction in LDL.

614
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:14,100
So if we combine all these things together, we're probably at this low intensity stuff.

615
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:21,120
Now that's just LDL reduction. So there's other benefits that come with following a dietary pattern.

616
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:29,879
But you can maybe see why in this country they're pretty quick to use statens or people

617
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:35,340
would maybe prefer just to take a pill every day that's trying to totally adjust their diet,

618
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:45,570
although that is usually the first thing recommended is some dietary intervention and this is all data, but this is showing a similar kind of effect.

619
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:54,090
So if we have our patients do all those things to their diet, they'll see about maybe a 20 to 30% reduction in LDL,

620
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:58,800
which is really good, but it's still not the same that we see from a step.

621
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:11,190
Okay. So when we're talking about nutrition research, does anybody here want to do more research based work?

622
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:18,309
Probably not. I don't blame you. So what do you guys think, though?

623
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:25,870
As future nutrition professionals, what should we be study? Should we look at nutrients, foods, dietary patterns?

624
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:32,440
Should we be trying to look at biomarkers? We'd be investigating new biomarkers that are something besides your intake.

625
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:39,850
What makes the most sense is fruit for you guys. It's those that are kind of coming up into the field.

626
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:50,810
Or they can see the value of all of them, but is looking for more applicability.

627
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:54,800
You might think so, but we're just talking about links.

628
01:13:56,630 --> 01:14:01,430
Nothing exists isolation. And because there are so many different interactions and things like that,

629
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:08,870
it's difficult to eat more with either because different things impact your ability to absorb.

630
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:14,720
And so eating certain foods doesn't benefit you. The same with other societies.

631
01:14:15,290 --> 01:14:23,860
So I think it's in terms of like actual realistic ability to like things to help people, you need to be looking more at focus.

632
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,970
I tend to agree with that and the other thoughts. Yeah, I agree with that.

633
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:38,970
And I also think that like the diet is more important to me because it's like I feel

634
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:46,420
like I like to do like the heard that this is like advertising on a certain food,

635
01:14:46,430 --> 01:14:52,310
exactly what everyone else can study.

636
01:14:53,450 --> 01:15:03,200
Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Yeah. But you have also certain populations.

637
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:13,760
Yeah, that's it. That's an important component and a huge part of like nutrition, precision nutrition.

638
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:22,430
It's like what tends to work best for people. So I definitely agree that there's value in all of the social sciences within the

639
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:27,390
department or maybe focus a lot of nutrients and thank goodness we have that data mind.

640
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:37,280
My brain doesn't think that way. I tend to think working with patients would seem to make the most sense just initially.

641
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:42,229
Like if we're trying to make adjustments, there may be just some like single, you know,

642
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:48,680
even just some swaps or additions that people can understand through like foods first and then.

643
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:57,590
Then I do agree that dietary patterns and really trying to understand the effect of food and nutrients on disease,

644
01:15:57,590 --> 01:16:05,600
we really have to look at dietary patterns because there's so many different considerations there and that tends to capture a little bit,

645
01:16:06,110 --> 01:16:12,470
tends to capture that a little bit better. And there's also lifestyle considerations, too.

646
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:17,870
But generally, people do not consume isolated nutrients.

647
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:21,860
We know this. The foods they eat are more than just the sum of their nutrients.

648
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:27,080
There is a lot of good saying that if you get the foods right, you'll get the nutrients right,

649
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,860
and if you get the foods right, you'll get your fats right as well.

650
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:41,299
So again, so I really like kind of focusing on foods as a dietitian that works with individuals on a more population level.

651
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:44,420
The potential for residual confounding from lifestyle,

652
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:53,420
dietary and socioeconomic factors and bias in observational research definitely limits our causal interpretation.

653
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:01,970
It is really difficult to randomize people to certain diets, so that's why it can be really hard to study.

654
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:11,270
So for this reason, I think dietary guidelines is usually derived from analysis and synthesis of different types of evidence.

655
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:20,030
But really looking at dietary patterns, if we can find a way to study that better, I think will be the most helpful.

656
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:26,720
But as a dietitian working with individuals, getting away from percentage of calories from this,

657
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:30,530
focusing on foods and or a dietary pattern is really helpful.

658
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:37,819
What about biomarkers? So there are some biomarkers.

659
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:44,809
So studies will look at different biomarkers as a reflection of fruit, vegetable intake.

660
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:49,610
Maybe it's like serum vitamin C, there's a lot of problems with that.

661
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:55,069
So I don't tend to be the biggest fan of biomarkers,

662
01:17:55,070 --> 01:18:02,930
but some people that we can have something to detect in the blood that tells us what the diet is for research.

663
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:08,930
That could be really helpful and I get that. But that's there's potentially a lot of limitations there.

664
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:14,030
So yeah, lots of different.

665
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:20,030
And then what are we measuring or is it the marker of the diet or is it a marker of the nutritional effect of different nutrients?

666
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:28,970
So this is like a big area of trying to identify biomarkers and that are reflective of people's diet.

667
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:37,250
So I'd say stay tuned on that. That's not an area that I'm particularly knowledgeable of.

668
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:47,239
Or yes, I'll stick to the different types of study and say like it might be important,

669
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:54,630
esthetically, cultural as far as like the appetite patterns or, you know,

670
01:18:55,010 --> 01:19:03,350
the fact that there are some health consequences out there that you may not get as far as getting a dietary pattern,

671
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:08,570
just search and get more from other people, from different cultures.

672
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:17,720
Realize that this is a major step for nutrition because like you said, we're not they might be human.

673
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:21,770
I might say that that has recently reported.

674
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:27,680
And as far as like dietary patterns, diet is a lot,

675
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:39,710
but it's also quite much to focus on a lot of superfoods and there's a lot of issues that affect populations and populations,

676
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:50,950
maybe the day's behavior towards that, maybe recipes that focus on the idea of the Mediterranean diet more so.

677
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:57,739
That. And right now, there's not a lot of research. Yeah, I do.

678
01:19:57,740 --> 01:20:02,840
We do a good job of that at all in research.

679
01:20:03,490 --> 01:20:11,390
No. Right. I mean, it's through a very definitely through a white lens with diet research.

680
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:17,840
The Mediterranean diet is derived from a population largely of Caucasian descent in Europe.

681
01:20:18,530 --> 01:20:29,540
Does that mean that that pattern or the kind of nutrient nutrients reflected in that pattern couldn't be applied for to different cultures?

682
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:34,340
Yes, it can. And we just have not studied or even put effort into doing that.

683
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:39,469
There's a huge criticism of the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

684
01:20:39,470 --> 01:20:48,950
If you've ever looked at the sample meal plans or I would ask you, look at the sample meal plans of the handouts that I've posted.

685
01:20:50,450 --> 01:20:51,710
It's really terrible.

686
01:20:52,160 --> 01:21:03,080
And they have there's so much criticism in terms of what type who are writing these diets, who who's writing the books like even our textbook,

687
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:11,209
all these nutritional reference often are written by a singular population,

688
01:21:11,210 --> 01:21:20,330
and it does not apply to the populations we serve as health professionals, but it is definitely not culturally diverse.

689
01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:29,659
So there is a huge push within the field to get better and more not more sensitive to that,

690
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:36,260
but even just like more with it in terms of this is inappropriate and not really

691
01:21:37,550 --> 01:21:41,720
beneficial to a lot of the populations that we serve or not relevant essentially.

692
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:44,030
So it's a huge problem.

693
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:54,109
And I'm so glad you brought that up because we do not do a good job in research addressing that or even researching other populations and seeing

694
01:21:54,110 --> 01:22:07,040
that foods that may be more prevalent in certain diets of different cultures are healthful and can be part of a healthy dietary pattern.

695
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:12,890
And it's completely missing from the specific recommendations we apply.

696
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:15,980
So that's such a good point.

697
01:22:16,850 --> 01:22:27,620
The field is not up to the job of it. Our governing body is trying, I think, relatively unsuccessfully, to advance that part of the field.

698
01:22:29,270 --> 01:22:33,830
So it's really going to be you've got to move the field forward.

699
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:42,200
So we'll have an optional assignment later in the semester that that really looks at that part of that component.

700
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:50,450
So you can do that. You don't have to, but it's a really important aspect to think about, especially in this field.

701
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:57,649
Okay, so key takeaways. We'll stop here. I know we're over time.

702
01:22:57,650 --> 01:23:04,340
So for cardiovascular health, substantial evidence supports the importance of type of fat consumed, not total fat.

703
01:23:04,710 --> 01:23:09,260
We want to eliminate trans fats, which has been done for the most part.

704
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:17,300
Much of the evidence suggests that risk of coronary heart disease is reduced by replacing saturated fat with these healthier fats,

705
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,370
but not with refined carbohydrates.

706
01:23:20,090 --> 01:23:28,280
And then controversies remain about long term health effects of specific plant oils in a high fat, low carbohydrate diet.

707
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:35,149
So we need more research here. And the focus the focus of dietary advice on the consumption of foods and overall

708
01:23:35,150 --> 01:23:41,150
dietary patterns can be really helpful and really catering to our specific

709
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:46,129
populations and making sure that we are making individualized recommendations

710
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:53,420
there is helpful will be a question on a lot of this information we went over.

711
01:23:54,860 --> 01:24:01,669
It's still a little bit wishy washy, so that's kind of the best synopsis I think that I can offer.

712
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:05,030
But if you do have questions or other thoughts, please let me know. Okay?

713
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:09,980
All right. I'm sorry. We're going a little bit older. I will see you guys on Thursday.
