00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:16,030
Welcome to Epit 634 as module on adding disease specific mortality transmission models in this module, I will present an S.A.S. essay.

2
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:20,920
Our model that has the disease specific mortality to learning objectives of

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,210
this module are one to examine how properties of our transmission model change

4
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,100
when adding disease specific mortality and to to identify important questions

5
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,800
that can be addressed when populations are no longer assumed to be constant.

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,810
So let's first start with an S.A.S. model that incorporates disease fatality.

7
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:48,220
What changes do we see in our S.A.S. model? First, we observe that the population is knowler constant.

8
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:58,240
That is as close eye does not always equal one. Therefore, we want to explicitly add the S plus I factor in the birth rate term of the model.

9
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:05,800
Second, we have added mortality term alpha that accounts for mortality due to disease.

10
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:12,910
So here are equation's can are two added terms in the original S.A.S. model.

11
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:19,990
We studied Deeside DSC Placide T equals zero because the birth rates each birth,

12
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:25,840
the birth rate equals the death rate and the population therefore remain constant.

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,320
But now we have an additional death rate term and the DADT equation.

14
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,640
Therefore DSK plus I d t equals minus alpha times.

15
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,780
I guess this means that the population size is decreasing over time at an exponential rate.

16
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:54,750
Alpha. So now to see how the equilibrium properties change in this new model, we want to look at and plot the necklines.

17
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:04,260
The first thing we noticed here is that there are two as clients that S.A.S. model with that disease fatality only had one.

18
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:10,190
And we see that one is no client is along the x axis at eye equals zero.

19
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:15,830
Like the old SARS model and the other is a horizontal line.

20
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:27,230
And as equals a new plus gamma over BITA in the original SARS model, the SNL climate was a monotonically non-linear decreasing function.

21
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:36,620
The I know climbs look similar. One at equals zero and the other a horizontal line at S equals MUE plus gamma plus how over bita.

22
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:48,800
What do these changes mean. They mean that now the only location where s and I know Clines Intersect is on the S axis where I equals zero.

23
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,190
And what does this mean? It means that it means two things.

24
00:02:52,190 --> 00:03:00,980
First, that if the only solutions are at a equals zero, there's no endemic condition possible for this model.

25
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:09,260
Second, the steady state solution is not unique. It can be at any value of S.

26
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,980
Here are the no clines plotted. Yes, no.

27
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:19,380
Klein and the I know Clines note that one of the s.

28
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:25,500
And one of the I know Clines is the same and I equals zero.

29
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:36,900
Therefore, they intersect at an infinite number of points. So there is no endemic solution, but epidemics are possible.

30
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:49,160
If we rearrange the ISIS equations. The S.O.S model equation's the S.A.S. model with disease fatality actually looks like an essay, our model.

31
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,780
The only difference is that people die rather than recover.

32
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,400
In the essay, our model, if you recover, you are no longer part of the transmission process.

33
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,700
But you you are part of the demographic. Birth and death process. This is obviously not true.

34
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:11,820
If you die. Just like the ISIS, our model epidemic properties, for example,

35
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:17,370
the peak number of cases and the final numbers is opticals are functions of the initial condition.

36
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:23,590
The initial number of susceptible is as well as the parameter values.

37
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:28,510
Therefore, also simulations and with a equals zero.

38
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:42,980
But. The final number of susceptible is as infinity depends on the initial number receptacles, beda the transmission rate and gamma the recovery rate.

39
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:48,790
So now let's shift gears and look at CSIR model with disease fatality.

40
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:55,930
Here we have three modifications. We now have immigration into the population rather than a birth rate.

41
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:04,090
We now model temporary immunity. People recover and become susceptible again at rate gamma.

42
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,720
And finally, we have disease specific mortality.

43
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:18,970
And here are the equations, along with the three modifications in the equation from the original CSIR model.

44
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:24,420
Because these changes, because of these changes, we now have population dynamics where DNA,

45
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:35,770
D.T. and being the total population is plus five plus R is equal to the immigration rate, A minus the natural mortality rate.

46
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:41,710
New Times hand minus two disease specific mortality rate.

47
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:49,890
Alpha times in. When disease.

48
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:56,670
Specific mortality is zero. This dynamic is simplified and the steady state, total population.

49
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:03,570
When DNA equals zero is a over AMMU.

50
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:13,410
When disease specific mortality is not zero, then the steady state population is some value less than a over MUE.

51
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:25,120
What does this mean? This means that disease specific mortality that with disease, because every mortality, the disease is regulating the population.

52
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,890
What are the endemic properties of this model to figure this out?

53
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:35,410
We first need to calculate the NL claims. We see that like the CSIRO model.

54
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:42,010
We have one as no claim that monotonically decreases starting at a over MUE.

55
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:46,480
When I equals zero and dropping to a constant value as I increases.

56
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:52,020
The I know Clines also looked qualitatively similar to the essay or model with an hey,

57
00:06:52,020 --> 00:07:01,610
no client I equals zero and one at SC equals a constant Mbewe plus Delta plus alpha over beta.

58
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,900
If we plot these no claims, we get the following.

59
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,120
Where this is our s non-flying. And these are our.

60
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:18,630
Hi. Hi. No Clines. And here are two equilibrium points.

61
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:29,000
As long as I over. Is greater than the I know Klein, which is Delta plus B plus Alpha over Peter.

62
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:38,070
So just like the essay, our model under these conditions, that is a over mbewe is greater than Alpha plus me plus Delta over Beda.

63
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:45,470
There are two equilibrium points where the endemic point is the stable equilibrium point.

64
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:59,850
One new concept here is that we have an immigration threshold for immigration, where immigration above this value new Overbay at times.

65
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:13,130
Delta plus new plus Alpha is enough to maintain an amnesty immigration below this value means as a disease will be eliminated.

66
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:23,780
So for this model. Here, where a over overview times Beda is the rate of generating new cases.

67
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:30,550
And one over Delta plus MUE plus Alpha is the time in the infectious state.

68
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:41,240
Again, if hours less than one, then the steady state population is equal to a over HMU.

69
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,880
The disease is eliminated and therefore the population is not regulated.

70
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,770
This is reflected by the orange line on this graph where the immigration rate is

71
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:58,280
on the x axis and the steady state population and infinity is on the y axis.

72
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:06,850
The population size therefore increases with increasing a if are not is greater than one,

73
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,870
and the population is regulated by disease specific mortality.

74
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:21,800
At the studies date, population and the steady state population is less than a over Ammu.

75
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:30,020
So with the immigration rate above a threshold value shown in the last slide, the disease remains endemic.

76
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:42,750
And the degree of population regulation is measured by the deviation from the orange line.

77
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:50,310
Now, we can now apply this concept by looking at an experiment that was conducted in 1920s with mice as

78
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:57,630
the host and the bacteria as the pathogen experiment consisted of a population of mice in a cage.

79
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:03,660
And the researchers added mice to the cage at regular intervals to simulate immigration.

80
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,980
They started the experiment by adding an infected mouse.

81
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:15,390
They tracked the population size very due to the immigration rate and disease specific mortality.

82
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:22,070
Over time, they ran different experiments with different immigration rates.

83
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:28,170
Anderson, in May, in the 1970s, analyze these data using the SARS model,

84
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:35,000
they first derived a linear equation for an infinity as a function of a another parameter values.

85
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:44,600
They then found values for three parameters from the literature, the recovery rate, disease specific mortality rate and the natural mortality rate.

86
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:53,060
So they were left with two unknown parameters beda the transmission rate and gamma, the rate of becoming susceptible again.

87
00:10:53,060 --> 00:11:02,280
They used data from the from two experiments. To create two equations for an infinity.

88
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:08,490
And we're able to solve for the two unknown parameters, beta and Gamma.

89
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:25,770
They were then able to plot an infinity versus a for a less than a three a threshold value of A and A for greater than the threshold value of a.

90
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,000
And here are the results.

91
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:38,800
The first drone shows the population size as a function of time for two immigration rates, six per day and point three, three per day.

92
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:48,510
The second row is a plot of a steady state, total population as a function of disease, specific mortality for two different immigration rates.

93
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:52,850
The two main results pop out of these graphs.

94
00:11:52,850 --> 00:12:04,100
First, higher immigration rates result in greater transmission and a greater degree of host host population depression or regulation.

95
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:12,440
And second, there is an intermediate pathogenicity level that maximizes population regulation when virulence is low.

96
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,420
There is little regulation since the disease is not killing off the host.

97
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:23,870
When the virulence is too high, the pathogen kills off the host to a fish effectively,

98
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:28,940
which limits transmission and therefore the disease is eliminated.

99
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:37,180
You will explore these properties of the essay as an essay our model reviewed in this module.

100
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:43,518
When adding disease specific mortality in more detail in the labs.
