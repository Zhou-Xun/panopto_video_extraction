1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,860
Okay. Let's set up the slides.

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:13,140
Cute up there. I have them on the desktop, so you can just.

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,680
Yeah. So hopefully when you start it, it might stray too.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,790
Yeah. Okay. All right.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:34,130
So we are very, very fortunate that the originator of this class for 11 years creator and and and was it 11 years?

6
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,030
Yeah. Well, we've had Chip for 12 years.

7
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:45,920
Yeah. Yeah. Dr. Charles was at the original meeting where we, we decided we needed to have a CHIP program.

8
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,520
Actually, the origin of CHIP program was a student. This is me.

9
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,250
I just ask. This is running in the background. Do I need anything to do?

10
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,690
Anything that will capture this? Yeah, it will capture that.

11
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:05,959
Yeah. A student wrote and said had a great time at Michigan, but I won't recommend anybody here.

12
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,680
I would love to do infection control training.

13
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:19,190
And they punted it to me and I sent an email to I could share with everybody I can think of actually Sue Bradley I sent it to and

14
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:28,610
we were sat there and answer session with made a very strong argument that we had to have a practical experience for the students.

15
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:35,360
And so and she designed this course to make sure that everybody got whether or not they got some replacement.

16
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:42,540
So thank you for that. It's been very successful. I think we have at least one infection prevention.

17
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:50,730
Yeah, it's a big program now and many graduates from this school end up in our area.

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,570
I have been very happy about that. We have a very strong pipeline.

19
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,450
And I have to say, a lot of them have come back and spoken to you and they remember sitting in your shoes.

20
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,430
So this is, I think, maybe one of the most fun lectures.

21
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,730
So I'm glad you showed up. Great.

22
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,950
So I'm Carol Chenoweth. I'm one of the infectious diseases physicians.

23
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,930
I was the hospital epidemiologist for over 22 plus years.

24
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,930
Then I moved into antimicrobial stewardship.

25
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:31,050
And once we found somebody to take over that spot, I've been in a phase retirement, so I'm pseudo pseudo retired now.

26
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:39,960
But this last year I taught this class to stealth, so I'm pretty familiar with what you've gone through.

27
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,419
And today I wanted to talk about outbreak investigation,

28
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,520
but this is going to be you guys sort of leading the discussion once we get through a little bit of background information.

29
00:02:50,850 --> 00:03:00,030
And I know you have had outbreak investigation in your epidemiology class, I'm assuming, and the steps are pretty much the same.

30
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,580
But when you apply it to the hospital setting, it can be just a little bit different.

31
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:13,020
In particular, you're going to be working with hopefully way less numbers than you have in a population study.

32
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:20,760
But there are also a lot of people that are going to be very interested in.

33
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:33,580
So sometimes just managing the communication and the angst that's happening in the hospital is a major part of that of the outbreak investigation.

34
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,830
What the infection prevention is primarily end up having to do.

35
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,219
So I have made up an outbreak stuff which is very similar.

36
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:52,320
If you go on to the CDC website, you're going to find this type of outbreak investigation steps.

37
00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:00,600
We in infection prevention have our own, which has about 30 steps to it.

38
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:07,560
And the reason I'm not using that because we have added things to our steps

39
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:14,250
because at some point in the very beginning we want the infection prevention is.

40
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,530
By the way, please make sure the hospital epidemiologist knows what you're doing.

41
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:26,010
Please make sure the leadership on the unit knows what you're doing at this stage.

42
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:32,400
And there's kind of a standard email that gets sent out like very early on.

43
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,269
We are working up a cluster of infections on your unit.

44
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:44,700
Please make sure everybody's doing their proper hand hygiene and that items are being cleaned and following all infection prevention.

45
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,850
So there are a lot of intervening steps that are not there.

46
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:55,980
And the truth of the matter is these steps are kind of all many of them are done all at the same time,

47
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:04,350
because in order to verify that you have an epidemic, you have to find all the cases and see how far it went back.

48
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,830
And to while you're doing that, you're going to find your cases.

49
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:13,620
So a lot of these steps are really rolled into one step.

50
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:20,280
And so this may not fit exactly what you see on the CDC website, but it's close enough.

51
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,480
They we all we all follow the same general steps.

52
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:30,000
Like I said, some rebuilt in many, many steps into our outbreak investigation.

53
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,020
So first thing you have to do is confirm that there's an epidemic.

54
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:39,720
And this is this happens on a daily basis, practically infection prevention.

55
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,120
You see two infections in a certain area and you go, huh, is that something new?

56
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,140
Or is is this something that's just a random variation?

57
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,250
So you have to look back and see what's been going on.

58
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:59,759
And so we do surveillance. Part of the surveillance is for improvement.

59
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,140
You've been hearing about our surveillance for hospital infections.

60
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:09,930
Part of it's for improvement, but part of it is to make sure that we identify an outbreak right away.

61
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:20,009
The next thing you do is verify the diagnosis. And that sign seems kind of vague what I think of this as are you dealing with real

62
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:27,990
infections and does the infection fit the bacteria that were that you're looking at?

63
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:35,430
So part of this is that you look up, you may not know everything about it.

64
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,300
Or a bacteria or a fungus and.

65
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:50,210
Part of that is that you look it up. And I will tell you, even at my stage of the game, I still have to look things up because first of all,

66
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,020
there are new diagnostic tools that tell me an organism that I have not seen before.

67
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,310
And I have to figure out, is this something that can really cause infection or not?

68
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,300
And then I have to figure out. So if it is, where did it come from?

69
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:17,299
Where does it live? All of that, all that reservoir transmission, all of the stuff you learned in epidemiology for infections comes into play.

70
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,990
You have to know exactly what you're dealing with or what are the possibilities.

71
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,930
And you know what? The literature has outbreaks.

72
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:34,760
We at the very end, you communicate your final report and you can put out your you can publish your outbreak investigations.

73
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,739
I've done several and it's very useful for other people down the line.

74
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:50,180
So look for you may find exactly what you need, an outbreak that's already been published and in fact kind of explains what might be going on for you.

75
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,679
The other thing is sometimes that names change.

76
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,610
So, you know, bacteria that we used to call one thing,

77
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:05,640
come out with a new name and now you have to you kind of have to look at that and say, Oh, yeah, I know this.

78
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,160
You still look things up. Emily Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

79
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,970
Everybody does. So in the in the old days, we looked at the book.

80
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,920
Now, of course, we have the Internet, which can give us all kinds of information.

81
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,490
So how do you identify that? Confirm the diagnosis.

82
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:32,410
It implies that you have to know that something has changed from baseline.

83
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,970
So you have to have some background information. So this is the endemic rate here.

84
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:45,850
You should be familiar with looking at these if you paid any attention to the COVID curves, this is exactly what we see in the COVID curves.

85
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,080
But you have to know what's the baseline so you can tell when something changes.

86
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:59,920
We use this epidemic curve, which we'll talk about a little bit later, a lot to just simply eyeball and say this looks very different.

87
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:07,000
We also in the hospital had this sort of rule that if it's two standard deviations different from the mean,

88
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,870
then it's something that we have to do something about.

89
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:16,120
And that's kind of an artificial thing because the health department requires us

90
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,370
to report outbreaks in the hospital and we had to decide what's an outbreak.

91
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:26,110
We chose that two standard deviations, even though truthfully,

92
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:35,020
we would start investigating even before it might have gotten out of to standard deviations if it just looks like something is going on.

93
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:40,120
And it also depends on somewhat about the organism, how quickly this is happening.

94
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:48,250
So then this is what looks like this group spread to this group spread to this group of the waves keep building.

95
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,270
This is what influenza looks like. This what a viral infection looks like.

96
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,010
But it all hinges on the fact that you have to have some baseline surveillance.

97
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:05,920
So the health department does surveillance so they know when there is an outbreak based on a change from the baseline.

98
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,020
We do the same thing in the hospitals,

99
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:17,260
but we run into the situation where we don't do surveillance for everything that might happen in our hospital, we do targeted surveillance.

100
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:23,590
You've gone over the main types of infections, but we well,

101
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:29,170
so when we have to we have to look back through other methods and we'll go over how we might do that.

102
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:41,140
So the next thing is to develop your case definition, and this is very similar to what you've learned before and then find cases.

103
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:48,729
So case definition is always a working definition because we aren't sure exactly at the beginning what we're dealing with.

104
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:56,320
And so we may have to modify it as we get more information, but it always includes a time, a place and a person.

105
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,080
At minimum, it may include important clinical or microbiological information.

106
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:12,970
So if you have an outbreak of diarrhea, you would say it's in patients on X ward during this time frame with diarrhea.

107
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:18,550
If you know that they're C difficile, then you would say with C difficile during that time frame.

108
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:24,339
So our definition will be modified as we go and then we do case binding.

109
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:33,160
So if we do not do surveillance for an infection and we come across what we think might be something important,

110
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:43,720
we have to figure out what the baseline is. So the way we generally do it is go back to microbiology lab and they will tell you right here will s

111
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:52,510
give us a listing of every patient with this Clostridium difficile in the hospital in the last year.

112
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:59,649
We usually go back a year because many infections have like a face to them as

113
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:04,210
the year goes on so that we can see what was going on a year ago at least.

114
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,150
Is it like it just always goes up in the summertime, so we'll go back a year.

115
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:19,330
We can also ask admissions and discharge information to tell us which patients were discharged with this diagnosis.

116
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,580
We look at our infection control records because we are doing surveillance for some things.

117
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:32,160
And then if there's something going on with a procedure, say a surgical procedure, we'd would say to the O.R.,

118
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:40,690
please give us a list of all patients who had this procedure during this time frame so that we can see if they have have had an infection.

119
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,990
That way we get our fine or we find all our cases.

120
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:51,820
Remember, we're finding our cases, but we're also confirming the epidemic kind of at the same time, because you go back a year,

121
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:58,660
you get you find more cases and you see what the baseline is and you do it all really at the same time.

122
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:04,750
And then you organize your data and there's lots of ways to organize your data.

123
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:10,030
But these three are the primary ones and probably the most important for you to remember.

124
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:20,590
There are other graphs that we'll talk about. I wrote them up here, but the line listing and everybody know what a line listing is.

125
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:31,670
Basically an Excel file. Nobody really we do this, which is a patient's name, their gender, their flirt,

126
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:37,310
date of onset, which operating room they were in, what surgeon, what nurse.

127
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,500
But now, of course, it all gets plugged into an Excel file or an access file.

128
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,330
It's basically the same thing that we used to do here on a piece of paper.

129
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,000
And this will give you a list of all the patients.

130
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:58,070
And you can start organizing. Like how many patients were in operating room five?

131
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:02,330
How many patients had surgeons associated with their case?

132
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:08,000
So you can see pretty quickly, what are the common features of each of the infections?

133
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:13,249
We will include things like what is the organism, how long, what date it happened?

134
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,780
What how long did it take for the infection to come up?

135
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,120
Who else was involved in the surgery?

136
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:30,560
There's all kinds of things that you can put on here that will be sort of related to the particular infections that you're dealing with.

137
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:41,420
And then the basic demographics, which are you take all the clinical information about the patient and you sort of look at that.

138
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:47,780
Are these all men? Are they what's the age? What did their infections look like?

139
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:54,440
Were there other bacteria involved so that you just have just the basic information

140
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,790
about the patients and that is actually coming from the line listing as well.

141
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:05,959
And then you draw the epidemic curve. So the epidemic curves our cases over time.

142
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,390
And I'm just going to give you some examples.

143
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:19,400
I think you probably already had this, but this tells us a whole lot what the epidemic because it's cases over time, this pattern.

144
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:25,530
What kind of a pattern is this? So it's right at the top.

145
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:29,590
And this is a common source or eight point sources.

146
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:36,830
Everybody goes to the picnic and they eat the potato salad and they all get sick within a certain time frame and then it goes away.

147
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,450
Right. So they're all exposed to the same thing.

148
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:45,700
And after the incubation period, it's not person to person.

149
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:56,950
Right. So because it's not building as opposed to this curve which is propagated or person to person spread, you have an index case.

150
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:02,590
Index case infects a few people. Here you got an incubation period.

151
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:10,960
These people infect more and then it builds until somebody does something to stop it or everybody gets immune.

152
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,760
So this is kind of what you would see with viral infections.

153
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:23,319
It's not typically we do get viral outbreaks or norovirus outbreaks.

154
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,710
We get all kinds of outbreaks in hospitals.

155
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:33,129
But usually we will stop it before it gets to too far.

156
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:42,010
But I've seen some huge norovirus outbreaks that not at our hospital, but at some hospitals that would have continued to keep going.

157
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:51,870
And this is kind of a either it is a common source with continuing exposure.

158
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:59,099
So this is a patient to patient spread or there's a continuous source.

159
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:05,850
If everybody keeps drinking the e-coli water in a community, then they're just going to keep getting infections like this.

160
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:13,170
And that doesn't usually it can happen in hospitals forgot contaminated sink somewhere.

161
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,959
Patients keep coming in to that room and they keep getting infections.

162
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:25,830
So this could happen in the hospital, although it doesn't happen most frequently.

163
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:32,370
That's not the type of outbreak that we see, but we have and then this is what's called an intermittent source.

164
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,989
So you get little common source outbreaks.

165
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:46,620
So this is the water leak in a community reservoir that happens when the water when there's a large rain and it gets into the water supply,

166
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:56,010
everybody gets e-coli. This might happen if a person works, is carrying a bacteria and they work intermittently.

167
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,130
So when they work, you suddenly get an outbreak.

168
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,670
But it goes away when they're not when they're off. Typhoid Mary.

169
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:11,059
What's that? Typhoid Mary. Yep. Now some other graphs that you can do.

170
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:20,570
And I think that hopefully you'll see it on your computer a little bit better where you can enlarge this graph.

171
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:29,060
But this is a very famous graph of that John Snow did when he was investigating cholera in London.

172
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:33,740
Basically put a dot wherever the person that got cholera lived.

173
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,000
And what he was able to do was find that it was very much centrally,

174
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:46,880
but it was very much surrounding the Broad Street pump where everybody was getting contaminated.

175
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:52,190
So that's a very large population, but we can use something like that.

176
00:18:52,190 --> 00:19:02,540
And again, I hope you can put that. But we had we can use it for something like pseudomonas is occurring in a certain ICU.

177
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:16,850
We think they look like they're all the same or we type them, some of them are the same and you can put that on a map of the unit.

178
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:26,389
And in this case we were able to find that there were some sinks in the unit that had

179
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:34,010
the same organism and we could geographically locate the infections around the sink.

180
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:42,740
So we do use this kind of a graph every once in a while, about very rarely, not nearly as much as the epidemic curve.

181
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:52,370
I think our infection prevention is got get a little bit irritated with me because I always say can I say epidemic

182
00:19:52,370 --> 00:20:00,020
curve because that immediately is will tell me so much information like is this real and what's the magnitude of it?

183
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:06,049
But it's extremely important. Then there's also something called a timeline.

184
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:10,670
So this is a timeline just to show you a graphic of what it looks like.

185
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:14,709
This is was the original SARS outbreak that happened in Hong Kong.

186
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:19,190
The trip got transmitted around the world. They were actually able to control that one.

187
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,710
It didn't spread nearly like the SARS-CoV-2.

188
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:36,650
But think of this as this is the original traveler who got scars, came back to Hong Kong and in transmitted that at a hotel.

189
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:44,270
One of the people then came back and you can see the time that he was living with

190
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:51,260
the his household and they got the earliest usually where the person gets infection.

191
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:57,740
So think about this as, let's say the burn unit, we have a patient with a massive need, a bacteria in our burn unit,

192
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:08,030
patient in the same room ends up with and we can show the overlap based on these rectangles.

193
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:16,700
And then the time that they got the doctor and then the patient in the next room got it.

194
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,160
So it tells us more of a time sequence.

195
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:30,830
This very much implies that there is person to person spread, not necessarily directly from the patient coughed on to the other patient like SARS,

196
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:43,370
but probably in this case in the burn unit, it's hands personnel going from one patient to the next or device going from one patient to the next.

197
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,870
And we use that information to put into place our interventions pretty quickly.

198
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:55,190
So we use this more to give it time reference for person to person transmission.

199
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:08,440
Any questions about any of this? So then once you've got all your cases you've done, you've organized it, you formulate your hypothesis.

200
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:23,409
You know, I think it's Surgeon B is colonized with MRSA and then you have to do something as soon as you have a hypothesis.

201
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:32,229
And honestly, I'm going to tell you that even back here, you're going to put into place some interventions because like I said,

202
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:36,730
first thing we do is email and say, listen, this is going on.

203
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,840
We need you to do this right away. Let us know if you have any more cases.

204
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,550
So we're doing some intervention even here.

205
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:51,819
If this is a big enough outbreak, you're also if you've got a serious I mean,

206
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:59,490
really serious outbreak before you even get to your hypothesis, you're going to say, we can't let this keep going on.

207
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,819
Well, we figure it out. We have to close the unit.

208
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:11,890
We have to do this. We have to do something. Sometimes it's pretty drastic, but in some cases it's absolutely necessary.

209
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:22,030
So you make your hypothesis that you put into place some intermediate control measures and then you test your hypothesis.

210
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:34,840
So that what we use is very similar to what you learned in your epidemiology classes, which is we use case control study.

211
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:41,260
Our numbers are always less. I've had some statisticians tell me you can't do statistics on this.

212
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,659
You know, you don't have enough patients.

213
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:51,460
And I have to impress on them, though, this is a lot of patients for this situation and there aren't things you can do.

214
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:58,450
You use a fisher's exact instead of a chi square, you can still do a t test.

215
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:06,519
You can still even do multivariable analysis always, though it may not be as accurate,

216
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,920
but you'd be surprised at how much you can really show with very small numbers.

217
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:19,420
So we use a case control study, or if a case if the total numbers of patients are not very big,

218
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:27,490
like there's only 50 patients that have gone through the cardiac procedure that you're looking at, then you would do a cohort study.

219
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:32,290
We just look at all of them and just compare that case. The people got infected to those.

220
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:40,390
Then you come up with a relative risk versus a odds ratio, but they're interpreted pretty much the same.

221
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:49,330
You can also go on to do some multivariate analysis, usually if there's something that's real.

222
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:59,080
And then the other thing to test your hypothesis, I put it here, you can culture now you may culture personnel or you may culture environment.

223
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:05,680
And that's when knowing what your bacteria is and where it lives is becomes very important.

224
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:16,179
It's extremely important that you have your in your epidemiology to back up your your testing,

225
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:21,250
your any micro you had better be based on the the epidemiology.

226
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:24,910
And the reason is if you're going to test personnel,

227
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:35,800
you have to really have something telling you that they might be the person because it's very sensitive to the employee, number one.

228
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:46,540
But certain things like staph aureus, how many people that say even in this room, how many people will carry staph aureus?

229
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,399
It's about 25%. So you will end up finding a lot of staph aureus.

230
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:02,260
That has nothing to do with anything. If you just go out and blanket culture, I've seen some outbreaks or if they've done that,

231
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:08,080
they just went in and tested 500 people and they end up with a lot of people with them with MRSA.

232
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,500
And then it becomes a mess because you put them off work.

233
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:22,030
What do you I mean, you're talking about people's lives here and we'll get to some implications of it in one of our cases.

234
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,800
The same is true for environment. So when I first started Infection Control, we used to go around.

235
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:38,980
They they did not knock, not when I did it, but they previously they had gone around cultured the environment all the time.

236
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,750
You're going to find bacteria. You're going to find everything in the environment.

237
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,340
There's it's not sterile. It's there are things everywhere.

238
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:54,970
But to be able to link it back to the patient is really hard and a lot of it means nothing.

239
00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:08,620
And so we don't we try not to culture a lot without something epidemiologically pointing to the environmental source.

240
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:19,210
One year I got frustrated and I had them because we were seeing a bunch of gram negative infections in from the operating room and I had them grow up,

241
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:24,220
go in the water. I have not heard the end of that.

242
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:32,770
Well, I don't see them that often anymore. But I can tell you I did not hear the end of that because we cultured so many things.

243
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:37,089
We found so many things that had nothing to do with anything but didn't answer the question.

244
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:46,180
So in general, we don't culture the environment unless we have something point, some epidemiological clues that point to it.

245
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:53,260
And then you put into place your final control measures and evaluate.

246
00:27:53,530 --> 00:28:04,179
So that means you don't just say, nailed that one, we're done and go back to your office.

247
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:13,059
You have to keep watching to make sure that what you're put into place has taken care of the outbreak and then finally communicate your findings.

248
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:21,820
You will be at all along the way communicating to some people, because if it's a big outbreak, the news is going to get wind of it.

249
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:26,979
And you better be letting your public relations people know what's happening.

250
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:36,400
The administrators do not like to hear about things from the news or from the even the people in the hallways when they're walking along.

251
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:43,030
So you need to be making sure that you're been communicating all along, but now's the time you do.

252
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:50,920
We do write up a final report to put everything together because our infection prevention people will look back at that.

253
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:56,200
We save all of those things, say last time, that's what we found.

254
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,630
And so the next time you come across something, you can say, Oh, they start doing this again.

255
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,780
We also publish.

256
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:16,300
So we the cases that we're going through are actually all published outbreaks so that information can be extremely useful for other people.

257
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,680
So any questions? All right.

258
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,150
Yes, I was talking about like establishing the baseline before the outbreak.

259
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:36,340
In terms of some infections, you don't necessarily have baseline data because you can't do surveillance everything.

260
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:40,510
Right. What happens if you don't have kind of data?

261
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,960
Yeah. So that's when we go to micro,

262
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:53,589
let's say you see two stenographer minus or let's say three because that's when things start getting concerning maybe two.

263
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:59,170
It's kind of could be a coincidence. But you got three senator families.

264
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:07,570
What we would do is we would look back at our infection prevention surveillance to see what because we would have it all logged in there.

265
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,790
Types of infection, senator of turf among us.

266
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:19,210
But more importantly, we'd go to microbiome and say protect the network from illness for the last year or what, however long we need it.

267
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:27,430
That would be a lot of signature from all of us for a year, but it kind of depends on what the duration of what you're looking at.

268
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:36,850
If we need to know if there's if this is an epidemic, we usually go back a year because like I said,

269
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:43,390
some things have some yearly variation and we just want to make sure that.

270
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:48,690
So that's one thing if there's something that's not microbial.

271
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:53,630
Then we would get admission and discharge diagnosis.

272
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:03,340
Or like I said, I think the last thing that I said is like, show me every patient on your unit and we'll go through and look.

273
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:09,559
Or show me every patient that's had this procedure in the last year or so.

274
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:18,070
And we go through and look. So it is a bit of footwork to to look back.

275
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:26,710
But we do we are we do have ways to do it. If it's something communicable, we could also go to the health department and say, what are you seeing?

276
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:33,280
Can you tell us how many of these types of infections you've had reported to you?

277
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:42,609
So that's a little tricky in that we may have to go to the state because everything a communicable

278
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:47,350
disease wise is reported through counties and not all of our patients are from counties,

279
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:56,920
our county. So we would start with Washtenaw County, but then we might have to go statewide, might have to go Detroit area wide.

280
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:04,260
Any other questions? Okay. So usually I have the guys work on this together.

281
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,830
So do you all feel comfortable working in groups?

282
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:16,740
Sure. Yeah. Okay. So, uh, can I get, like, two groups on this side and two groups on this side, or three?

283
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:29,490
Divide yourself up into groups. Um, what I, what we have here is this is a hospital, a, which happens to be in northern Michigan a long time ago.

284
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:39,389
It's not a new outbreak. The infection prevention is there found within a four month period from April to

285
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:44,969
August that there were ten surgical site infections due to group streptococcus.

286
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:57,450
So that's streptococcus priorities. So I would like for your group to put together the first four steps.

287
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:12,760
How would you go about confirming your diagnosis, which also includes finding cases right through strep?

288
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:17,770
I would start with what do you know about group strep?

289
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,020
This is strep prioritize causes, sore throat.

290
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,580
Strep throat. Can it cause infections like this?

291
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,940
If it does, what does it look like? Where does it come from? Where is it?

292
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:35,420
There. Those are things you should look at early so that you have an understanding of what,

293
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:42,470
and then you should have all the information you need to make your case definition.

294
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,540
So work together to look at the to go through all of that.

295
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:59,750
Okay. Think about who you need to, like, know and if there's anything you need to do right away.

296
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:08,000
Because like I said, communicate is all all the way through control measures really is all the way through.

297
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:24,020
I'll give you about 15 minutes on this first one. It comes much faster because they're all the same with the same.

298
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:45,790
And I will tell you the few times I would say yes for the government, for culture, for and for they are tearing up.

299
00:34:49,240 --> 00:35:06,160
I'm sorry. I guess I'm not really sure what I'm doing.

300
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:14,610
I spoke with our instructors over at the same so they're a to way to first the first.

301
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:24,180
I think that's going to be for all. I'm.

302
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:32,730
Interesting. Well, I wouldn't say it's good.

303
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:38,940
Yeah, I think there is.

304
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:43,170
There still is. Yeah.

305
00:35:43,680 --> 00:36:08,650
Yeah. You know, obviously over and over again, I told you and I'm a place which I should really research for comic book film work,

306
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:22,730
but I'm only doing it because I supposed to do five weeks. They screwed up my insurance because I was going through something earlier this year,

307
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:33,410
which I couldn't do with my radio as was like I was doing it for the money.

308
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:43,550
Yeah, that's true. I think because they're short staffed, but you know, like the purposes is like, you know,

309
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:58,240
the cultures are still just full of this culture and you know, it's been mission culture didn't really restoration pretty much.

310
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:15,090
Right. They had to go back and say, oh, you don't read this or even your like.

311
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:22,640
Yeah, I understand. That's all.

312
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:29,390
I want to go back and see restoration and then we'll see how it works because I haven't finished that.

313
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:38,250
It's turned on her on June seven and done in July.

314
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,800
So I guess we were just going.

315
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,219
You have secret extra innings every day.

316
00:37:52,220 --> 00:38:00,810
Narrow it down into specific search responsibilities. Turns out that most kids and their siblings.

317
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:16,000
Now, I'm sure everyone is not surprised that my daughter supposedly comes on that last request.

318
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:29,850
Well, that was inevitable. I that was just an adventure looking a little bit down after I felt like in water.

319
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:43,130
And I can't help myself and my husband realize we don't have the headphones to use the.

320
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:54,420
I guess it's like this was just like the first Thanksgiving because, of course, everybody.

321
00:38:54,840 --> 00:39:03,320
Oh, yeah. There's no. Yeah. So how much is going on with that period?

322
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:12,690
I think the whole weight was just sort of personal.

323
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:30,140
So it's not like, you know. And you know, they talked about this about it in this case, she said, but isn't your teacher, but I'm sorry.

324
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,300
Well, that means that. That's correct.

325
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:46,620
I guess I was just saying earlier that I've seen relatively little of writing about errors in the hospital for some time.

326
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,360
I remember that as well.

327
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:59,639
There were a couple of things that when I was getting everybody the right to open to the knowledge with, I mean, it was just it was just confusing.

328
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:04,740
It's really hard to continue. They should refer you to them and they can do.

329
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:09,630
Yes. Yes. I've never done this before. I an entrepreneur.

330
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:18,780
Yes. Police Commissioner Richard Wastewater is part of 30 different fines for the industry.

331
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,660
So we're just doing it as a proof of principle. Kind of cool. What are we looking for?

332
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:28,790
It just shows a little bit of.

333
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:39,990
To bring you 700.

334
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,890
Over 100. That was unreal.

335
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:57,570
And if know what happened, on the other hand, you have.

336
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:04,240
It wasn't in the parking lot.

337
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:13,300
In early December, 1984.

338
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:19,270
Oh, my God. What was that?

339
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:27,830
That was like. Oh, I was looking through the mail.

340
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:32,990
Through the mail.

341
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:48,020
That is very, very hard on their conscience recipients.

342
00:41:48,070 --> 00:42:02,530
I don't even know if you know that, because actually the other guy.

343
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:10,270
So I don't know who likes to take everything.

344
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:19,480
So I tried to think of how much of that is true.

345
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:29,300
And I think it's. So it's kind of like if they come into the house to just sort of.

346
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:39,800
Just just go with, you know, what I'm telling her.

347
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:50,660
I know that it's just, you know, I mean, I had a feeling that.

348
00:42:53,350 --> 00:43:04,930
I'm sure they wouldn't want to rush to your level because they said that a lot of very young men experienced these things.

349
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:25,260
Yeah, they do. But they. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

350
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:55,810
That's great to have this experience and they get as much as 170 were also able to do like and and then you also you know sometimes you know whatever.

351
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:17,180
Yeah I know. And I just didn't think they had a history of hepatitis C, so but it was really like 3 seconds.

352
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:33,040
And so I went to visit my student that's right there, just everything right now.

353
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:41,830
So we were just saying this notion that, you know, they get paid by age and for like two, three years.

354
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:50,830
But, you know, at that time there is no actually, it's like I was like, yeah,

355
00:44:51,070 --> 00:45:01,350
but you know, she came after, you know, well, then that right shortly after.

356
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:19,800
And there was the one because they were like, Yeah, we don't think there's anything else.

357
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:24,060
I don't really know. I'm sorry. Yeah, I know.

358
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:41,550
I really don't mind. Yeah.

359
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:54,010
Let me ask you something.

360
00:45:55,180 --> 00:46:11,160
I wonder what they're doing that also they haven't given you an example.

361
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:15,220
Are people doing you're getting close to being done or are you done?

362
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:25,950
A Let's say two more minutes and for. Ah.

363
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:31,770
Everybody seems to have stopped. So why don't we go ahead and start then?

364
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:43,410
So I actually work through the first four steps, this group here, which I can't tell if it's all of you or are you all working together?

365
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:56,099
Oh, okay. So I will ask you then tell me first, what did you find out about group strength and what to verify the diagnosis are?

366
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,610
We're dealing with a group based strapping faction problem here.

367
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:08,000
Who? Who wants to be the spokesperson? Oh, I should have told you I got it.

368
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:12,499
Okay, so we found that probation officer that we found on the nose and on the skin.

369
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:18,260
So it's not really a common bacteria that you would find in surgical site infections, which makes it interesting.

370
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:23,270
So we kind of thought, well, maybe has something to do with hand hygiene compliance or some kind of source of contamination.

371
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:29,569
What was the second part of that? Okay. Yeah. Anything else that you've figured out about?

372
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:34,549
So it's a human bacteria that's extremely important. Group strep is humans.

373
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:38,570
It's not something that you're going to be going and finding in the water,

374
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:46,720
although it may end up we were just talking about water surveillance, but it may end up in the water, but it's not going to survive long.

375
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:56,090
So it's a human. Anything else that needs to be known about group strep, it can be spread through direct contact with the nose and throat discharges.

376
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:01,140
So that's important because in skin lesions where everything is created pretty.

377
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,540
So it's bad hemolytic. Yes. Yeah.

378
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:12,500
So that's not specifically a virulence factor, but where you're going?

379
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:17,270
Oh, yeah, yeah. In the culture, you're going to find it with maybe hemolysis around it.

380
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:22,759
And while the hemolysis isn't necessarily a virulence factor, this is a pathogen.

381
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:28,920
So when it causes infection, it cause it can cause very serious infections.

382
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:34,710
So. Good. Anything else about group B strep that we need to know going into this?

383
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:47,210
All right. There's a group here, I think. Right. So tell me, how did you confirm the epidemic and at the same time find cases?

384
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:53,810
So we said that we would make an epidemic curve just to make sure that I mean,

385
00:48:54,110 --> 00:49:00,049
probably but make sure that ten exercise due to the racetrack is actually an uncommon

386
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:04,430
occurrence or is increased from the previous like baseline data that they would have.

387
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:10,460
Okay. And where did you get the baseline data? We didn't talk about that.

388
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:15,380
Would I mean, I'm assuming that you could ask micro, but.

389
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:23,240
Yeah, okay. You do. I I'm going to pick on you guys then because we're actually jumping to the next with this particular question.

390
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:35,540
Can you draw a curve for me? I put here and you can do it if you think about it.

391
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:39,319
There were how many cases? Ten surgical site infections.

392
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:44,149
Let's say they happened because they came between April and July.

393
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:47,290
And let's say they're equally distributed. So.

394
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:59,290
Who wants to? Somebody brave. Come here. It doesn't have to be you, Larry, I'm assuming.

395
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:04,720
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this is part one from last year.

396
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:19,180
So you went back a year? Started from April to.

397
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:31,030
So they would be from April to July and and April to August 16.

398
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:38,880
So these 42 and 43, it's going to be eight. What she what I actually said.

399
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:46,840
Let's say we get another.

400
00:50:49,120 --> 00:51:07,440
There's one. Sure. All right.

401
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:10,080
Let's say that that had a adding up to ten.

402
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:20,610
So we go from the sitting were very infrequent here to suddenly very high probably a little more dramatic than that.

403
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:31,049
So thanks. We jumped ahead. You don't need a lot of information to do an epidemic curve, especially if you're condensing it like this,

404
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:35,760
because we don't they haven't told us yet that the distribution over weeks.

405
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:41,900
So this group here then did you make a case definition?

406
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:51,420
We misunderstood the question. What's that? So we kind of understood what we had to do.

407
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:54,569
So we didn't actually write this case definition. We just kind of defined how we would do it.

408
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:59,910
We go into the literature a little bit and see, Okay, so you need a person, place and time.

409
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:04,470
Look at this and just tell me what you think the definition would be.

410
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:14,489
So the person would be someone that's been since the surgical site, someone that's best was had it the surgery had an operation within that timeframe.

411
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:17,520
So you could even go probably go a little bit before as well.

412
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,969
Exactly. If you can capture anything. Yes. And we usually do.

413
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:28,770
We want to make sure we capture outside. So sometimes we go one month, sometimes you go two months before and a little bit afterwards.

414
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:47,700
So it's any patient who develops a group strep infection at hospital, a lesser place between, let's say, March and September.

415
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:51,179
Would you want to generalize it more to like maybe like symptoms as well,

416
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:55,620
like looking at their symptoms to see if you can capture more group stuff that you might have missed and testing?

417
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:59,940
Or would you just go with you could if you have more information.

418
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:09,440
But right now we are setting our initial definition and then we're going to expand it as we need to or narrow it.

419
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:14,189
Maybe we'll say it's only it's only in people getting heart surgery.

420
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:20,760
So based on the information going forward, this is what we have, which is during this four months,

421
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:25,890
there were ten surgical site infections with group strep at hospital.

422
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:32,460
So to confirm the outbreak, what they did was looked back.

423
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:41,100
Look, during the epidemic period, there were two 2600 surgical procedures performed and there were ten infections

424
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:49,350
that led to a rate of infection from group strep a point four per 100 procedures,

425
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:54,330
which is the usual denominator that we use national rates.

426
00:53:54,630 --> 00:54:07,440
So remember, CDC collects this data to you and they can tell you national rates were two per 10,000, so which comes out to a 0.02.

427
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:18,990
So it's very high group strep and when they look back over a year, there were 6000 cases surgeries with no group strep.

428
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:23,100
So do we have an epidemic? Yes.

429
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:29,459
You should also know that group is drop tends to cause very serious severe infections.

430
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:42,230
We know that it's a human organism. So the general rule is that when you see a strep infection in a surgical site that you the city,

431
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:47,459
the joint commission has told us that is like a central event.

432
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:50,820
You have to do an investigation. So even with one,

433
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:57,389
you start looking because it's a chance that there is a person that is our common

434
00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:03,180
source that because the the graph is actually probably more dramatic than it was,

435
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:14,219
because now we know these were in there and then we got ten cases over a quarter to quarter, but it's really mostly like water.

436
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:22,930
So it's like this. And you look at that immediately say that's something different is happening there.

437
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:28,690
Well, it's a group airstrike. So we take that very seriously.

438
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:39,200
So their definition was any patient with a post-operative infection, that group perhaps trapped between April and August.

439
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:45,290
They went to went to microbiology records, looked back through their infection control records.

440
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:51,440
Do we have any previous surgical site infections due to group based strep going back a year?

441
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:56,780
And they found none, which is good. Actually, it's good that they weren't happening all along.

442
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:00,080
And here's their epidemic curve.

443
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:08,180
I put it into a quarter based on what information we had so that you could draw an epidemic curve, but this is their curve.

444
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:15,950
So they were they had it by month or by week, so they were able to spread it out.

445
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:20,810
We didn't have that luxury. So ours is all condensed as a common source.

446
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:25,100
What do you think about this? Does this look at all familiar to you?

447
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:34,580
Yes. The intermittent outbreak. Yeah. This has that pattern of an intermittent outbreak.

448
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:47,270
So we'll store that information. While you're collecting your cases, you're also putting down information into your line listing.

449
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:56,120
So and you're getting demographics. So I'll go ahead and give you some case demographics, some information.

450
00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:04,160
All patients who developed an infection had purulent drainage from their wounds within four days of surgery.

451
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:12,530
The median time to fever was 28 hours after surgery, so they got fever before the wound started showing evidence of infection.

452
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:16,970
And they were very febrile. That's 39/4 pretty high.

453
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:26,000
Two of them had bacteremia. One died of group based strep thrombus phlebitis, which is an infected blood clot.

454
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:33,560
And the patients had undergone gynecological urological plastic surgeries.

455
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:38,000
Orthopedic, neurosurgery and general surgery procedures.

456
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:45,840
And it happened in five different areas. So tell me what you want.

457
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:52,920
I'm going to let you all do this together. Tell me what you want to put in that line listing.

458
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:59,020
What information is important for you to figure this out?

459
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:03,820
Because the next thing we have to do is make a hypothesis.

460
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:08,650
Yes. You want to know to put like the types of procedures. Yes.

461
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:12,520
Who was doing them? Yes. What? Who's doing them?

462
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:16,360
Meaning surgeon? Yeah. Surgeon. And any of his surgical helpers?

463
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:22,660
Anybody else? What were you going to say? I was going to say where the doors are located.

464
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:26,800
Yes. So you want to know general proximity of the O.R.?

465
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:30,120
Did you have something where the surgical equipment came from? Yeah.

466
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:39,520
So you might want to track certain surgical instruments and how they were processed.

467
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:43,720
You guys have all been to CST Sea, as it's called now.

468
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:52,090
Yes. We will want to look at the instruments and somebody might make a trip down there, but.

469
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:56,920
But is group strep an environmental thing?

470
00:58:57,890 --> 00:59:01,810
No. Okay. So anybody else you want to include?

471
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:09,989
You might want to look at where they were located predominantly like, oh, okay, yeah,

472
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:18,719
along the whole train or you know, the whole process where they started, all the people involved, all the people.

473
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,080
And remember that it's not just the surgeons in the operating room.

474
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:30,590
You've got all kinds of other people, you've got some nurses, you've got some people coming in and out, you've got anesthesiology, right?

475
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:35,370
So you're going to put all of those things in there as well, right?

476
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:47,040
Anything else you want to put into this? That's going to be the main one.

477
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,020
You have to be in the community. Yes.

478
00:59:52,030 --> 01:00:03,960
So. You might want to make a phone call to the operating room, I mean, to the public health department and find out what's been going on locally.

479
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:09,750
Are you hypothesizing that people are coming in with their group strep because they could be colonized?

480
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,560
Okay. Okay.

481
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:18,720
We can make a phone call to the Health Department at the same time.

482
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:31,080
All right. So very quickly, I'm going to give you 5 minutes to get back in your group and formulate your hypothesis,

483
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:41,969
because the next step is to test the hypothesis. And while you're at it, whatever your hypothesis is, you should develop some interventions.

484
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:46,080
What do you want to do about this right now?

485
01:00:46,980 --> 01:01:02,160
Remember, I know when I do the communicable diseases exercises and the pandemic exercises with Dr. Sante,

486
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:11,610
that one of the emphasis is always that you have to make sure that you've got it's made it safe for patients going forward.

487
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:17,579
So think about that. You've got very sick people.

488
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:20,940
Those are very sick people with this group. Strep Infection.

489
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:24,659
One has already died in a two month period. You don't know what's going on.

490
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:31,170
What are you going to do? Okay. What do you need to do right now to make it safe?

491
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:46,160
And I think all of these interventions.

492
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:54,350
I can't remember the name.

493
01:01:54,370 --> 01:02:00,950
So it was a year ago, she said.

494
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:11,920
And then I was. It's always been something.

495
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:34,450
So again, I was looking for like every single thing where I'm like, Yeah, I'll give you their free and open circles, that type of style.

496
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:39,520
It was low level.

497
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:48,010
So yeah, I was able to handle that high intensity.

498
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:59,560
I think there are many people right now in our city and I know how to do the same thing.

499
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:09,070
Yeah, that's just also like if you're searching for something special and this is what

500
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:29,400
I'm going to put it to you exactly like since it has been like on this issue.

501
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:46,430
Like I said, there's a loading and then it's definitely one of.

502
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:59,240
Yeah. I think there were white jackets and I was like, I know I can just do the work.

503
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:14,020
And I don't know if it's because it's like but also I know about the people that work.

504
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:28,160
That's why I said the we have inconsistent ideas and anyone.

505
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:38,840
MARTIN Yeah. You're saying that is just the opposite is true within the party that has to serve them.

506
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:48,230
And yet this is everybody's got an idea of what they think is going on and what they want to do about it right now.

507
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:52,550
And I'm going to stop start on this end first.

508
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,860
What's your hypothesis? What do you think might be going on to cause this outbreak?

509
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:09,440
Because it's not super stable in the environment and it's usually Strep A or her face drop is usually spread person to person.

510
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:17,659
We have half the size that it was likely due to either mild or asymptomatic infection.

511
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:25,220
And the staff that are caring for these patients, either potentially pre during or post operatively.

512
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:31,160
Great, good, good hypothesis. What do you want to do based on that hypothesis?

513
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:35,180
Did you come up with the same hypothesis? Yeah. Okay. What was what?

514
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:38,750
Now tell me one intervention that you want to do.

515
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:49,220
We said that we would test all the personnel, like you said, that were involved pre during operation or post operatively and test them for extra.

516
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:52,520
Okay. And when you say test, what are you testing?

517
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,650
Nose. Nose, nasal pharynx.

518
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:06,320
Yeah, yeah. Throat, yeah. Most of us carry it in the throat if it's got anywhere else.

519
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:11,700
And you're going to do everybody in the operating room. I mean, we said we were okay.

520
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:19,010
What's that? Health related illness or co-infection cases of anybody that was in any of the infect.

521
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:22,190
Okay. All right. Final initial score.

522
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:29,990
Yeah, maybe we look for, like, ones that over people that overlap with all five, but then I think that that might.

523
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:34,730
So now you're doing the test, the hypothesis to see who you should test.

524
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:39,500
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Sometimes you don't have time.

525
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:42,860
Or if the CDC comes in, they may just culture everybody, but.

526
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,690
But we'll see what happens when they do.

527
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:51,740
So what did you guys want to do? Anything else intervention wise?

528
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:59,220
And we said just as an interim thing, you could just. Encourage more hand hygiene.

529
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:02,820
More hand hygiene you never heard, and now it's never going to hurt. That's fine.

530
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:06,210
It's probably, like organic has been working with patients.

531
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:12,300
Oh, definitely. Probably. He's going to probably do something to prevent further spread.

532
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:18,720
Okay. So you're going to continue with an enhanced infection prevention.

533
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:27,720
Okay. Anybody want to close the door? We've got ten people in a matter of three.

534
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:33,690
It's for four months. One started.

535
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:38,490
Yeah, we'll see for sure. Yeah.

536
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:44,670
At this point, it's not something you're going to be very unpopular with your CEO.

537
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:50,700
The administrators are not going to like this. The O.R. staff and the surgeons are not going to like that.

538
01:07:51,990 --> 01:08:00,180
But at this point, they did choose to close the O.R. and can you close only part of the O.R. in this case?

539
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:09,120
No. No, because it's across multiple surgical disciplines, multiple hours.

540
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:15,120
You don't really have a good idea of who or we have an idea that it's a person, but we don't know who.

541
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:23,540
So they did culture people in the operating room.

542
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:28,980
They did nasopharynx and throat cultures of all personnel.

543
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:34,560
They also did surface or lights, tables and stands,

544
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:46,230
and they found that anesthetized a culture group strep and was removed from the operating room and treated with penicillin.

545
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:51,940
Are we done? We have to evaluate.

546
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:56,930
Say it again. You have to evaluate whether removing unnecessary work.

547
01:08:57,610 --> 01:09:00,730
Yeah. Is there a way to test if he's really the one?

548
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:11,740
This is where you do your case control study. Because remember ten, we didn't talk about this, but 10% of people carry a group strap.

549
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:16,630
And that doesn't necessarily mean they disseminate or cause infections in other people.

550
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:24,189
So they cultured over hundreds of people here and one of them had strep.

551
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:27,800
So that's within our the normal population.

552
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:31,990
So. But this one got positive and got removed.

553
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,229
We can do a case control study.

554
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:48,220
Remember, if if somebody is involved in the cases but not in the controls, they are more likely to be the person that is the one that transmits.

555
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:54,950
So they found in their case control study that the infected patients were exposed to 14 surgeons.

556
01:09:54,970 --> 01:10:03,010
So do we think it's the surgeon? There were 17 nurses and six anesthesia personnel.

557
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:14,260
54 control patients selected from it, from the epidemic period were used as these are people not infected.

558
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:26,709
We used as our controls and nurse A who we haven't talked about was the circulating nurse on eight of the cases, but only five of the controls.

559
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:29,710
So that's an odds ratio of 30.

560
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,250
Ah, excuse me. It's a relative risk of 30 because they did a cohort study.

561
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:39,010
Anesthetist A was involved in only two cases and it was not statistically significant.

562
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:50,740
So this is where we get back to letting your epidemiology direct your culturing and what what interventions you do.

563
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:57,729
Are you thinking that this is anesthetists may not know.

564
01:10:57,730 --> 01:11:07,660
And by the way, he's kind of angry because he had to take off and uses PTO because they didn't allow him to work.

565
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:15,069
So this is the type of problems, problems that you get into when you're doing this.

566
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:27,940
You have to do it because it's the safest thing to do. But on the other hand, you also run the risk of causing major irritations.

567
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:37,390
So what do you want to do about Nurse A? Remove her from the picture.

568
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:43,450
Okay, so we want to remove her from work until we sort this out.

569
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:47,620
What else do we do? Additional culture. Yeah. Colonize somewhere on her.

570
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:57,740
Yeah. So I don't. I can't remember if she was gone the day they were doing the culture or if she was negative in her pharynx.

571
01:11:58,390 --> 01:12:06,760
So now we're really getting to where we need the epidemiology, because now we're going to be doing more culturing, culturing different sites.

572
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:12,970
And this is where you it's like very sensitive and you need to be able to back up what you're doing.

573
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:22,840
So they brought oh, this is another piece of information that in the people that were exposed to nurse A,

574
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:30,850
the infected people had gotten streptococcal and anti streptococcal.

575
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:36,220
So we give prophylactic antibiotics to people going through certain surgeries.

576
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:44,710
Those that got it were less like got some antibiotics prophylactically, were less likely to get infection.

577
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:50,049
And they also had a longer duration of surgery.

578
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:57,070
So their exposure time was higher. So that doesn't really tell us, is it to nurse or not,

579
01:12:57,070 --> 01:13:06,340
but it gives us more information that it's exposure to nurse a without antibiotics and longer durations that seem to be the risks.

580
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:16,300
So they brought the nurse day in and cultures of the narrow pharynx throat axilla umbilicus ear,

581
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:19,720
hands and feet were all negative with four group based strep.

582
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:30,280
However, there are few people that will carry this in the perineal or vaginal region at around the vagina and the and the rectum,

583
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:41,319
and some people carried in their intestinal track. So this is again why it's extremely important that you come in with information.

584
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:48,010
So she cultured, positive at all at the vaginal perineal and an anal region?

585
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:56,290
Yes. I'm curious for like from an occupational health perspective, if employees are allowed to say no to culture?

586
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:02,590
I think they do have the they can do that.

587
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:11,020
I've been involved in situations where the this the the employee did not want to get cultures back.

588
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:14,460
When we discussed it with them, they agreed to do it.

589
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:20,799
But doctors don't realize you're right. I mean, you can't, like, hold someone else for, you know, they're not children.

590
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,940
So you can hold them down and force them to get especially this kind of culture.

591
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:32,860
Right. Like this is very rare. So it's impressive that went along with it.

592
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:40,659
But it it can definitely be challenging. But you're right, you can't you just have the conversation and say, see why this is so important.

593
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:46,209
Right. And I think, you know, this person probably recognized that there is an outbreak and, you know, someone died.

594
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:52,510
And that's very serious. And that's probably what, you know, what led to them agreeing to get tested for it.

595
01:14:53,050 --> 01:14:58,700
Yeah, these these situations could definitely be cause that's obviously very, very sensitive, so.

596
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:02,799
Yeah. Could you also, like, reassure them to be like. Exactly.

597
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:06,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're not in trouble, right?

598
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:10,510
We're just trying to, you know, this is a public health intervention.

599
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:22,100
Yeah. Um, speaking of repercussions, what are they actually like if there are things like this going too far?

600
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:27,500
Like driving. In pictures like that.

601
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:33,620
A picture has passed through the. Typically come back in and or something?

602
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:38,120
Well, that's that's a good question. And they they could.

603
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,679
And it's you know, this is a situation, obviously,

604
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:53,160
where you'd have to have your risk management department involved to help you kind of go through that disclosure process to communicate.

605
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:59,940
We didn't mention risk management. Yeah. The legal people need to know about a situation like this.

606
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:10,540
Right. Right from the beginning, just like PR. But in general, employee information wouldn't be given to the patient.

607
01:16:10,590 --> 01:16:19,310
Right? Yeah. You wouldn't disclose the identity of the employee or I'm not even sure if they would be told that there was an employee.

608
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:24,020
But if it became known, they would I don't know.

609
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:28,880
Would they or not? I hadn't. I don't think we have done that.

610
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:35,810
Yeah, I think maybe only if the, you know, the patient or family is pressing really hard for more information.

611
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:43,580
But it's hard because, you know, when people have a surgical care team, it's not a large number of people.

612
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:51,840
Right. So it's kind of hard to say. You know, someone on your care team was infected without sort of outing that person.

613
01:16:51,870 --> 01:17:00,740
Right. Yeah. And the other thing is, you may get sort of forced into letting it be known why this happened,

614
01:17:00,770 --> 01:17:08,060
that there was somebody who was carrying a bacteria, because in general,

615
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:15,230
they'll this patient sometimes they're litigious and want, you know, some money,

616
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:20,299
but oftentimes they just want to know that it doesn't happen again and that you've done something.

617
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:24,620
So we do risk that's what risk management does.

618
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:32,300
They sit down with and tell them that we've looked at and that we've figured out what may have caused it without trying to get.

619
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:37,340
And certainly an employee would never be we would never let that happen.

620
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:43,430
And we would we always take care of our we have to take care of our employees as well.

621
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:52,489
So the CDC did stereotyping and this the the the nurse was actually carrying the same bacteria.

622
01:17:52,490 --> 01:17:55,760
That was the type of bacteria that was found in patients.

623
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:57,950
And they did set a plate.

624
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:08,870
So set of plates are on our plates that are just put around the room so that any aerosolized bacteria will settle on to the plate.

625
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:16,520
Does it bother you that this patient was not in all of the cases there was only an eighth of the cases.

626
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:30,080
Document it. And if you work in the operating room, well, there are circulating nurses and other people that come in and out of rooms all the time.

627
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:38,360
And so it's not uncommon that someone would not necessarily be on the record of having been is more.

628
01:18:38,450 --> 01:18:47,180
She was a circulating nurse so she did go like if something needed to be fetched, she would bring it into the room and maybe not get documented.

629
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:58,640
She also had a habit of doing calisthenics in the prep room, which a workroom which is attached to the operating room,

630
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:04,310
which is why they think it may have aerosolized a little bit.

631
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:09,080
So they went back, filled in some information.

632
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:14,419
This is an old study, but so the graph looks a little bit faded, which it is.

633
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:22,760
But she had had a fever and pharyngitis in March, and then she got a diarrheal illness.

634
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:36,710
Remember, she had it in her rectal region, which means she probably was GI colonized, so she had more bacteria probably at that point.

635
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:51,930
And then it faded away. She got a herpes outbreak, which also probably increased the colonization burden so that she became a spreader again.

636
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:58,540
So this happens with people who carry a staph aureus in their nasal passages.

637
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:06,860
That's where we carry staph. If you get a cold or allergies, the bacteria multiply in numbers.

638
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:14,299
So we have had situations where MRSA carrier doesn't cause infection, doesn't do anything.

639
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:21,190
But then when they get a cold or flu or any respiratory symptoms, it's disseminated.

640
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:25,670
So the dissemination is what we always focus on. So she got treated with penicillin.

641
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:30,829
So this was interesting because this was aerosolized.

642
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:34,580
I mean, yes. In her hands it was. Yes.

643
01:20:34,670 --> 01:20:45,530
Passing gas and so forth. And. Yes, and a feature of this in the paper, which I was reluctant to say because it sounds sexist.

644
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:51,980
But she also wore dresses as opposed to pants, which I think also allowed for aerosolization.

645
01:20:54,500 --> 01:21:01,880
And then the with she probably got a little worked up and sweaty hot when she did her calisthenics in the workroom.

646
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:08,210
So all of these things you don't think about but become extremely important for dissemination.

647
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:13,370
So she got penicillin. What do you want to do now? Done.

648
01:21:13,850 --> 01:21:17,140
Right. Are we done? Evaluate. Yes.

649
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:23,540
You continue to watch, so you have to continue to. How will you continue to evaluate?

650
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:32,290
You want to recapture her? Not a bad idea, right?

651
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:43,350
So how long do you want to recapture her? How long it would take for the infection?

652
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:53,580
Well, infection to clear would be about ten days. Um, she went months, about a month there.

653
01:21:54,690 --> 01:21:59,010
So we want to go at least a month, right? Recall to make sure she's not carrying it.

654
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:04,020
Um, and then anything else you want to do?

655
01:22:07,450 --> 01:22:14,110
You want to. Yes. Coltrane Katrina patients that she works with culturing patients or.

656
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:20,230
Yeah. What else about the patients it makes you want to look for?

657
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:28,850
Probably infections, right? Yeah. Okay. Yes.

658
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:36,950
We're going to do surveillance for infection. So they she was taken off all our dirty duties and treated for ten days.

659
01:22:36,950 --> 01:22:40,219
Follow up cultures at ten days were negative.

660
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:46,070
She returned to work cultures at one and three months later were negative.

661
01:22:46,610 --> 01:22:50,989
And then they stopped. And then five months later, two more cases.

662
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:55,610
A group strep appeared and she was removed from clinical duties.

663
01:22:56,660 --> 01:23:02,870
Because she's a chronic carrier, it's really hard to get rid of group based strep, especially in the intestinal track.

664
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:09,079
So she was not allowed to work in patient care or do duties anymore.

665
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:12,350
So that was the end.

666
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:21,150
Any questions? They're not always decent, dramatic.

667
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:24,720
We have two more case situations, but we should take a break or no.

668
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:29,800
Do we take a break usually or no. If you want that, would you? There would be any comments.

669
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:33,490
I've spoken. Okay.

670
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:38,190
The other the next two, because we have worked through the process next to go faster.

671
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:41,290
In fact, the last one I usually just breezed through.

672
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:53,930
I agree. And I think if you look.

673
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:15,570
I grew up in the last century. Oh, yeah.

674
01:24:19,630 --> 01:24:35,600
She said, you're right. He's. It's not like it was, you know, they were aiming to try to get ahead.

675
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:42,200
And she also a lot of people are losing their affection.

676
01:24:42,530 --> 01:25:01,790
I mean, after all these started, I don't know, the hours and they don't recognize any one great 32 year veteran, by the way, out there mentally.

677
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:09,230
Well, we got an email about this one a while.

678
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:19,910
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

679
01:25:20,030 --> 01:25:30,350
Okay. So you have your own families, but this is really for one thing.

680
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:36,890
And then we feel like like I think that's going to be exactly exactly like I said,

681
01:25:37,910 --> 01:25:49,969
we had this as far as I felt like I was going to have to move to where it was.

682
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:54,670
100 oh. Oh oh.

683
01:25:58,030 --> 01:26:16,860
Oh, God, no. But yeah, we feel like you guys are absolutely right in thinking that we might have to involved.

684
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:44,760
I didn't learn anything. Anything like when you were on or something like that, but you're allowed to do it?

685
01:26:46,210 --> 01:26:52,140
Well, yes, I think I did 20 years ago.

686
01:26:54,130 --> 01:26:56,620
Oh, well, I mean, you know,

687
01:26:56,900 --> 01:27:14,760
I also I think I issue it's not like I think the film like happened with your with your parents speaking to you out of your fears.

688
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:21,770
You on what I.

689
01:27:29,190 --> 01:27:38,990
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

690
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:44,100
Are you doing that?

691
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:49,890
I yeah. I don't know.

692
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:55,300
I don't. I think about it.

693
01:27:55,860 --> 01:28:00,780
I mean, they say that like now they're saying.

694
01:28:00,790 --> 01:28:14,730
But I know from my friends, I remember when I was 24 years old and they were like,

695
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:21,910
that's why I was thinking, I wonder if, you know, I just thought, well, I agree with you.

696
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:27,770
I think the same way I guess what to is take a walk away the.

697
01:28:28,630 --> 01:28:35,080
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you're right.

698
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:44,180
Yeah. I might not be able to tell you that.

699
01:28:45,740 --> 01:29:04,190
Certainly not. I think that, you know, I didn't know what to do with her, like, oh, I do something like that.

700
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:15,550
So I understand. I don't know what I want to do.

701
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:22,860
It's a lot. Why don't you go first?

702
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:27,760
How much?

703
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:32,920
What's more important? For 20 hours in the middle.

704
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:40,450
Know, but. Exactly right.

705
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:52,150
Yeah, yeah, I guess. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

706
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:57,890
So that's how they saw I mean, that's why they have a difference in the public so that.

707
01:29:58,370 --> 01:30:03,139
Yeah, but it's like, it's kind of like you differentiate. I like I smell something.

708
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:19,640
I have a word for it. Yeah. Like if Red had a word, you see the important it's important for to get to know the other.

709
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:26,910
While the players need to start developing. So they have the time.

710
01:30:28,180 --> 01:30:37,270
I need more time for them because afterwards and again, people keep saying something like that happens.

711
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:52,970
Instead of trying to calm down, no one really knows right at the moment.

712
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:05,530
Everyone was like, Oh, are you going to jump around?

713
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:27,680
I think of the journey with friends back in South Africa.

714
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:40,010
I don't want to find out like other people is that many European countries, Europeans are much more divided with Europe.

715
01:31:42,010 --> 01:31:49,660
Extremely well. Should I wait till they get back to work?

716
01:31:51,070 --> 01:31:55,700
That's because you know that right now.

717
01:31:57,460 --> 01:32:01,930
That's right. You know, I like that story.

718
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:06,040
Okay. Why don't we go ahead and get started on the second outbreak?

719
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:18,070
This is also a surgical outbreak. They're not all surgical, but they're the they're the easiest to figure out and report.

720
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:21,340
So and they tend to be a little more dramatic.

721
01:32:21,820 --> 01:32:27,700
Like I said, these have come from these have come from the literature.

722
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:31,060
So they've always figured out what's going on.

723
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:36,220
So between August 28th and September 28th,

724
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:45,220
you the infection prevention s was worse notified of six post-operative Serratia Masterson's infections at hospital eight.

725
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:53,440
These are cardiac I didn't put that they're they're cardiac infections they also you've

726
01:32:53,440 --> 01:33:00,220
also found a Serratia Masterson's infection in a patient who had vascular surgery.

727
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:05,710
So if you would divide up into your groups, you should be able to do this much faster.

728
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:20,530
So I'll give you about 10 minutes, let's say, to figure out how you, well, confirm the epidemic, find cases and develop a case definition.

729
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:29,350
Remember, verify the diagnosis. Meaning, what do you know about this bacteria?

730
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:35,590
Is it a human bacteria like the last one we saw and where what?

731
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:38,680
You know about Serratia Masterson's.

732
01:33:39,010 --> 01:33:45,129
So that can help guide you. So why don't you take about 10 minutes if you need longer?

733
01:33:45,130 --> 01:33:54,040
We can always give longer. But I think the steps are the same, and the process is pretty much going to be the same because it's very similar.

734
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:59,860
So you have six cardiac infections and one vascular surgery infection.

735
01:34:01,710 --> 01:34:07,120
Okay. If you want to get into your same groups, be prepared.

736
01:34:07,410 --> 01:34:13,600
Get a spokesperson to help answer this.

737
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:24,450
The first four steps I know where they lands in that guy's answer as the time in their lives is one.

738
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:42,630
I can't wait to see it.

739
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:55,200
So it is really going to be about an animal.

740
01:34:55,860 --> 01:35:08,550
That's right. And which ones are causing the reactions in humans?

741
01:35:08,670 --> 01:35:11,270
Animal Planet. They are minor as well.

742
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:23,639
So, yes, I think that, you know, the business of making this happen and now being able to turn this without any surgeries in that second week,

743
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:30,650
or does 90% of its organism are as centralized as right now?

744
01:35:30,890 --> 01:35:36,570
Yeah, yeah. I'm going to be turning 39 and I forget.

745
01:35:36,570 --> 01:36:11,040
Yeah, I think I realized that, you know, I, I should have taken my phone off for a year in Babylon five years ago because I think,

746
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:17,790
you know, that word would be different from what is your opinion.

747
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:25,200
I think it has nothing to do with autism over the last two years as well.

748
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:29,410
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. Something like that.

749
01:36:29,430 --> 01:36:32,810
Because you have to factor in science to figure out what they're saying.

750
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:55,440
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Just building foundation or I did I did have to say that the person that I think is really, really inspiring that that's.

751
01:36:57,230 --> 01:37:10,480
Yeah. I said, Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

752
01:37:11,070 --> 01:37:14,080
So we're very excited.

753
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:17,730
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

754
01:37:17,730 --> 01:37:28,780
I haven't been biggest brag when I watch to see how it's going to be, for instance.

755
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:34,409
Well, I actually think I think it's probably a preview.

756
01:37:34,410 --> 01:37:37,680
I don't think there's going to be.

757
01:37:37,990 --> 01:37:45,860
Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm sorry. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

758
01:37:45,940 --> 01:37:51,540
Oh, yeah. I was like, I could be like, probably every.

759
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:56,080
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Right. This is like.

760
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

761
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:12,720
So everything we have in common with the water producers and stuff like it's in there I think we can take away from and a lot people have.

762
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:16,080
Yeah. Well I guess it's okay.

763
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:25,979
Oh yeah, I know. And I kind of think about what's the next goal because their only party is one night stand together.

764
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:32,050
But I guess the third meeting right now.

765
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:39,090
I'm so sorry. Yeah, I like.

766
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:44,010
I just wanted to ask you, how big is the most logical place?

767
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:50,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, that's what I think.

768
01:38:50,990 --> 01:38:54,330
That's really, you know.

769
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:10,910
Yes. I'm looking for the future for the company.

770
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:22,120
Oh. Oh, I'm unconfirmed. Academic is part of the community.

771
01:39:22,740 --> 01:39:27,120
I mean, it's like, you're right.

772
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:44,320
I do think that, you know, you are in that category.

773
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:49,680
What did you do? And then we would.

774
01:39:49,680 --> 01:40:13,080
And like right now. Yeah. You know, it's an opportunity to involve national officials, especially like they're going to be culturally.

775
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:22,670
Yeah. Like you're probably I think you're trying to people like, you know,

776
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:32,489
we keep talking about exactly the same things and then they'd be like, I'm so glad you're here because they like doing these takes.

777
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:38,460
So much to see where there might be something.

778
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:42,690
Yeah. Yeah.

779
01:40:42,810 --> 01:40:46,550
So that's the first horse.

780
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:51,310
And there's going to be seems to be trying to figure out.

781
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:58,920
Oh, no, I don't know.

782
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:05,640
You're working as a culture unit in terms of Toronto.

783
01:41:05,850 --> 01:41:10,889
And so we think so because you guys are just like everything else, relentless.

784
01:41:10,890 --> 01:41:28,050
So, you know, the two things, you know, that I would ask her out of the coalition forces or the other nations.

785
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:32,550
Yes. Yeah.

786
01:41:33,070 --> 01:41:37,200
Another just it might be the specifics about it.

787
01:41:37,410 --> 01:41:41,460
It might be in a specific. Yeah. Like the specific surgery location.

788
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:50,700
Yeah. It seems a different commonality, you know, I guess a common interest for a long time later on.

789
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:58,230
Yeah, exactly. Including recurrent infections among that same population.

790
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:08,150
And I've heard a lot and then finding. Culture is a license that.

791
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,100
WERMAN So culturally it's big time.

792
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:29,460
I mean actually because I started with and I feel like, you know, I don't know, I think it's interesting enough how it would be if you like culture.

793
01:42:31,370 --> 01:42:34,800
Never do that. Yeah, I know.

794
01:42:37,010 --> 01:42:41,150
Because I can hear a lull. We're about at 10 minutes out.

795
01:42:42,530 --> 01:42:48,650
So let's work through the first four steps.

796
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:52,640
I'll start with this group. I think we've started elsewhere before.

797
01:42:55,850 --> 01:43:00,830
Tell me, first of all, what you found out about Serratia marsh since.

798
01:43:02,570 --> 01:43:11,270
We found that it can be found in the water and soil and in plants commonly, and that it does cause also human infection.

799
01:43:11,270 --> 01:43:14,509
And it's commonly an opportunistic infection in humans.

800
01:43:14,510 --> 01:43:18,170
So like usually healthy individuals would not be getting this infection.

801
01:43:19,700 --> 01:43:29,990
Yeah, we found that like, um, it can be found like on fomites like equipment commonly is implicated in nosocomial

802
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:34,639
outbreaks of three few more seasons and then also like in water systems.

803
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:42,260
And I think we also found one instance where it was like found out of soap dispenser and, and that there's usually person to person spread.

804
01:43:43,180 --> 01:43:46,230
I'm sorry. She Masterson's good.

805
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:50,780
Yeah. So it's a gram negative. It's. I think it is an indoor bacteria.

806
01:43:50,790 --> 01:43:57,389
Okay, it. When you culture it, it turns red, which is what its name implies.

807
01:43:57,390 --> 01:44:10,469
That has nothing to do with any of this. But, yes, it's something that can get on things and it can live in water, which is unique.

808
01:44:10,470 --> 01:44:20,160
There aren't that many things that actually survive and grow in water that you can find them in there, but they're usually much more transient.

809
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:29,700
So the good this group over here, how did you want to confirm an epidemic?

810
01:44:33,870 --> 01:44:38,820
It's just culture. So are you sure you're going to culture first Asia?

811
01:44:39,210 --> 01:44:43,410
Well, we have a culture and we should promote republic culture.

812
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:52,440
But communities specifically the central lines like ventilators that we use on the patients.

813
01:44:52,770 --> 01:44:59,580
Maybe there was a common machine that was used against multiple patients that hadn't been properly disinfected between the patient and the cases.

814
01:44:59,970 --> 01:45:06,810
So we want to evaluate that the central lines that we use, any ventilators used to determine serrations from the those.

815
01:45:06,870 --> 01:45:14,970
Okay. How do you know if this is a real difference from what you would typically see?

816
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:18,990
Because Serratia Serratia is around.

817
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:24,180
How do you decide if this is an actual epidemic?

818
01:45:24,780 --> 01:45:31,710
You would compare the rates that you have with any baseline in the hospital or from the CDC.

819
01:45:32,050 --> 01:45:38,550
Yes. What would be. Well, yeah. You want to look at what the CDC has to say as far as Serratia and other infections?

820
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:48,850
You'd want to look at your infection control records. And one of the things that we have done in the past is to look at Microbe Records.

821
01:45:48,870 --> 01:45:55,540
We want to look at micro records. Ask him to.

822
01:45:56,380 --> 01:45:59,680
Right now we know that some cardiac and vascular surgery.

823
01:45:59,980 --> 01:46:03,340
Right. Do we know is that the extent of the problem?

824
01:46:04,870 --> 01:46:18,250
Maybe not. Maybe not. So we need to ask the medical records for medical records of Serratia cultures going back a lot and.

825
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:30,970
Yeah. Probably a year. Yeah. And then based on that, you will find cases.

826
01:46:31,630 --> 01:46:34,600
But confirming and finding cases, like I said,

827
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:43,570
is really mushed together as you go back to see if there was anything going on before you see a few missed patients that needed to be included.

828
01:46:44,230 --> 01:46:54,820
So what is your case definition? Soon to be patients who had an operation were infected with Serratia.

829
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:59,290
But probably between the beginning of August and into October, probably.

830
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:06,809
Okay. So you went a little before and a little bit after I said any patient getting surgery that

831
01:47:06,810 --> 01:47:13,200
developed and you want to confine it necessarily to vascular and cardiac at this point?

832
01:47:15,070 --> 01:47:21,690
Um, definitely vascular I would say more just because you tend to have that random one that

833
01:47:21,690 --> 01:47:25,880
was vascular like definitely cardiac with because there's one that's outside of maybe.

834
01:47:25,950 --> 01:47:34,950
Yeah. So at this point you may not want to say until, you know, you have all your cases, you may not want to say vascular and cardiac surgery,

835
01:47:34,950 --> 01:47:43,020
but once you get all your cases and see that it's only cardiac and vascular, then you would go ahead and do it.

836
01:47:45,930 --> 01:47:59,220
So what they were able to find was that there were six out of 31 cardiac surgery patients, which gives a rate of 19.4 per 100 procedures.

837
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:04,169
That's really, really high. This is a this is what we call a clean procedure.

838
01:48:04,170 --> 01:48:11,940
And generally, I mean, we're go for zero infections, but you want always to be less than one.

839
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:20,430
One infection is what we consider to be kind of the upper limit of normal for a clean procedure.

840
01:48:20,670 --> 01:48:27,390
Vascular surgery, there was one out of 29, which is about a 3.5 infections per 100 procedure.

841
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:34,170
There were five patients, had surgical site infection, only two had bacteremia and one death.

842
01:48:36,630 --> 01:48:41,880
They went back a year and there were no Serratia infections in cardiac or vascular surgery.

843
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:54,660
Overall, the national surgical site infection rate for cardiac procedure was 1.1 infections per 100 procedure, and 1% of them were due to Serratia.

844
01:48:55,950 --> 01:48:59,609
So do you have a do you have an outbreak? Yes.

845
01:48:59,610 --> 01:49:06,670
Can you draw your epidemic curve? I went ahead and did it for you.

846
01:49:08,260 --> 01:49:11,260
And that I did it by month. And that's your curve.

847
01:49:11,290 --> 01:49:14,350
There was nothing. Nothing. Seven cases in a month.

848
01:49:15,190 --> 01:49:21,549
If you had it by week, you could spread it out. But it would still be what looks like a common source.

849
01:49:21,550 --> 01:49:24,910
Right? This does not look like person to person.

850
01:49:25,330 --> 01:49:29,620
But based on what we know with Serratia, it's not likely to be person to person.

851
01:49:31,450 --> 01:49:34,810
And they had a case definition of any patient.

852
01:49:34,930 --> 01:49:42,069
Once they read the case finding, they could say any patient undergoing cardiovascular or vascular surgery between August 16th

853
01:49:42,070 --> 01:49:46,720
through September 28 who developed a post-operative infection with Serratia Masterson's.

854
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:51,640
They reviewed all charts of patients undergoing surgery.

855
01:49:51,670 --> 01:49:58,450
They didn't have that many, so they also pulled microbiology records for all.

856
01:49:58,450 --> 01:50:05,140
Serratia Masterson's going back a year. What intervention would you do in the intervention right now?

857
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:14,730
You're going to be communicating again. You're sure? You know, your hospital administrators do not like to find out about this from the news.

858
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:21,010
Some of these died. This could get to the news. You want to let your administrators know.

859
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:26,110
You want to let your public relations people know. You want to let your risk management people know.

860
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:30,040
You definitely want to let the hospital epidemiologist,

861
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:39,460
Dr. Stoneman will not like walking down the hall and getting affronted by one of her colleagues about what's going on in the operating room.

862
01:50:43,650 --> 01:50:47,430
What else do you want to do? Yes.

863
01:50:47,730 --> 01:50:51,000
Would you stop the car? Use her cardiovascular surgery?

864
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:56,090
You know what? If people think the administrators are going, you can't close by.

865
01:50:56,100 --> 01:50:59,250
All our surgeons are going, I got to do my surgery.

866
01:51:02,410 --> 01:51:06,940
It's a massive rate. It's a very high rate and people are dying.

867
01:51:08,410 --> 01:51:15,100
There have been seven cases in a month. So they did stop operations.

868
01:51:15,430 --> 01:51:22,570
Did you have to do all of the O.R. in this case? Doesn't look like it's outside of the cardiac or vascular.

869
01:51:23,230 --> 01:51:28,960
So what do you do next?

870
01:51:32,150 --> 01:51:39,950
What do you want to put on your line listing? Surgeon.

871
01:51:39,950 --> 01:51:43,940
Information surgeon. I'll just do this all together.

872
01:51:43,970 --> 01:51:47,060
Surgeon information. Operating room.

873
01:51:47,270 --> 01:51:52,570
Operating room. Anybody else in the operating room?

874
01:51:53,950 --> 01:51:58,660
Nurses. Nurses? Yes, anesthesiologists.

875
01:51:59,290 --> 01:52:08,770
All the people coming and going in the operating room. Right. What about devices used?

876
01:52:08,950 --> 01:52:15,780
This is where actually you might want other devices, right? Everything is with that because it's post-operative.

877
01:52:15,790 --> 01:52:22,300
So if I didn't have to do that or on my catheters or ventilators or central.

878
01:52:23,390 --> 01:52:31,320
Okay. So you want to look at the processes and the activities that are happening after the operating room.

879
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:36,990
And I will tell you that we've had some problems with surgical site infections,

880
01:52:36,990 --> 01:52:47,400
because generally we like to keep the surgical wound closed until until it has healed enough that you could take the dressing off.

881
01:52:47,730 --> 01:52:52,320
But we've had situations where the nurses like to clean it up and make it look clean.

882
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:57,900
And so they take the dressing off and get water. Tap water has bacteria in it.

883
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:01,890
That's not what happened in this case. So I'm not giving you. But that is right.

884
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:06,150
You want to look at the processes, equipment all along the way.

885
01:53:07,650 --> 01:53:13,500
All right. There were 55 patients who had surgery.

886
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:16,590
31 were cardiac. 24 were vascular.

887
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:20,970
Seven met the case definition, which is 13%, very, very high.

888
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:28,890
They looked at age, race, gender weight, BMI, co-morbidities, diabetes, smoking, previous infections,

889
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:37,200
and put that into their line listing to see if there was something about patients that might be causing it.

890
01:53:37,230 --> 01:53:40,780
They also looked at all the factors that you said.

891
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:49,340
So. Just to get together this very, very quickly and come up with a hypothesis or if you want to,

892
01:53:49,340 --> 01:53:53,930
just somebody wants to tell me what they think is going on.

893
01:53:57,980 --> 01:54:04,940
We can do it together. If somebody is brave enough to do that. If you want to do it as a group and come up with a plan or an idea.

894
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:11,090
We already did the interventions. We closed that operating room while we're waiting to figure this out.

895
01:54:13,670 --> 01:54:18,409
You're not going to come up with what happened here. So it's okay.

896
01:54:18,410 --> 01:54:25,730
But just think about what are the things that you which might be happening and how you go about testing.

897
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:35,280
Part of the intervention is doing culture in two. So tell me if you if you think you want a culture, what you're going to do.

898
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:55,160
All right. Take 5 minutes. Anybody who's a they're crazy.

899
01:54:55,170 --> 01:55:02,470
They're they're going to give you a guy like that.

900
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:11,150
This is like the Civil War. You can surprise the audience here with.

901
01:55:17,650 --> 01:55:38,940
Do you think maybe we can start the process of your existing right where the treatment is like the regular part of this entire story?

902
01:55:39,070 --> 01:55:49,650
Yeah, because the CBC, you have like it's going to be all right, but if it isn't.

903
01:55:55,840 --> 01:56:03,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is very much like.

904
01:56:05,070 --> 01:56:18,330
Yeah, that's the point of the whole thing.

905
01:56:18,580 --> 01:56:21,880
This is something that I could just be completely and crazy.

906
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:34,710
It could be zero. You can also feel it is possible that, well, if it's not you're simply busy with your life is something that.

907
01:56:36,390 --> 01:56:43,080
Just because they think something's going to happen, that they weren't thinking like a serious matter shooting at the border.

908
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:51,800
So they have to pay for a lot of cases and categorizations like you do, like certain chapters here.

909
01:56:51,810 --> 01:57:05,870
And I were just so happy and they're like, there's no way they look at people and how they made that one.

910
01:57:06,540 --> 01:57:12,060
Yeah, but one of the.

911
01:57:14,710 --> 01:57:18,060
Yeah. Well, I guess I don't know.

912
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:21,989
I don't know how it is. I don't know. What are you saying?

913
01:57:21,990 --> 01:57:27,760
What's going to happen to my interest?

914
01:57:27,810 --> 01:57:38,720
Right. But it's hard to see. All right, so it's under this order for us just because, you know, okay,

915
01:57:38,790 --> 01:57:50,350
we're interested in what business groups hypothesis that it could be associated with someone like, um.

916
01:57:52,290 --> 01:57:57,510
Within the hour or four where the servers are being done.

917
01:57:57,810 --> 01:58:07,010
Okay. And any interventions that you wanted to do. I mean, I guess coaching the device, interacting its use.

918
01:58:08,020 --> 01:58:11,160
Um, Houlton.

919
01:58:11,550 --> 01:58:14,790
Common order. Okay, great.

920
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:21,780
Yes. Also making sure that we're, like, taking care of the devices, like, you know, like the things that they're actually properly.

921
01:58:21,810 --> 01:58:28,890
Yes. Yes. You would definitely want to be looking at the processes for all the devices.

922
01:58:28,930 --> 01:58:33,460
Pre-op in the hot in the operating room and post-op.

923
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:39,299
Yes. What was your hypothesis when you said a lot of the same stuff around the devices?

924
01:58:39,300 --> 01:58:47,070
And we also said I'm not sure I might have missed it if we also said looking at like sinks and faucets and stuff like that.

925
01:58:47,070 --> 01:58:50,520
Drains, maybe? Mm hmm. Humidifiers, if there are any.

926
01:58:50,730 --> 01:58:54,600
Yeah, since it is commonly found in water.

927
01:58:55,050 --> 01:58:58,290
Okay, good. And what was your hypothesis?

928
01:58:59,700 --> 01:59:03,200
Kind of the same thing. Same thing? Yeah. Okay. Look at the.

929
01:59:03,210 --> 01:59:07,560
All the equipment. Okay. Where are you guys going? To culture also.

930
01:59:07,680 --> 01:59:10,800
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right.

931
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:18,710
So let's see. They did their case control, so they made their line listing, put everything into an access file.

932
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:23,010
They got their controls. Actually, controls were everybody.

933
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:28,500
They did a cohort study basically looking at everybody that underwent these surgeries.

934
01:59:28,980 --> 01:59:39,780
What they found was that their say was involved in seven out of 22, all of the patients.

935
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:44,639
Seven out of 22 of the patients that were exposed to Nurse A became infected.

936
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:51,240
And none of the patients who were not exposed to her were infected.

937
01:59:51,660 --> 01:59:57,060
And then there were others that also were common.

938
01:59:58,290 --> 02:00:04,349
They looked at ICU beds, DNA that had some association.

939
02:00:04,350 --> 02:00:14,399
But this is where you get into real problems, because if patients with vascular surgery tend to go to D and E in the ICU beds,

940
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:18,750
then you if the same is true for operating rooms,

941
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:28,740
if those surgeries are always done in operating room B or one or two, then it's going to show up as positive.

942
02:00:29,070 --> 02:00:38,250
But then we looked at this very uniquely and found that if they had surgery on Monday,

943
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:48,210
the risk of infection was much higher and then afternoon surgery was less.

944
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:59,030
They actually had less infections if it was in the afternoon. So anybody want to change their hypothesis?

945
02:01:01,620 --> 02:01:04,800
Yeah. I hope that we're pretty similar.

946
02:01:05,100 --> 02:01:09,120
Yeah. Yeah. And now you've got some data suggesting.

947
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:18,420
Hmm, this may be health care related, health care worker related, and we may want to do some culturing.

948
02:01:19,230 --> 02:01:23,340
So and in general, that would be very problematic.

949
02:01:23,350 --> 02:01:31,470
Where do you culture on a health care worker? Right. But the hands of the personnel may be important.

950
02:01:32,550 --> 02:01:38,290
If there's a sink, it may be that the health care workers picking it up on the sink going.

951
02:01:38,310 --> 02:01:44,340
So they did a graph that looks like this, which is very different.

952
02:01:44,430 --> 02:01:46,589
It's not one that we usually do.

953
02:01:46,590 --> 02:01:54,270
And I don't know how they they obviously collected when what day of the week and what time of day that the surgery was done.

954
02:01:54,630 --> 02:01:58,980
And then they decided to graph it out and it looks like this.

955
02:02:02,130 --> 02:02:11,190
And then it they didn't graph it out. But the if the if they got surgery in the morning, patients were more likely to get infected.

956
02:02:13,290 --> 02:02:17,250
Anybody want to change their. Their hypothesis.

957
02:02:20,810 --> 02:02:24,920
This is a CDC evaluation. It's not something that we would typically do.

958
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:34,880
We might pinpoint it down to a nurse. Well, they did, Mike.

959
02:02:35,150 --> 02:02:40,400
They did PFG, pulse filled gel electrophoresis. And all the strains that they were able to do.

960
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:48,770
The molecular testing were the same. They did hand cultures, including two from Nurse A, that were negative.

961
02:02:49,580 --> 02:02:55,430
They did 600 hospital environmental cultures, which you guys wanted to do, which were negative.

962
02:02:57,140 --> 02:03:01,950
So then they got permission to go into the home of the nurse.

963
02:03:01,970 --> 02:03:10,150
This is the part we don't do. We're not. We don't operate like house where he goes and cultures the dog or whatever.

964
02:03:12,590 --> 02:03:20,500
The nurse consented to allow there to go into her home and they must have gotten this information for that.

965
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:25,040
For that reason, she had gotten this.

966
02:03:26,270 --> 02:03:30,200
It's organic. There's no preservative in it.

967
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:35,959
It's not foliar cream that was made from almond shells and lipids.

968
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:40,540
And she kept it in her shower. That's why they went into the home.

969
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:48,410
So she did this on the weekend. That was her self-care that she liked to do on the weekend.

970
02:03:49,850 --> 02:03:53,510
More importantly, she handled this sterile equipment.

971
02:03:53,540 --> 02:03:58,370
She retracted she irrigated wounds. She wore artificial nails.

972
02:03:58,670 --> 02:04:05,540
So artificial nails are something that is really not supposed to happen in health.

973
02:04:05,570 --> 02:04:11,120
We don't want them in our health care system at all. But in the operating room, that should not be used.

974
02:04:11,220 --> 02:04:20,950
I've we've had another outbreak associated with artificial nails because they get too heavily colonized with bacteria.

975
02:04:21,080 --> 02:04:25,760
They also break through the gloves much more easily.

976
02:04:26,870 --> 02:04:31,370
And so what would be your intervention at this point?

977
02:04:38,260 --> 02:04:42,070
Yeah. Take off her nails.

978
02:04:42,310 --> 02:04:50,650
Make her take off her nails and tell her to stop keeping her her stuff in the shower.

979
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:54,940
Maybe. Don't even use it, please. You could ask the question.

980
02:04:54,940 --> 02:04:58,010
I don't think you could. So they reopened the operating room.

981
02:04:58,030 --> 02:05:00,040
They discarded the exfoliant cream.

982
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:08,380
They reinforced a policy that they actually had in place, which was that no artificial nails could be used in the operating room.

983
02:05:08,380 --> 02:05:15,250
And then, of course, you always do more surveillance, make sure that your everything is working.

984
02:05:16,810 --> 02:05:21,250
Yes. I'm curious, like, how does the transmission happen been?

985
02:05:21,250 --> 02:05:27,190
So was 6 billion including. But. But she walked it off.

986
02:05:27,190 --> 02:05:33,270
And then when she was tested, it was negative. So did it past three weeks.

987
02:05:34,280 --> 02:05:38,210
Yeah. So she did the she did the Exfoliant cream on the weekend.

988
02:05:38,750 --> 02:05:42,770
So the colonization was highest in the early week and then it washed off.

989
02:05:43,220 --> 02:05:51,170
So it did wash off over the week. So I don't know. They never told us what day of the week they did cultures of her hands.

990
02:05:51,830 --> 02:05:56,330
They also may not have gotten in and around the the nails where it would be hiding.

991
02:05:57,500 --> 02:06:01,300
So it's not clear that they went along this process.

992
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:13,340
If it was here, she may not have been carrying it anymore and then she re recolonize herself on the weekend and it wore off again.

993
02:06:14,060 --> 02:06:17,389
So we know this is unusual. This is not what we usually do.

994
02:06:17,390 --> 02:06:21,110
But people were being very astute and paying attention to all the details.

995
02:06:21,110 --> 02:06:26,300
So. But the major things you guys all got.

996
02:06:27,830 --> 02:06:36,160
All right. Any questions? All right, we'll do this one together.

997
02:06:36,170 --> 02:06:47,170
It's fast. We have. We have time and we should get done early, get everybody out last day.

998
02:06:48,810 --> 02:06:51,720
So you're contacted. This is actually one that happened here.

999
02:06:51,780 --> 02:07:02,309
We wrote it up and we were contacted by microbiology lab that they have had identified seven isolates

1000
02:07:02,310 --> 02:07:10,770
of Clostridium so Delhi from clinical specimens from six patients over a seven week period.

1001
02:07:12,030 --> 02:07:16,920
Well, what I want you to do, everybody do that's who has access.

1002
02:07:17,550 --> 02:07:27,780
Find out what you can about Clostridium. SAADAWI Because verifying the diagnosis becomes very important in this case.

1003
02:07:28,190 --> 02:07:31,830
Okay, so some of you may have heard about it.

1004
02:07:32,370 --> 02:07:41,340
It's not common that we see it that often. But find out what you need to know about Clostridium Saadawi.

1005
02:08:06,700 --> 02:08:10,810
Yes. Is it that it causes toxic shock syndrome? Yes.

1006
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:15,570
Toxic shock syndrome. In what setting? Anything more about that?

1007
02:08:15,580 --> 02:08:19,000
So it's when it causes an infection, it's bad.

1008
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:23,589
Bad infections. But we haven't heard of it much.

1009
02:08:23,590 --> 02:08:30,520
Right. So people walking around are not necessarily likely to get Clostridium difficile or Stella infection.

1010
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:35,560
Yes. That's a common gynecological procedure, right?

1011
02:08:35,590 --> 02:08:43,870
Childbirth and abortion. Yes. So it generally happens in women post procedure.

1012
02:08:45,790 --> 02:08:53,560
So that's one thing that you need to keep in mind, that it's got a lot of toxins, makes people very sick.

1013
02:08:54,100 --> 02:08:57,370
And it happens usually in a certain setting.

1014
02:08:57,370 --> 02:09:00,699
Not that it can't cause infection in other people.

1015
02:09:00,700 --> 02:09:03,850
It could cause a very bad surgical site infection, for example.

1016
02:09:05,590 --> 02:09:09,160
All right. So how will you confirm your epidemic?

1017
02:09:11,050 --> 02:09:17,200
You're talking to the micro lab. What's the one question you want to ask them?

1018
02:09:17,200 --> 02:09:20,440
They say I've got seven of these over a seven week period.

1019
02:09:23,430 --> 02:09:28,530
What did you have for the year? Yeah. How many have you had in the year prior?

1020
02:09:30,390 --> 02:09:37,050
Can you make a case definition? You don't have a patient and.

1021
02:09:41,610 --> 02:09:44,910
We've got six patients who have a culture.

1022
02:09:47,530 --> 02:09:53,880
Should we make that our definition? Yeah.

1023
02:09:54,300 --> 02:10:05,879
Okay. We can start by saying we have any patient who has a cluster team or Delhi culture during

1024
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:11,190
this six week period and maybe going back to two months and going forward two months.

1025
02:10:12,480 --> 02:10:18,090
Okay. So we have we are going to ascertain find patients how.

1026
02:10:20,340 --> 02:10:26,490
We've already done it, right? We've asked them to go back a year. Tell us all the cluster items orderly that you've had.

1027
02:10:28,260 --> 02:10:37,410
So they reviewed the previous year records and there were no Clostridium sadeghi isolates in any clinical specimens that were sent to the micro lab.

1028
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:48,090
The definition was any patient with Clostridium sadeghi isolated in the clinical specimens didn't tell you the months,

1029
02:10:48,090 --> 02:10:53,550
but it's basically those seven weeks with a little bit extra on both sides.

1030
02:10:55,920 --> 02:11:04,110
And we looked back through infection control records, which wouldn't find any because we already know the micro lab never reported it.

1031
02:11:04,740 --> 02:11:13,530
We don't have it if somebody else had reported it and it got cold to us, but there were no infections associated with cluster clostridium or Delhi.

1032
02:11:16,620 --> 02:11:33,320
What do you want to do next? You're going to urbanize.

1033
02:11:33,350 --> 02:11:37,879
Yeah. Go and see. And, like, kind of observe.

1034
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:40,480
Not really observe. It's very sensitive. So don't observe, but like,

1035
02:11:40,700 --> 02:11:47,329
talk to people who perform like gynecological care and maybe see if you can see any trends

1036
02:11:47,330 --> 02:11:52,580
with like nurses or physicians or anybody who's giving that sort of care to patients.

1037
02:11:52,850 --> 02:11:56,680
Okay. So but first, you'd want the demographic.

1038
02:11:57,150 --> 02:12:03,920
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think. Yeah. What we need to know is, are these happening in gynecological procedures?

1039
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:07,070
Right. So look at who's.

1040
02:12:07,220 --> 02:12:11,240
Who's getting it. Do our line listing basically.

1041
02:12:11,240 --> 02:12:14,870
Right. We've got seven isolates and six patients.

1042
02:12:15,350 --> 02:12:19,610
And we want to know what kind of what was the specimen?

1043
02:12:19,820 --> 02:12:23,000
Because we don't even know that they've had a procedure at this point. Right.

1044
02:12:23,370 --> 02:12:30,590
What? Any procedures? What was the specimen and did they have toxic shock?

1045
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:41,390
Right. All those are going to tell us some information about leading us to whether we should go see gynecology, the gynecology procedures.

1046
02:12:43,010 --> 02:12:49,750
Here's our epidemic curve. Tell you anything.

1047
02:12:54,240 --> 02:12:59,820
We know it goes back a year without any. So it looks like it's probably a common source, right?

1048
02:13:03,600 --> 02:13:12,420
And here's the clinical characteristics of the infection. So the first specimen was chronic sinusitis,

1049
02:13:12,750 --> 02:13:21,390
and it was isolated from a sinus culture where there was also stressed staph aureus and struck Miller Eye.

1050
02:13:21,720 --> 02:13:27,210
One was an inguinal abscess, which was also bacterial.

1051
02:13:27,240 --> 02:13:30,480
One was a foot ulcer. Lots of other bacteria.

1052
02:13:30,900 --> 02:13:37,740
There's a diabetic foot nasal mucosa with chronic rhinosinusitis and there didn't appear to be any infection.

1053
02:13:39,180 --> 02:13:44,670
Bone cold, negative staff and a prosthetic device.

1054
02:13:45,720 --> 02:13:51,150
And then post-operative, which also grew Serratia in a transplant patient.

1055
02:13:51,930 --> 02:13:56,370
And I would tell you, none of them had anything that looked like a toxic shock type syndrome.

1056
02:14:00,350 --> 02:14:04,250
All right. Who wants to venture a hypothesis?

1057
02:14:17,090 --> 02:14:21,110
Is this an epidemic? We have to verify our diagnosis.

1058
02:14:24,490 --> 02:14:29,050
It's an epidemic of cultures, right? Yeah.

1059
02:14:30,220 --> 02:14:34,870
Any. So how might that happen? It's what we call.

1060
02:14:35,230 --> 02:14:39,310
Well, I'll tell you later. Yes. Cultures are contaminated.

1061
02:14:39,610 --> 02:14:43,840
What's that? Maybe the cultures are contaminated at the lab. Yeah.

1062
02:14:43,900 --> 02:14:47,980
So how would that happen? What do you know about Clostridium?

1063
02:14:48,400 --> 02:14:52,930
Hardly anything more you need to know about that bacteria.

1064
02:14:54,310 --> 02:14:57,790
Yes, it's anaerobic. Spore forming. Exactly.

1065
02:14:57,880 --> 02:15:02,320
Survivors. So. Yes. So this is an anaerobe.

1066
02:15:02,650 --> 02:15:05,860
It's a spore. Former. And it.

1067
02:15:06,340 --> 02:15:12,610
So that the spore part means that it can survive on surfaces, just like Clostridium difficile.

1068
02:15:14,230 --> 02:15:23,040
And how do they. Anybody know how you grow an anaerobe in the lab chamber inside a chamber?

1069
02:15:23,050 --> 02:15:25,000
So it's an anaerobic chamber.

1070
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:35,680
It's a big thing, tent like thing that they don't even put their hands in and they kind of use gloves to go in and do everything.

1071
02:15:38,020 --> 02:15:46,930
So anything else anybody knows about clustering, suddenly it's hard to disinfect.

1072
02:15:47,380 --> 02:15:54,850
So to get the hard to disinfect, like it's resistant to things like common disinfectants.

1073
02:15:55,840 --> 02:15:59,140
Oh, yeah. Yeah. It would be hard to disinfect. Right.

1074
02:15:59,980 --> 02:16:03,670
And if it got into the chamber, it may cause problems.

1075
02:16:04,090 --> 02:16:08,140
Question is how to get into the chamber? Because we didn't have any cases.

1076
02:16:08,500 --> 02:16:14,299
We didn't have any infections. So they looked for there.

1077
02:16:14,300 --> 02:16:16,090
There was no epidemiological links.

1078
02:16:16,090 --> 02:16:23,530
You saw that these were all different types of procedures all over the hospital, some of them not even in the hospital.

1079
02:16:23,890 --> 02:16:31,500
It just grew in the culture and it wasn't like they all had the same procedure, so a device carried it.

1080
02:16:31,570 --> 02:16:36,670
That's one of the things that we would look for in this. There's so there's no epidemiological links.

1081
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:40,840
There was no evidence of toxic shock.

1082
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:44,180
So they probably really didn't have infection.

1083
02:16:44,210 --> 02:16:54,970
So we worked through that. The next thing they did was take all of the isolates, actually, Dr. ARONOFF, Emily David ARONOFF did this.

1084
02:16:55,630 --> 02:17:00,730
He happens to work on Clostridium difficile when he was here in the medical school.

1085
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:16,060
So he took the isolates, any type them and he type them against a reference strain that is used in microbiology labs to test various things.

1086
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:21,610
So this reference strain was the same as the outbreak strain.

1087
02:17:23,440 --> 02:17:32,020
And what happened was, prior to a month before this happened, plates,

1088
02:17:32,200 --> 02:17:38,469
the anaerobic plates were prepared outside the anaerobic could and then stored in

1089
02:17:38,470 --> 02:17:45,310
the chamber to do to reduce or reduce them getting into the anaerobic situation.

1090
02:17:47,800 --> 02:17:54,970
They changed that to where they they weren't doing that process anymore.

1091
02:17:55,990 --> 02:18:02,350
It's also just right after they had had a number of students come in there.

1092
02:18:02,520 --> 02:18:04,110
You know, we're a teaching hospital.

1093
02:18:04,120 --> 02:18:14,020
They had medtech students come in and we're using the anaerobic chamber, although there were no direct breaks that they were able to identify.

1094
02:18:14,440 --> 02:18:21,250
So it appears that the the test strain that they were using, their control strain,

1095
02:18:21,700 --> 02:18:29,200
disseminated spores throughout the chamber and had to be thoroughly cleaned.

1096
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:35,950
It couldn't be cleaned with routine disinfectants, as you all have already mentioned, because of the spores.

1097
02:18:36,730 --> 02:18:43,060
They actually went back to using individually packaged, pre reduced media.

1098
02:18:43,960 --> 02:18:48,820
And since that time, there were no clustering classrooms or deli.

1099
02:18:48,830 --> 02:18:51,880
You guys haven't heard anything about any more of these, right?

1100
02:18:52,540 --> 02:18:56,320
Yeah. So we followed up for another eight months.

1101
02:18:56,710 --> 02:18:58,810
So this is what's called a pseudo epidemic.

1102
02:18:59,770 --> 02:19:07,720
And it's gets to the fact that you have to verify in those first few steps, you really have to verify the diagnosis.

1103
02:19:07,780 --> 02:19:16,450
Is this an infection? Is this likely just a contamination situation which happens more often than you think?

1104
02:19:18,130 --> 02:19:21,730
Thankfully, it doesn't happen all the time, but it does happen.

1105
02:19:21,730 --> 02:19:27,790
And so we have to. Make sure that we're dealing with a real infection and not an artifact that happens.

1106
02:19:28,120 --> 02:19:32,320
Now, sometimes, said, Sir, that contamination can happen in the lab.

1107
02:19:32,980 --> 02:19:43,090
The contamination can happen. And for a while we were having blood cultures bottles that were contaminated on the top with bacillus.

1108
02:19:43,420 --> 02:19:51,430
So we. So that's part of that's that can happen where it's not really a risk to patients.

1109
02:19:51,430 --> 02:19:54,910
But other times there can be equipment that are cleaning.

1110
02:19:55,840 --> 02:20:06,730
We have machines that clean, let's say bronchoscopes and they can become contaminated with bacteria and it can get down into the cultures.

1111
02:20:07,420 --> 02:20:15,700
That can be a pseudo outbreak also, but it could also cause infections so that we have to approach a little bit differently.

1112
02:20:16,690 --> 02:20:23,740
There have been pseudomonas, these atypical mycobacteria get into water and can grow.

1113
02:20:24,070 --> 02:20:30,670
And so if they are getting on to our scopes, then they can get into a patient.

1114
02:20:30,680 --> 02:20:36,729
So that's a little bit different level of concern than than a pseudo outbreak,

1115
02:20:36,730 --> 02:20:41,770
which is just got a bunch of contaminated stuff in the in the microbiology lab.

1116
02:20:44,340 --> 02:20:49,370
So I'm going to put all these are actually nice.

1117
02:20:50,290 --> 02:20:55,260
They will be up after class. This the slides will all be on your website.

1118
02:20:55,560 --> 02:21:00,620
I have asked Dr. Stoneman to also put the papers in.

1119
02:21:00,660 --> 02:21:06,240
The papers are there in checked. Okay. The papers are there too.

1120
02:21:06,570 --> 02:21:09,780
Did you just put them up or if they were there? Oh, no.

1121
02:21:10,080 --> 02:21:13,010
Well, you guys kind of come in all knowledgeable.

1122
02:21:14,080 --> 02:21:21,059
The point of it is not the details of these outbreaks, because you will never you will not see an outbreak like that.

1123
02:21:21,060 --> 02:21:29,190
Serratia outbreak. The what you should be able to know, if I were writing the questions, which are not this year, but if I were,

1124
02:21:29,190 --> 02:21:36,989
I would want you to be able to think about how you would go about writing a case definition, for example.

1125
02:21:36,990 --> 02:21:43,410
That's pretty standard, how you would go about organizing your data.

1126
02:21:44,760 --> 02:21:50,130
The first three steps are like. Like you should have those down in your head, I would think.

1127
02:21:50,970 --> 02:21:56,790
But it's not about memorizing this whole list because like I said, it's kind of gets all put together.

1128
02:21:58,170 --> 02:22:05,160
You kind of should know how to test a hypothesis, but the details are not the issue.

1129
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:11,790
But I put those I asked. I have those papers on there just so you can if you have an interest,

1130
02:22:11,790 --> 02:22:16,620
if it's something that you really, really like, you can go back and see what they did.

1131
02:22:18,150 --> 02:22:22,230
Are there any questions where you guys did really well?

1132
02:22:22,820 --> 02:22:28,050
Yeah, I will take that one comment.

1133
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:32,510
Yeah, it was in the last outbreak. I mean, this is what happened.

1134
02:22:32,520 --> 02:22:36,149
I mean, it's nice to have a pseudo outbreak, but as an example,

1135
02:22:36,150 --> 02:22:42,960
but there can be person characteristics from outside of the community that end up in the hospital with they have different.

1136
02:22:44,370 --> 02:22:54,120
So like one thing is, is whether the people all knew each other or they had attended a common event that they could have come to the hospital

1137
02:22:54,180 --> 02:23:02,460
with something that impacted their health care and they might have had different procedures or different cultures.

1138
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:07,739
Right. Probably not with this particular organism.

1139
02:23:07,740 --> 02:23:15,060
But yes, there are other organisms that we would want to tie in to a community outbreak.

1140
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:20,400
Right. Like there's there's been interesting outbreaks associated with injection drug use.

1141
02:23:20,430 --> 02:23:29,700
Oh, yeah. Yeah. For example, no doubt. Yeah. So that with people you wouldn't expect that with all know and shared needles.

1142
02:23:30,600 --> 02:23:38,130
So we have we have different ideas about who drug users are, but they're not people necessarily standing on street corners to do that.

1143
02:23:39,330 --> 02:23:48,150
So those kind of things are important to know that if you're doing outbreak investigation, you also want to look at there's things between people.

1144
02:23:48,450 --> 02:23:52,859
People care. That's why person is one of the important things too.

1145
02:23:52,860 --> 02:23:57,880
It's not that they all share the hospital ward, but they might have all attended, you know,

1146
02:23:58,020 --> 02:24:05,190
something else or have some behavior that's uncommon that you wouldn't think of anyway.

1147
02:24:05,580 --> 02:24:13,350
Definitely. Let's think that you can. With. With. Thank you for your participation.

1148
02:24:13,350 --> 02:24:17,860
That helps a lot. Mr. Blair, their last class.

1149
02:24:17,880 --> 02:24:24,900
And this is the last class. So I don't know if you have any questions about the final, which will be next week.

1150
02:24:26,370 --> 02:24:33,240
I did send an email about it. If you want to just get your midterms and the debates.

1151
02:24:33,300 --> 02:24:39,010
I had one here except for the people who spent their time going up to my office Wednesday to stop it.

1152
02:24:39,990 --> 02:24:40,590
So.
