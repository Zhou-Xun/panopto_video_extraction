1
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:09,299
Good afternoon.

2
00:00:11,764 --> 00:00:13,494
Can we get started please.

3
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,469
There are some couple of seats up here and

4
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:20,681
several of them over here if you need them.

5
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:29,040
Okay today, quiet down please.

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,422
Today we're gonna talk about what public health is.

7
00:00:33,422 --> 00:00:39,887
And as you will see that is something that probably is confusing to many of you and

8
00:00:39,887 --> 00:00:43,763
it's certainly very confusing to the public.

9
00:00:43,763 --> 00:00:48,600
Most people don't really have any idea what it means.

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,300
And I'll give you two examples of that.

11
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,479
But did I mention the other day about the freshman.

12
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:56,708
The woman who saw me when I was the second year, I talked to course and

13
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:58,081
told me how excited she was.

14
00:00:58,081 --> 00:00:59,111
She was going to go into public health.

15
00:00:59,111 --> 00:01:01,290
Did I mention that storey?

16
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,300
Just this to me kind of summed it all up.

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,502
She came into my office and she said,

18
00:01:05,502 --> 00:01:09,421
I got admitted to the University of michigan and I was so excited.

19
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:14,416
And I went to my father and I said, dad, I'm really thrilled I'm going to

20
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:17,892
U of m and then I'm going to major in public health.

21
00:01:17,892 --> 00:01:19,900
And I'm gonna go into the field of public health.

22
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,726
And he said, that's great, dear.

23
00:01:21,726 --> 00:01:23,245
What's public health?

24
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:25,261
And she said, I have no idea.

25
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,401
And I think that's characteristic of it in a way.

26
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:31,041
I'll tell you another storey a little bit later.

27
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,740
That's also characteristic of it.

28
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,761
So we'll talk a little bit about the meaning of public health, it's importance.

29
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,671
Can we settle down?

30
00:01:40,671 --> 00:01:42,521
There's still a little background noise here.

31
00:01:42,521 --> 00:01:44,002
Thank you.

32
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:49,820
I'm gonna talk about the imbalance between public health and medical care a bit.

33
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,451
And then the mission and functions of public health,

34
00:01:52,451 --> 00:01:54,240
the core areas of the field.

35
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,440
And then we're gonna look at the concept of disease prevention, how we define that.

36
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,442
And then finally, I'm gonna spend a little time on an issue that is gonna be

37
00:02:03,442 --> 00:02:06,440
very central to a lot of what we do in this course.

38
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,723
And that's why public health issues are often so contentious.

39
00:02:10,723 --> 00:02:16,340
You will find there are relatively few public health issues of any importance.

40
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:22,011
They don't generate a lot of both art and support and very strong opposition.

41
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:24,450
And there are good reasons for both.

42
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,769
There good reasons for that.

43
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:29,540
And we'll see what they are towards the end of the class today.

44
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,701
So what does the public think, public health means?

45
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,447
Really since the 911, from what is now, 14 years ago,

46
00:02:39,447 --> 00:02:45,180
public tends to think of public health as a disaster response mode.

47
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,040
And it certainly is that, amongst other things, but that's not all it is.

48
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,620
They think of public health as health care for the poor.

49
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,260
And there's certainly an element of that as well.

50
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,975
But that doesn't describe public health.

51
00:02:57,975 --> 00:03:01,692
Many people will tell you public health are behaviour nannies.

52
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:06,678
And they talk about new York city trying to limit the size of soft drinks as

53
00:03:06,678 --> 00:03:08,077
an example of that.

54
00:03:08,077 --> 00:03:12,877
A lot of people who have, shall we say more libertarian philosophy,

55
00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:17,280
tend to see public health as intervening where it shouldn't.

56
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,140
Because it's telling people what to do and it's nagging them to do it.

57
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,935
Other people will talk about something like restaurant inspections for

58
00:03:25,935 --> 00:03:30,120
cockroaches and their like, that's an important function of public health.

59
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,751
How many of you have ever heard of the Pretzel Bell in ANn Arbour?

60
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,900
Okay, I see about four hands.

61
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,832
Had I asked that question 20 years ago, 25 years ago,

62
00:03:41,832 --> 00:03:44,260
I wouldn't even ask the question.

63
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,670
Everybody knew what the Pretzel Bell was, every single hand here would have been up.

64
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,422
The Pretzel Bell is where you went on your 21st birthday to have

65
00:03:53,422 --> 00:03:55,272
your first legal drink.

66
00:03:55,272 --> 00:03:59,923
I'm told this, I wasn't here at age 21, my wife was.

67
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:05,223
And the routine was if you went and you stood on a table at the Pretzel Bell and

68
00:04:05,223 --> 00:04:09,340
you chugged a beer and people threw peanuts at you.

69
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,941
The RFd boys.

70
00:04:10,941 --> 00:04:13,611
Any of you ever heard of the Rfd boys?

71
00:04:13,611 --> 00:04:14,856
If you get a chance,

72
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:19,626
you wanna hear some fabulous bluegrass music played by some very old people.

73
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:23,035
Go to the ark when the Rfd boys are playing.

74
00:04:23,035 --> 00:04:26,038
They used to play at the Pretzel Bell on Friday and Saturday night.

75
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:30,561
And it was the single best entertainment in all of ann Arbour people loved it.

76
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:34,715
The beer was flowing and literally the peanuts were flying all over the place and

77
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:36,650
the music was absolutely fabulous.

78
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,359
The Pretzel Bell is no longer with us because the Health department went in.

79
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:44,926
And in one of their inspections discovered cockroaches and

80
00:04:44,926 --> 00:04:48,370
other kinds of insects that shouldn't have been there.

81
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,756
And it turned out it was basically a function of the way the building had been

82
00:04:51,756 --> 00:04:52,471
constructed.

83
00:04:52,471 --> 00:04:55,476
There wasn't much that the owners could do about it and

84
00:04:55,476 --> 00:04:58,500
eventually they went out of business because of that.

85
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,240
That was a public health decision.

86
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,000
That the food provision within the pretzel ballot was a restaurant.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,965
The food provision was not sufficiently sanitary, so

88
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:10,840
that's one function of public health.

89
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:16,489
And then there are a lot of people who will simply say, I don't know what it is.

90
00:05:16,489 --> 00:05:22,340
Now, I mentioned the idea, I said I'd come to this, I'll do it early.

91
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,186
There are a lot of people who think of public health as being very much left

92
00:05:27,186 --> 00:05:30,040
leaning on the political spectrum.

93
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,302
And I think it's a fair statement to make that on average, most people

94
00:05:34,302 --> 00:05:39,014
in public health are more on the left and the right of the political spectrum.

95
00:05:39,014 --> 00:05:43,649
But not all I've known, some very effective people in public health who were

96
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:46,301
pretty far on the right end of the politics.

97
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:50,519
But the impression out there is that everybody is a left winger.

98
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:53,169
I personally am very much middle of the road,

99
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:57,859
which to many people in public health makes them think that I'm a right winger.

100
00:05:57,859 --> 00:06:00,440
Because more of them are on the left wing.

101
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,710
But I'll give you an example of how the public sometimes perceives this.

102
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,554
I was at the annual meeting of the American Public Health Association

103
00:06:08,554 --> 00:06:11,477
in Miami many, many years ago and we had our badges.

104
00:06:11,477 --> 00:06:13,911
You have your badge for the convention you're attending.

105
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:18,067
And there were two major conventions that were being housed at whatever hotel we

106
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:18,580
were in.

107
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,479
One was american Public Health Association and

108
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,892
the other was some group of national group of realtors.

109
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:25,740
Okay.

110
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,681
And some guy comes up to me and he's got the realtor badge on him.

111
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:32,044
He looks at me and said you with that public health meeting?

112
00:06:32,044 --> 00:06:32,670
I said yes.

113
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,380
And he said Communist and walked away.

114
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,540
Yeah.

115
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,820
So that's one impression of people in public health.

116
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,721
I don't think it's a fair one.

117
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:44,709
It's certainly not applicable to me.

118
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:49,853
But I told somebody today during office hours, I'm trained as an economist.

119
00:06:49,853 --> 00:06:55,531
And it's hard to spend a lot of time in economics and become a communist.

120
00:06:55,531 --> 00:06:56,770
It's just really hard to do.

121
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,361
It just doesn't work that way.

122
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,832
Now, I'm not gonna read this definition to you, but

123
00:07:02,832 --> 00:07:04,980
I urge you to read it on your own time.

124
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,080
This is a definition of public health from nearly 100 years ago.

125
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,788
It's rather wordy, but

126
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:15,840
it really captures the essence of what public health is all about.

127
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,375
So I will leave it to you to read that by yourself CEA Winslow was one of the real

128
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:27,451
sort of fathers if you will parents of the field of public health from a century ago.

129
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,040
Here's a more concise definition.

130
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,875
Public health is a set of activities a society undertakes to monitor and

131
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:40,140
improve the health of its collective membership.

132
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,540
Now there are three distinguishing features of public health.

133
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:50,151
First, the focus is on preventing disease and injury, not on treating them.

134
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,539
That's not to say we don't have some responsibilities in the area of treatment,

135
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:57,400
but the focus is prevention.

136
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,960
Second, the patient is really the community.

137
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,140
It's not an individual recipient of services.

138
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,320
And similarly, thirdly, the provider is the society,

139
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,300
it's not an individual professional.

140
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,737
So if you think about this other health professions and

141
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:18,761
I've listed many of them here.

142
00:08:18,761 --> 00:08:22,640
Medicine, nursing, dentistry, pharmacy, allied health, social work.

143
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,221
What are they typically involved?

144
00:08:24,221 --> 00:08:27,890
And it's typically the exact opposite of what I've just given you.

145
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:32,693
There's an individual provider who is providing services to a single patient or

146
00:08:32,693 --> 00:08:36,669
it can be a group patient group counselling, something like that.

147
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:42,725
But to individual people, there is an emphasis on treating an illness or

148
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:46,809
a disability dealing with an existing problem.

149
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:52,340
As opposed to trying to prevent that problem from occurring in the first place.

150
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,470
So that's the fundamental difference.

151
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,100
And here's a great example.

152
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,276
One of my favourites example of health care is a dentist treating

153
00:09:01,276 --> 00:09:06,561
dental carries cavities in individual patients filling them.

154
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,938
And the example of public health is government requiring and

155
00:09:11,938 --> 00:09:15,326
executing the fluoridation of the water supply.

156
00:09:15,326 --> 00:09:18,609
Which makes fluoridated water available to all members of

157
00:09:18,609 --> 00:09:22,440
the community who are simply drinking from their taps.

158
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,330
So they don't even have to think about it.

159
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,566
They just go about their normal business of drinking water and

160
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:31,640
they are getting protection that prevents dental carries.

161
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,695
How many people in here have never had a cavity.

162
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,501
Okay, that blows me away.

163
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:39,325
I have to say.

164
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:43,177
How many of you have had five or more?

165
00:09:43,177 --> 00:09:44,200
All right.

166
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,210
My guess is he not many here.

167
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,173
My guess is that some of you probably come from communities that didn't fluoridate

168
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,147
your water supply.

169
00:09:51,147 --> 00:09:53,797
And others were just unlucky.

170
00:09:53,797 --> 00:09:57,530
Now if you're my age, you would have had five cavities or more.

171
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,943
Because we didn't really start fluoridating the water until most of us

172
00:10:01,943 --> 00:10:05,740
were well into our childhood and it was just the norm.

173
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,279
It was just expected.

174
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,279
One of the really interesting things if you wanna look at sort of the history and

175
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,510
evolution of a profession is to look at the field of dentistry.

176
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:19,780
If you go back several decades, it was a treatment oriented profession,

177
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:24,540
pretty much exclusively filling cavities and the like.

178
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,850
And then along comes water fluoridation.

179
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:32,816
And the main thing that dentists are doing isn't happening very much anymore.

180
00:10:32,816 --> 00:10:34,131
So now what are they doing?

181
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:36,640
They're doing more preventive dentistry.

182
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,340
You get your every six month checkup.

183
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:45,448
You're certainly seeing a lot more work on teeth for cosmetic reasons.

184
00:10:45,448 --> 00:10:51,247
When I was a kid orthodoxy was something that wasn't done unless there

185
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:56,269
was some real malformation malfunction to your occlusion.

186
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:59,580
Today lots of people would ask you to raise your hands.

187
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,540
My guess is that most of you had orthodontia.

188
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,258
It's just become something that you do and everybody looks nicer.

189
00:11:07,258 --> 00:11:11,540
You have these beautiful smiles like this because they had their orthodontia.

190
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,306
But the success of one very important public health measure,

191
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:21,254
water fluoridation has led to essentially the elimination a lot

192
00:11:21,254 --> 00:11:25,570
of what one of the other health professions used to do.

193
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:29,561
And it's really redefine that health professions.

194
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,691
And by the way, I was talking about issues being contentious and

195
00:11:34,691 --> 00:11:39,440
we'll look at why later on fluoridation is still a contentious issue.

196
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,329
Anybody here from Oregon?

197
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:44,880
One, anybody just one.

198
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,940
Okay Phil were you aware of the fights that they were having within the last

199
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,227
couple of years over- >> [INAUDIBLE]

200
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:53,518
>> There were some fights and

201
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:55,107
I think it was the entire state.

202
00:11:55,107 --> 00:11:58,854
It was certainly several communities in Oregon about whether they were gonna stop

203
00:11:58,854 --> 00:12:00,059
fluoridating the water.

204
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:03,155
Because they thought it was doing bad things to people and

205
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:04,841
there's no evidence of that.

206
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:09,827
And there's loads of evidence that does good things that battle arises frequently.

207
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:11,621
By the way, those of you from Michigan.

208
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:14,691
Well you're all from Michigan now.

209
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:18,913
Those of you from Michigan will be pleased to know that the origins

210
00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:20,756
of water Fluoridation lie,

211
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:26,085
I think it was in grand rapids with some of the first trials of water fluoridation.

212
00:12:26,085 --> 00:12:30,039
And it spread very quickly throughout this state and other states as well.

213
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,485
So why is public health important?

214
00:12:36,485 --> 00:12:41,277
Well, these are numbers that were jined up as you can see here by the Centres for

215
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:46,013
Disease Control, the Institute of Medicine and the Public Health Service.

216
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:50,224
They did independent studies to produce these numbers.

217
00:12:50,224 --> 00:12:53,930
And they've been pretty consistent over the years and they take them for

218
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,140
ballpark numbers and not precise.

219
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,451
But they said if we wanted to know what we could do to get rid of

220
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:04,609
the premature mortality that we talked about last week.

221
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:09,730
Remember we said about half of all deaths are avoidable premature deaths.

222
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:14,040
If we want to get rid of those, what would we do?

223
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:19,015
And they said 50% of those could be changed by altering deleterious

224
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:20,740
behaviours.

225
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,597
20% by improvements in the environment.

226
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:29,187
20% by changes in human biology, in other words, messing with genetics,

227
00:13:29,187 --> 00:13:31,010
we're getting close to that.

228
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,951
Obviously we haven't done a lot with it we've done some.

229
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:37,646
And additional medical care 10%.

230
00:13:37,646 --> 00:13:42,126
Remember that one graph that was looking at life expectancy versus

231
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:43,811
medical expenditures.

232
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:47,298
And when you got in the high range of medical expenditures,

233
00:13:47,298 --> 00:13:50,670
you didn't see much by way of changing life expectancy.

234
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,811
Sorry, what that's telling us is basically this message.

235
00:13:54,811 --> 00:13:57,100
I don't want you to misinterpret this.

236
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,230
This is not saying medical care is unimportant or that it doesn't save lives.

237
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,549
It's saying if we wanna make further improvements in the health of the public,

238
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:07,911
where are we going to go?

239
00:14:07,911 --> 00:14:11,110
And it's saying we can put a lot more money into medical care.

240
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,705
But that's only gonna put a dent in the problem that we have of this

241
00:14:15,705 --> 00:14:18,307
preventable premature mortality.

242
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:22,640
Behaviour is frankly the biggest payoff by far.

243
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,050
And we're seeing that we've talked about the obesity issue a bit.

244
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,415
We'll go back to that we're seeing with tobacco a little bit less, but

245
00:14:30,415 --> 00:14:34,440
somewhat with exercise and some other areas like that.

246
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,158
So the bottom line here is public health is important because it relates

247
00:14:40,158 --> 00:14:46,561
to how people behave what they breathe and drink from the environment and so on.

248
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,560
Now, I'm gonna give you one study here.

249
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,180
I will tell you there are many studies and they come up with different numbers.

250
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:59,770
The point is the concept, not so much the specifics of the numbers.

251
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,310
This is from John Bunker.

252
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,456
Who actually was an anaesthesiologist and he and

253
00:15:04,456 --> 00:15:08,394
his colleagues published this article 20 years ago now.

254
00:15:08,394 --> 00:15:13,150
They estimated of the 30 year gain in life expectancy in the United States

255
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,652
over the course of the 20th century.

256
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:20,598
Five years of it could be attributed to the medical care system having improved,

257
00:15:20,598 --> 00:15:24,392
25 years from the public health system, having improved.

258
00:15:24,392 --> 00:15:28,608
Things like sanitation, housing, nutrition and job safety.

259
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:32,610
As I say, you'll find other studies that have put slightly different weights on it.

260
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:37,301
But the basic concept that public health is what accounts for

261
00:15:37,301 --> 00:15:42,915
life expectancy increases is shared by virtually all of these studies.

262
00:15:42,915 --> 00:15:48,675
So now I want to think about something in concept here and then look at reality.

263
00:15:48,675 --> 00:15:52,008
So in concept, public health on this right there, did we

264
00:15:52,008 --> 00:15:56,397
decide there was nobody in the other room that I'm staring at this camera.

265
00:15:56,397 --> 00:16:03,504
[CROSSTALK] Hi, sorry, I was about to leave, but I'll stay here for you.

266
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:07,761
But next time come in here so I can wander, I'd like to wander.

267
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:09,845
Think about this conceptually.

268
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:13,056
Public health is kind of the framework for

269
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:16,743
everything that we do that pertains to health.

270
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:21,083
So, on the left hand side, we're talking about collective health services,

271
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:25,322
that's the kind of thing like water fluoridation that we're referring to.

272
00:16:25,322 --> 00:16:30,266
On the right, public health overseas individual health services and

273
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:34,555
then you have those individually listed underneath there.

274
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:39,706
That is conceptually what a public health system should be.

275
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:44,466
Now, let's think about how we tend to view these areas in practise.

276
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:47,328
Medicine, number one.

277
00:16:47,328 --> 00:16:53,306
We put almost all of our public health resources into individual medical care.

278
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:56,365
Probably a good 95% of them.

279
00:16:56,365 --> 00:17:01,111
Other individual health services that fall beneath that and

280
00:17:01,111 --> 00:17:07,082
then of course, public health at the bottom just gets a pittance as a field.

281
00:17:07,082 --> 00:17:08,723
Very poorly funded,

282
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:14,204
very much almost an afterthought in a lot of communities in the States.

283
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:18,815
So we can think about the imbalance between the two in this manner.

284
00:17:18,815 --> 00:17:22,981
If we think about the impact on preventing premature mortality,

285
00:17:22,981 --> 00:17:28,588
this then diagram shows you there's a very large potential impact from public health,

286
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:31,939
a much smaller potential impact from medical care.

287
00:17:31,939 --> 00:17:36,947
And of course, there's an intersection between the two of them, okay?

288
00:17:36,947 --> 00:17:41,786
That intersection is basically an area where people are providing medical

289
00:17:41,786 --> 00:17:46,490
services that are having a good preventive effects in the communities.

290
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,092
What's a good example of that?

291
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:48,860
Can you think of something?

292
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:53,482
It's a medical service, but it really is serving a preventive purpose.

293
00:17:53,482 --> 00:17:54,095
Yes.

294
00:17:54,095 --> 00:17:58,729
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> Colon cancer screening for colonoscopy.

295
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:01,927
The colonoscopy for colon cancer.

296
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:03,661
I don't think so.

297
00:18:03,661 --> 00:18:06,655
That's a screening that is to try to prevent, but

298
00:18:06,655 --> 00:18:09,664
it's really trying to prevent for individuals.

299
00:18:09,664 --> 00:18:13,403
In other words, you're trying to identify individuals who might have a problem.

300
00:18:13,403 --> 00:18:14,248
Sir.

301
00:18:14,248 --> 00:18:17,332
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> Vaccination.

302
00:18:17,332 --> 00:18:22,015
Vaccination is one of the great successes of medicine and public health and

303
00:18:22,015 --> 00:18:24,555
it is definitely in that intersection.

304
00:18:24,555 --> 00:18:29,457
It is typically delivered by some component of the private or

305
00:18:29,457 --> 00:18:32,629
public personal health care system and

306
00:18:32,629 --> 00:18:36,969
it has the benefit of serving the greater community.

307
00:18:36,969 --> 00:18:40,944
We will talk about that in much greater detail later on.

308
00:18:40,944 --> 00:18:46,117
But the reason that we care about vaccinations so much is not because

309
00:18:46,117 --> 00:18:51,291
we're going to protect you if you get a vaccination, it's because

310
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:57,039
you're getting a vaccination is protecting the rest of us as well, okay?

311
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,991
So that's the relationship there.

312
00:18:58,991 --> 00:19:03,258
Now let's think about expenditures, public health,

313
00:19:03,258 --> 00:19:07,807
tiny share of the money, medical care, lots of the money.

314
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:10,365
Take a look at this and think about what this means.

315
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:16,700
This is what we spend annually on healthcare in the United States.

316
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,597
I stopped it there because I ran out of zeros.

317
00:19:19,597 --> 00:19:26,786
That's $3 trillion dollars that we spend in the United States on Healthcare.

318
00:19:26,786 --> 00:19:31,413
Now we have something like 300 million people that works out

319
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:36,041
to something on the order of $10,000 per man, woman and

320
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,902
child that we spend in the United States every year.

321
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:43,096
Public health, it's so small you can barely see it.

322
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:49,708
Let's see, I think it's either 50 or $60 billion, it's about 2% of the total.

323
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:54,350
So on the one hand, we have all this huge potential in public health to

324
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,474
make great differences in people's health,

325
00:19:57,474 --> 00:20:01,252
and we put all of our money into the medical care sector.

326
00:20:01,252 --> 00:20:04,253
Now, why do we do that?

327
00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:06,556
Why do we see this imbalance?

328
00:20:06,556 --> 00:20:10,432
Well, economic interests helped to explain a lot of it.

329
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:15,448
Market systems tend to cater to services for individuals.

330
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:20,417
Public health is something that we frequently refer to as a public good or

331
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:22,052
it has externalities.

332
00:20:22,052 --> 00:20:25,729
So in the case of a vaccine, if I get vaccinated,

333
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:29,247
I'm deriving some of the benefits from that.

334
00:20:29,247 --> 00:20:33,355
But I'm also protecting everybody else I come in contact with.

335
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:37,373
So I'm not getting all of the benefit from that vaccination,

336
00:20:37,373 --> 00:20:39,160
I'm getting a piece of it.

337
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,465
But I'm going to make the decision for

338
00:20:41,465 --> 00:20:46,237
whether I want to get vaccinated on the benefit to me relative to the cost to me.

339
00:20:46,237 --> 00:20:49,305
So I'm not considering the full societal benefits.

340
00:20:49,305 --> 00:20:52,196
The benefits extend to other people and

341
00:20:52,196 --> 00:20:58,251
that means that the market isn't going to solve that problem for us all by itself.

342
00:20:58,251 --> 00:21:00,849
Interest group politics.

343
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:04,265
I mentioned this once before, we'll talk about this and

344
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:06,339
a little bit later on in the class.

345
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:08,955
This idea of contentious issues.

346
00:21:08,955 --> 00:21:14,488
I assume most of you are well aware of how much politics and interest groups

347
00:21:14,488 --> 00:21:20,840
within politics drive virtually everything certainly in our collective society.

348
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,995
But we'll look at some good examples of that later.

349
00:21:23,995 --> 00:21:26,799
And then there's something called the rule of rescue.

350
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,853
This is what people want.

351
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:33,388
What people want is to be saved when there's

352
00:21:33,388 --> 00:21:36,552
something very bad happening to them.

353
00:21:36,552 --> 00:21:41,894
You're in a car collision and you're hurt, you have a heart attack.

354
00:21:41,894 --> 00:21:44,584
You've been diagnosed with cancer.

355
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:51,648
That's when you want somebody to help you when you've got a bad problem.

356
00:21:51,648 --> 00:21:54,895
Very few people are thinking as intensely or

357
00:21:54,895 --> 00:22:00,516
in fact demanding of their legislators to provide preventive services that

358
00:22:00,516 --> 00:22:05,607
are going to prevent many of them from developing that heart attack or

359
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:10,302
having that car collision, or getting the cancer diagnosis.

360
00:22:10,302 --> 00:22:12,642
Because they don't think about that much,

361
00:22:12,642 --> 00:22:15,054
they want to be rescued from a bad situation.

362
00:22:15,054 --> 00:22:17,805
Very understandable.

363
00:22:17,805 --> 00:22:20,855
But it's a problem for public health.

364
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:25,298
People don't understand relative risk at all.

365
00:22:25,298 --> 00:22:27,584
We'll talk more about that later in the course and

366
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,714
I'll give you a very nice example in a moment.

367
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:32,882
And then there's the invisibility of public health.

368
00:22:32,882 --> 00:22:36,950
If something is going to be supported by the public,

369
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:41,857
they have to know it's there and they have to value it, right?

370
00:22:41,857 --> 00:22:43,409
So let's try this.

371
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:48,511
How many people in this room and you in the other room as well,

372
00:22:48,511 --> 00:22:52,829
please raise your hands, have you ever had polio?

373
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:55,361
Not a single one of you?

374
00:22:55,361 --> 00:22:58,060
My father in law had polio.

375
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:03,320
I was at risk of it until the polio vaccine was demonstrated to be safe and

376
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,789
effective and I got vaccinated.

377
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:10,607
But I was not allowed to go to the community swimming pool by my

378
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:13,171
parents when I was a little kid.

379
00:23:13,171 --> 00:23:17,508
Because that's where a lot of people contracted polio.

380
00:23:17,508 --> 00:23:21,143
That's not something that any of you ever had to confront and

381
00:23:21,143 --> 00:23:22,647
would ever think about.

382
00:23:22,647 --> 00:23:27,601
All right, how many people in the room have had mumps?

383
00:23:27,601 --> 00:23:30,310
Gee I'm the only hand, what a surprise.

384
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,804
You're vaccinated against it.

385
00:23:32,804 --> 00:23:38,501
How many people here get more interesting now have ever had measles?

386
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:42,556
Nobody's had measles here, wow, that's really unusual.

387
00:23:42,556 --> 00:23:44,202
You usually expect to find a few.

388
00:23:44,202 --> 00:23:48,749
I think I mentioned the other day, we did have the measles outbreak in

389
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:53,156
the dorm right across the street here about 10, 15 years ago.

390
00:23:53,156 --> 00:23:55,537
And it's it's one of those sort of sad cases.

391
00:23:55,537 --> 00:23:59,782
It's a lot of parents decide they're not going to vaccinate their children because

392
00:23:59,782 --> 00:24:03,907
whoever hears about measles, why would you take the risk of something going wrong

393
00:24:03,907 --> 00:24:07,404
from the vaccination and then what you see is an upswing and measles?

394
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:12,071
So every few years over a 10 year period, let's say we'll have swing when all of

395
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:15,877
a sudden you'll have four or 500 cases of measles nationwide.

396
00:24:15,877 --> 00:24:20,698
That's not a lot, but most years it's down much closer to zero.

397
00:24:20,698 --> 00:24:24,570
I had mumps and measles because we didn't have the vaccine that you did.

398
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:28,597
How many people here ever had chicken pox?

399
00:24:28,597 --> 00:24:32,187
Guess what, if you're doing this lecture,

400
00:24:32,187 --> 00:24:36,815
you're in my place here a generation from now 20 years,

401
00:24:36,815 --> 00:24:41,073
nobody's gonna stick their hand up for chicken pox.

402
00:24:41,073 --> 00:24:44,302
Because we now have a vaccine for it.

403
00:24:44,302 --> 00:24:49,149
So nobody in that class of one generation hence is going to know what that was.

404
00:24:49,149 --> 00:24:53,089
The American stick their hands up for any of these illnesses.

405
00:24:53,089 --> 00:24:54,684
Now, think about this.

406
00:24:54,684 --> 00:25:00,270
Think about the number of people who were crippled or died as a result of polio

407
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:06,229
whose parents greatest fear was polio back in the 1940s, early 1950s.

408
00:25:06,229 --> 00:25:10,950
The single thing they were most afraid of was their kids getting polio during

409
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:15,542
the summer and either being very disabled or dying as a consequence of it.

410
00:25:15,542 --> 00:25:19,664
You don't think about that at all, you never need to think about it.

411
00:25:19,664 --> 00:25:26,750
That's the invisibility of public health when it's working, you don't see it.

412
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:31,678
How do you develop a constituency a political constituency for

413
00:25:31,678 --> 00:25:36,893
something that's working so well that nobody is thinking about?

414
00:25:36,893 --> 00:25:40,053
That's a big problem for us.

415
00:25:40,053 --> 00:25:40,847
Here it is.

416
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:44,964
Ebola, terrified of Ebola while he smokes a cigarette and

417
00:25:44,964 --> 00:25:50,438
drinks his beers and shoves the Big Mac and all that sort of stuff in his mouth.

418
00:25:50,438 --> 00:25:55,012
I said people don't appreciate relative risks and that is indeed true and

419
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:59,833
we'll have some very interesting examples of that throughout this course.

420
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:06,298
Think about how terrified people were about Ebola last year.

421
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:11,479
In the United States, people were freaking out over Ebola.

422
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:15,818
Ridiculous, completely and utterly ridiculous.

423
00:26:15,818 --> 00:26:19,622
The conditions that bred the huge Ebola outbreaks

424
00:26:19,622 --> 00:26:23,346
in three countries in Africa don't exist here.

425
00:26:23,346 --> 00:26:25,042
For starters we can and

426
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:29,516
did get on top of the little bit of exposure that we had to it.

427
00:26:29,516 --> 00:26:33,578
And while it was a terrible outbreak, there's no question about that,

428
00:26:33,578 --> 00:26:36,255
it was devastating for those three countries.

429
00:26:36,255 --> 00:26:41,479
Ebola and other diseases like that when you have reasonably good

430
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:46,712
control measures in place, aren't killing that many people.

431
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:52,783
Food is, cigarettes are, alcohol is, illicit substances,

432
00:26:52,783 --> 00:26:59,665
illicit drugs in many instances are, people don't think about that.

433
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:02,360
They don't understand that.

434
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,798
It's a little bit like people who are have a fear of flying.

435
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:11,167
If you look at the data for flying, you are incredibly safe,

436
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:16,478
whether it's per passenger mile or per trip or whatever it may be compared

437
00:27:16,478 --> 00:27:22,495
to loads of other ways of getting around, including in your car or on your bicycle.

438
00:27:22,495 --> 00:27:24,152
I ride my bike to work.

439
00:27:24,152 --> 00:27:29,158
I'm in much more danger doing that than I am taking a flight

440
00:27:29,158 --> 00:27:33,868
anywhere in the world, but people are afraid of that.

441
00:27:33,868 --> 00:27:37,677
So how many people in the typical year die

442
00:27:37,677 --> 00:27:42,509
as a result of a major commercial crash worldwide?

443
00:27:42,509 --> 00:27:44,471
Any ideas how many do you think it is?

444
00:27:47,712 --> 00:27:52,410
Probably, if you look at it worldwide, it's probably a couple 100,

445
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,455
maybe 300 or something on the average year.

446
00:27:55,455 --> 00:28:00,164
If you look at the United States will be hard pressed to find many years in which

447
00:28:00,164 --> 00:28:03,510
there was even one death in a major commercial flight.

448
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,601
And yet people are afraid of that and

449
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:09,872
they're not afraid of getting into their car or biking or what have you.

450
00:28:09,872 --> 00:28:12,538
Relative risk, appreciating this is important.

451
00:28:12,538 --> 00:28:15,587
In the, one of the lectures on environmental health,

452
00:28:15,587 --> 00:28:17,973
you're gonna get a real nice dose of that,

453
00:28:17,973 --> 00:28:22,370
of understanding how people evaluate relative risks and comparative risks.

454
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,704
Very interesting.

455
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,560
So, here's one of my favourite little schemas for

456
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,610
sort of trying to understand this.

457
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,891
Let's think about trying to do some kind of health promotion,

458
00:28:33,891 --> 00:28:35,844
maybe an exercise programme.

459
00:28:35,844 --> 00:28:39,363
What are the benefits of an exercise programme?

460
00:28:39,363 --> 00:28:44,690
Well, hopefully down the line 10 years, 20 years, 30 years,

461
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:49,838
fewer people who are in that exercise programme are going to have heart

462
00:28:49,838 --> 00:28:54,655
attacks and dropped dead than if they hadn't had the programme.

463
00:28:54,655 --> 00:28:59,376
But that benefit is deferred, which means it's going

464
00:28:59,376 --> 00:29:03,701
to occur well into the future and it's abstract.

465
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:05,443
Why do I say it's abstract?

466
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:13,425
Because you don't know if you don't have a heart attack that is because you exercise.

467
00:29:13,425 --> 00:29:17,313
My mother, I don't know if she ever exercised a day in her life and

468
00:29:17,313 --> 00:29:18,601
she lived to be 90.

469
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:20,770
Is that good evidence for not exercising?

470
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:24,595
No, but you can't tell in a group, a large group of people,

471
00:29:24,595 --> 00:29:28,278
I can tell you how many times I can tell you some precision.

472
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:32,602
If I've got a very large group, I can tell you some precision how many people

473
00:29:32,602 --> 00:29:35,390
are going to live longer as a result of exercise.

474
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,878
I can't tell you who they are.

475
00:29:36,878 --> 00:29:39,547
So it's an abstraction.

476
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:42,646
You don't know if it's you who's going to derive that benefit.

477
00:29:42,646 --> 00:29:46,049
If you're doing it, you're doing it on the basis of faith and

478
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:48,221
a belief in public health principles.

479
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:51,430
Think about the cost, they're tangible and immediate.

480
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:55,480
If you're going to exercise, your taking time to do it.

481
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,995
You're gonna sweat, you're gonna have to take an extra shower,

482
00:29:58,995 --> 00:30:00,440
you have more close to watch.

483
00:30:01,575 --> 00:30:05,973
There are lots of costs associated with them and they're very real to you.

484
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:10,401
Now, consider on the other hand, the case for disease promotion.

485
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,529
I actually think this picture is almost period.

486
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:20,232
It's almost obscene and really just looking at this and

487
00:30:20,232 --> 00:30:25,204
I don't know how you all feel about chocolate but, this is very arousing.

488
00:30:25,204 --> 00:30:30,266
>> [LAUGH] >> You get to a certain age and

489
00:30:30,266 --> 00:30:32,910
there's some things that arouse you and other things.

490
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:36,938
>> [LAUGH] >> Think about that beautiful piece of

491
00:30:36,938 --> 00:30:39,980
chocolate cake, think about that.

492
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,923
You dig your mouth into that and

493
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:45,780
what about those benefits are absolutely tangible.

494
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:50,380
You can taste it, it tastes a beautiful flavour, it's immediate.

495
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:55,472
And the cost, well, maybe my arteries are gonna get a fraction of

496
00:30:55,472 --> 00:31:01,880
a millimetre smaller over a course of the rest of the day because I hate that thing.

497
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,481
And maybe 20 years from now,

498
00:31:03,481 --> 00:31:07,260
I'm gonna have that heart attack because I had that piece of cake today.

499
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,098
But gosh, that doesn't seem very likely,

500
00:31:10,098 --> 00:31:14,380
it seems very much in the future and very abstract.

501
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,594
And of course there's also the problem that for people your age,

502
00:31:18,594 --> 00:31:22,975
you're probably considering yourselves essentially immortal.

503
00:31:22,975 --> 00:31:29,046
And I don't mean that in the literal sense, but you don't think about dying.

504
00:31:29,046 --> 00:31:31,633
I mean, I remember this very vividly

505
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:36,561
having a conversation with a colleague when I was in graduate school.

506
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:41,726
I was 22 and he was 28, so he was an older man at the time.

507
00:31:41,726 --> 00:31:44,297
And he makes some comment and I said, Dan,

508
00:31:44,297 --> 00:31:47,480
it sounds like you think you're going to die.

509
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,093
He said, no, no, I don't think I'm gonna die,

510
00:31:50,093 --> 00:31:52,791
I just realised I have a finite amount of time left.

511
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,204
And that was an interesting concept to me because I had never particularly

512
00:31:58,204 --> 00:31:59,980
thought of that myself.

513
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:03,356
And by the way, I had a very good reason to think that,

514
00:32:03,356 --> 00:32:08,101
cuz I had a sister who died of cancer at 21 after being sick for four years.

515
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:13,583
So I could have, if anybody was going to think that there was such a thing as

516
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:15,372
mortality in young adulthood,

517
00:32:15,372 --> 00:32:20,080
I probably should have been the person who felt that and I didn't.

518
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,606
So, put that into perspective of trying to think about doing things that are gonna be

519
00:32:24,606 --> 00:32:28,002
good for your health 20,30,40,50 years from now.

520
00:32:28,002 --> 00:32:35,062
That's a hard perspective to develop at an age when it doesn't seem relevant.

521
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,033
What is public health supposed to do?

522
00:32:39,033 --> 00:32:41,849
This is a definition from the Institute of Medicine.

523
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:45,830
And by the way, those of you who've never heard of the Institute of Medicine,

524
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,630
they can kind of forget about it cuz it's now called the National Academy of

525
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,339
Medicine as of a month or two ago.

526
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:56,336
Institute of Medicine is considered maybe the most reputable large body of

527
00:32:56,336 --> 00:33:01,990
scientists to review issues pertaining to health, public health, medical care.

528
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:06,680
They do loads of studies every year and they publish their results.

529
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,222
Congress frequently asks them to do studies on issues.

530
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:13,800
Their results are relied upon and quoted all the time.

531
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,899
They did a study and this is one of two, they've done the other ones more recent,

532
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:21,250
but the first was called the Future of Public Health in 1988.

533
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:26,005
They said the mission of public health was to fulfil society's interest in

534
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:29,370
assuring conditions in which people can be healthy.

535
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:33,365
Think about that notion, conditions in which people can be healthy.

536
00:33:33,365 --> 00:33:36,805
Not assuring individual persons they will be healthy, but

537
00:33:36,805 --> 00:33:40,880
providing an environment that will allow them to be healthy.

538
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,765
The aim of public health is to generate organised community effort to address

539
00:33:45,765 --> 00:33:49,373
the public interest in health by applying scientific and

540
00:33:49,373 --> 00:33:53,680
technical knowledge to prevent disease and promote health.

541
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,441
And then in a little bit, I'm gonna talk about one other thing we need

542
00:33:58,441 --> 00:34:01,407
besides scientific knowledge to do that.

543
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:07,238
There are three core functions of public health, learn these, okay?

544
00:34:07,238 --> 00:34:09,959
These are basic, this is really important.

545
00:34:09,959 --> 00:34:13,180
This also comes from the Institute of Medicine.

546
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:17,987
Three main things, assessing the health of the population, developing

547
00:34:17,987 --> 00:34:22,958
public health policies and assuring the availability of needed services.

548
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:26,864
None of those is quite as intuitively obvious as it may sound and

549
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:28,199
we'll see why here.

550
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:32,497
Assessment of the health of the population obviously involves

551
00:34:32,497 --> 00:34:34,450
collecting data on health.

552
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:38,806
It involves statistical and epidemiologic analysis and

553
00:34:38,806 --> 00:34:44,350
we'll be learning more about each of those just in future in the course.

554
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:49,227
And it involves disseminating findings both to the public, but

555
00:34:49,227 --> 00:34:55,189
also to people who need those findings which maybe people running hospitals or

556
00:34:55,189 --> 00:34:59,436
health care systems and maybe people running schools,

557
00:34:59,436 --> 00:35:03,885
can be all kinds of other institutional users of the data.

558
00:35:03,885 --> 00:35:06,000
The development of public health policies.

559
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,496
This is one of the things that makes public health so very interesting and

560
00:35:10,496 --> 00:35:12,680
also so very challenging.

561
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:17,690
Yes, we've got to have the science and there are loads of faculty

562
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:24,880
in this school who are developing the science that will underpin public health.

563
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,554
One of them no longer here, moved to a different place many years ago,

564
00:35:29,554 --> 00:35:34,549
was a biostatistician who did the original work showing the dangers of lead

565
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,480
in the environment.

566
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,910
And it, I start saying it lead, I guess I know what the other word.

567
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:45,850
It led to the removal of lead from gas, okay?

568
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:49,217
We don't have, that's all you always see, unleaded.

569
00:35:49,217 --> 00:35:50,432
You know the expression unleaded?

570
00:35:50,432 --> 00:35:53,021
Did you ever ask yourself why did they say unleaded?

571
00:35:53,021 --> 00:35:56,301
It's all unleaded because it didn't used to be.

572
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,422
And we saw instantly when we moved to unleaded gas,

573
00:36:01,422 --> 00:36:07,062
if you look in particular inner city environments which were dense with

574
00:36:07,062 --> 00:36:13,490
lead that was being admitted by the cars, those rates went way way down.

575
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:16,880
That was part of the science of what happened here.

576
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,080
Treatment of hypertension.

577
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,536
One of the original trials of that was chaired by a former Dean,

578
00:36:23,536 --> 00:36:27,840
Richard Remington, dean of this school biostatistician.

579
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,120
Are there any number of other examples?

580
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,980
We'll talk later on about the Salk vaccine and polio.

581
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:40,209
Jonas Salk himself learnt how to do the techniques that

582
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:45,227
he used to develop the Salk vaccine here as a student.

583
00:36:45,227 --> 00:36:49,901
And then the first and really probably the most remarkable clinical

584
00:36:49,901 --> 00:36:54,911
trial in history was led by Tommy Francis who was chair of epidemiology.

585
00:36:54,911 --> 00:36:58,297
And you will note that his name is on one of the two school of public

586
00:36:58,297 --> 00:36:59,390
health buildings.

587
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:02,340
We'll talk more about that at a later stage.

588
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:06,966
But suffice it to say, I want you to just think about this until we get to that.

589
00:37:06,966 --> 00:37:11,497
Eight million kids were part of this clinical trial to see whether the Salk

590
00:37:11,497 --> 00:37:14,580
vaccine was safe and efficacious.

591
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,480
There were no computers.

592
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,601
They had to do all the data collection and analysis by hand for eight million kids.

593
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,980
Life is much easier in many ways today.

594
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,280
But that's all the science side.

595
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,811
Then, you get to the appreciation and use of politics.

596
00:37:34,811 --> 00:37:38,756
Because so many issues in public health are contentious,

597
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,880
even something like lead and gasoline.

598
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,680
Why was that a contentious issue?

599
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,001
Why would there be people who say we don't need to take the lead out of gasoline?

600
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:51,691
Yes, ma'am.

601
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,491
Well not just more work for the gas companies, but what else?

602
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,252
More cost, okay?

603
00:38:01,252 --> 00:38:04,800
They're a big lobby, those companies are very powerful.

604
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,361
They didn't wanna spend the money to have to take the lead out, so what do they do?

605
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:14,073
They challenge the science, they go lobby with their congress people and

606
00:38:14,073 --> 00:38:19,380
say you gotta fight this, this is gonna kill us, it's gonna break our backs.

607
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,126
We're seeing that with all kinds of issues,

608
00:38:22,126 --> 00:38:25,823
there are very few public issues where that doesn't occur.

609
00:38:25,823 --> 00:38:27,855
So, what does that tell you?

610
00:38:27,855 --> 00:38:33,139
Public health policy, and for reasons you will come to understand,

611
00:38:33,139 --> 00:38:39,739
we have to produce policy to make public health work, requires science for sure.

612
00:38:39,739 --> 00:38:45,470
But it also requires the art of being effective in politics.

613
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:50,518
And pulling those two things together critical for public health policy,

614
00:38:50,518 --> 00:38:55,501
that's a real challenge coz there's almost nobody who's good at both.

615
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,880
Most people in public health work on one or the other.

616
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,980
Getting them together is tough.

617
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,591
We'll see lots of examples of that throughout this term.

618
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:11,302
Now, the third one is actually a very interesting and I hope I'll be able to

619
00:39:11,302 --> 00:39:15,610
make this clear to you, assurance of the availability of needed services.

620
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:19,480
So let's take a very simple example.

621
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:25,070
Although it is not public health role to provide healthcare to individuals,

622
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:29,800
that's not its principal role, it is the role of public health to

623
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,201
make sure that healthcare is available to all individuals.

624
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:38,598
That's a function of public health.

625
00:39:38,598 --> 00:39:42,446
How do they do that when they've got that little $60 billion over there versus

626
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:45,003
the three trillion we're spending on medical care?

627
00:39:45,003 --> 00:39:50,346
They can't do it by providing the services, so what they have

628
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:56,425
to do is number one, encourage others to do that, public or private.

629
00:39:56,425 --> 00:40:00,000
Many hospitals, for decades, have provided care for

630
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,819
people who didn't have insurance and they basically wrote off the loss or

631
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,941
charged more to people who did have insurance.

632
00:40:07,941 --> 00:40:12,292
But that was part of an implicit deal with public health that says,

633
00:40:12,292 --> 00:40:14,632
we gotta take care of these people.

634
00:40:14,632 --> 00:40:18,005
When they come in through the door after that car collision and needs some

635
00:40:18,005 --> 00:40:21,891
emergency aid you don't say no because they don't have an insurance card on them.

636
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,280
Now, sometimes we have to require such actions through laws or regulations.

637
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,701
In other words, write up something that tells another organisation,

638
00:40:34,701 --> 00:40:39,142
it might be a hospital, you must do x, y or z as part of law.

639
00:40:39,142 --> 00:40:43,497
That is your responsibility, if you don't do it, you're in contempt of the law,

640
00:40:43,497 --> 00:40:45,501
you can be penalised or what have you.

641
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,521
So those would be the two major mechanisms by which public health attempts to ensure

642
00:40:51,521 --> 00:40:54,980
that all people have access to healthcare.

643
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,525
Number three here says, directly providing services.

644
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:01,135
This is a safety net concept.

645
00:41:01,135 --> 00:41:06,133
People fall through the cracks, obviously in this country we have not done a good

646
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:09,823
job of ensuring that all people have access to health care.

647
00:41:09,823 --> 00:41:14,599
We are the unique example of that amongst the developed world.

648
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:19,190
We're the only major developed nation in the world that hasn't solved that problem.

649
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:24,131
But most people in the United States have good access to very high quality

650
00:41:24,131 --> 00:41:25,112
health care.

651
00:41:25,112 --> 00:41:30,108
Some don't and you will find health agencies through principally

652
00:41:30,108 --> 00:41:35,549
local health departments providing services as a sort of last resort for

653
00:41:35,549 --> 00:41:39,046
the people who don't have access otherwise.

654
00:41:39,046 --> 00:41:40,580
It's a problem.

655
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,340
If you look at the budgets of local health departments,

656
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:48,980
you will find many of them that spend 50% or more of their budgets on

657
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:54,280
providing individual health services to individual patients.

658
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,080
They shouldn't be doing that.

659
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,510
They should be able to use that money for broader public health purposes.

660
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,080
But they have to provide the safety net.

661
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,570
So that's the assurance of the availability of needed services.

662
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:12,276
It's not just healthcare services, obviously it's water fluoridation,

663
00:42:12,276 --> 00:42:17,292
clean restaurants and the whole nine yards, everything about it.

664
00:42:18,321 --> 00:42:22,957
Okay, I'm not going to read to you what the 10 essential public health

665
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:26,914
services are on this slide and the next, but you should do so.

666
00:42:26,914 --> 00:42:31,443
Read them and get a sense of what the Institute of Medicine,

667
00:42:31,443 --> 00:42:34,162
now National Academy of Medicine,

668
00:42:34,162 --> 00:42:38,254
deem to be the 10 basic functions of public health.

669
00:42:38,254 --> 00:42:42,099
So, if you're gonna test the local health department on whether or

670
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:46,561
not they're doing their job, this could be a checklist for you to go against.

671
00:42:46,561 --> 00:42:49,391
Are they doing each of these functions adequately?

672
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,280
There are five basic areas of public health.

673
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,040
You see them up here.

674
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,770
The names of our departments are exactly what you see and

675
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:06,790
we now have one on nutrition, a brand new department on nutrition as well.

676
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:11,380
But every school of public health has a slightly different structure to it.

677
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:18,768
They all, every one of them will cover these five basic areas of public health.

678
00:43:18,768 --> 00:43:25,018
Epidemiology and biostatistics are the two basic science methods of public health.

679
00:43:25,018 --> 00:43:29,800
They're the science, I should say science disciplines of public health.

680
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,461
Environmental health and health behaviour and health education are dealing

681
00:43:34,461 --> 00:43:38,684
with exposures that people have either through their own behaviour or

682
00:43:38,684 --> 00:43:40,370
through the environment.

683
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:45,005
Health management and policy represents an attempt to organise

684
00:43:45,005 --> 00:43:49,980
things in a logical manner so that we have the opportunity to maximise

685
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:54,468
the conditions that will most improve the public's health.

686
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:59,345
Epidemiology and you'll have a great lecture on that coming up pretty soon from

687
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,984
Dr Sharon Kardia who's the associate dean of the school and

688
00:44:02,984 --> 00:44:05,280
a marvellous epidemiologist.

689
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,766
Epidemiology is concerned with analysing and describing patterns of occurrence and

690
00:44:09,766 --> 00:44:12,980
determinants of diseases in human populations.

691
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:18,480
We do tend to think of this as the core science of the field of public health.

692
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,846
And by the way, if you like mysteries and

693
00:44:21,846 --> 00:44:27,780
you like solving problems, you might like epidemiology.

694
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,618
Now I'm not gonna tell you everyday people run into work

695
00:44:31,618 --> 00:44:35,380
in order to solve a mystery today, but they do it a lot.

696
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:40,123
For example, I'll give you the most mundane example and this happens hundreds

697
00:44:40,123 --> 00:44:44,580
of times if not thousands of times every year in the United States.

698
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:49,180
There's an outbreak of what appears to be a food born illness.

699
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:52,027
You wanna figure out where it's coming from so

700
00:44:52,027 --> 00:44:57,280
you can put a stop to it, prevent future or additional episodes of illness.

701
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,770
That's one of the jobs that epidemiologists do.

702
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:03,239
When I chaired a department here many years ago,

703
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:04,992
I used it as a smaller department.

704
00:45:04,992 --> 00:45:07,554
I would take the entire first year class to Lansing,

705
00:45:07,554 --> 00:45:11,167
to sit down with what is now the Michigan Department of Community Health,

706
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:13,700
within the Michigan Department of Public Health.

707
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:17,264
And we hear their lead epidemiologist talk about what they did in

708
00:45:17,264 --> 00:45:19,470
the State Health Department.

709
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:24,512
And he told this wonderful storey, about an outbreak of foodborne illness,

710
00:45:24,512 --> 00:45:27,447
that was getting people all over Michigan.

711
00:45:27,447 --> 00:45:30,622
And that makes it difficult to figure out right away, right?

712
00:45:30,622 --> 00:45:34,249
Because it's not just localised to one community,

713
00:45:34,249 --> 00:45:39,038
it's not just bad potato salad at the park that some small group had.

714
00:45:39,038 --> 00:45:42,470
It was occurring all over the State of Michigan.

715
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:43,181
So what do they do?

716
00:45:43,181 --> 00:45:45,431
They go out and interview the people who are ill.

717
00:45:45,431 --> 00:45:48,667
They ask them what they had to eat in the last 72 hours or so,

718
00:45:48,667 --> 00:45:51,410
where did you have your meals and so on and so forth.

719
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:56,725
And in very short order, they figured out that it had to do with somebody

720
00:45:56,725 --> 00:46:02,470
who was sick, was preparing salads for Bill Knapp's restaurant.

721
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:04,670
How many have ever heard of Bill Knapp's?

722
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:08,060
Okay, this used to be one of the big chains in Michigan.

723
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:11,404
This was the place that you went to on your birthday,

724
00:46:11,404 --> 00:46:15,748
if you're already over 21 and we're going to the Pretzell Bell.

725
00:46:15,748 --> 00:46:20,570
And you would get your age as a percentage off, your dinner.

726
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:22,288
So if you are 75, you go there and

727
00:46:22,288 --> 00:46:24,966
you have three quarters off the price of your dinner.

728
00:46:24,966 --> 00:46:30,176
And we threatened to take my wife's grandmother was 102 there.

729
00:46:30,176 --> 00:46:31,610
>> [LAUGH].

730
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:34,393
>> And make them pay her 2% of her bill to have eaten there.

731
00:46:34,393 --> 00:46:36,047
>> [INAUDIBLE].

732
00:46:36,047 --> 00:46:36,860
>> pardon?

733
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,911
>> [INAUDIBLE].

734
00:46:38,911 --> 00:46:41,822
>> But that's right, We do have the chocolate cake [LAUGH].

735
00:46:41,822 --> 00:46:42,640
>> [INAUDIBLE].

736
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,821
>> They gave you a chocolate cake.

737
00:46:43,821 --> 00:46:44,421
That is correct.

738
00:46:44,421 --> 00:46:46,770
It was small, but it was very good.

739
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:51,151
So, it was a good place to go, have a birthday, a nice family restaurant.

740
00:46:51,151 --> 00:46:55,891
Interestingly Bill Knapp's, the restaurants were only in Michigan,

741
00:46:55,891 --> 00:46:59,170
but the salad preparation took place in Indiana.

742
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:03,198
And within a matter of a few days, literally a few days,

743
00:47:03,198 --> 00:47:06,027
they tracked down one guy who was sick,

744
00:47:06,027 --> 00:47:11,088
wasn't wearing the appropriate gloves and hat and mask and all that,

745
00:47:11,088 --> 00:47:16,460
was essentially getting stuff into the salad and that's what caused it.

746
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:22,270
They shut down that operation right away, and the epidemic stopped.

747
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:24,034
There's also a marvellous book,

748
00:47:24,034 --> 00:47:27,830
I don't know where you can find this because it's so old at this stage.

749
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:30,570
I think it's called Twelve Blue Men.

750
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:32,770
If that's if that's the right name of it.

751
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:37,040
It was written by, I can't remember the guy's name, I can find if anybody wants,

752
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,176
but he's a Frenchman epidemiologists.

753
00:47:39,176 --> 00:47:43,432
And it's essentially a series of storeys about epidemiology, and

754
00:47:43,432 --> 00:47:48,671
what various mysteries had to be solved, and how the epidemiologists solve them.

755
00:47:48,671 --> 00:47:53,477
I can also tell you lots of other books like that fascinating field,

756
00:47:53,477 --> 00:47:59,317
lots of stuff to look at that you will be talking about throughout the term on that.

757
00:47:59,317 --> 00:48:02,687
Biostatistics, this is looking at the development and

758
00:48:02,687 --> 00:48:06,774
application of statistical mathematical methods to the design and

759
00:48:06,774 --> 00:48:10,970
analysis of public health problems and biomedical research.

760
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:15,706
A lot of biostatisticians, including those in this school worked,

761
00:48:15,706 --> 00:48:20,933
not only, but in large part with physicians and other medical scientists,

762
00:48:20,933 --> 00:48:24,970
in helping them to design trials and do the light.

763
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:29,213
We have a group doing statistical genetics here,

764
00:48:29,213 --> 00:48:32,554
that is quite literally world famous.

765
00:48:32,554 --> 00:48:35,120
One of our biostatisticians.

766
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:40,064
There's a list that's put out, I can't remember who puts it out right now,

767
00:48:40,064 --> 00:48:45,101
but there's a list of the ten most cited scientists in the world in all fields.

768
00:48:45,101 --> 00:48:50,770
And he was number eight a couple of years ago, and number seven the next year.

769
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:56,004
That group is developing means of associating genes with

770
00:48:56,004 --> 00:49:00,811
illness conditions, very complicated business.

771
00:49:00,811 --> 00:49:06,132
This guy I mentioned has developed a series of methods to do this,

772
00:49:06,132 --> 00:49:12,250
that has taken the notion of evaluating a genome to look at the connection.

773
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:16,524
The evaluation of genome that needs to be done for the statistical testing,

774
00:49:16,524 --> 00:49:20,270
used to take something like two weeks to do one of them.

775
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:21,604
His first time out,

776
00:49:21,604 --> 00:49:27,070
he got that down for two days, the next time out he got it down to two hours.

777
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:31,864
It's brilliant work and it's fascinating stuff, if you happen to be

778
00:49:31,864 --> 00:49:36,520
good at mathematics and interested in understanding statistics.

779
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,029
I will say this, it is critically important for

780
00:49:40,029 --> 00:49:44,370
anybody in public health to understand statistics.

781
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:50,231
It's also critically important for anybody in medicine to understand statistics.

782
00:49:50,231 --> 00:49:54,791
And I considered a major failing of medical education that doesn't

783
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:58,394
do a better job training physicians and statistics.

784
00:49:58,394 --> 00:50:02,621
So that they can understand what various experiences mean, and

785
00:50:02,621 --> 00:50:07,946
that they can read the literature and understand what's really significant and

786
00:50:07,946 --> 00:50:13,129
should affect their behaviour, their practise and what isn't significant.

787
00:50:13,129 --> 00:50:17,700
As you might have gathered, I liked occasionally to give individual anecdotes.

788
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,670
So I'll give you one of my favourite about me.

789
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:25,470
When I was in my 40's I used to have lots of back problems.

790
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:27,344
You'll have them, don't worry.

791
00:50:27,344 --> 00:50:30,254
>> [LAUGH]. >> 85% of everybody In the United States

792
00:50:30,254 --> 00:50:33,350
has at least one serious episode of back problems.

793
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:35,480
Mine went on for about ten years, and

794
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:39,270
you knock on wood I'm much better now than I was then.

795
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:42,919
My physician said, I want you to go see this Doc,

796
00:50:42,919 --> 00:50:48,870
this is a tenured associate professor at the University of Michigan.

797
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:52,654
He said, I want you to have him take a look at you, and

798
00:50:52,654 --> 00:50:56,270
see what we can figure out, if anything.

799
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:59,991
I went in to see the guy, and he said I want you to get an MRI.

800
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:02,870
I said, why?

801
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:05,461
Because I was not interested in surgery at that point.

802
00:51:05,461 --> 00:51:08,570
There's lots of reasons not to be interested in back surgery.

803
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:12,060
And I wasn't, I said I wasn't gonna consider it at that stage.

804
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,070
And he said baseline.

805
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,098
So you see what your back looks like today, and

806
00:51:16,098 --> 00:51:19,870
then if we ever have to take a look at a later stage and see how it's changed.

807
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:26,440
And then he said this to me, honestly he said why not?

808
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,452
It's not gonna hurt you, and it's not gonna cost you anything.

809
00:51:30,452 --> 00:51:33,070
That's a problem in healthcare.

810
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:35,540
Why are we spending $3 trillion?

811
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,660
Well maybe one reason is not gonna cost me, the patient,

812
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:43,300
who's getting the service anything, because I'm covered through my insurance.

813
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:48,639
It's just gonna cost everybody who shares that insurance with me, okay?

814
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:52,637
So I went and got the MRI, went back into the guy's office, and

815
00:51:52,637 --> 00:51:57,917
he put up the picture on the light box and there's what looks like, I've been doing

816
00:51:57,917 --> 00:52:03,071
a little research on my own, and there's what looks like a pretty normal spine.

817
00:52:03,071 --> 00:52:05,510
Except there's this great big bulge.

818
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:10,770
And the radiologist has drawn a red crayon arrow pointing at the large bulge.

819
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:12,019
The doctor says,

820
00:52:12,019 --> 00:52:17,191
well there's nothing in this picture that suggests any kinda a problem.

821
00:52:17,191 --> 00:52:19,110
So it's got to be something else.

822
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:20,656
I said excuse me Doc isn't that?

823
00:52:20,656 --> 00:52:21,470
>> [LAUGH].

824
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:25,318
>> Yeah, there's not a large arrow pointing at a large bulge?

825
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:30,249
And he said that's nothing, this is a direct quote by the way,

826
00:52:30,249 --> 00:52:36,079
he said that's nothing 90% of all lower back disc problems are L4-L 5,

827
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:39,240
that's L3-L 4, so that's nothing.

828
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,381
To which I said, excuse me?

829
00:52:41,381 --> 00:52:42,651
Didn't you just say 90%.?

830
00:52:42,651 --> 00:52:47,170
Doesn't that mean 10% can occur in the adjacent vertebrae?

831
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:51,885
And he said like this, no, it's never happened, just doesn't happen, so

832
00:52:51,885 --> 00:52:54,770
that doesn't mean anything.

833
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:58,470
This was a tenured professor at the University of Michigan.

834
00:52:58,470 --> 00:52:59,227
Okay?

835
00:52:59,227 --> 00:53:02,248
He didn't understand statistics at all.

836
00:53:02,248 --> 00:53:03,033
>> [LAUGH].

837
00:53:03,033 --> 00:53:05,370
>> And that one's easy.

838
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:06,551
That one's easy.

839
00:53:06,551 --> 00:53:09,020
Let me assure you, I can give you many examples.

840
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:13,455
Other ones that are a little bit more difficult than that were ,where

841
00:53:13,455 --> 00:53:18,349
physicians have as a group made wholesale changes in medical practise based

842
00:53:18,349 --> 00:53:22,120
on information that was not statistically significant.

843
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:25,191
There's some marvellous case studies of that, and it's worrisome.

844
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,061
Environmental health sciences,

845
00:53:29,061 --> 00:53:32,981
aims to protect human health from adverse environmental conditions.

846
00:53:32,981 --> 00:53:37,596
And in particular, we're thinking about harmful practises and exposures in air,

847
00:53:37,596 --> 00:53:41,450
water and food, in the workplace, home, and ambient environment.

848
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:46,141
You will hear lots more about that, from Professor who by the way, teaches

849
00:53:46,141 --> 00:53:50,915
the undergraduate class on environmental health, along with one of his colleagues.

850
00:53:50,915 --> 00:53:53,281
You'll hear from him later on in the term.

851
00:53:53,281 --> 00:53:57,690
And it's a very interesting area with lots of activity going on.

852
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:01,013
And by the way I said, if you like mysteries,

853
00:54:01,013 --> 00:54:04,522
epidemiology is a great place to go for a field.

854
00:54:04,522 --> 00:54:08,510
If you wanna go into a field where the unfortunately,

855
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:12,430
where the competition for slots is not very strong.

856
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:15,753
There's not that many people going into environmental health for

857
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:17,301
reasons I don't understand.

858
00:54:17,301 --> 00:54:19,841
It's a really interesting area, it's an important one.

859
00:54:19,841 --> 00:54:21,588
And there seems to be quite a bit of demand for

860
00:54:21,588 --> 00:54:23,970
people who are trained in environmental health.

861
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:27,899
That's the field nationwide, that has trouble in Schools of Public Health,

862
00:54:27,899 --> 00:54:31,270
getting an adequate number of really good students.

863
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:32,900
I don't know why.

864
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,795
I don't think anybody does.

865
00:54:34,795 --> 00:54:39,634
Health Behaviour and Health Education, this is the area that addresses what is

866
00:54:39,634 --> 00:54:43,611
associated with health related behaviour, and health status.

867
00:54:43,611 --> 00:54:46,971
And develops, and evaluates educational activities,

868
00:54:46,971 --> 00:54:52,070
designed to improve individual and community health and quality of life.

869
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:56,020
So this is a group, this is an unfair generalisation.

870
00:54:56,020 --> 00:55:00,846
But a lot of the faculty in this area would come with backgrounds in psychology,

871
00:55:00,846 --> 00:55:05,528
sociology that's sorta more typical, is that a fair statement back there,

872
00:55:05,528 --> 00:55:09,010
more typical background of people and health behaviour.

873
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:13,064
And again, these are the folks who are dealing directly with the behavioural

874
00:55:13,064 --> 00:55:18,370
issues, that will talk a lot about in this course, because it's so important.

875
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:23,461
Health Management and Policy, is trying to improve access to financing of and

876
00:55:23,461 --> 00:55:26,545
delivery of high quality health services, and

877
00:55:26,545 --> 00:55:31,670
also to develop and implement cost effective public health policies.

878
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:34,546
So this is an area where you get everything,

879
00:55:34,546 --> 00:55:39,214
from people going into consulting firms trying to do analyses of public

880
00:55:39,214 --> 00:55:44,070
health policies, to people who are running health systems.

881
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:48,660
So a very large proportion of the heads of major health care system in

882
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:53,920
the United States are graduates of our programme in health management policy.

883
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,770
The school, as I'm sure you know, is very highly ranked.

884
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:00,498
This programme is the number one ranked programme in health administration

885
00:56:00,498 --> 00:56:03,042
in the nation, and has been ever since US News and

886
00:56:03,042 --> 00:56:06,291
World Report started doing their rankings in the 1990s.

887
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:08,931
End of commercial.

888
00:56:08,931 --> 00:56:10,323
Let's get back to the TV Show now.

889
00:56:10,323 --> 00:56:10,823
>> [LAUGH].

890
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:15,627
>> Alright, I wanted to define disease prevention for you.

891
00:56:15,627 --> 00:56:20,570
Here you see something from a kinda classic textbook in public health.

892
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:25,620
Anticipatory action taken to reduce the possibility of an event or

893
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:30,400
condition occurring or developing, or to minimise the damage

894
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:36,170
that may result from that event or condition, if it does occur.

895
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:37,670
Now, what does this mean?

896
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:41,690
Well if you take a look here, there are three different levels of prevention.

897
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,700
Primary, secondary and tertiary.

898
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,742
So I'm going to define them for you here, and then I'll give you some examples that

899
00:56:47,742 --> 00:56:50,070
I think will make this much easier to understand.

900
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:56,316
Primary prevention, is going after people who might be susceptible to a disease or

901
00:56:56,316 --> 00:57:02,206
condition, and trying to prevent them from developing it in the first place,

902
00:57:02,206 --> 00:57:05,870
that will reduce disease incidents.

903
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:09,907
Secondary, is taking people who are asymptomatic, and

904
00:57:09,907 --> 00:57:14,698
trying to figure out and find that in fact they have a condition, and

905
00:57:14,698 --> 00:57:19,270
you wanna reduce either the prevalence or consequence of that.

906
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:23,129
So, the young lady who mentioned colon cancer, colonoscopy for

907
00:57:23,129 --> 00:57:24,550
colon cancer earlier.

908
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:29,161
This is a good example that, if you screen, you don't know if you have colon

909
00:57:29,161 --> 00:57:34,133
cancer, but if you get screened for it and it's a positive, you can be treated for

910
00:57:34,133 --> 00:57:38,700
it and essentially assuming it isn't widely disseminated at that point.

911
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:43,070
You can prevent any adverse outcomes through the surgery.

912
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:44,581
Okay, so that's a nice example there.

913
00:57:44,581 --> 00:57:46,762
But I'll give you some even better ones I think.

914
00:57:46,762 --> 00:57:52,370
Tertiary prevention, somebody is symptomatic.

915
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:56,694
You know something's going on, and you wanna reduce the complications or

916
00:57:56,694 --> 00:58:00,262
disability from their condition, what their condition is,

917
00:58:00,262 --> 00:58:02,670
ill give you example of that.

918
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:06,671
Most people in public health are interested in primary and

919
00:58:06,671 --> 00:58:08,770
secondary prevention.

920
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:14,255
Tertiary prevention begins to look like something we call ,treatment, okay?

921
00:58:14,255 --> 00:58:19,570
So think of tertiary prevention as treating an existing condition.

922
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:24,890
Primary and secondary prevention, are actually trying to prevent that illness or

923
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:29,670
disability from occurring, or reduce its consequences.

924
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:34,370
Now, that's kinda confusing, this I hope will make it much clearer.

925
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:37,651
So let's take an area where we have made enormous progress, and

926
00:58:37,651 --> 00:58:41,370
that's with regard to motor vehicle related injuries.

927
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:46,270
Primary prevention, build a divided highway.

928
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:50,603
People tend to run into each other a whole lot less frequently,

929
00:58:50,603 --> 00:58:52,827
if the highway is split, okay?

930
00:58:52,827 --> 00:58:57,099
So the actual barrier, or area of land between the two sides.

931
00:58:57,099 --> 00:59:03,270
That in itself, took down the number of deaths on the highways quite dramatically.

932
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:05,050
That's primary prevention.

933
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:08,670
It prevents the collisions from occurring.

934
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:11,531
Secondary, have safer cars.

935
00:59:11,531 --> 00:59:15,870
So you have airbags or people wearing seatbelts.

936
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:19,639
The collision occurs, instead of getting killed,

937
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:23,931
sometimes you walk out of it with just some bruises, okay?

938
00:59:23,931 --> 00:59:26,490
So the collision still occurs, but

939
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:32,302
you've managed to prevent any serious outcome, not always, but frequently.

940
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:38,291
Tertiary, somebody's in a car crash, they weren't wearing their seatbelts,

941
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:43,236
their head goes smash into the glass and everything else, and EMS,

942
00:59:43,236 --> 00:59:47,440
Emergency Medical Services, has to come and save them.

943
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,380
That's tertiary because it really is treatment.

944
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:52,352
Now the damage has occurred, and

945
00:59:52,352 --> 00:59:56,270
you have to minimise its consequences through treatment.

946
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:58,148
You have any questions about that example?

947
00:59:58,148 --> 01:00:00,110
Because I think it, yes please.

948
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:11,857
[INAUDIBLE] >> Where would I put that in here?

949
01:00:11,857 --> 01:00:15,844
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> It could have been, it certainly could

950
01:00:15,844 --> 01:00:20,653
have been one of the things that's really interesting is,

951
01:00:20,653 --> 01:00:26,326
we talk about public health, a lot of people think about healthcare,

952
01:00:26,326 --> 01:00:29,530
and getting disabused of that notion.

953
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:32,360
Think about something like automotive safety.

954
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:36,456
That's an area that for most people is almost completely outside the area of

955
01:00:36,456 --> 01:00:39,728
health, and yet it has a very significant impact on health.

956
01:00:39,728 --> 01:00:43,349
So, whether it's a public health person who came up with that, or

957
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:46,210
a safety engineer, or somebody else I don't know.

958
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:52,201
But it certainly is somebody who has the right kind of public health thinking,

959
01:00:52,201 --> 01:00:52,759
okay?

960
01:00:52,759 --> 01:00:57,150
Another example, high blood pressure.

961
01:00:57,150 --> 01:01:01,573
If you eat a proper diet and you exercise, you may be able to

962
01:01:01,573 --> 01:01:07,150
prevent yourself from developing high blood pressure, right?

963
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:09,881
Some people, even with diet exercise can't do that.

964
01:01:09,881 --> 01:01:12,250
They've got a genetic predisposition.

965
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:16,550
They end up with high blood pressure, and diet and exercise are not enough.

966
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:20,095
Secondary, prevention with them is control of

967
01:01:20,095 --> 01:01:23,850
their blood pressure through medications.

968
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:28,721
This is one of the couple of major contributors to the dramatic reductions in

969
01:01:28,721 --> 01:01:32,375
heart disease, and stroke deaths in the United States,

970
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:34,371
is blood pressure treatment.

971
01:01:34,371 --> 01:01:36,352
So, they're asymptomatic.

972
01:01:36,352 --> 01:01:39,724
You can't tell if you have high blood pressure, you don't feel it, but

973
01:01:39,724 --> 01:01:42,680
you got high blood pressure, you treat it, you bring it down.

974
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:47,686
People are much less likely to have heart attacks and strokes as a result.

975
01:01:47,686 --> 01:01:51,043
Tertiary care, somebody has that heart attack, or

976
01:01:51,043 --> 01:01:55,871
stroke and you treat them, the disease is equally of high blood pressure.

977
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:02,304
Any questions about the distinction between primary,

978
01:02:02,304 --> 01:02:06,823
secondary, and tertiary prevention?

979
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:11,877
All right, so, the final issue I wanna talk about it in some degree,

980
01:02:11,877 --> 01:02:15,016
because it's it's pretty important is,

981
01:02:15,016 --> 01:02:18,872
why public health issues are so often contentious?

982
01:02:18,872 --> 01:02:24,600
And you see five reasons here, one is that they restrict individual liberty.

983
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:29,450
Many public health measures restrict individual liberty.

984
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:34,161
If it is a law that you have to wear your seat belt in the state of Michigan,

985
01:02:34,161 --> 01:02:39,350
that's restricting your freedom to decide that you don't want it.

986
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:44,580
Or if it's a law that you have to wear a helmet, if you're a motorcyclist in

987
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:49,903
the state of Michigan that's restricting your freedom as a motorcyclist.

988
01:02:49,903 --> 01:02:53,970
And many of you may be aware that a couple of years ago now

989
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:58,046
the motorcyclist won the right to remove the helmets.

990
01:02:58,046 --> 01:03:02,552
After about 20 years of annual lobbying against helmets,

991
01:03:02,552 --> 01:03:05,550
they finally won that right.

992
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:08,035
We could have a fascinating, and long, and

993
01:03:08,035 --> 01:03:12,290
detailed discussion about whether that's good, bad, or indifferent.

994
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:14,260
We know it's gonna kill more people.

995
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:17,680
We know it's gonna have more people who are gonna be tetraplegics.

996
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,948
As a result, we know that, that's very well established by comparing the half

997
01:03:21,948 --> 01:03:26,361
the states that have motorcycle helmet laws with the half the states that don't.

998
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:32,449
But maybe there's some value to the freedom that individuals have to

999
01:03:32,449 --> 01:03:35,161
make that decision to take that risk.

1000
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:40,014
Second, the debate over individual responsibility,

1001
01:03:40,014 --> 01:03:42,671
which often goes under the label, blame the victim.

1002
01:03:42,671 --> 01:03:45,050
I'll make that very clear to you in a moment.

1003
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:49,550
Third, economic interests rearing their ugly head again.

1004
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:54,332
Fourth, the morality issues that tend to pervade a lot of public health.

1005
01:03:54,332 --> 01:03:58,184
And then fifth, the politics that are embedded in science.

1006
01:03:58,184 --> 01:04:03,440
And that's one unfortunately not gonna have a lot of time to talk to you about.

1007
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:07,230
I personally find it fascinating and frequently very frightening, but

1008
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:11,350
I will least give you an indication of what that's all about.

1009
01:04:11,350 --> 01:04:14,793
Why do we impose restrictions on individual liberty?

1010
01:04:14,793 --> 01:04:19,289
Well, sometimes they're actually good reasons to do it from a sort of

1011
01:04:19,289 --> 01:04:21,290
philosophical point of view.

1012
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,684
And these are related to something that we again,

1013
01:04:23,684 --> 01:04:26,780
we'll come to later on called externalities and public goods.

1014
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,410
I'll define those for you.

1015
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:30,378
I think it maybe next week, and

1016
01:04:30,378 --> 01:04:34,253
those of you have had some economics will know what they are.

1017
01:04:34,253 --> 01:04:39,915
Basically they're saying this is a case where leaving decisions to individuals

1018
01:04:39,915 --> 01:04:44,671
to the market is not satisfactory from a theoretical point of view.

1019
01:04:44,671 --> 01:04:48,510
It's just the wrong thing to do and you need to get involved.

1020
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:54,819
So, this tragedy of the commons comes from a very classic storey of a commons area,

1021
01:04:54,819 --> 01:04:59,951
somewhere in England, where there were beautiful grazing land.

1022
01:04:59,951 --> 01:05:04,212
And people would bring their sheep to graze on this land because it was so good.

1023
01:05:04,212 --> 01:05:08,635
Everybody would bring more and more sheep and they started crowding out each other

1024
01:05:08,635 --> 01:05:12,798
and depleting the land and had lost its value and all of them, everybody was in

1025
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:16,797
trouble with their sheep because they've lost this great grazing area.

1026
01:05:16,797 --> 01:05:19,666
So, it's a problem when everybody's trying to do something,

1027
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:23,237
get too crowded around something, you have to have some kind of restrictions.

1028
01:05:23,237 --> 01:05:26,250
You have to have some mechanism for making that work.

1029
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:29,408
We'll talk a lot more about that.

1030
01:05:29,408 --> 01:05:34,384
Paternalism, seatbelt laws, who does seatbelt laws save?

1031
01:05:34,384 --> 01:05:38,150
It's the people who are wearing them.

1032
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:43,644
So, it's paternalistic to tell people that they must wear seatbelts,

1033
01:05:43,644 --> 01:05:48,250
they have to protect themselves whether they like it or not.

1034
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:53,398
It's paternalistic but acceptable to say that kids have to wear

1035
01:05:53,398 --> 01:05:58,737
seatbelts because we don't allocate to them the rational adult,

1036
01:05:58,737 --> 01:06:01,424
mature decision making theory.

1037
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:05,016
We say basically they have to be protected so that's okay.

1038
01:06:05,016 --> 01:06:08,271
But seat belt laws are basically paternalistic,

1039
01:06:08,271 --> 01:06:11,230
protecting you whether or not you like them.

1040
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:15,226
Now, my guess is that most of you don't even think twice when you get in a car,

1041
01:06:15,226 --> 01:06:18,856
buckling your seatbelt is as much a part of getting in the car is sitting

1042
01:06:18,856 --> 01:06:19,560
in the seat.

1043
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:22,008
That's my guess, I feel that way.

1044
01:06:22,008 --> 01:06:27,850
I feel naked or weird if I'm driving, even backing up and you out of the car,

1045
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:32,347
backing out of the driveway and I want my seat belt buckle.

1046
01:06:32,347 --> 01:06:36,449
I don't feel right, there's something really wrong with that,

1047
01:06:36,449 --> 01:06:38,874
I just don't feel right when I do that.

1048
01:06:38,874 --> 01:06:43,771
I have a friend who's nearing 90 years old, and every single time he

1049
01:06:43,771 --> 01:06:48,513
gets in the car, I've got to talk him into putting on his seat belt.

1050
01:06:48,513 --> 01:06:52,371
Because he grew up in an era before seat belts.

1051
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:56,671
My first car and later on in the term you will see it.

1052
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:02,160
My first car was a Corvair convertible, 1965.

1053
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,820
I Absolutes loved the thing.

1054
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:08,516
It had seat belts in it just because it was 1965.

1055
01:07:08,516 --> 01:07:11,960
Before that, I never wore a second.

1056
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:14,066
I didn't know what they were and

1057
01:07:14,066 --> 01:07:17,732
you'll see data that will show you how to tie over time,

1058
01:07:17,732 --> 01:07:23,197
how the use of seatbelts has spread to the point now we're in a place like Michigan.

1059
01:07:23,197 --> 01:07:27,550
90 some odd percent of people use seatbelts essentially all the time.

1060
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:30,540
So, it's a second nature to us, but it wasn't.

1061
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:35,021
There social norms and morals, sodomy laws that are on the books and

1062
01:07:35,021 --> 01:07:36,521
still in some states.

1063
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:40,170
So, I mentioned restrictions on individual liberty.

1064
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:42,930
These are behaviour that directly affect others.

1065
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:45,160
What are some of the best examples here?

1066
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:48,171
Actually, this is not a trick question if you have your notes in front of you.

1067
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:50,700
Yes. >> Smoking.

1068
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:54,134
>> Smoking is a great example because if you're smoking and

1069
01:07:54,134 --> 01:07:58,572
other people's presence, you're exposing them to secondhand smoke,

1070
01:07:58,572 --> 01:08:02,390
which has hazards associated with it In addition to the noise.

1071
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:03,950
That's a beautiful one.

1072
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:05,119
What else?

1073
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:06,404
Sir, sorry.

1074
01:08:06,404 --> 01:08:08,507
>> Criminal activity.

1075
01:08:08,507 --> 01:08:10,620
>> Criminal activity.

1076
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:14,121
Absolutely, why do we ban, tell people they can't murder others.

1077
01:08:14,121 --> 01:08:17,770
They can't break into people's houses because they're harming other people.

1078
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:20,460
So, that's another case of that.

1079
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,152
Yes, Ma'am In the back.

1080
01:08:22,152 --> 01:08:22,888
I'm sorry.

1081
01:08:22,888 --> 01:08:24,801
>> Driving while intoxicated.

1082
01:08:24,801 --> 01:08:29,537
>> Driving while intoxicated or in your generation's instance,

1083
01:08:29,537 --> 01:08:33,832
while texting, they're at least as bad as one another and

1084
01:08:33,832 --> 01:08:40,250
you are creating hazards on the road for others around you when you do that.

1085
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,320
So, you get the picture here.

1086
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:47,219
There are lots of them, and they all relate to the risk that is imposed

1087
01:08:47,219 --> 01:08:50,271
on someone other than the decision maker.

1088
01:08:51,450 --> 01:08:54,463
This is what relates to this notion of externalities,

1089
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:56,761
even simple things like traffic lights.

1090
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:02,404
The fact that we have traffic lights is there to prevent one person's

1091
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:06,360
irrational or risky behaviour from hurting somebody else.

1092
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:10,050
By the way, I love traffic lights.

1093
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:14,750
I think about traffic lights, like very few other public regulations.

1094
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:20,850
If I'm on my bike, or I'm walking, there's nobody coming across the street.

1095
01:09:20,850 --> 01:09:22,550
Red light doesn't matter.

1096
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:25,782
Should, but it doesn't, there are places in the world where it does matter and

1097
01:09:25,782 --> 01:09:28,450
you better know when you're there that it does.

1098
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:31,856
But if I'm in a car, I could be coming home at 12 or

1099
01:09:31,856 --> 01:09:35,690
1:00 AM from somewhere and I stopped for a red light.

1100
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:41,861
There's nobody within 3000 yards of me and I wait for the light to turn green.

1101
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:46,650
That is amazing level of compliance.

1102
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:49,150
And almost everybody does that.

1103
01:09:49,150 --> 01:09:50,360
Almost everybody does it.

1104
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:56,269
It's a good thing that we do overall, although it's kind of silly in a way.

1105
01:09:56,269 --> 01:10:00,360
Where did we change a law relating to traffic lights

1106
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,651
in the not too distant past?

1107
01:10:02,651 --> 01:10:04,479
This is probably actually before you were born,

1108
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:07,050
but it's not too distant past for some of us.

1109
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:11,635
What do we change to get rid of some of the irrationality of waiting at that

1110
01:10:11,635 --> 01:10:12,650
light?

1111
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:13,723
>> Right on red.

1112
01:10:13,723 --> 01:10:15,960
>> Right on red, good for you.

1113
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:20,205
You were never allowed before that to turn right on a red light, okay?

1114
01:10:20,205 --> 01:10:24,269
You have to stop until it changed, even if there's nobody near you,

1115
01:10:24,269 --> 01:10:25,550
we changed that law.

1116
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:31,181
And hallelujah was a very good thing to get rid of because it makes good sense.

1117
01:10:31,181 --> 01:10:34,010
And I personally have not seen very many if any

1118
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:36,771
accidents as a result of people doing that.

1119
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:42,989
I should note that shortly after the law came into effect, it's not just right

1120
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:46,973
turn on red by the way, you can turn left onto a one way street, right?

1121
01:10:46,973 --> 01:10:47,871
They're correct.

1122
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:56,470
I was on West Huron, and I'm trying to think what's this street.

1123
01:10:56,470 --> 01:11:01,462
I don't remember what the street name is, but there's a street that runs south

1124
01:11:01,462 --> 01:11:05,951
to north that's one way, pretty close to campus, not far from state.

1125
01:11:05,951 --> 01:11:08,850
It's just a little bit west of state troop doesn't matter.

1126
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:11,000
I was stopped, I was facing east.

1127
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,450
There's a red light.

1128
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:16,421
Nobody coming my way and the other one and I turned left and

1129
01:11:16,421 --> 01:11:21,247
started driving down the street and all of a sudden [SOUND] the lights.

1130
01:11:21,247 --> 01:11:24,252
I pulled over and there's a state trooper and

1131
01:11:24,252 --> 01:11:28,058
he said that was a mighty red light you just went through.

1132
01:11:28,058 --> 01:11:32,778
And I said, officer, I thought under the new law that I was

1133
01:11:32,778 --> 01:11:37,650
allowed to turn onto a one way road and he looked like this.

1134
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:42,537
I went back and forth, he scratched his head literally and he said,

1135
01:11:42,537 --> 01:11:46,071
I'll be, gosh, darn, I'm sorry about that.

1136
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:49,356
>> [LAUGH] >> Alright,

1137
01:11:49,356 --> 01:11:53,801
we have behaviour that indirectly affects other people in the interest of time.

1138
01:11:53,801 --> 01:11:58,730
I'm not gonna ask you for the examples that are here, motorcycle helmet use

1139
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:03,658
does affect all of us in the sense that when somebody is smashed up badly, and

1140
01:12:03,658 --> 01:12:07,894
are going to be in serious disability for the rest of their lives,

1141
01:12:07,894 --> 01:12:10,390
we're gonna have to be taken care of.

1142
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:13,505
That is imposing costs on everybody else,

1143
01:12:13,505 --> 01:12:18,850
financial costs through their insurance rates or what have you.

1144
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:23,980
Now, the compromise that allowed the Michigan law to go through was what?

1145
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:26,850
That removed the helmets, a lot of people to remove their helmets.

1146
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:29,350
What was the compromise sir?

1147
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:31,696
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> You have to pay for extra insurance,

1148
01:12:31,696 --> 01:12:35,642
I've been told the extra insurance doesn't come close to covering the cost, but

1149
01:12:35,642 --> 01:12:37,027
that's my understanding.

1150
01:12:37,027 --> 01:12:41,891
But that would be a reasonable approach to take to deal with that if you wanted

1151
01:12:41,891 --> 01:12:43,720
to bans on illicit drugs.

1152
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:48,560
This is a question of whether people are bothering others the same

1153
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,121
kind of thing with alcohol abuse.

1154
01:12:51,121 --> 01:12:53,255
Sodomy laws, abortion laws,

1155
01:12:53,255 --> 01:12:57,790
the university smoke free policy all have this characteristic.

1156
01:12:57,790 --> 01:13:00,771
They're indirectly affecting other people.

1157
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:06,850
We have the debate over individual responsibility blaming the victim.

1158
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:09,150
So, somebody's got a problem.

1159
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:11,310
I'll keep this abstract call it X.

1160
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:15,160
Are they at fault for it, and therefore individually responsible?

1161
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:18,812
Or are they victims who need and deserve some kind of public assistance?

1162
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:26,646
So, you see somebody like that and I don't know about you, but I would

1163
01:13:26,646 --> 01:13:31,537
guess that many of you feel a sense of disgust when you see that picture.

1164
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:35,371
I don't like the fact that I feel that, but I do feel it.

1165
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:41,871
So, the question is, is this woman completely responsible for her obesity?

1166
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:43,971
Or is she not?

1167
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:49,643
Well, I know one thing I've got better metabolism than she does because I eat

1168
01:13:49,643 --> 01:13:52,750
like a horse and somehow I don't get obese.

1169
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:54,931
So, she has a bad break in that respect.

1170
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:58,680
She probably has some kind of genetic predisposition to obesity.

1171
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:03,727
And she lives in an environment that is just filled with things to make

1172
01:14:03,727 --> 01:14:09,568
you eat and eat more and to live your life without being very physically active.

1173
01:14:09,568 --> 01:14:11,465
Is it her fault?

1174
01:14:11,465 --> 01:14:13,942
Should we be blaming her?

1175
01:14:13,942 --> 01:14:17,925
Or should we be blaming the society or feeling sympathy for her or

1176
01:14:17,925 --> 01:14:19,632
some combination of them?

1177
01:14:19,632 --> 01:14:23,507
All of the issues you see up here have that same set of

1178
01:14:23,507 --> 01:14:26,330
characteristics in common.

1179
01:14:26,330 --> 01:14:31,734
It is very easy for most people in your generation to look at smokers and

1180
01:14:31,734 --> 01:14:34,450
say it's all your fault.

1181
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:39,748
My guess is if you do that, you were never addicted to nicotine as a child,

1182
01:14:39,748 --> 01:14:42,661
which is how most people start smoking.

1183
01:14:42,661 --> 01:14:46,350
They get addicted when they're middle school or high school.

1184
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:49,459
And my guess is you don't understand what addiction is all about.

1185
01:14:49,459 --> 01:14:51,020
Do we blame them?

1186
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:55,444
Do we blame the pervasive advertising that was around the society for so long for

1187
01:14:55,444 --> 01:14:56,244
cigarettes?

1188
01:14:56,244 --> 01:14:58,127
Do we blame the cigarette companies for

1189
01:14:58,127 --> 01:15:02,005
lying to the public about what they knew about the dangers of smoking?

1190
01:15:02,005 --> 01:15:05,420
You can go down a long laundry list of issues.

1191
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:10,605
Economic interests, there are often powerful economic interests that

1192
01:15:10,605 --> 01:15:16,483
are hurt by public health regulations, and I said, what are some examples here?

1193
01:15:16,483 --> 01:15:20,727
Every one of these, the food industry, the food industry, as you'll see,

1194
01:15:20,727 --> 01:15:24,189
we're gonna have a reading about this later in the term has a lot

1195
01:15:24,189 --> 01:15:26,758
that makes it look like the tobacco industry.

1196
01:15:26,758 --> 01:15:32,037
Now, food and tobacco are very different, food you need, I don't recommend people

1197
01:15:32,037 --> 01:15:36,678
stop eating to avoid health problems you will have a worse health problem.

1198
01:15:36,678 --> 01:15:40,968
And many foods are good for you and it's a question of quantity and

1199
01:15:40,968 --> 01:15:44,099
the mix of nutrients and all that sort of thing.

1200
01:15:44,099 --> 01:15:49,952
But big food as it is now being called, is beginning to look like big tobacco and

1201
01:15:49,952 --> 01:15:53,425
its behaviour in trying to avoid regulations.

1202
01:15:53,425 --> 01:15:55,686
Do they cost them something?

1203
01:15:55,686 --> 01:16:00,147
Polluting firms that are told they have to stop polluting, health insurers,

1204
01:16:00,147 --> 01:16:04,220
hospitals and providers who are having requirements imposed on them.

1205
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:09,168
All of these have the common in common the notion that they're

1206
01:16:09,168 --> 01:16:14,224
afraid it's going to hurt business in one fashion or another.

1207
01:16:14,224 --> 01:16:19,301
And they become very powerful political interests and

1208
01:16:19,301 --> 01:16:24,266
economic interest that is aggregated in some fashion

1209
01:16:24,266 --> 01:16:27,261
is a powerful political lobby.

1210
01:16:27,261 --> 01:16:30,188
Keep in mind as well the cost burden for

1211
01:16:30,188 --> 01:16:35,402
undertaking many public policies to deal with these problems falls

1212
01:16:35,402 --> 01:16:40,255
on the people who are most wealthy and politically connected.

1213
01:16:40,255 --> 01:16:46,933
The benefit goes to people who are least affluent and not politically enfranchised.

1214
01:16:46,933 --> 01:16:48,900
They don't go out and lobby for themselves,

1215
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:51,762
they don't know how to do it they maybe don't think they should.

1216
01:16:51,762 --> 01:16:56,059
So there's an imbalance between who's getting the costs having to bear the cost

1217
01:16:56,059 --> 01:16:57,968
and who's deriving the benefits.

1218
01:16:57,968 --> 01:17:01,692
And the decision making powers are frequently on the side of

1219
01:17:01,692 --> 01:17:06,025
the people who are going to incur the cost, that's a problem for us.

1220
01:17:06,025 --> 01:17:09,186
And then also the politics of the current costs for

1221
01:17:09,186 --> 01:17:12,956
these future abstract benefits I've been talking about.

1222
01:17:12,956 --> 01:17:16,871
Have you ever heard a debate in the legislature which they're talking

1223
01:17:16,871 --> 01:17:19,072
about trying to balance their budget?

1224
01:17:19,072 --> 01:17:21,783
They're all trying to balance their budgets.

1225
01:17:21,783 --> 01:17:24,645
That means cutting virtually everything that you can cut.

1226
01:17:24,645 --> 01:17:26,818
One of the easiest things to cut or

1227
01:17:26,818 --> 01:17:31,939
not funded in the first place is something that is not going to have a benefit for

1228
01:17:31,939 --> 01:17:36,529
a long time in the future and especially if it's an abstract benefit.

1229
01:17:36,529 --> 01:17:40,589
So your constituents don't know they personally are going to benefit from it or

1230
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:42,721
their children or their grandchildren.

1231
01:17:42,721 --> 01:17:44,670
That's an easy thing to cut.

1232
01:17:44,670 --> 01:17:47,454
And then there's this notion of politicians discount rate,

1233
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:49,604
how many of you know the idea of a discount rate?

1234
01:17:49,604 --> 01:17:53,062
Is that something that's familiar to many of you?

1235
01:17:53,062 --> 01:17:57,492
Okay, we don't need to hear but if you get the economics or something you'll learn

1236
01:17:57,492 --> 01:18:01,372
about it, but it's basically the rate at which we discount the future.

1237
01:18:01,372 --> 01:18:04,263
So the simplest way to give you an example of it.

1238
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:08,885
If I had $1000 in my hand right now and I don't, if I had $1000 and I said,

1239
01:18:08,885 --> 01:18:13,638
sir would you like that $1000 right now or would you rather wait for 10 years and

1240
01:18:13,638 --> 01:18:17,293
I'll give you the purchase power of $1,000 in 10 years.

1241
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:18,588
Which would you choose?

1242
01:18:18,588 --> 01:18:19,521
>> Probably right now.

1243
01:18:19,521 --> 01:18:22,405
>> Right now, probably everybody takes it right now.

1244
01:18:22,405 --> 01:18:26,200
What that's telling us is that you don't value a dollar in the future as much as

1245
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,976
you do a dollar today and there are good reasons for that.

1246
01:18:28,976 --> 01:18:33,376
Politicians do not value benefits that occur beyond the term that

1247
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:37,623
they're gonna be in office because they gotta get reelected.

1248
01:18:37,623 --> 01:18:42,418
They don't wanna spend money now when they're not gonna be any benefits

1249
01:18:42,418 --> 01:18:47,539
until they've been out of office for 20 years, prevention is a hard sell.

1250
01:18:47,539 --> 01:18:51,987
The morality issues and I have to go quickly through this and the next one,

1251
01:18:51,987 --> 01:18:55,792
intensely felt physicians that derived from a sense of moral or

1252
01:18:55,792 --> 01:18:57,397
religious writer norms.

1253
01:18:57,397 --> 01:19:02,483
You know all these issues, they're highly contentious, they're always fought over.

1254
01:19:02,483 --> 01:19:06,034
Some of them are kind of getting better like the area of gay marriage.

1255
01:19:06,034 --> 01:19:09,462
Some of them have been going up and down and up and

1256
01:19:09,462 --> 01:19:13,425
down like abortion for as many years as I can remember.

1257
01:19:13,425 --> 01:19:18,134
But these are highly laden issues, you know about the county

1258
01:19:18,134 --> 01:19:23,222
clerk whose was not allowing marriage licences for gay couples.

1259
01:19:23,222 --> 01:19:24,503
Politics and science and

1260
01:19:24,503 --> 01:19:27,799
this I hate that I'm not gonna have more time to talk about this.

1261
01:19:27,799 --> 01:19:32,315
But take a look at these and realise that a lot of what goes on in

1262
01:19:32,315 --> 01:19:37,013
science is actually under the pressure of political forces and

1263
01:19:37,013 --> 01:19:40,134
sometimes that economic forces as well.

1264
01:19:40,134 --> 01:19:41,170
Given the time,

1265
01:19:41,170 --> 01:19:45,548
I'll let you just read that list and we will call a halt to it for today.

1266
01:19:45,548 --> 01:19:47,213
Here's what public health is.

1267
01:19:50,882 --> 01:19:57,730
And we will talk about the history of public health next time.
