2
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:09,300
So, now I wanna talk with you
about what causes obesity.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,904
Fundamentally, on an individual level,
obesity is about energy balance that

4
00:00:13,904 --> 00:00:16,584
individuals are taking
in too many calories,

5
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:19,141
and they're not burning enough calories.

6
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:22,040
And this causes weight gain over time.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,460
Energy intake occurs through eating and
I'll talk about that second.

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,470
What I want to talk about
first is energy expenditure.

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,040
How do we burn the calories
that we are eating from food?

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,640
Energy expenditure occurs in three ways.

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,560
The first is the amount of calories
your body burns just by breathing.

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,700
It's pretty simple.

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,910
We all have a baseline level of calories
that we burn just by existing every day.

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,980
Then comes a small amount of calories
burned through digesting food.

15
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,320
It's really not that many and
we don't have much control over it.

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,750
What we do have control over
are the amount of calories we burn

17
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,670
through our everyday activity.

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:03,530
So, this may be walking, standing,
doing your every day activities.

19
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,470
And it also can be purposeful exercise.

20
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,660
These are the two major ways that we are
able to have control over the amount of

21
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,900
calories we burn.

22
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,883
So, coming back to eating or
how we take energy in.

23
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:20,512
We know it's a lot easier to overeat and
eat too many calories, and

24
00:01:20,512 --> 00:01:24,492
it's pretty hard to burn off
all those excess calories.

25
00:01:24,492 --> 00:01:27,776
So, we think that the majority
of the obesity epidemic, or

26
00:01:27,776 --> 00:01:32,052
high obesity rates today are coming
from excess intake we're eating too many

27
00:01:32,052 --> 00:01:34,665
calories we're eating too much.

28
00:01:34,665 --> 00:01:39,443
A big problem and a big contributor
to this excess calorie intake.

29
00:01:39,443 --> 00:01:41,830
Is how often were eating out.

30
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:47,120
The portion sizes of the foods we eat, and
the energy density of the foods we eat.

31
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,300
Today we're eating a lot more
foods they're incredibly

32
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,900
energy dense they have a lot of calories.

33
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,550
And very little nutritional qualities
that help us be healthy individuals.

34
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,820
Foods like sugar sweetened beverages,
and desserts provide a lot of calories,

35
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,880
and we're eating them in very
large portion sizes today.

36
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,770
And this is what we believe is
contributing to the obesity epidemic.

37
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,660
So, a really interesting line of
research is what we're finding out today

38
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,470
about the energy expenditure
side of the equation

39
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,100
among individuals who have lost weight.

40
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,040
What we're finding out is that among
individuals who have lost a great deal of

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,060
weight, their metabolism actually changes.

42
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,790
They're not burning as many calories as
people who where never that higher weight.

43
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,378
So, you can take two individuals
who both weight 150 pounds.

44
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:39,125
One of them at rest, may be burning 1,500
calories, a person who's never dieted,

45
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,380
who's never been a higher weight.

46
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,111
But someone who has lost a great deal of
weight their metabolism has slowed down.

47
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:50,390
So, maybe they're only burning 1,000
calories through their daily intake.

48
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,990
What this means on
a practical level is that

49
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,280
it is incredibly hard to
keep off weight loss.

50
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,090
Your body is fighting against it,
you have a lower metabolism, so

51
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,610
you need much less food to be
able to maintain your weight.

52
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,820
What this means for Public Health is it
emphasizes the importance of prevention.

53
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,480
We wanna help children and

54
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,600
adults never become obese, and
never have to lose weight.

55
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,980
And then, they're not gonna be
fighting against their metabolism,

56
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:23,072
and experiences extreme difficulty
in keeping a lower weight.
