1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:06,100
I'm love for that. That's what I say.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,710
I see it with the sticks and everything.

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:18,690
Except for. Where's your fun theme?

4
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:27,500
I feel like I had to do anything with myself.

5
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:34,820
Yeah, I mean, I was fun.

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,740
You know, I guess you will get your ass.

7
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:45,370
Let's go. I mean, like, I can do great, but I'll get my ass.

8
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,060
So I'm on the property market. I'm so proud.

9
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,650
All right. Let's get started here with sensitivity analysis to make sure that this is.

10
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,080
Sensitivity analysis today. I've been talking about this long time. Hopefully this will be valuable if you watch the videos.

11
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,320
I want to do a quick recap and then walk us through some examples.

12
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,470
A lot of different types of sensitivity analysis and the big picture we want to

13
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:31,040
understand how do the results change if some of our assumptions are are different?

14
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:38,330
And, you know, really with cost items out, there are a lot of assumptions going into these these models.

15
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:43,220
And you want to understand as our assumptions change, how do the results change, if at all?

16
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,990
So there are different types here.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,770
One way to a tornado. Public statements, to be honest, is one way.

18
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:57,679
We're just varying a variable up and down and seeing how does the outcome we care about in this case,

19
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:07,850
the cost of construction go up and down the tornado analysis and this can be a little bit tricky, but we're very it's just kind of repeated one way.

20
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,920
Sensitivity analysis is the way I think about it.

21
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:16,580
So you're varying a variable through its input range and seeing what the output ranges so you can characterize and say,

22
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,680
okay, I think these are plausible upper or lower bounds for what that parameter might be an input parameter.

23
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,220
And then you see what is the output parameter range as the input range to high, how does the output change?

24
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,500
And then you do that again for different variables and again for different variables.

25
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:41,900
Another area, another variable. And really you take all these one way sensitivity analysis and you track what there is,

26
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,209
what is that output range for each variable and then you and in this case,

27
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:51,560
all those output ranges are shown vertically, but you flip it over or rotate it.

28
00:02:51,560 --> 00:03:00,830
So they're all showing horizontally. And then we list all the variables here and see, you know, how do those output ranges potentially?

29
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:06,840
Very, very. And so presumably they're all centered on the base case results.

30
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:14,610
But you get a sense of how the cost ratio varies as each one of these parameters individually is ranged between low and high values.

31
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,080
It gives you a sense of, yeah, well, actually ask you guys, So what is this?

32
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,280
Well, actually, maybe the next one here is in this example here.

33
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:31,050
This is an example of some drug for thrombosis in the legs.

34
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:40,560
First of all, as you look at this toe diagram, what you see is, is it's maybe a little bit blurry here that.

35
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:48,180
But what do you see is one of the key takeaways I guess you can see from.

36
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:58,430
Tornado. A diagram like this. Maybe first of all, in the base case, does this look like it's cost effective?

37
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:07,410
It's a little hard to see here. It says base case $495,804 per boy.

38
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,360
Is that is that a valuable intervention? Should Medicare spend money on it?

39
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,740
Should spend money on it? Should physicians recommend it?

40
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,100
Seems a little expensive. Seems a little expensive. Yeah.

41
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:35,750
So that's that's kind of expensive. And then they drew a couple of lines on here at 50,000 and $100,000 for probably what the researchers thought

42
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:42,560
maybe would more be more reasonable cost effectiveness thresholds for something that is a good value for money.

43
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:52,570
So now the base case as a result, you know, parameters would suggest this is about a half million dollars per party adjusted life years.

44
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,290
That sounds too expensive even here in the United States, where we like to spend money on lots of things related to health.

45
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,879
So would what would changing one or one of these parameters, would it change?

46
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:12,690
Our conclusion about this is maybe not a good value for money would it would would change one of these parameters change our opinion and tell us,

47
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,229
hey, this is a really good investment. Maybe we should invest in it.

48
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,520
Maybe it is a good value for money.

49
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:26,520
And if so, which parameters would be most important in changing your mind about whether this is a good value for money or not?

50
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:48,040
So let's look at this case fatality of p. So how deadly is a pulmonary embolism?

51
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,610
Pulmonary rose beetle clot in the lungs? That's not a good thing.

52
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:59,440
But they had a certain assumption about how deadly a pulmonary embolism is and they vary that up and down said,

53
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,310
well, maybe it's it's not quite as deadly. Maybe it's more deadly than we initially thought.

54
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:10,480
So they varied that as they varied that they saw what the cost effectiveness ratio would be for this this drug here.

55
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,870
And they said, well, maybe it could be easy to change our opinion about this instead of being half a million dollars

56
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:22,450
for probably maybe about $330,000 probably or maybe would make it be $800,000 for calling.

57
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,100
Does that change your opinion about whether this is a good value for money or not?

58
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:36,300
Would you like to spend $800,000 for a quality and you want to write both the checkbook writing a check for $8,000 to buy quality?

59
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,960
About $300,000 to buy five. I don't see anyone reaching for their checkbooks here.

60
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,790
Sound like a good value for money. So even if the case fatality for pulmonary embolism is a little bit different,

61
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,300
it doesn't change your opinion about this being a good value for money, right?

62
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:59,420
Which parameter, if any, does change your opinion about this and says, oh,

63
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:04,970
actually this actually might be a good value for money, might be a good high value intervention to invest in.

64
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:16,420
Incidents of beating incidents of each. The incidents of VTI after SBT without treatment.

65
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:23,020
That is the one that kind of gets close as to what these researchers thought were good value for money thresholds.

66
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:30,250
It potentially could lower the cost effectiveness threshold to a very sorry cross smokers ratio to 124000 hours per.

67
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:37,389
And and when this study was published a decade ago or so, they thought $100,000,

68
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:42,070
which is kind of the maximum you're willing to pay actually today, maybe we'd be willing to spend $150,000 per point.

69
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,760
And so potentially that actually might make it cost effective.

70
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:51,040
But this what this tornado diagram does is it tells us most of these parameter changes

71
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,240
are not going to change our opinion because it's still going to be way expensive.

72
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:07,720
Right. Potentially this parameter incidence of activity and incidence of the risk of getting a venous thromboembolism, you know, embolism in your leg,

73
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:18,040
your veins typically after this SBT without treatment if that incidents where I'm guessing probably high then maybe the cost ratio of this new

74
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:30,940
therapy might look at to 125000 hours probably maybe that one parameter might be important to to whether this on a pair new is cost effective or not.

75
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:38,229
So that's what the 20 trial AM tells us. It says, first of all, the base case says, we think this is not a good value for money.

76
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:44,980
It's too expensive. Most parameter changes aren't going to change that opinion except for maybe one.

77
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,940
Maybe one would make us change our opinion about whether this is cost effective or not.

78
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,720
And so that actually, as a as a researcher or policymaker, it helps you focus your attention later on so you can focus your attention and say,

79
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:02,620
well, if I really you can either say this is this is really suggesting there's no way this is going to be cost effective.

80
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:08,859
I'm done considering this. We're not going to consider at all. It's not it's not on the plate, not on the docket, not on our consideration.

81
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,790
We're not going to do it. Or maybe if you are still willing to consider it,

82
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:18,459
you'd want to focus your efforts to understand that the incidence of VTE after SVT without treatment.

83
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,750
And so you want to study that a little bit better to understand what is the incidence of VTE?

84
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,460
We're, we're uncertain about that a little bit and maybe that is the one thing that might change your opinion.

85
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:37,979
So that's. That's what the tornado program can help you do is help focus your attention on the most

86
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,260
important parameters that might change your change your opinion about about this drug.

87
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,800
So that's one way sensitivity analysis to a sensitivity analysis is.

88
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,270
Is burying two parameters. Same time. This.

89
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,670
This has varying a lot of parameters, but only one at a time.

90
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,450
We're only airing this one, and then we're resetting it to the base case.

91
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,890
When we're burying this one, presenting everything else to the base.

92
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,820
It's really varying this one in the resetting.

93
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,160
So we're only doing one thing at a time to a sensitive analysis, says, what if two things change at the same time?

94
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,240
What? I might circle on a couple of different things. There are a couple different ways of presenting this.

95
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,280
You can put variable one on an axis and variable to be different colored lines in this example.

96
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,430
Or you could put variable one on one axis, variable two on the other axis,

97
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:34,550
and then different regions of this graph might represent different regions of cost effectiveness.

98
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,050
So this region up here is really expensive. This region down here is a good value for money.

99
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,290
So variable one is low, variable two is low. This is a great investment if able to, one is high.

100
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:53,770
If you're able to as high as we're up here, it's not a good investment. At a high value investment.

101
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:02,010
We have a threshold analysis where we can get a sense of it.

102
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:07,520
At what point in a variable is this not cost effective or is cost effective?

103
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:13,490
This can often be helpful. For example, if you're looking at a new drug and you're not sure quite what the price will be,

104
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:20,750
this is a really great type of analysis to do and say, look, if the drug is priced below a certain amount, it is cost effective.

105
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:28,250
And if it's priced above a certain amount, it is. It's too expensive. Research into has how many you've heard of at home or at home can come out.

106
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,840
It's a new drug that was approved last year for Alzheimer's.

107
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:38,120
And you've heard of that. We'll talk about it later on this week.

108
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,970
Evidence for any effect at all. It's very expensive.

109
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:48,200
It's like $50,000. Yeah, but that's not per year, I think, anyway.

110
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:55,220
And researchers have said, well, actually, if you wanted it to be cost effective, it would have to be, you know, have a price cut of 90%.

111
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,390
So what's that threshold? You know, what should it's you know, it's price is way out here.

112
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,910
And they said, well, the price needs to drop substantially for it to actually be considered cost effective.

113
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,380
So that's a threshold analysis, trying to figure what is that threshold?

114
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,790
Yeah. Now, all of this is what I call a static analysis.

115
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:20,450
You know, you put numbers into the model, you say $22,500, let's say for film one ring keychain.

116
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,290
This is the rank and file price. This is the rank and file device. This is the film.

117
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,340
More relative risk of dying.

118
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:35,060
You plug those point estimate numbers into the model and you get a point estimate cost effective ratio at the other end of your your model.

119
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,100
Monte Carlo simulation, on the other hand, puts distributions on the inputs.

120
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:45,440
You're not putting a single point estimate into that into the into the machine here the model.

121
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,720
But what you do is you get a distribution of what that cost effective ratio might be.

122
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,940
So it's kind of nice giving you the idea here is to give you a sense of, you know,

123
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:04,530
not necessarily what's my point estimate of what the answer is in terms of cost effects, but what's a distribution?

124
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:12,190
What's my uncertainty around that outcome given my uncertainty and all the different parameters that are being plugged into this model?

125
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,629
So this is a this is a typical result.

126
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,170
There's something called a cost effectiveness acceptability curve.

127
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:28,670
I need to ask you guys how if you saw this cost acceptability curve here, how would you interpret this result if you wanted to?

128
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,510
So let's say this is, you know, that the cost effectiveness of some sort of new intervention.

129
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:42,580
And is it highly likely that this is a good value for money or maybe not so likely to be a good value for money,

130
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:49,270
or it's highly uncertain whether it's good or bad value for money. How would you interpret the results of this graph?

131
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,300
You will be asked in the next homework assignment to interpret a graph like this.

132
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:02,070
So it's important to be able to think about this. What's this graph telling us?

133
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,760
Yeah. Is it cost effective, like after like maybe the $15,000 threshold?

134
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,620
Because that's really like, the most. So, yeah.

135
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:22,190
So in this class we've been saying I've been saying that if something cost less than $50,000 per quality adjusted life year,

136
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,499
that's usually considered highly cost effective.

137
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,980
And in fact, in the U.S. oftentimes would be willing to spend much more than that 100,000, $150,000 for quality adjusted life.

138
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,640
So yeah, at at least 50,000, that's kind of the maximum in this graph.

139
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:42,860
What what are we at here? We're kind of, you know, 99, 90 something percent on that graph.

140
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,750
So what is what does that mean? Does that mean it's it's likely to be cost effective or not likely to be cost effective?

141
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,130
Um, to clarify, said 15, not 50. Sorry, 1550.

142
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:59,450
That was my thought process. Okay. So 15 you know, if, if you were in a low income country,

143
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:06,290
perhaps $15,000 per quality adjusted life years would be a good threshold to use because in that,

144
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,280
in that resource limited setting, you don't have unlimited funds to spend on health.

145
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,880
You have to spend money on education and roads and sanitation and things like that.

146
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:22,040
And so maybe you don't have the budget to spend a whole lot of money on health interventions.

147
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,840
And so you might have a lower willingness to pay to purchase quality adjusted life years, if you will.

148
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,150
So let's say even if you lived somewhere where maybe you were willing to spend $15,000 per quality adjusted life year.

149
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,330
How likely is it that this would be cost effective under that kind of threshold?

150
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:49,650
Very pretty likely. Pretty likely. So this this kind of access is labeled in kind of a funny way, fraction of situations by willingness to pay.

151
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,570
But basically, it's in this with this money card situation,

152
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:58,680
what happens is different numbers are drawn from the distributions and you get an output number and then you draw different numbers

153
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:05,190
from the distributions and you get a number and you kind of gradually kind of build up this with thousands of simulations.

154
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:12,210
So this is saying out of those thousands of simulations or what's the probability that this was likely to be cost effective?

155
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,459
In this case at 50,000, it's maybe 90% likely to be considered a good value for money.

156
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,840
That's the way I would interpret that.

157
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:27,360
And actually, if you're in America and you're willing to spend 50,000, 100,000, it's like 99% chance that it's going to be cost effective.

158
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,840
You know, if you're willing to spend $30,000 or $100,000 per party, just like now,

159
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:38,340
if you wanted to see how likely is it this is actually going to save money, be cost saving?

160
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:45,480
Well, there if you're only if you're not willing to pay anything for quality, it's maybe only 3% likely to save money.

161
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:58,850
That's kind of what this is, curve and intelligence. Okay.

162
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:07,590
So as we think about sensitivity analysis broadly, what we're really talking about here is uncertainty about parameters.

163
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:14,760
So we're uncertain about, you know, what's the relative risk of pulmonary embolism or what's the quality of life?

164
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:18,390
What's my utility or quality of life associated with being blind?

165
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,670
And we say, okay, utility with blindness is a point six.

166
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:29,790
Well, how certain are we that it's that that the quality of life is 0.6 on that someone

167
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,509
would say six years in perfect health is according to ten years of blindness,

168
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:40,470
or I'd take a 60% chance of having perfect health and 40% chance of dying instead of living with blindness.

169
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,680
So that that precise point six, how how certain are we that it precisely is point six?

170
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:51,540
Well, we're uncertain about that. And so we want to explore that uncertainty in what that parameter value might be.

171
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,650
And so that's what we're talking about, really, when we're talking about sensitivity analysis.

172
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,760
And with that said, there is additional uncertainty when you build a markov model or decision tree.

173
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:09,719
You know, did I include all the right arrows and circles or with my decision tree and did

174
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,380
I include all the relevant uncertainties and things that are important to me?

175
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:23,490
That's more difficult to quantify. The only way to analyze kind of structural uncertainty or the impact of that structural uncertainty,

176
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:28,080
or did I include all the right things, is to actually do the analysis with structure and structure.

177
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,899
And that's something people rarely do.

178
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:37,350
But keep in mind that even though, you know, this Monte Carlo simulation gives you gives you a sense of security,

179
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,730
that, oh, I'm 90% sure that this is less than 50000 hours,

180
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:46,620
probably if the model is not structured appropriately to incorporate all the important things,

181
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,390
there might be some additional uncertainty about how likely it is to be cost effective.

182
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,060
So all the all of these results for any of these sensitivity analysis are reliant upon,

183
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,790
you know, having the right structure, including the right components in in your analysis.

184
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,460
So just be aware. Any questions?

185
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,530
Okay. So let's walk through some examples of how this might look. So let's look at some horrible disease.

186
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:26,690
If you go to our. First Module's page.

187
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,670
We have that disease weight versus get rid of it. That's a horrible disease.

188
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:37,850
Also look at the film we can and an example regorafenib model example a lot of things under week five here.

189
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,750
Um, so let's actually, let's start off with the regression.

190
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,870
Let's start off with that one regression. That's kind of the one of the simplest examples here.

191
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:58,510
So here there's a file called No More and Shine Final.

192
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:07,010
And just to recap, Thelma, Rick and Shine is that example of a pediatric heart defect, correct, with, you know, the film one procedure.

193
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:16,100
The procedure. The way this Excel worksheet is structured, we have some inputs and results on this overall SI tab.

194
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,690
We have similar model, RE content model where we're actually doing the calculations to calculate costs.

195
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:25,220
With each intervention, there's a mortality tab which shows the mortality information,

196
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:31,370
and then there's this to a sensitivity analysis worksheet, which we're actually we don't need that.

197
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:39,830
We'll do that on the future. So we have the overall C overall cost effectiveness worksheet here.

198
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:44,030
And the nice thing about how this is structured doesn't have the inputs at the

199
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:47,419
top and the outputs are that the final things we care about at the bottom.

200
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,700
So we have, you know, stuff like our discount rate,

201
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:57,860
quality of life and risks with with so more procedure automation risk with the rank and shine procedure up here at the top and the bottom,

202
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:03,860
we have our total costs and qualities associated with someone reconciled.

203
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,720
We have our incremental cost,

204
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:16,430
incremental qualities and the incremental cost effectiveness ratio here in the nice little graph here showing us the cost effectiveness point.

205
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,980
And what I'd like to do is some sensitivity analysis.

206
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:28,610
So I'd like to see what if some of my assumptions are wrong. So let's down here at the bottom.

207
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,530
I have created a little table. And what I'd like to do is show as that.

208
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:42,230
Just to recap the Fillmore procedure here. It's the hypothetical situation here is that it's incomplete fix of the pediatric heart defect.

209
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:49,850
And so kids who grow up with this incomplete fix have slightly higher mortality than the general population.

210
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,290
They have a 25% higher mortality than the general population.

211
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:58,400
So that's the relative risk of dying. It's 25% higher than the general population.

212
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,770
But they were uncertain about that.

213
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:06,980
Maybe some doctors who do the procedure maybe are better or maybe it isn't really as deadly as we initially thought it was,

214
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:12,860
or maybe it's more deadly than we initially thought. So what we can do is we can say, well, what?

215
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:17,899
What does the result look like if our Fillmore relative risk of dying is 1.0?

216
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:24,379
So it's it's no deadlier than than than someone in the general population that they

217
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,050
have to face exactly the same mortality as someone in the general population.

218
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:35,480
Or if it's a 1.25 here, the base case or one if it's higher, what if they have a 50% higher risk of dying than the general population?

219
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:39,470
I want to also highlight too, there are a few other things that are different here.

220
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:47,300
So one we're also assuming has lower quality of life. The quality of life is 0.84 so more and the quality of life with ranking China's .85.

221
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:53,000
We're going to leave those other parameters about the Fillmore quality of life and reconstruct quality of life the same here.

222
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,490
We're also going to leave the costs more as $10,000 cheaper than rent, and we're going to leave those other things.

223
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,280
We're just going to vary that relative risk of dying.

224
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:09,680
And I want to see what is the incremental cost artist ratio as I change that relative risk of dying for people.

225
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:20,030
Any questions before we get into this? So the first thing I'll do is I'm going to bring that.

226
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,670
There's this is a big worksheet here. A lot of stuff going on here.

227
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:31,579
I'm just going to link up the incremental cost effectiveness ratio to be down here so I can so it's right here in this this table.

228
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,799
I'm going to create a table here. Straight out here.

229
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:42,280
And I want to fill in the cells here. In fact, I'll highlight them in in yellow here.

230
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,870
So I want to fill in these cells here. We know with 1.25, the cost of operation is $5,000 per year.

231
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,150
So I'm going to right click and paste those values in there.

232
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,470
Let me make these in currency.

233
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,400
Okay. So I know with our base case, it's $5,546 per poly.

234
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:09,760
But then what I can do here is I can say, okay, well, originally is 1.5, but what if it's one?

235
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:17,200
So I can change that relative number at the top. And if all my formulas are linked together, it immediately changes the cost effective ratio here.

236
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:24,170
To $6,575 per part. So I can copy this, I can paste it in here,

237
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:32,090
and now I've got $6,535 properly and it's automatically I've created a template for a

238
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:37,400
graph here is automatically starting to sit here and I'll fill in points here and,

239
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:43,190
and see what the, what the final results look like.

240
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,910
So who like to be my volunteer? I'm a highly paid professor.

241
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:51,560
I can't do this monkey business here. So who'd like to fill in some of the numbers for me?

242
00:24:53,630 --> 00:25:00,500
Come on up here. And so it's your chair.

243
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:05,670
So it's hard work to be the big rock star.

244
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:17,220
So. So why don't you go up there at the top of the screen and we'll change this relative risk here instead of being 1/10 of 1.05.

245
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:27,970
And then if you scroll down to the. The bottom of the screen here and a little further.

246
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:36,260
And then so now we'll copy that and then paste as values in in that cell this would yeah.

247
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,959
Actually. So we have a student who knows a lot of the key combinations. I love it. So actually, you're way too talented for this.

248
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,730
Is this is this really is beneath you.

249
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:56,250
So let's actually, you know, and we don't want you to turn to some, you know, keyboard clicking monkey has to go back and forth, back and forth.

250
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:01,550
So what you can do here is actually highlight the entire table here,

251
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:06,410
including that first row and including that cost focus ratio with kind of header in there.

252
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:17,900
And what we'll do is we'll have Excel, do the monkey work for us of basically plugging in a number, recording the output and plug it in to our table.

253
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:23,480
How many of you have you how many of you have used a microsoft Excel data table before?

254
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,910
So you can tell us how to do this, maybe. Any thoughts?

255
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:38,010
So Microsoft Excel data are great for having Excel, you know, plug in numbers and record numbers and a table for you.

256
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:44,519
What we're going to do is we're going to go to the data tab at the top and then go to

257
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:50,160
what if analysis on the far right and then choose data table as the third option down.

258
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,470
And it asked us for two things a row input cell and a column inputs out.

259
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:00,209
In this relatively simple search example, we only have a column of data,

260
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:05,490
we have a column of the inputs here in column eight, and then we want our outputs here at column being.

261
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,889
And so we want to tell it. So these so it automatically looks in when you say column input,

262
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:16,020
it's going to look in the leftmost column and it wants to know though, where do I plug these numbers in?

263
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,080
So it says these are important numbers, but where do I plug them in?

264
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,459
It doesn't say I wasn't smart enough to know that those are relative risk. So dovetailing with no more procedures.

265
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:29,370
So we have to tell it. So for column inputs now we need to pick that cell up at the top of the screen.

266
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:35,760
So go ahead and choose that. The little dropdown or the little three hour scroll up.

267
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:42,960
And so scroll up here and we want to choose C seven in this case, which is that relative risk of dying with the merged procedure.

268
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,950
So what Excel is going to do is take those numbers in that first left hand column

269
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,000
and plug them in to C seven and then record with the outputs are going to be.

270
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:58,680
So go ahead and hit. Okay. And then it's over.

271
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:09,150
Go ahead and just here it let's go back down and yeah, let's highlight that entire table again.

272
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:22,200
We'll do data what if analysis in table and then for the column input so that to be C seven and just hit okay scroll back down.

273
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:29,370
It should fill this in. And so it basically takes what is in the header of this right hand column and fills it in.

274
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:34,950
Now actually interestingly, if you want to, you could have you can have an even bigger table with more headers across the top.

275
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,979
Here you have the cost to fill one of the cost of Frankenstein.

276
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:45,390
The incremental costs are similar to the spring effect. But one of the things and it would fill in whatever's in this column header into that table.

277
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:53,550
So that can be really useful here. Now this in this example maybe would have been faster for you to change the numbers go back and forth.

278
00:28:53,820 --> 00:29:01,830
But instead, if this table had, you know, 50 or 100 data points, it's much easier to use the Microsoft data table to fill in those numbers for you.

279
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:10,260
So this is one way sensitivity analysis here. We've changed that film, more relative risk of dying.

280
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:16,919
And now we've got a graph here which shows us how the cost effectiveness ratio

281
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:21,270
changes as that relative risk of dying with some more procedure changes.

282
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,659
So what are your kind of policy interpretations of this is remember the the initial

283
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:32,520
base case cost of our ratio is about $5,000 per quality adjusted life year,

284
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:36,870
meaning the rink and shiny, more expensive procedure did give us more qualities.

285
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,860
And we're spending about $5,000 to buy a quality, if you will.

286
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:48,180
That's the that's the rate at which we're purchasing quality adjusted life years. First of all, is that a good value for money in the base case?

287
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:52,590
$5,000 to buy a year in perfect health? Yeah, that's a good value for money.

288
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,150
Does this as the relative risk of dying with the filler procedure changes,

289
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:02,040
do we come to a different conclusion about whether rink and time is valuable or not?

290
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:15,069
Because. Would you be willing to spend $4,858 to buy a point for that?

291
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:20,850
Too expensive? It's still a good value for money.

292
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:25,590
How about $6,575 for quality? Is that too expensive?

293
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:37,360
No. So either. Either way, no matter how. If even the former procedure is one or 1.5.

294
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,270
No matter what, it's still probably a good value for money.

295
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:44,590
Yes, the cost structure issue does change a little bit, but it's still a good value for money.

296
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:50,090
It's kind of like if I'm going to sell you a Ferrari for $10, you know, is that a good value for money?

297
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,420
Probably. Oh, what if it's $11? What if it's $9? Well, it's still a good value for money.

298
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:59,650
We're changing that now. If I said it's $1,000,000 and then I change your perception about whether it's a good value for money.

299
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:08,739
But we're seeing, you know, we're varying an assumption and seeing how it changes that the outcome we care about in this case, cost effectiveness.

300
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:14,650
And it's still cost effective no matter how we vary that relative risk of dying with the former procedure.

301
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:20,680
So we've learned something here, even though even a similar procedure and reconstructive procedure have equivalent mortality,

302
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:27,400
the rate and change procedure is still a good value for money. And partially, that's because it gives you better quality of life.

303
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:35,350
If we go to the top of the screen here, the quality of life with their words point eight and 4.4, 3.85.

304
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:41,350
So you're getting 0.05 quality additional utility each year of your life with Frankenstein.

305
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,940
And that adds up over the course of, you know, many decades of a child's life.

306
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:52,959
So that's still really valuable. So if you scroll back down to the bottom, we can do a different sensitivity analysis.

307
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,760
And if we scroll down a little bit further here, I've got another kind of template here,

308
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:01,720
which is the utility or the quality of life with Fillmore and Rincon.

309
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:09,460
And so in this, I'd like to see what if the utility for Rincon shines between 28 and 25?

310
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,020
And what is the utility of similar various 3.8.5, as we saw actually?

311
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:18,940
And in assessing quality of life, you know, a difference from point A to point five is relatively small.

312
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:23,260
I mean, it is it is meaningful, but there could be some variation around that.

313
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,420
That's you know, these numbers are not always super precise.

314
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:35,290
So what I'd like to do here is fill in this table with the cost of exploration, see how the cost of artificial changes if those utility values change.

315
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:41,530
Remember, our base case assumption was so mars utility is point eight rate change, utility is .85.

316
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:48,720
So the first thing we'll do is up in this upper left hand corner. We want to put the thing we care about in this case, the cost of equity ratio.

317
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:53,320
So in here, let's just link that up. So we'll say equals and then find the cost effectiveness ratio there.

318
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:57,339
Make sure that's there. And now we use another data table.

319
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:05,870
So instead of monkeying around and changing numbers, we use the Microsoft data table to fill in all these 25 cells in there.

320
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:12,690
So what you can do is highlight that entire table here and then go to data.

321
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:18,040
What if analysis data table. Now here we don't have just a column of inputs.

322
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:24,040
We have a row and a column of influence. In this case, the row of inputs is the utility with the right on procedure.

323
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:34,540
So the row will tell Excel. We want to plug in that .8.8, 1.2 into the utility with ranking change, which is up at the top of our screen.

324
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:39,670
That was up a little bit higher.

325
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:44,070
Health related quality of life change point in five, let's see, nine.

326
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:50,080
And then the column inputs will be that health rate quality of life associated with the Fillmore procedure and see for.

327
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:56,690
And so go ahead and hit. Okay. And now if we scroll to the bottom, it should have filled in our table.

328
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,150
Okay.

329
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:10,080
So here is our our table showing us how the cost effectiveness ratio changes as those utility value chains actually call it and go back up to the top.

330
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,170
And let's change the relative risk of dying with Filmore back to 1.25, which is our base case.

331
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:22,080
And then if we follow that bottom, we can see that.

332
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,600
With quality of life with similar point and quality of life with previous times.

333
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:34,270
25 we have our base case cost to our position of $5,500 for quality adjusted life year.

334
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:44,350
But here you can see that the cost penetration does vary or can vary significantly depending on how those utility values,

335
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:51,070
the combination of utility values changes. Notice actually if we just change one variable like the utility of ranking showing

336
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,610
the cost of our ratio changes from point $35,000 properly down to $5,000 per poly.

337
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:04,780
And if we just change the utility with no more, the cost ratio does change from $5000 to $35000 per poly.

338
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:14,800
But if we change both of them, there's a more dramatic change in the prospects ratio is $35,000 for quality.

339
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,000
Is that too expensive?

340
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:30,740
Should Medicare spend $35,000 to purchase a quality of life or should should Medicaid when it's thinking about paying for things for babies,

341
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,580
should they spend $35,000 to buy it here in perfect health?

342
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:38,580
I see a lot of head start up and down. Okay.

343
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,889
Yes. And typically, again, typically anything less than 50000 hours provided,

344
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:46,490
just like you're still considered a good value for money, highly cost effective.

345
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:55,040
So if we vary one of these parameters, the utility for just one of these things, it looks like it would still be highly cost effective.

346
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,940
But interestingly, one would be very both of them that their results might change.

347
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,360
Now, some of the time here, we're seeing some negative numbers.

348
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:10,060
What do you think those negative numbers mean? What do you think a negative cost effectiveness ratio means?

349
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:21,200
I have a note on the bottom of this. Many of you are less than light.

350
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:30,499
I don't know. Hmm. Money in your lost and life. So remember that the incremental cost effectiveness ratio is, you know, the cost of intervention.

351
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:38,450
A minus. The cost of intervention would be over the qualities with intervention, a qualitative intervention.

352
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:43,370
And again, we can think about this in the cost effectiveness plan.

353
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:57,110
We have cost we have intervention A actually versus here, if this is intervention B and we have a new intervention, a new intervention A is up here.

354
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:05,160
What's the incremental cost? Is it positive or negative? Cost.

355
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,630
Ease of access is the incremental cost.

356
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:15,090
Positive or negative? It is here and B is here. So this is positive.

357
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,870
This is the incremental quality or the positive or negative.

358
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:24,660
Positive. Okay. Positive divided by positive gives us a positive outcome.

359
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:31,170
Right. But what if instead A is here?

360
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:43,790
Is the incremental cost, positive or negative? Negative to have negative thoughts in front of all these negative negative driving never

361
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:47,960
actually gives us a positive cost effectiveness ratio down if you're down in this quarter,

362
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:51,350
although you're were rarely in this quadrant. So let's not worry about that too much.

363
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,780
But what if we're in this quadrant here? Well, is this the good quadrant or bad quadrant?

364
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,249
This is really good. We're saving money and we're making health better.

365
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:09,470
Right. But what's the incremental cost here if we're in this?

366
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:15,110
So here the incremental cost benefit ratio is positive.

367
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:22,790
Incremental cost ratio is positive. Here the incremental cost effectiveness ratio is what the incremental cost is.

368
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:30,500
What for down here? It's negative always is positive.

369
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:38,750
So we get a negative incremental cost to show this, I think more of our spending ratio is negative and this is really good.

370
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:42,950
Right? However, what if we're up here?

371
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,910
Our incremental cost is positive. Our income always is negative.

372
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:53,780
So incremental cost vectors ratio is negative.

373
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:01,900
So if you see a negative, incremental cost by Treasury, you could be here or here.

374
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:07,080
This one is really good, right? We love to be down here. We're saving money or making health better.

375
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:12,490
We love this. We really don't want to be here. We're adding cost and we're making health worse.

376
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:19,180
So be really careful. If you see a negative incremental cost issue, could be needs are things are really good or really bad.

377
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:26,710
Now, in this case here, let's think about this. We're thinking about how valuable is rank and trying to compare to government.

378
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:34,600
And if rink and China's quality of life is point eight for low and Fillmore is quality, that is really good.

379
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:40,120
What does that mean about the value of of rink in China compared to Fillmore.

380
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,580
In fact, once you scroll up to the top of this, let's change the numbers there.

381
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:54,860
Let's change health and quality of life with still more to the point in time and help lower quality of life with regard try to be point eight.

382
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:02,720
So yes, rank and shine gives you lower mortality, but it has lower quality of life and Fillmore, which has higher mortality.

383
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:09,050
Now it's now if you scroll up and actually let's just look at the main cost effective in just a little bit further.

384
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:14,090
The main costs affect this figure that's right up here. Okay.

385
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:20,230
So now let's look at Fillmore versus Frankenstein. So it's rank and shine.

386
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,630
Now. Actually, I caught it. Here. Here. I flipped the axes here.

387
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:32,320
They have effectiveness and cost on this one. Here is.

388
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:36,820
Is Rincon shine good or bad? Now.

389
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,340
Why is Gilmore better? Because of.

390
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,720
Low costs, am I right? Yeah.

391
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:57,800
So in this case, if quality of life with ringgit shine is bad and quality of life was good, then Fillmore gives us more quality.

392
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,370
This in this case,

393
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:08,380
I put effectiveness on this access and cost and this one and and actually Fillmore is lower cost and higher quality is in this example.

394
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:18,579
If actually you can maybe even scroll up and just look at the table here, we can see Fillmore has more qualities if it has better quality of life,

395
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:22,990
even though it has higher mortality and has better quality of life, then it has more qualities.

396
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:33,340
And so in this example, if you scroll back down to the two way sensitivity analysis table is actually even down a little bit further.

397
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:41,760
So in this case, if Joe Moore has really good quality of life. And rank and shine has low quality of life.

398
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:50,020
We have a negative cost effectiveness ratio, and that negative cost ratio means that that rank and shine is not good.

399
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:54,480
It's really bad, actually. It has worse quality of life and higher costs.

400
00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:01,290
So, yes, I say, you know, that one of the morals of the story here is, again, be really careful.

401
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:08,549
If you see a negative cost effect, it can be it can be really good things that you're saving money, make health better or can be really bad things.

402
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:16,340
You're making health worse and it's more expensive. So here we're burying two things at the same time.

403
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,320
And so you can see it really in the case of the morning.

404
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:24,040
And one of the key things is what's the difference between the utilities of between rank and shine?

405
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:32,170
What's the what's the difference? And in our base case, Frankenstein was 0.5 better, 0.05 excuse me, better than we can shine.

406
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:39,940
But as that as that differential and quantify decreases or shrinks, you know, the cost ratio is going to have to rise.

407
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:46,690
And you can see that if the if it shrinks this way or shrinks this way and if it if both of them changed,

408
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,890
you could flip that film was actually better than the future.

409
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:06,450
Any questions? So again, with the two way sensitivity analysis, we're very in two things at the same time, two parameters at the same time,

410
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:11,909
and seeing how the combination of the two affects things and that might be something you want to see.

411
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:17,510
Sometimes you might want to say, Well, yes, one thing I might answer about one thing, but I'm also sort of uncertain about something else.

412
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:23,850
I want to see how the combination of those two things might affect my conclusions about the value of my interventions.

413
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:31,879
Well, thank you very much for your help here. This is this is better than helpful.

414
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,570
And hopefully seeing these data tables is also helpful for you as well.

415
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:40,310
Actually, maybe I'll point out one other thing about data tables that will be helpful for your homework assignment.

416
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:49,050
Let's say I wanted to put this on a different worksheet, so I say on.

417
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:55,450
To a sensitivity analysis. I want to put it on on this other worksheet.

418
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:05,650
The first of all, I'd have to link up my. I want to have the structure of this table.

419
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,820
This actually changes back to point eight. It's about 2.5.

420
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:17,870
Okay. So I've got this this data table. When I copied it, it didn't copy the data table.

421
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:21,250
So I have to recreate it to consume that a little bit more here.

422
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:25,840
So let's say you want to create this two way sets,

423
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:32,950
two houses on a different worksheet or even a one way sensitivity analysis, but any kind of data table on a new worksheet.

424
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:38,110
Okay, so I go here. I'd say data. What if analysis?

425
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:42,210
Data. Table. Okay. Then you hit the row as utility chain.

426
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:48,840
So over here, utility controlling and.

427
00:44:52,310 --> 00:45:06,050
I did, but no more. It says selling point reference is not valid on Microsoft Excel.

428
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:13,400
When you're creating data tables, it wants those cell inputs that you reference to be on the exact same worksheet.

429
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:21,170
It doesn't like you for whatever reason, like you're going through a different worksheet to pick the cells that that these numbers kind of plug into.

430
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:33,980
So if you do want to to, I would recommend either doing it on the same worksheet as your inputs or kind of linking your inputs over here.

431
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:41,690
So I could have kind of make sure that my inputs are on this worksheet so I can say.

432
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:50,910
This was point eight. This was .85. And then here.

433
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:57,219
Make sure that these numbers are not inputs on this worksheet, but are actually linked up to the other worksheet.

434
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:03,490
So here I'll just say health where quite a little more is actually kind of controlled, if you will, by this number on this worksheet.

435
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:09,130
And at this number, .85 is controlled by this number on this worksheet.

436
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:22,160
So now. I can create a data table where the row input cell is here and it's actually in a change number on this worksheet.

437
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:27,740
Now that number, of course, will change numbers on other worksheets, which is fine for the table for a reason.

438
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:33,770
But the important thing that it's pointing to has to be on this worksheet.

439
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:48,620
So now it should give us the exact same. Any questions?

440
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,230
Plus a little details can be really helpful for sensitivity analysis.

441
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,280
Excel is a great tool for this kind of thing, but that's one little quirk that can be tricky sometimes.

442
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:08,430
Okay. So that is the Fillmore Rican Chinese Apple.

443
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:14,160
Let's look next at the.

444
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:24,380
Diseases can get rid of it or some horrible disease. Example Oh, by the way, one other just minor thing, but the details, the really crazy,

445
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:33,720
really powerful they can sometimes if you get carried away, they can really slow down here.

446
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:42,150
So if you have a dinner table with if you have like 17 data tables each that are 100 rows by 100 columns, sometimes that can slow things down.

447
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:47,669
If you get super carried away for this class, I don't think you'll be doing that.

448
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:51,570
But just for future events, they're really great, powerful tools, but they can.

449
00:47:54,870 --> 00:48:08,450
Okay. So the just to recall what the disease, you know and get rid of it some horrible disease example is here that is this example here.

450
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,370
But we have got inputs up at the top here and then the models bottom.

451
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:15,930
So we have three things with some horrible disease, you can choose not to get any therapy at all,

452
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:19,980
so you'd have no intervention and you're either alive or dead.

453
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:28,770
You can choose disease way. I would just take one pill a day at it costs a dollar a day and so it does lower mortality.

454
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:34,800
So over time here we can see the number of people alive are higher than if you didn't have any intervention.

455
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:42,420
And then finally there's get rid of it, which is a surgical procedure. Very deadly, though, 40% chance of dying during a surgical procedure.

456
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:46,200
So if you started with a thousand people, you only have 600 left after the surgical procedure.

457
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:52,620
But if you survived the surgery, you actually have pretty good survival and long term survival here as well.

458
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:55,710
So so get rid of it. Maybe maybe it looks pretty good, too.

459
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,239
But as we mentioned earlier, we might be uncertain about it.

460
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,870
Actually, if I still your bottom here, here's our cost effectiveness ratios.

461
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:12,060
And so we can also do sensitivity analysis on this and change some of our assumptions to see how the results.

462
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:20,850
What do you guys think would be interesting to look at and sensitivity analysis for the disease wave or just get rid of a some of disease example.

463
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:39,680
Quality and quality of life. So, by the way, in this in this example here, our base case results was the disease,

464
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,210
which is pretty cost effective only if you are less than 5000 hours properly, get rid of it.

465
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:49,000
Kind of expensive, maybe worth it, you know, but $830,000 per yourself.

466
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:56,600
But quality of life could be something we are interested in. So as HD with no treatment, we said the quality of life is 0.9.

467
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,790
So pretty good but not perfect.

468
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:03,820
We assume that if you're treated with disease way, you actually go back up to perfect health by taking those pills each day,

469
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:07,240
you still have quite a high mortality rate, but you still get a five life.

470
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:11,329
And then after having this get rid of a suitable procedure, maybe your spleen was moved in.

471
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:15,410
Your quality isn't so good, but maybe that's wrong.

472
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,910
Maybe. Maybe. Actually, your quality dies after they get rid of it. Surgical procedure is not so bad.

473
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,710
Maybe it's actually back up to perfect health, so we get very bad.

474
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:29,720
So then where do you want to look at one way sense to be honest to us. Sense funny analysis.

475
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:37,850
What do you think the. Or one way said something else.

476
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:45,470
So let's look at this. You know, after the surgical procedure, 0.95, we said it's quite nice, but say, hey, I know a great surgeon, surgeon.

477
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:48,620
He's going to do great job on a field perfect after the surgery.

478
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:55,970
So maybe if I feel perfect after the surgery, if people feel great after the surgery, maybe it won't be 128,000.

479
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:00,990
Maybe will look better if it will look better. So let's take a look at that.

480
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:06,920
So already life after surgery.

481
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:12,270
So our base case was 0.95.

482
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:18,000
Actually, someone says, well, I think insurgents are hacks. Maybe quality life will be worse on it's 8.94.

483
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:24,690
Maybe quality of life could be worse. Maybe part of life could be better.

484
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:35,720
And what we're interested in is the cost ratio of the surgical procedure compared to the medical procedure.

485
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:39,620
Or to take the pills. So we'll go here, Data.

486
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:45,900
What if analysis. Data table. And this is a column of inputs.

487
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:57,200
And so those column inputs, we want to plug those numbers into the quality of life after surgery here, which is most relevant.

488
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:02,400
So following surgery, if you survived the surgery, what's your quality of life?

489
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:09,149
So now here we can see a bunch of cost effects ratios.

490
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:15,420
Let me just. Here.

491
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:24,190
Let's. I typically think of scatterplot as a good graph to do with these kind of things.

492
00:52:54,870 --> 00:53:02,280
So here we have what is the cost effectiveness ratio with certain values of quality of life after surgery?

493
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:13,760
She? Okay.

494
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:19,070
So. How would you interpret this results here?

495
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:28,860
Very quality by following surgery at this point.

496
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:35,520
9.9 5 a.m. is perfect health 1.0 as that quality varies.

497
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:39,660
Our cost effectiveness ratio is also very. So what? How is that?

498
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:47,160
How would you interpret this for thinking about the value of doing this surgical procedure is a good value for money or not.

499
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,720
Or maybe. What questions do you have as you're looking? I'm seeing some faces.

500
00:53:57,020 --> 00:54:16,830
Looks like this. Looks like a confusing graph. I think it is.

501
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,550
You think it is? No, it is for me.

502
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:29,760
I said it's good value for money to get it sorted for us. So if we so remember our base case was .95.

503
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:35,700
So then in fact, let me maybe show.

504
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:47,010
Maybe show the to it and point out five who's 125000 hours, poor quality, just life here.

505
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:54,500
And maybe that sounds like good value for money. But what if what if quality of life is better for, you know, perfect health?

506
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:59,760
What if, you know, after the surgical procedure, if you don't die, you feel great and you feel like you're in perfect health.

507
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:05,370
So then it's good value for money, is that what you're saying? And I would I would agree with that.

508
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:09,330
Right. So if if you have perfect health on the surgery and you survive the surgery,

509
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:15,090
the quite the cost effectiveness ratio here is $60,000 per quality adjusted life year.

510
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:20,910
That's a pretty good value for money in the U.S. I don't think many people would argue that that's a good value for money.

511
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:25,110
And in fact, if you call it at this point, nine nine, 4.9, 8.97,

512
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:32,549
this is still good value for money, you know, 125000 hours, probably good value for money.

513
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:38,610
But some people might argue with you now, what if quality of life following the surgery isn't so good?

514
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:43,040
If the surgeon is doing our job, you end up with some infections and you lose.

515
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:46,050
You lost a limb or something like that and you're not feeling so good.

516
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:52,680
So what if your quality of life is 49 two, for example, then is this good value for money?

517
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:58,360
But. Seeing some heads shake back and forth left and right.

518
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,760
Maybe not so good in terms of value for money.

519
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:07,690
What if your quality of life is 0.9 following the surgery, which is in this case equivalent to some having some horrible disease to begin with?

520
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:13,820
Now, your your survival is better. Which quality life really isn't much better than in some form of disease.

521
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:17,530
And by the way, quality of life with the pills, again, was perfect health.

522
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:25,200
So what is this bank negative cost effective ratio mean -$1 million per point.

523
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:31,310
What do you think that means? Then been difficult to.

524
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:40,860
Yeah. You're spending more money, but your quality of life is worse. So, again, we're comparing this to to taking those pills every day.

525
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:53,690
And recall that, you know, in the base case with 5.95, you're not you're gaining about 0.2 quality adjusted life years.

526
00:56:54,200 --> 00:57:01,520
So let me go up in here and we can actually change the numbers here. So what if this is 0.9 29 after I get rid of it?

527
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:06,830
Now we can actually look at our table and we can see actually if that's the case,

528
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:12,170
then all of a sudden having the surgery gives us worse net quality adjusted life years.

529
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:16,070
It's actually slightly lower than disease away.

530
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:17,840
And so Dan was right.

531
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:26,020
If if the quality of life following surgery is low enough, then all of a sudden it becomes worse in terms of total net quality of life inequalities.

532
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:32,240
Then the alternative in this case, which is taking those pills of all of these way.

533
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:37,309
So not only are you spending $30,000 more more, but you're actually getting worse quite often.

534
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:41,960
So in this case, that negative cost effect is a bad a bad thing.

535
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:54,229
And one one other kind of way you can tell about this, too, is things were not looking good for the surgical procedure.

536
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:57,590
As quality of life got worse, the cost of penetration was going up and up and up, up.

537
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:04,790
And then all sun goes negative. And that suggests you're moving you're moving this direction.

538
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:12,410
And then also, you crossed over the the axis here. If you all you move into bad territory and then in turn, really negative.

539
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:16,580
If, on the other hand, we saw something getting better and better,

540
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:22,000
better lowering phosphate ratio and then it one negative that suggests we're probably moving in this direction.

541
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:26,810
Also moved into the great territory, if you will, where we're saving money and making health better.

542
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:46,290
Other questions or thoughts on this. Okay.

543
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:51,880
Let's walk through a third example, then the regorafenib example.

544
00:58:52,440 --> 00:59:02,750
I'm doing a place for this situation where it's better to use what seems to work because we are not looking at the combination of two.

545
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:07,099
Yeah. So so that's a good question here.

546
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:14,960
And really, this is where some of this is where a lot of the art comes into play in cost effectiveness, analyzes is in sensitivity analysis.

547
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:21,530
There's art in designing the analysis of how many bubbles and arrows I choose to to create

548
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:27,140
here art and deciding to to stimulate this in terms of alive or dead things like that,

549
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:35,180
but also art in terms of choosing the base case parameters as well as science analysis, but also art.

550
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:39,559
There's an art in choosing what is an appropriate range to use here.

551
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:44,720
I, I chose, I said, oh, the base case is .95, let's very between point nine and one.

552
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:53,120
But that's that's a, a, a choice, you know, my my choice.

553
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:58,640
You know, I was looking at some of the other quality life parameters here and said, that sounds like a reasonable range.

554
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:02,540
Someone else might have a different sense of what is a reasonable range.

555
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:06,590
So choosing the ranges for these parameters is a, an art.

556
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:12,510
You know, you want to base it on the context and maybe data and evidence.

557
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:18,319
So maybe there's a clinical trial gives you 95% confidence rule. That's a good maybe a good range to use for these things.

558
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:23,450
But often times you don't have that. And so you have to use your judgment about what is a good range to use.

559
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:28,880
And then the question is, well, what parameters should I do sensitivity analysis on?

560
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:34,460
I typically the recommendation is try to do one my sensitivity analysis on every parameter in the model.

561
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:39,229
That's the general recommendation. But then the next question is what are a two way sensitive analysis?

562
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:45,170
And let's say we have ten parameters.

563
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:50,090
How many one way sensitivity analysis would you do if you did it on all ten?

564
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:59,910
So if I did read ten parameters and I do one way sensitivity analysis on each one of those ten parameters, I would do how many?

565
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:06,170
Ten. I would do ten more sensitivity analysis. What if I wanted to do two way sensitivity analysis?

566
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:22,320
Well, there it gets more complicated because they have to do perimeter. So let's say that my parameters are a, b, c, d, e, f, g h I think.

567
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:32,380
J. I guess that's ten. So I do want racing shows and all those.

568
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:39,220
But if I do too, I sensitivity analysis. I have to compare A and B and.

569
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:44,810
B and C. And C. And D. And E. And F.

570
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:48,560
And F and g. G and h. I am j.

571
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:55,530
J and K. But also A and C and D and A and B.

572
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,790
So all of a sudden we get this combinatorial explosion.

573
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:05,300
And so no one was going to recommend you do two ways and stimuluses on every single combination or permutation of every single parameter.

574
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:14,210
So then there's some art to that. If you're going to do to a sensitivity analysis, which parameters should you do it on, if any?

575
01:02:14,810 --> 01:02:21,420
My recommendation would be. Is maybe first.

576
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:27,200
Look at that ass here. I'd like to.

577
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:38,410
Draw on these things and then it gets messy. My recommendation would be start with the parameters that you think are most important.

578
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:46,299
So when this let's say this this example here, I might just arbitrarily say, okay,

579
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:52,690
these these top six parameters are the ones that seem to have the biggest influence on the results.

580
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:59,130
And in fact, this incidence of VTE after SVT without treatment is the most important one.

581
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:05,010
And maybe I would look at combinations of of this one and this one.

582
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:14,100
What if both of those were at their, at their most favorable settings and, and maybe this one and this one.

583
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:17,100
What if they were at their both most favorable settings?

584
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:24,240
So, you know, you can use the tornado diagram to help you select which parameters you think might be interesting to look at in combination.

585
01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:31,709
So if you if you look at, you know, this one and this one way back down down here, maybe that other one isn't going to make a big impact.

586
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:36,570
It's really going to be the conclusions are probably not really going to be driven by this parameter.

587
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:41,490
But if there are several parameters that seem like they might have an important impact on the results, then those might be ones.

588
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:43,410
I would want to do two way sensitivity analysis.

589
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:50,310
And then also sometimes there are things that are kind of that kind of make a logical sense to look at at the same time.

590
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:55,229
So going back to one ring and trying, maybe I think I'm highly uncertain about quality of life.

591
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:59,280
I think maybe the studies that evaluated quality of life for someone recognized aren't very good studies.

592
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:05,760
Then maybe I want to look at both of those together because they're kind of similar, both looking at kind of quality of life together.

593
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:13,800
So I might want to do two sensibilities for both of us. And then so going back to the disease, you can get rid of it.

594
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:18,330
Maybe I'd want to do quality of life with disease way and quality of life with get rid of it together.

595
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:24,060
That might be an interesting kind of two way sensitivity analysis. What if taking these pills every day doesn't bring you back to perfect health?

596
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:30,570
You know, and what if the surgery does? And so I might be on sort of both this body vice and so I might want to vary those together.

597
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:41,840
We have a group looking at several medications for Crohn's disease, and you might be uncertain about how effective each one is.

598
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:48,349
And so you might do a two ways and three ounces of effectiveness of drug versus effectiveness of drug B and vary both of those

599
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:54,170
things simultaneously into a sensitivity analysis and see how the relative effectiveness of those two affects your conclusions.

600
01:04:56,290 --> 01:05:01,240
So part of it might there might be in some ways kind of what I'll call kind of science.

601
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:06,010
You know, looking at the Trinity and seeing which parameters seem like they have the biggest impact.

602
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:08,620
But part of it also is based on your your judgment.

603
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:17,080
If there's art to that, about which parameters do I think people are most concerned about and might potentially vary together or,

604
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:22,930
you know, together correlated or or in different ways that might affect our conclusions.

605
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:31,480
Or another way to think about it, too, is actually going back to disease versus get rid of it, especially with quality of life.

606
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:40,300
There might be different people with different feelings or beliefs who might we might be able to divide the population into different sub populations.

607
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:45,130
So you've got some people who say, you know, I really don't mind taking a pill every day.

608
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:52,540
That doesn't bother me at all. I think I find enough is great and the side effects listed on the box don't seem like they're really important to me.

609
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:57,550
Now, there might be some other people who say that's really important to me. I don't like taking a pill every day.

610
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:04,120
I don't like. I'd be really anxious knowing that my mortality is higher with the take these pills.

611
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:08,050
I'd rather I would feel less anxious if I knew I survived the surgery and had much lower mortality.

612
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:12,310
So different people might have different perceptions of these.

613
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:16,869
And so you might actually have different subset subsections of the population for

614
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:22,130
whom intervention is better and other subsections were in right should be made.

615
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:27,760
Maybe also you could look out for maybe not for this, but for some other drugs and interventions you age.

616
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:33,040
So maybe for for young people, you know, for like a 30 year old, you don't recommend breast cancer screening,

617
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:38,739
but for a 60 year old, you do because they have different risk profiles and life expectancy.

618
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:45,069
But then you might have another dimension about family history and that might be, you know, family history versus family history of breast cancer.

619
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:47,889
And maybe, maybe for them, the 30 year old with family history,

620
01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:53,350
maybe it is a good choice to get breast cancer screening and maybe for the six year old, no matter what it is.

621
01:06:53,620 --> 01:07:00,100
So you can very a couple of things together to decide how you might want to subsegment the population give different recommendations for people.

622
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,710
So it tends to be policies can be useful in that way as well.

623
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:15,220
Actually, with that said, maybe we'll skip the regorafenib example you guys have.

624
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:24,360
It's a few examples here. Skip over a second here.

625
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:33,980
But I want to highlight that, you know, these types of analysis can give you a sense of, you know,

626
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:39,060
under what conditions is something cost effective when under what conditions not cost effective.

627
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:44,219
They can give you a sense of are there even some populations for whom it might be?

628
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:50,130
You might want to split up the population and make a recommendation A for this population recommendation be for a different population,

629
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:53,460
depending on their preferences or risk profiles, things like that.

630
01:07:54,360 --> 01:08:00,239
It also can tell you if you have an error or help you identify errors in your model.

631
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:07,260
So typically one of the first things you do after creating your base case results is do some sensitivity analysis and see what the results look like.

632
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:18,000
And for example, with still more shrinkage like if I increase the mortality was with reconciled let's say and also had made wincanton look better.

633
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:20,850
That suggests there might be an error in my model.

634
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:28,450
So if I you know, if I if I say, oh, rank and shine, quality of life is terrible and mortality is high,

635
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:34,300
and all of a sudden it says, Oh, really, it's really great. Then maybe you want to look in your model, make sure you didn't subtract.

636
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:40,430
We should added or divided and sort of multiplied or made some sort of math error, if you will.

637
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:51,639
So that's something that can help. You know, one of the things you can do with these and I'm not expecting you to do this in your crossfire,

638
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:56,709
this would just be aware of is sometimes you can do a value of information analysis.

639
01:08:56,710 --> 01:09:01,510
So you can you know, when we typically think about making a decision, we have to make a decision.

640
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:07,330
And then after that, we observe what the effect is, what value of information.

641
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:19,070
Is kind of we have an uncertainty about a lot of different things. That information can tell us how valuable would it be to switch this around?

642
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:24,470
So what if you could know the effect before you made the decision?

643
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:30,470
So what if you could know the effectiveness of masks before you made your mask mandate decision?

644
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:33,530
What if you could and actually, we do this with drug with drugs.

645
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:40,610
You know, we make it we make people go through clinical trials to know the effect of the vaccine before we recommend people get a vaccine.

646
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:50,630
So that's the value of information. Here is how valuable would it be to have the information before you make the decision and that can help you.

647
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:57,530
So basically it's doing the analysis, but assuming you had the information beforehand.

648
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:01,310
And then how will your decision change afterwards?

649
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:08,440
And we can actually quantify that and we can get it get it put a dollar value on that information, and it can help us understand it.

650
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:17,690
Should we prioritize gathering information or not? Oh, and one other thing, too.

651
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:23,750
Just going back to the tornado diagram that I think is helpful is once you do this a stimulus,

652
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:30,050
it can help you decide, are we done or do we need to go back and gather more information?

653
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:41,570
So, for example, in this in this case of find a pair of new I mean, I guess I would argue once you've done this, you might almost say we're done.

654
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:49,850
This is not cost effective. Or if you do want to continue, you can say, okay, I really want to focus in and and, you know,

655
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:54,560
maybe try to gather a little more information on Vitis and understand that a

656
01:10:54,560 --> 01:11:02,660
little bit better before we make our final conclusion that this is not cost. So it can help you decide, you know, are we done here?

657
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:07,780
Are we can we or do we want to kind of continue to gather information before any considering.

658
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:20,840
And in the last few minutes here, I just want to quickly show you some of the value of this in a paper I wrote over a decade ago.

659
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:26,210
So why the chewing gum across the road?

660
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:33,600
It was stuck to the foot of the chain, Adejoke says.

661
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:39,180
So you might have heard of H5N1 avian influenza.

662
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:45,930
Maybe we've forgotten about that since we're worried about coronavirus. But the decade ago or so, people were very concerned about it.

663
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:53,640
The key thing here is that it's maybe you can see all the small numbers here, but the numbers of deaths relative to cases was quite high.

664
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:57,090
It's like 50% to 60% of people were dying. Got it.

665
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,470
But it was it was primarily, you know, from chickens to humans.

666
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:09,900
So we weren't concerned that I was going to cough on you or H1N1 at the time of this was really a concern ten or 15 years ago.

667
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:14,820
But then 2013. Since then, there haven't been any cases. It's kind of died out in terms of the concerns.

668
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:20,669
But people were concerned. Little over a decade ago about bird flu.

669
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:26,460
So we said, hey, you know, it's sort of The Onion says this is very important.

670
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:32,070
And, you know, things in the media like this movie Contagion, which maybe, maybe some of you have seen.

671
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:36,240
You know, people were concerned about should we plan for pandemic influenza?

672
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:40,740
And so we did a paper trying to look at the cost spectrum so that now, as you can imagine, though,

673
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:50,700
when we're planning for pandemic influenza in, you know, 2009, 2010, there was no pandemic H5N1 influenza.

674
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:57,929
So you were uncertain about a million different things. We use some simulation modeling to try to figure out what we thought the the

675
01:12:57,930 --> 01:13:02,580
impact of of having some pre-pandemic preparations of pre-pandemic vaccines,

676
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:13,190
stockpiling Tamiflu, which we've heard about that. And so it is the KFC supply chain send out Tamiflu to people.

677
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:20,220
And what you'll see here, though, is there are a lot of assumptions here in this analysis.

678
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:25,800
So we have, you know, how effective would Tamiflu or Relenza be?

679
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:34,140
And I would actually argue maybe we're too conservative with our ranges for sensitivity analysis as if we're dealing with a totally new virus.

680
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:38,220
We don't really know how effective it would be. We had some sense from seasonal flu, but they.

681
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:38,520
Sure.

682
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:49,120
And then there were some vaccines over a decade ago that were developed based on the then circulating H5N1 that was going from chickens to humans.

683
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:52,020
So people have developed vaccines based on that strain.

684
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:57,240
But if it did become a global pandemic, it would probably mutate to become easily transmissible between humans.

685
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:03,090
So it's unclear how good a vaccine developed based on the chicken strain would work for humans.

686
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:08,669
So we made some assumptions here about how effective different versions of that vaccine might be.

687
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:13,080
We were assuming maybe a B 20 to 50% effective. We varied it from 10 to 80%.

688
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:19,560
Probably should have had an even wider range for sensitivity. Also that some assumptions of a side effect to support.

689
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:28,050
But there's a lot of things we're uncertain about. Probably most of which is is this is there even going to be a pandemic of a bird flu pandemic?

690
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:37,920
Yeah. So we did a lot of we did one way sensitivity analysis. And in fact, most of the vaccines that we might be stockpiling was a huge, huge factor.

691
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:47,910
The if a bird flu pandemic became human to human transmissible, we weren't sure how deadly it would be, the pandemic or not.

692
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:55,980
The the the then existing cases of case fatality rate looked like it was 50, 60%.

693
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:02,670
But it's possible that if it mutated to become human to human transmission, it might become much,

694
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:08,430
much less deadly and therefore, you know, maybe have a case fatality proportion of 1% or less.

695
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:17,310
And that might make this the cost effects ratio of stockpiling millions of vaccines that maybe aren't very effective.

696
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:26,970
It might not be as cost effective. And so a key question is, is it worthwhile to invest in planning for something that might not happen and in fact,

697
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:30,720
has not happened in the last 15 years. We have not had a global bird flu pandemic.

698
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:36,180
Right. So if you spend millions of dollars preparing for that and you never use it, that's that's wasted money.

699
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:44,700
So the way I was thinking about it here is you can you can prepare or not prepare and the pandemic can occur enough.

700
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:48,990
And if you're prepared and there is a pandemic, you're the hero, right?

701
01:15:49,230 --> 01:15:52,530
Your foresight, you save the world because of that.

702
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:57,360
Of course, if you if you spend billions of dollars on vaccines pre-pandemic,

703
01:15:57,740 --> 01:16:01,560
you know, chicken vaccines and nothing happens, you a fool for Winston 2020.

704
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:06,830
And if you don't prepare and there is a pandemic, you're the villain, of course.

705
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:12,209
And if you didn't spend all these billions of dollars on a national pandemic as a wise steward, you were smart.

706
01:16:12,210 --> 01:16:18,750
You didn't spend money. And so what you want to do is you want to kind of think about maximizing your chances of being the hero,

707
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:24,929
but also being the wise steward and not being the for not being the villain, which is challenging.

708
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:29,220
Right. And a lot of this depends on what's the chance that there's a.

709
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:33,389
Endemic, which is something that's very, very difficult to estimate.

710
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:38,130
And actually different people have different beliefs about what that is. Anyway.

711
01:16:38,190 --> 01:16:41,560
So can we can think about this pandemic each year?

712
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:45,510
What's the likelihood that will actually be valuable or not?

713
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:53,350
And, you know, the outcomes of interest we're interested in are things like. You know, qualities that we can simulate with models.

714
01:16:57,260 --> 01:17:05,000
So, you know, one, I think one of the most interesting sensitivity analyzes we did was looking at things like vaccine effectiveness here

715
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:11,030
and initially thought maybe would be in the range of like 20 to 40% with this pre-pandemic not well-matched vaccine.

716
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:22,940
And if you think there's a 3% chance of a pandemic meeting of a bird flu pandemic, then maybe it might be cost effective to stockpile a vaccine.

717
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:27,620
If you think it's going to be reasonably effective, you know, 25000 hours probably isn't so bad.

718
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:34,550
But if you think there's a really high chance of a bird flu pandemic, 25% per year.

719
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:40,040
Then you would think it's highly cost effective to cycle these vaccines.

720
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:44,240
And if you thought there's a very low chance of having a bird flu pandemic,

721
01:17:44,570 --> 01:17:49,400
then stockpiling these pre-pandemic vaccines doesn't look so good, especially if the vaccine is not going to be very effective.

722
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,270
Now, all of a sudden, you're shooting off to know hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars.

723
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:58,460
Now, I'm not going to tell you what the right probability of a bird flu pandemic is.

724
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:05,450
Meaning, actually, in hindsight, we can say. It certainly wasn't 25% as in the last decade, we have not experienced a pandemic.

725
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:14,340
But, you know, who knows? It is difficult to know what the chance of a pandemic is actually of a very specific pandemic, like a bird flu pandemic.

726
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:19,040
So is it 1%? Maybe it's less than that. And the chance per year?

727
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:28,190
If so, you'd want to have a very effective vaccine to make that a worthwhile investment to invest,

728
01:18:28,190 --> 01:18:32,420
you know, millions, hundreds of millions of dollars in stockpiling this pre-pandemic vaccine.

729
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:38,889
Actually now with money technology, maybe you don't have to stockpile a pre-pandemic vaccine.

730
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:45,790
Maybe you can just ramp up production really quickly. At the time of this, we assumed that it would take you years to get a vaccine.

731
01:18:45,850 --> 01:18:50,379
That interestingly, with the current pandemic, we got vaccines within like six months or so,

732
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:54,430
which was quite 6 to 9 months or so, which is quite impressive.

733
01:18:54,430 --> 01:19:05,350
And maybe we can do better for a future. We also tried to do some multi way sensitivity analysis and we want to explain the strategy now.

734
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:09,820
I would argue trying to do more than two things at the same time is probably not a good idea.

735
01:19:10,030 --> 01:19:16,630
Here we are varying effectiveness of the vaccine for different reproductive rates and different case fatality proportions.

736
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:21,100
You know, 60% mortality have 4% mortality, kind of low transmissibility.

737
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:25,000
High transmissibility. But this is trying to show too much on one graph.

738
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:32,680
You probably want to do more of a two way sensitivity analysis first because susceptibility curves and so forth.

739
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:40,150
Yeah. So just to wrap up here, key things, two key reasons to do so, sensitivity analysis.

740
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:43,750
One is model validation. Make sure your model is operating as you expect.

741
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:49,910
Make sure it's not getting weird results like increasing my my drug makes it look better.

742
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:58,810
I say where to focus future research. Remember those tornado programs, the bars at the top that are big and wide and maybe maybe change your.
