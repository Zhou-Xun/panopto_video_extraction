1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,260
Beatrice is different.

2
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:17,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:35,120
No, no, no. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,440
All right. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome.

5
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,840
My name is Natasha History. I am the instructor for this course.

6
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,140
Adolescent substance use prevention. So if enrolled in the course, if you're interested in the course, you're in the right place.

7
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,700
Good to see you all. Looking forward to this semester.

8
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,610
It's always fun to teach some highlights of my life here at the U of M.

9
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:11,710
I know that there was a lot of you guys know, a lot of movies, several six or seven who wanted to enroll but are on the waiting list.

10
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:19,320
So what I need to do to see if we can get more people into the class is to have everybody sign this same action.

11
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,840
Okay. Put your name down. Tell me if you're enrolled or not just by saying yes or no.

12
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,379
And then tell me your degree program that you're in like some MPH program on the page,

13
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,690
the program or the bachelors program in public health or whatever field you're working in.

14
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,470
We are giving priority to folks in our HPC and Teach program for this course,

15
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:53,159
but there's a room available and everybody else who's interested can get in if

16
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,080
there is room available and try to keep the class relatively small around 24,

17
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:05,520
25 people, because it's nice to have that size for group discussions and engagement and so forth.

18
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:11,730
I feel like when I teach a large class, everybody's kind of anonymous and I don't like doing that.

19
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,910
So for a better experience for myself and for you, I prefer the smaller classes.

20
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:24,000
So I haven't seen this. So please fill this out. And I hope that all of you who want to get in can get in.

21
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:34,470
But there may be a couple of disabilities. Okay, so please follow self, pass it on and and then bring it.

22
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,310
If you're the last person, just bring it up here, put it down here.

23
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,270
And then as people walk in and remind them to fill it out.

24
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:50,400
Okay. And then by the end of probably this week, I should know if we have more space and how many seats we have.

25
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,810
Okay, great. So this just logistical stuff.

26
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,950
All right. So let's get into today. I'm just going to talk about what the class is about today.

27
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,200
You know, give you some general ideas about major fonts that will cover conceptual cover in class.

28
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:13,480
And then we'll go through and talk about what are the expectations in the course in terms of participation.

29
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,140
Reading assignments, the other assignments in the class.

30
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:24,830
Okay. And you will also today sign up for some readings that we will present to the class.

31
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,280
Right. So I'll share a document with you on Google Docs.

32
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:37,760
So if you guys have computers, I would probably be a good idea to turn them on and log on to your new Ms. account on Google Drive,

33
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,380
because we're going to fill out a couple of forms today or tables today as we go through the class.

34
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,990
I've also set up the canvas site.

35
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:54,950
Mostly I need to maybe update the assignments section a bit, but otherwise the canvas should be running and today slides are on there.

36
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,810
Okay, so if you need to look at the slides on your computer, please feel free to download them.

37
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:06,370
All right. So, Ritesh, we're going to get a little a little bit more about me when we do the ice breaker activities.

38
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,820
I'm not going to get into that right now. I want to get into the subject of this class right away.

39
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:15,800
Okay. Just the terms. You know, it's called adolescent substance use prevention.

40
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:20,240
And I guess you guys got attracted to this class because of this title.

41
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:27,020
But, you know, all of these little all of these words of four words kind of have nuances in them that I'd like to discuss

42
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:33,260
at the current moment to get an idea about what you were thinking about when you think about adolescent.

43
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,080
Substance use and prevention. Okay.

44
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,100
Those are pretty heavy words. They mean a lot.

45
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:48,130
On the face of it. They didn't seem like that. But I think there's a lot of complexity to these concepts.

46
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:56,170
So let's talk about these words. I want you to tell me from your point of view, what does the word adolescent mean to you?

47
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:05,730
You know, you can think about in terms of age ranges, social and emotional or physical developmental issues,

48
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:14,130
you know, mindset, psychology, whatever comes to mind when you think about the word adolescent.

49
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,510
Please share back with me and the class about what that word means to you.

50
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,490
I'm going to close the door so I don't interrupt others in the auditorium.

51
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,670
Yeah. And see your name when you speak so you can actually get to learn to know who you are.

52
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:40,550
Yeah. I'm Gina. And adolescent for me, I guess like another substitute where I was, like, kind of teen mom.

53
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,210
And then, yeah, it's like, kind of like middle school, high school range.

54
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:55,890
So like 12 to 18, I guess there's a lot of yeah, like developmentally like things are changing like, which is,

55
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:03,070
you know, very broad, but like, I mean puberty identity thing but also like racial identity or sexual done, right?

56
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,260
So some of those things might be more of like.

57
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,620
So, yeah, that's, that's great, great.

58
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:18,210
That's wonderful. So age range, you know, teenage years are usually the eight years people think about during adolescence.

59
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,250
But as you mentioned, you know, teens go to 19, right?

60
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:32,250
So it doesn't stop at 70 below the research you may read about in terms of adolescence, they'll focus on this 12 to 17 gauge range.

61
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:39,420
But those boundaries are kind of flexible in my mind because a lot of it has to do with not the age,

62
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,170
but the emotional, social and physical development of that individual.

63
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:48,900
So you can create a little buffer around both of those ends, maybe 2 to 3 years.

64
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,190
You know, you can even go up to 22 or so to think about adolescence.

65
00:06:54,330 --> 00:07:00,840
And you talked about identity. So identity development is a really important part of adolescence.

66
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,100
That's the journey you go through, one of the main journeys you go through.

67
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,899
That's part of the experience of adolescence. Try to figure out who you are in that journey.

68
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:18,510
Doesn't really end in my mind. You know, I still am trying to figure out who I am, but it's really a big question for kids.

69
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:24,190
And they're trying to figure out and test and try out different identities, right.

70
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:29,970
Until they find something that feels comfortable to that identity.

71
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:37,440
Development is a really big issue. We talked about hormonal or pubertal kinds of things, so that's part of it.

72
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:46,020
And that affects your psychology, your reactions to stimuli, your desires to take risks.

73
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:52,560
Those things come into play, right? So you touched on a lot of important kind of ideas around adolescence.

74
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:58,300
Who wants to add to that concept or those words or ideas about adolescence, please?

75
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:07,380
Yeah. Was nice, but I remember last winter for about 30 seconds or so,

76
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:15,750
I decided to find adolescent boys who learned that adolescent tend to be mean like 10 to 19 years old.

77
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:24,450
So just like for research purposes, it was just something that's great.

78
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,410
Okay, so young adults 18 to 24 is sometimes aging.

79
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:33,630
But, you know, I trying to do a study right now on young adults knowing my age and just the 34.

80
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,260
So part of, uh, part of part of all this stuff is actually driven by our,

81
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:46,140
our contemporary history relative to what might be going on 50 or 100 years ago,

82
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:57,809
a person who was 23, 24 in the fifties, 1950s is a very different kind of role set responsibilities and so forth than somebody might be.

83
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:03,330
2324 now. Um, so yeah, so the age range is flexible.

84
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:11,909
And so what, what types of things do you expect adolescents to accomplish by the time they move into young adults?

85
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,180
Or maybe that's one way to think about adolescence. What do you want?

86
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,990
What journey should they have been? Should they have gone through already?

87
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:28,950
We should have learned about themselves. What place should they have in society when they move through that period?

88
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:36,060
So those are some questions to think about. One important think about is in the think about is that adolescence is a period when

89
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,540
you really are focused on moving away from your family and towards your peers.

90
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,940
Right. We are all about that.

91
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:49,950
But by the time you leave adolescence, you should be moving toward independence from your family and exploring other peer groups,

92
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,310
but just the peer group from your high school and their schools.

93
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:00,480
So that's, you know, so there's a lot of stuff about adolescence and there's actually a course that our chair teaches on adolescence.

94
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,620
So if you're interested in that time period of life life stage,

95
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:12,540
I recommend you take that class because it's really a great class and it's a really important age group to think about.

96
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:21,420
When you think about public health and public health problems, and especially things like chronic diseases and sexuality and those types of things.

97
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:27,450
All right. Let's go on to the word substance. We can talk about adolescence all semester and this move to substance.

98
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,920
So what do what do we mean? What do you mean? What do you think about it?

99
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:38,120
Think about the word substance in this context. Yeah.

100
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:43,730
The first thing I think of is drugs like alcohol and that, especially adolescence, is great.

101
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:50,209
What's your name again? My name's Judy. Judy, nice to meet you and thank you for responding to the question.

102
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,570
Yeah. Drugs, right? The word drugs.

103
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,530
If you think about it from a medical or pharmacological perspective,

104
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:08,420
it's usually like a singular molecule, like ibuprofen or nicotine or, uh, you know, methamphetamine.

105
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,400
But when you think about substance, it's a little bit more nuanced.

106
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:19,220
Instead, that read, right, we has an active agent, THC and maybe CBD and stuff like that,

107
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:24,620
but there are all kinds of other chemicals in there that create an effect on the body.

108
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:31,520
So the words drugs and substance have a slightly different meaning, substance being a little broader.

109
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:39,730
Thinking about, you know, shrooms, weed or, you know, even alcohol.

110
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:48,230
So there's a constant, complex set of chemicals within the substance that can create your own different health effects and psychological effects.

111
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:55,130
And drugs generally can have medical or therapeutic value, but they can be abused.

112
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:02,600
And they're usually pointing to a singular molecule or a small molecule complex.

113
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:09,020
So we will use the word substance and substance and drugs kind of interchangeably in class.

114
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:17,030
And we'll try to focus a lot on the major substances of use and abuse in this country like alcohol,

115
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:21,880
tobacco, marijuana, but some other ones as well, whatever.

116
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:25,430
Just you. All right. So let's talk about the words to use.

117
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:32,990
So what do we mean by use here? What do you think this means in this context?

118
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:34,400
Yeah.

119
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:46,840
And again, Sara, this is a kind of like consumption because that, you know, it's not just like drinking in some weed or surrounds like lots of drugs.

120
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,170
They're like injecting, taking it into your body.

121
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,310
Yeah. Okay. Any other ideas about use?

122
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:04,360
Yeah. Hi. My name's Ryan. And I also think of, like, addiction and abuse that only comes out overconsuming for it.

123
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:12,070
So there is something about the intensity of the pattern of the x ray, not just taking it in, but how much are you taking?

124
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,540
And you talked about addiction and abuse.

125
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:27,280
So what consequences that the use have on you and your family or peer group or your environment that also comes into play?

126
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:36,639
Uh, so there are terms in this literature in science that people use a lot and those terms are changing over time.

127
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:45,060
And you know, there was a period of time where we said user of user habit, right?

128
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:54,850
Um, and so those kinds of words are less appropriate these days because you're one of these person first kinds of language.

129
00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:03,189
So we, we say use instead of user abuses that user try to use that and not make that mistake.

130
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,999
And it's still shorthand to say user abuser.

131
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,450
So but there is a there's also this degree concept, right?

132
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:15,700
So users just taking it and you can take it for fun and enjoyment and whatever purpose you want.

133
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:23,830
And it's not going to have a negative impact on it's just a temporary thing you're doing for extended period maybe a few times over.

134
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:32,860
And you know what length of time. But there's this concept of misuse which you will find a definition about in the literature.

135
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:39,130
Is it using and then having a negative consequence news drunk the night before.

136
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,950
Super huge hangover lethargic can get up and get to work or go to class.

137
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:55,270
So that's Mrs. Jolie looks at Mrs. Cooper and then there's abuse so abuse as you keep doing it, you can still you have negative consequences.

138
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:01,720
And also if there's something that's illegal and then use it let's that's defined it's abuse.

139
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,580
So abuse prescription drugs even if you take it a few times and you're not and

140
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,280
negative consequence if you really engage in quote unquote illegal activity.

141
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,970
So we define that as abuse in the literature is fear.

142
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:25,479
And then abuse can lead to addiction or dependance, which is you a compulsive pattern pattern you use.

143
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,950
Even if you want to stop, you just can't do it. That's so we talk about use.

144
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:36,490
We're talking about all of those types of hundreds of use in for kids, adolescents, young people.

145
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:43,850
We focus on youth because early use. Even if you use it.

146
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:54,570
If you didn't have any negative consequences of land use and experience, it could lead to abuse later on at a higher rate than those who don't use it.

147
00:15:55,710 --> 00:16:00,120
So the idea for for this type of prevention work is to try to.

148
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:10,939
Increase the age of initiation to be Asian initiation moves up and moving towards late adolescence.

149
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,230
There is less risk of developing dependency as you get older.

150
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:23,720
So a lot of prevention programs are trying to focus on increasing the age of Asian or try substances.

151
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:31,410
Okay. Now, prevention. So what do we what is prevention mean to you all?

152
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,010
When we think about. The stuff in this context.

153
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:49,720
Use prevention. We're all in public health, so we should probably all know about primary prevention and secondary prevention,

154
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,290
tertiary prevention, primordial prevention.

155
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,870
So for this cause, I would say the focus is largely on primary prevention.

156
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:07,720
You can think about primordial prevention and then if anybody heard of that word, primordial prevention.

157
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:17,689
Okay. I guess, though, that kind of refers to the concept that, uh, you don't really focus on the behavior or the health.

158
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:22,399
Also, you're really focusing on the risk retention and promoting factors.

159
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:31,980
And so some primary prevention factors might be like, I'm hungry.

160
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:45,979
Experiences of racism and discrimination, unfairness, um, you know, social cohesion, uh, that type of thing that are just so primal, so primordial.

161
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,879
Through our life experience, they can impact many different health outcomes.

162
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,930
Indicators are you can work on that stuff in this class too, because, you know,

163
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:59,690
unemployment and poverty can be associated with higher risk of substance use.

164
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:08,780
Getting people into meaningful jobs and stuff like that are important, I believe, substance use and abuse prevention strategies.

165
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:17,300
So you can think about it in that lens. Primary prevention, you want to delay the onset of use as much as possible.

166
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,240
Yeah. Misuse as well?

167
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:29,470
No. Abuse and addiction are hard. So going from abuse to addiction.

168
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,480
We're not going to deal with things like secondary prevention much in this class.

169
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,550
You may get to know and learn a little bit about it. Meaning once you become an addict or become dependent.

170
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:51,930
How do we get you to become you know, if you miss from that experience, that's a whole other field.

171
00:18:52,200 --> 00:19:01,650
Well, treatment is clinical and clinical and interventions that you can do to do secondary prevention.

172
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,940
So we're not going to do too much secondary prevention. Primary and primordial is something to talk about.

173
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,639
Okay. And when you do your class project,

174
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:18,480
I would love you to focus on those pieces and not necessarily getting people into treatment programs and seeing what type of,

175
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:28,260
you know, pharmacological interventions might be relevant or social behavioral interventions might be relevant to address addiction and dependance.

176
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,570
It's not a business class. Okay.

177
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:38,790
Well, there should be a class on that, but not yet the amount that we have within the scope of the problem, fortunately.

178
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,230
Problem is there's not good science in that area, to be honest.

179
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:49,470
So that's that give you a good idea what we're going to try to cover just by going through these works.

180
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:55,799
Okay. So that's kind of the focus of this class. This is what I mean when I titled this class.

181
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,990
And I think it's probably what attracted you to come to this class and enroll.

182
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:09,420
So now that we kind of know what you know, basic topic, this class is from the title.

183
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:13,860
Let's talk a little bit about ourselves. All right. I want to learn a little bit about all of you.

184
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,599
You all might know each other, right? I noticed some of you are undergrads.

185
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,480
Some of you are grad students. Maybe you're in different programs so maybe you don't know each other about well.

186
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:30,900
So let's take a few moments in class. It may take a little time because we have probably about 20 or so people in

187
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:37,350
there to jot down answers to these questions and then share them one by one.

188
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,490
And I'm going to do the same thing. Right. So what is your name?

189
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,520
What department are you in? What's your degree program?

190
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,730
I know you wrote it down, but it's shared with everybody else.

191
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:55,050
What area of interest do you have in public health and how do those interest theories intersect with what we're going to do in this class?

192
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,410
And what are your expectations from this course?

193
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:03,210
What do you want to learn? What do you want to get out of this class after you leave this class?

194
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:09,750
What do you what do you want? What knowledge do you feel like you should have gained since the time we spent together?

195
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,650
And then these, you know, kind of fun icebreaker questions.

196
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:21,090
The first was not that much fun, I guess work, academic or other experiences related to this course.

197
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:30,160
And, you know, we have we have also personal experiences which are very relevant to people's desire to work in this area and learn about this area.

198
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,450
And then think about when you were teenager. When you were young.

199
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:41,340
Maybe not just a teenager, but adolescent. Maybe some of you guys still feel like adolescence.

200
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:44,640
I sometimes do have to think about that time.

201
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,100
Your your memories,

202
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:58,079
more recent than mine would've been kind of like your one of your favorite bands that made you happy to listen to them or you felt connected to that.

203
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:05,280
That's what movie. And did you really, really like it resonated with you and what?

204
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,490
So take a few moments, answer those questions, and then we'll go one by one.

205
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:20,080
And tell us each other about this and I'll start off.

206
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:24,290
Okay, so I'll break this. Yes, it's a two minute strategy.

207
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:36,060
They're just responding to these questions and we're going to share the responses to everybody.

208
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,500
There's a Spanish sheet going around and I'll just put your name on it and so forth.

209
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:49,920
But then. Well, let me start off by getting more time.

210
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,140
I don't think so. Okay. All right. So, you know, I'm British.

211
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,580
You can call me British after mistress, respond to a professor.

212
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,240
But I just believe that it's actually British.

213
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,019
That I've lived here so long. I call it by myself.

214
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:14,790
Old American School. Department of Education and associate professor in this department.

215
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:21,510
My degree program. I'll tell you what degrees I have have a B.S. in evolutionary biology.

216
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:25,440
I have a master's in public health and a Ph.D. in public health.

217
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:32,280
Public health. I study basically things we study in beauty, social behavioral sciences,

218
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:38,460
areas of interest in public health, and how those interests intersections course.

219
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,430
Well, I have a very broad interest over my career in public health.

220
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:52,589
I started off wanting to study and learn and work in the area of maternal and child health in developing countries,

221
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:59,520
quote unquote, factories from developing countries. So I started off, you know,

222
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:08,520
one of the first projects I did with study to try to understand and finding practices of males in India and the Himalayan region.

223
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,010
And it's one of my early studies.

224
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:25,920
I did a study in for my dissertation on pregnancy care in rural India and access and utilization and gender and power dynamics in pregnancy.

225
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:33,610
So I was interested in reproduction things like children and mothers, right?

226
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:42,280
Believing that, you know, the children are our future and we need to have healthy and happy children that have a healthy, happy societies.

227
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:50,290
And so that's kind of where I got into public health. But over the years, I, you know, work with so many different people over time.

228
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:54,450
I used to work at the V.A. working with veterans.

229
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,340
And these are elderly individuals.

230
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:09,300
I was working on a program that provided care coordination, health care coordination to elderly veterans who were hospitalized.

231
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:15,390
So I became interested in things like mental health at that time.

232
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:19,200
And that experience is is not of substance use.

233
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:24,570
Veterans have a lot of mental health and substance use problems and dealing with those problems in that work.

234
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:37,260
And at the same time, I also worked with parents and young children trying to understand their experience in health care and pediatric care,

235
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:42,440
some of that stuff just to earn money because I was a grad student and needed to work.

236
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:48,930
And these are the things that came to me as opportunities and I sought out because I was interested in that.

237
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,140
But over time I started working in cancer prevention and control and started learning about tobacco control,

238
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,510
tobacco control, specifically kids in youth populations.

239
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,620
And I did some studies in the U.S. and California.

240
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:13,440
Then I went to India for a year and did a whole project on adolescent tobacco use policies that impact their uptake of tobacco.

241
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:20,940
And that sort of brought me into the field of substance use. Tobacco is a substance that has addictive potential.

242
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:29,640
And so I came to this university. They were looking for people interested in adolescents, working in areas of substance use,

243
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:36,870
interactions with the major substances that create excess mortality and morbidity in the world.

244
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:52,560
So they hired me and as I move along, I study alcohol consumption, marijuana use, etc. So my mind, they think I don't have a very straight line.

245
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:59,340
Career path, but I'm here now and enjoying what I'm doing, so it's all good.

246
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,050
So I guess maybe that's an example too, that you don't have to stick with one thing to know.

247
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,270
You can start something completely different and moving to an area,

248
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:13,980
but you can apply same kind of analytic concepts and theories and so forth to many different health problems.

249
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:23,790
What's my expectation from this course? I guess I want to come out of this course learning about how I can teach this course better the next time.

250
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:29,160
Some of the value in your feedback throughout the semester and at the end.

251
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:35,070
So I can teach this course better and become a better teacher.

252
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:41,280
That's all I want to gain from this course, and I want to get to know you guys and see what makes you tick.

253
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,830
I speak your questions, work, academics and experiences.

254
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:53,240
I have already told you about that, so I guess I could say a little bit about you.

255
00:29:53,430 --> 00:30:01,500
I have had personal experiences with substance use and abuse in the States using substances in the past.

256
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,430
Who? The problems of addiction in my family.

257
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:09,510
I have a brother who's an adult, who's an addict.

258
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:17,390
I can't say the word addict because I just see him though and he says he's suffering and using a full blown dope.

259
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:26,700
So there's some, you know, emotional, personal stuff in my life that makes me feel connected to this person's material.

260
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:33,510
And I wish that my brother had a different adolescent experience so he wouldn't be in this place that he has now.

261
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:44,140
Still. All right. So some of you know, many students over the years have similar experiences they share in class.

262
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:49,540
And we find value in sharing that stuff. And it helps them, I guess, establishing material.

263
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,420
And of course, assignments, you know.

264
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:59,830
Yeah. When I was a teenager, what was my favorite band?

265
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:05,200
I guess one of my favorite bands was Oingo Boingo. You guys know Oingo Boingo.

266
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,679
Let's check it out. Danny Elfman.

267
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:22,959
You might know Daniel, because he's a he's he writes music scores for film and a lot of the Wednesday the new TV show on Netflix.

268
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,260
He directs that. Yes, I do.

269
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:36,850
It's a Tim Burton music composer. So at all, my my first experience in a live concert was even going to you know, they had a mosh pit.

270
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:42,159
So it was so much fun. I was 15 or 16 years old and it was the best time I've had.

271
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:51,360
I've never had it so much fun. Classroom. Yeah, but you know, for those of us, I still love Oingo Boingo movies.

272
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,840
I'm trying to get my daughter to watch Princess Bride,

273
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:04,030
and she's still I think that the trailers these days are just of older movies are just not very exciting.

274
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:11,470
So, you know, I don't want to do. The Princess Bride was is in was one of my favorite movies when I was younger.

275
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:18,430
In the book, see, I like Dune and the Dune series.

276
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:23,379
So I actually haven't watched the new Dune brand new anymore.

277
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:29,560
But the recent incarnation of the Dune films or film, I need to do that.

278
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:35,290
But that was my most favorite series when I was a kid, so that's me.

279
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:42,340
So we got to know a little bit about me now that you guys I mean, we start from the front.

280
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:46,330
We'll start with you. Hello. My name is Jim.

281
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:53,410
I'm an information student and I'm interested in racial disparities in preventive medicine.

282
00:32:53,770 --> 00:33:02,350
And I mean, there's a kind of overlap with like reading substances and children and adolescents expectations and of course,

283
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:08,020
trying to learn about these different substance use and take it back to like my friends have an insulin and I as

284
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:15,460
the substance use in young people a lot so if I have educate them I would like a lot of ice cream questions.

285
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:21,969
I mean, I kind of mentioned like the everybody and saying what so we use a lot and I

286
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:26,510
was teenager something in like middle school ish I really liked one direction.

287
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,370
It wasn't in the summer movie.

288
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,729
I don't know. I feel like I was into mainstream stuff. I really like Twilight.

289
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:46,330
I still like it and but of course basing it on our side to ask me and every teenage girl, cool.

290
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:52,780
You know, I should have you guys write these down so I can have a list of young people.

291
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,809
Books, movies. He's great.

292
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,900
That's awesome. Thank you so much about you.

293
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:03,490
Go right behind you. I'm Alex.

294
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:06,790
I'm an undergrad in the public eye sciences degree.

295
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:12,760
I'm interested in mental health, in primary prevention of chronic diseases.

296
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:21,590
So nutrition or substance abuse types of expectations in the course, hoping to just kind of get into action,

297
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:28,420
adolescent health and how substances and different behavior choices can affect your melatonin search.

298
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:35,890
And then I don't have that much experience and the topics that I think we're going to have this sports.

299
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:48,070
But I also just not be familiar with all the teen panda I think but 21 pilots know was one of my favorites for the movie.

300
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:51,820
There was the first Kingsman movie. I really like that one.

301
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:55,720
And then the book was The Giver. That's cool.

302
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:59,680
Thank you. Hi, guys. My name is Sarah.

303
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:03,340
I'm in the undergrad, Public Health, the Arts Program.

304
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,250
I'm interested in my chronic diseases because I want to specialize in oncology one day.

305
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:14,320
So kind of thinking about how this class we're going to be learning about prevention,

306
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:18,760
maybe applying some of those like chronic disease prevention intersect in that way,

307
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:24,639
especially since like substance use is a major risk factor for like chronic diseases, cancer.

308
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,840
So then I'm thinking about expectations from this because I'm interested in if there's like any,

309
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:37,120
like disparities associated with the substance use, like how we can learn from those, like what populations are most at risk.

310
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,330
I use for her questions.

311
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:48,890
I have some personal time, so like the topic I really think I have like work experience and there's a lot of courses I've taken now,

312
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:53,049
like being in public health underground. I'm sure everyone can relate that we learned about prevention.

313
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:58,950
So kind of like learning about it, like specific. Interested to learn as a teenager.

314
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:04,169
I also saw One Direction, that American movie I put Hallmark stars in,

315
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,280
and she said that was her favorite book, but I wasn't a big reader back in the day.

316
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:13,710
So I think it was a sign reading for class. But To Kill a mockingbird was a good book.

317
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:20,399
Great, great. Thank you. Hi, everyone. My name is Jim and pronouns are she her?

318
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,020
And I'm a B.A. in the Community and Global Health Program with a minor in applied statistics.

319
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,900
I'm interested in population, mental health and then policy and also disparities within that field,

320
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:36,360
and then also health data systems more broadly and how they intersect with this course.

321
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,999
I've taken a lot of psychology classes and then also public mental health, so I learned a lot about this topic,

322
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,450
but never really through public health and prevention and strategies lens.

323
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:53,910
So I'm interested to also see how this class discusses the intersection between substance use and mental health from a public health perspective.

324
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:58,650
And then also, just because adolescence is such a impactful time in your life,

325
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:06,780
I'm really interested to see how prevention looks different for this age group versus adults and give your questions.

326
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:14,040
I guess I went into my academic experiences already as a teenager last year, so it's kind of all the same old stuff.

327
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,750
When I was younger, like 13, 14, I had a bit of a punk rock phase.

328
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:26,790
I listen to a lot of followup by congressmen, but yeah, and then my favorite book has always been A Thousand Splendid Suns by Collins.

329
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:29,819
And so very good.

330
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:36,360
Thank you very much. I'm really happy you're at the table.

331
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,410
Oh, yes, AM. Hi. My name is Mariah.

332
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,840
I'm an undergrad and public health abstract.

333
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:51,530
So my interest in public health or disease prevention, nutrition, epidemiology and my interest intersect with this course.

334
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,390
And I'm also taking classes in mental health.

335
00:37:54,570 --> 00:38:05,520
So I want to see how that plays a role in like the micro scale and also at the system level how the scale of abuse today is.

336
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:10,320
I don't know too much about like adolescent substance abuse and more about that and

337
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:15,410
policies and interventions that have successfully I don't hear a lot about it in the news,

338
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:22,830
but I can see myself seeing what what works and then my expectations to learn more about the topic.

339
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:32,040
I don't have that many work or academic experiences, but I work in the hospital, so oftentimes it's nurses prescribing pain medication.

340
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,750
So I wonder if that affects later on after they leave the hospital.

341
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:41,760
And then as a teenager, my favorite books were the Harry Potter series.

342
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:45,930
I love Taylor Swift, and I would watch like everybody would be in theater.

343
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:53,250
Thank you. I'm again, I'm also an undergrad and theater program.

344
00:38:53,910 --> 00:39:05,310
And I would say my area of interest in public health be home and specifically violence experience, so to speak, etc.

345
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:19,440
And I guess the only intersection I see between that and this course is that both those problems hinge on changing behavior, which is important.

346
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:29,370
And I don't know much about adolescent substance use at all, so I just expect to learn something interesting about that.

347
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:41,400
And also from a prior public health class, I've learned that I enjoy going to other primary prevention interventions.

348
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:47,640
So hopefully to do that and really learn what makes a successful intervention.

349
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:57,630
And then I don't have much work or academic experience with this, but definitely there's some personal experience,

350
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:06,650
especially with like a helper kind of scary experience after surgery was very good, so that was nice.

351
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:15,150
It was like, I have not seen anyone, but when I was a teenager, like 13, 14 years old,

352
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:23,530
I would listen to like, I don't know, I guess remember that I kind of listen to their music.

353
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:37,920
But on I really love and I remember I would watch to a lot of which is a show like Mermaids and I read The Hunger Games like it's pretty good.

354
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:54,450
So thank you for sharing. My name is Sophie student and specifically interested in making this happen and kind of relating to this.

355
00:40:55,460 --> 00:41:00,100
A lot of adolescents go to college as well.

356
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:08,900
So my expectations from this, I would say the first question it touches on,

357
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:16,870
since you specifically sort of think that it's more fun to know how much it is.

358
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,850
And then I would say it's work experience.

359
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:28,200
I've had a couple people talk about, you know, the kind of moment spaces or executives and really,

360
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:32,840
you know, not directly but sure, you know, in some way, shape or form.

361
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:38,000
And then I would say as far as words to determine if you were branded as Jonas Brothers,

362
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:49,190
my favorite movie was diaries and favorite books were very powerful, but I'm staring.

363
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,470
I was an undergrad and abstract.

364
00:41:52,580 --> 00:42:04,690
I have an interest in maternal health, so I'm interested to see how illicit substances in terms of that kind of information.

365
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:10,909
Um, I don't know much about substance use with substance use in particular.

366
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:16,460
So I want, I'm not to mention somebody else.

367
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:22,370
I don't have much experience or work experience in this class.

368
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:26,840
And then as a teenager, I was a big fan of Taylor Swift, too.

369
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:31,820
And then I think my third one was tangled and I was a big Percy Jackson.

370
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:45,220
I'm Gina, and I'm a young undergrad and I'm interested in public health.

371
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,960
I guess it is like just various cultural ethnic groups.

372
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:57,329
I really like assignments where it's kind of like design and state intervention and I guess like, you know,

373
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:05,219
like I talk to my friends who might go on who's or a group or like do research or and funny way to do it that way.

374
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:09,900
That's not like just a lot of well selected community oriented.

375
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,300
So that's something I want to do in the future.

376
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:23,159
And um, and also like in regards to adolescent health, like there's a huge focus on like pediatric care but then not as much as like anything else.

377
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,660
And so that's something that also the mindset to learn about.

378
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:35,690
And then after that and then yeah, the expectations for this class are like learning about existing interventions and primary,

379
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:41,240
primary influences I have worked and ones I know and also how to account for like individuals.

380
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,120
I think they're like that.

381
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:50,819
Really interesting because even if you design something perfect, there's a very low chance that everyone's going to appear exactly how you want to do.

382
00:43:50,820 --> 00:44:00,750
And I really do like human study, human behavior in different contexts in terms of work and stuff.

383
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:08,310
I kind of already maybe a little on this, but so I work at the Adolescent Health Initiative, which is like part of Michigan Medicine.

384
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:17,790
So I'm the program intern. So there's a lot of editing stuff that already made, but it's also the clinician thing.

385
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:20,909
So they write a lot of guys like for clinics and doctors,

386
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:29,990
like how to talk about sexuality with your patient and how to like make sure your space is like confidential as can be.

387
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:37,920
There's a lot of legal, you know, laws, laws that differ between states, too,

388
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:46,740
and then also like access they can to, Alisyn, have access to resources like for treatment.

389
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,270
So that's kind of like I told my boss about this class and she was very excited for you.

390
00:44:52,290 --> 00:45:00,150
So moving to when those two roles together, they haven't focused that much on substance use.

391
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:09,959
So and then as a teenager, my favorite movie was and still is Surf's Up, which is about penguins,

392
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:20,550
the surf and a chicken and and I stroke to become a band person now but I was like a teenager.

393
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:24,030
Most of all, I just don't have reason to dream.

394
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:26,819
And that's who I said is my favorite artist.

395
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:35,879
The teenager love him and then a book I didn't really serious but I mean really good formative time was this book

396
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:44,370
called senior like Circe by Madeline Miller she does a lot of other like interpretations of of Greek mythology.

397
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:50,440
So. Yeah. Well, thank you. Okay.

398
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:55,830
My name is David and my kids are doing science.

399
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,310
And so my interest in science. That's.

400
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:17,840
Yes. And maybe I want to just give you some specific some substance abuse or communication with more people.

401
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,970
So this is my business.

402
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:25,720
It's my vision on this.

403
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:35,620
Once you start creating, these sites need to understand substance abuse and so on.

404
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:47,260
So maybe this depletion of these canvases turns.

405
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:52,770
That's what they need.

406
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,240
Why do I tell you this?

407
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:12,000
It's two different things. So first, we have to see some value in schools to accommodate some of these students in the current university system.

408
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:33,090
And to be honest, I didn't and I surmise that it's prejudicing my kids and it raises some of these.

409
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:40,640
And that's how one. Yeah, I like that.

410
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:46,390
And that changes a whole range of things since.

411
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:51,720
Cool. Thank you. Hi, I'm Sarah.

412
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:57,470
I'm an impact student in stages. I intend to work in Elysium Health Education specifically.

413
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:03,229
Except that it means that some substance use is something that those who live in confidence from this

414
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:11,000
course I expect only just learn how to develop effective prevention programs that are go beyond.

415
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:21,840
Just don't use those facilities that I've had some work with and like academics within like mental health specifically.

416
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:27,500
Nothing that's touched so much on substance use which has been mentioned like in passing.

417
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,980
I was an engineer, so I'm excited to learn more about it.

418
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:44,210
When I was a teenager, it was different than we really were in, I guess like movies and books.

419
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:49,430
I was really into Harry Potter, like those movies. It looks so cool.

420
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:54,020
Thank you. My name is Casey. I am each student studying.

421
00:48:54,020 --> 00:49:03,020
It's been changed nine areas, which is to help communication and then also focusing on adolescent populations and those experiencing homelessness,

422
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:07,760
which are two populations that are susceptible to substance use.

423
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:15,530
And then within this class, I think I harbor some of stereotypes within myself about I was in substance abuse.

424
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:20,210
So I'm excited to as class to dismantle those and so learn more about the topic.

425
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:25,970
And then just eager to get more practice designing practical,

426
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:37,130
workable interventions in terms of academic work by each big 600 project focused on adolescent substance abuse.

427
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:42,920
So I have a little bit of research there. Nothing super strong, but a little bit.

428
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:49,010
And then as a teenager I was like a really girl and I talk boy.

429
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:52,250
Then I read a lot of John Green.

430
00:49:52,430 --> 00:50:00,399
I like burlesque and then movies, anything that, you know, a Disney channel and or featured Selena Gomez.

431
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,620
Okay, cool.

432
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:12,650
Thank you. I only have a first year and each student also each reach university.

433
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:22,340
I mean my interest cover like access to care, addressing racial disparities and as president of general meetings, my expectations for the course.

434
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:26,860
I just want to learn more about it I really want to pursue in the future.

435
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:40,510
I was also in the same room as Casey for her 600 plus sentences, so I had little knowledge and I saw questions when I was a teenager for music.

436
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:45,280
I just like mainstream pop songs with little mix there.

437
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,730
The radio. Oh really?

438
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:54,740
But girls like The Maze Runner. Like, why is the media, your jeans and the TV show?

439
00:50:54,830 --> 00:51:03,400
I can survive this lots of time. I really like the twists, even though it's very cool.

440
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:17,320
Thank you. I'm great. I'm a student athlete in sports and my interest is in the treatment.

441
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:21,130
The press release was coming.

442
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:27,200
So naturally that leads to some overlap with this topic.

443
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:43,130
I'm not sufficient for this course. I just want to learn more about this initiative and as I'm sure we have to decide, adolescent legal practice.

444
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,450
And so that's something that you have to treat. So I'm excited.

445
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:52,720
I'm also just doing this for my husband.

446
00:51:54,190 --> 00:52:06,730
I would just like I feel like I'm kind of coming back actually in a different way than academic experience when I was a teenager.

447
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:20,820
I was like I was like really like Carrie Underwood in that movie with Legally Blond and then book.

448
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:26,850
I didn't do it this time because I read The Great Gatsby three times.

449
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:35,870
Doesn't like. So if you use Mali, I'm in the program.

450
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:40,940
I'm really interested in nutrition and how old I am.

451
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:47,120
So I'm kind of interested to hear how different substances affect your body long term as well.

452
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:57,750
Growing up, I had a lot of exposure to mental health and substance abuse, so that's kind of my experience with that.

453
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:04,690
And then when I was a teenager, I was really from there, and I think we're going to be best if you're a child star,

454
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:09,470
you know, and I also am looking for, you know, if I could ever get through.

455
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:15,649
Well, thank you. My name is Max Carrie.

456
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:23,030
I am a program that is my current area of interest is in mental health.

457
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:34,669
But obviously it to me, I think school I think like other major things with this course like I was in a lot of thinking about

458
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:43,030
things that are in the future often have to be closely related to that was business to her hand and

459
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:52,850
then it was like in the course of like I am like once again resonance like in my undergrad television

460
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:58,410
for a year after I graduated from dancing and it was a lot of trainings on how to deal with alcohol,

461
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:06,390
primarily alcohol, marijuana, but it was a lot of like substance abuse treatment with more stress.

462
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:11,620
Um, I guess it's like learning how much that did.

463
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:15,920
And I was like, that was a college experience talking about.

464
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:27,550
I guess like when I was a senior, I think it was Linkin Park for a long time,

465
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:38,330
ever since my dad was a, um, movie star person in the first race back in 67.

466
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:43,700
Harry Potter? Yeah. Thank you.

467
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:56,160
My name's Jackson. I'm in the medical science program and speech meetings in areas that are women's health, mental health.

468
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:04,370
And so I guess I was just thinking that there are larger structural factors that affect all of these things that you can address.

469
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:12,430
And what I expected, of course, is obviously not to do this work effectively and simply,

470
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:23,390
but I will also be interested to learn what not to do, the sort of thing like I've done for time work specifically related to substance use.

471
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:28,430
I have done work in gender based violence prevention research at the college level.

472
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:32,480
So a little bit older and not entirely really,

473
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:46,639
but I have done some work and as a teenager I would take the first ever bad words for my mom and all of her kindness, you know, which I go to see.

474
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:52,730
It allows like, you know, not for her and movies.

475
00:55:52,730 --> 00:56:02,660
I got into horror movies later in high school and I accidentally saw it summer movie and scared me a lot.

476
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:13,430
Going back to in terms of books, when I was in middle school, I was very into Chris Jackson or thank you.

477
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:21,440
I'm doing like this week really doing something positive way to look at it.

478
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:29,540
Like Zoey, I am watching her home from school, social work class right next year hopefully.

479
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:34,400
And so if you were trying to change the choice.

480
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:43,120
One of the things that I did, just a few things, which was very easy.

481
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:57,250
I also had occupational therapist at one point. And so I took a class that was around wellness in that it was really interesting looking at

482
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:04,579
how we use occupations to help people be engaged in health indicators rather than saying,

483
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:16,720
you should not do this. We got them engaged in other activities and that I had a hope that would change a little bit of.

484
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:21,010
And then the other thing I like about community based, which is great,

485
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:34,690
is that it is moving to the pursuit of this idea of how by understanding this substance misuse through a lens of the community and by trauma,

486
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:43,090
and how that can be some of the ways that people who need substance use.

487
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:50,380
Some people that we have experienced this interesting thing about and I know this.

488
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:57,410
What? Cool.

489
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:01,430
You want to try the other thing?

490
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:14,840
The band I was interested in Taylor Swift and inside the movie The Notebook.

491
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:24,110
I like to go on and diary for the book, and with that the reader.

492
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:31,220
We also like to come up with ideas like possible people or thank you very much.

493
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:46,510
I, you know, I'm a seven year old student in our team and my areas of interest include public health and public relations courses.

494
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:54,610
I know about immigration and some of those stresses mean to learn about, which also kind of, I think,

495
00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:03,860
science fiction to this course and to see how our production methods are different or if they're different languages.

496
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:17,210
And um, an undergrad that I did biology and I did a minor pilot development and think I haven't learned to specific it seems to be so interesting.

497
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:27,290
And then my favorite family I. But what happened in how you mentioned my favorite movie was Mean Girls and then my

498
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:36,890
favorite book was my experience of Thank You for the one I'm sitting here in the program.

499
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:43,150
My interest was in the film specifically, you know,

500
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:51,500
in particular the first movie access where we have get this population in the region before

501
00:59:53,210 --> 01:00:00,590
the relation between mental health and substance use for that business class as well as

502
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:11,149
in your case where you use I was thinking last iteration suffered early on in 1979 which

503
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:17,840
is related to psychiatric disorders have all suffering from that loss of not much hope.

504
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:24,860
And then when I was a teenager, my favorite example was Freddie Gray.

505
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:29,240
And then I mentioned before Twilight was a favorite.

506
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:38,240
And then there was also a book series of which you've done great.

507
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:45,319
Thank you, everyone, for sharing. I think maybe I should add next time I want to have it recorded actually,

508
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:51,020
so I can get all the little tips for music and stuff like that for my little daughter.

509
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:54,390
She's a pre-teen and she seems like a teenager actually.

510
01:00:54,640 --> 01:01:02,630
You. So I thank you for that. I appreciate that and hope we get to learn about each other a bit more as the course progresses.

511
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:10,040
All right. Let's talk a little bit about, you know, why focus on adolescence?

512
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:20,750
I think we kind of have a general idea right now. It's like right here to commence change, a sensitive period of life.

513
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:29,720
People are trying new things, risk taking, positive risk taking, a negative risk taking this happening during this time period.

514
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:34,070
Those are all really good reasons to work in the adolescent age group.

515
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:44,360
When you think about dealing with substance use an addiction issues all but one of the major reasons I think is also that most of the time.

516
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:50,180
Um. Substance use. Um.

517
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,680
When when does substance abuse or addiction initiate?

518
01:01:58,010 --> 01:01:58,240
Right.

519
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:13,070
If you look at this graph, the bottom axis is age in this axis, percent in each age group who develop dependance for the first time to a substance.

520
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:19,850
And if you notice, the peak is around between 15 and 20 years.

521
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:23,440
Although this slide is slightly more than all,

522
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:33,220
this still rings true today that most of the time addiction and dependance initiates during the adolescent period.

523
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:36,610
And if you go down as you get older,

524
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:47,920
people don't become addicted to a substance dependent on the substance or a regular user of the substance, etc. That probably is much more.

525
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:53,130
So if you want to intervene, you want to start before you start seeing these spikes, right?

526
01:02:53,830 --> 01:02:59,650
So sometimes people argue that adolescence is a little bit late to deal with this problem.

527
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:06,790
So we should be dealing with this even preadolescent, you know, things like social emotional development issues,

528
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:20,110
emotional regulation, household and parenting practices during early childhood, not necessarily pre-teen and teenage years.

529
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:31,240
So you could in this class develop programs that deal with issues before adolescence to prevent substance use and abuse during adolescence.

530
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:40,310
But this is a slide often used to kind of signify that this age group is a really sensitive period.

531
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:46,929
This is when things are. So if you want to do something about this problem, you want to start during or before adolescence.

532
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:52,990
You can even start during pregnancy because there are there is evidence out there that, you know,

533
01:03:53,080 --> 01:04:00,460
fetal exposure to nicotine is associated with risk of nicotine addiction in adulthood.

534
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:11,950
Okay. So you can even do pregnancy programs to prevent adolescent uptake of substances and dependance on specific substances.

535
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:20,590
Just some brief overview of different ways people think about addiction in our society.

536
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:26,530
Right. You may have heard about these types of models of thinking about addiction and dependency.

537
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:38,860
And there's something called the moral model. A medical model, psychodynamic model, social model and bio psychosocial models from these titles.

538
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:47,080
And if you come across these and learned about these kind of models before, what's what do you think a moral model of addiction and a focus is on?

539
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:55,490
Yeah. Well, I like the individual one.

540
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:07,540
How they're oriented, whether that's pushing them towards substances and some personal values and morals that might be driving use.

541
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:16,760
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. But also might be more of like people seeing addiction as a moral failure.

542
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:23,719
So maybe like more societal morals and seeing it more as like a choice that they're making

543
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:31,050
rather than the kind of laws that what's going on is more about like I'm doing it the world.

544
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:38,000
What else? Yeah, I think that's right on.

545
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:41,170
It has to do with the individual individual worldviews.

546
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:47,799
And it's about substance use and becoming an addict, having an addictive pattern.

547
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:54,060
Abuse is a feeling of the individual. It's not about the feel of the environment, but the individual.

548
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:57,910
So there's something wrong with them and they need to be fixed.

549
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:09,190
Their value systems need to be adjusted. So if that's the case, what do you do if you use a moral Mel, to prevent or deal with addiction?

550
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:14,800
Yeah, exactly. I think a lot of people go toward volunteer programs.

551
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:18,550
Can you can you speak a little of the 12 step program?

552
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:25,960
I wonder if that's a little bit more like one of the ways that they go find what's.

553
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:39,940
Okay. I would say that more of the Big 12 step programs, I don't think they have moral approach,

554
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:52,660
but they do talk about the higher power and in succumbing to the higher power to deal with going through recovery processes.

555
01:06:54,190 --> 01:07:00,660
But others I mean, how would you deal with or prevent substances like a normal suicide?

556
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:06,460
Where you think the person. There's something wrong with the person. Yeah.

557
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:10,270
You throw them in jail or like very rigid.

558
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:19,300
You didn't, like, cure the problem yourself or it's like you can't, like, society as a whole, can't do anything about it cause it's a moral person.

559
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:24,249
Yeah. Throw them in jail. Make things legal.

560
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:27,850
Illegal. Fear based, maybe.

561
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:31,180
Intervention programs. Yeah.

562
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,930
Excellent. So what about a medical what is a medical model?

563
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:44,290
What might that lead to? And this is not a medical model that is, you know, like looking at the pathways, like nervous system,

564
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:55,240
like when neurotransmitters are released over and how that affects addiction and like your behavior and I using the drugs were great.

565
01:07:55,300 --> 01:08:00,970
Yeah. So there's some kind of like genetic or biochemical predisposition to addiction.

566
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:07,550
So if you want to deal with the problem. How would you deal with the problem if you applied a medical model?

567
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:23,250
In terms of prevention or in terms of treatment. Yeah, I know sometimes they use Narcan for healing, so that would be a solution to that.

568
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:27,450
So you could use pharmacological approaches, right, to deal with the problem.

569
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:38,010
You may identify people who are genetically at risk for the disease of addiction and target them for some type of intervention.

570
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:48,420
So you use a medical system, either a medical behavioral kind of intervention or a medical pharmacological intervention to address the problem.

571
01:08:49,410 --> 01:08:55,950
So what about a psychodynamic model? Yeah.

572
01:08:56,310 --> 01:08:59,740
Exactly. Like, yeah. You speak up a little bit.

573
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:05,950
Would that be fair? Yes, I think it would be some sort of therapy that would be a solution.

574
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:13,260
If you use a psychodynamic model like cognitive behavioral therapy or psychotherapy or something like that.

575
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:17,730
But the idea here is that you're using substances to cope.

576
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:28,790
That you had some early trauma, you have some stress, you have some anxiety, and you're using the drug to cope with that disease.

577
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:37,990
Cope with those feelings. And the way you address that problem is look at what might be the quote unquote root causes.

578
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:46,760
Right. What might what is causing this stress? And to eliminate or learn to address those stressors so that you don't use the drugs.

579
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:57,120
Now what about a social model? What would a social model try to communicate about substance use and addiction?

580
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:01,110
Yeah, when I think of social, I think like interacting with the people.

581
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:08,080
So for adolescents, maybe the peer pressure around them, like other people around them or using drugs, so they start using it.

582
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:14,470
Right. So another hand over here, I think that.

583
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:22,110
Yeah. So things about the social environment are what increases the risk of decreases in risk of substance abuse or addiction,

584
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:33,500
peer pressure, experimental use or family context of use something in your neighborhood, easy access to the drug.

585
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:43,770
There could be other issues in the neighborhood that create some risk for substance use, like social cohesion problem.

586
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:50,940
So issues of social disorder, that kind of thing.

587
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:57,720
So if you had a social model of addiction in mind, how would you address?

588
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:04,760
Prevention or treatment of addiction? Yes.

589
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:09,870
Creating a culture of knowledge.

590
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:14,790
Better knowledge. Okay.

591
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:21,190
So maybe if you would like in several schools, you would do back school climate change kinds of interventions that.

592
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:30,160
So those are done in great safe schools, schools where kids feel connected to others, learn how to deal with peer pressure.

593
01:11:30,730 --> 01:11:37,450
So when you're offered a drug, what to do to say no and how to get away and avoid drugs.

594
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:46,479
Right. Um, so social model takes that type of approach and a bio psychosocial model is something that kind

595
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:53,740
of takes all of these approaches together because I don't think any of them are really 100%.

596
01:11:54,460 --> 01:12:01,470
If you just use one of those models I think you're missing out on, what are some of the causal factors approach dress then,

597
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:07,180
but I don't think any of these models are actually well, even the model is not completely wrong.

598
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:15,970
Um, you know, sometimes they cut my brother. Sometimes this guy's making decisions that are just not the right decisions.

599
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:25,210
And so if you apply all these models together, I think you probably address the problem in a more effective way.

600
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:35,260
For example, we have things like, you know, tobacco at 21 now where you can't buy, uh, tobacco unless you're 21 or older.

601
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:39,130
And if you do, you're going to get in trouble with the law.

602
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:43,030
And that's applying some sort of a moral and social model to the problem.

603
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:51,519
Um, so the idea for this slide is to kind of think about variety of ways we've tried to address and think about

604
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:58,570
addiction and how that impact might impact the solutions we put forward and that none of these models are very,

605
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:06,280
completely wrong. And I think a bio psychosocial model that integrates many of these models is probably the right course to go.

606
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:16,150
So you deal with medical or biological predisposition issues about your psychology and stress, your background, uh,

607
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:24,460
things about things in your social circles or your social environment that might be increasing your risk of addiction.

608
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:28,320
Addressing all of those together, probably the right thing to do.

609
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:33,159
And you may not be able to do those in one program, but a host of programs,

610
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:39,940
a constellation of programs, can address all of these different kinds of influences.

611
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:49,409
Um, so principles of community based prevention, we're going to focused on a lot of these principles throughout class.

612
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:52,120
So we try to talk about prevention programing,

613
01:13:52,540 --> 01:14:00,820
but these are just some highlights of the things that are part of prevention programing for substance use, prevention and control.

614
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:11,020
Um, so for example, you should enhance protective and promoter factors in reverse or reduce risk factors for substance use.

615
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:22,020
Is protective factors are factors that buffer against some stress risk in your environment that may increase your risk of substance use,

616
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:31,329
promoting factors or things that make it less likely that you reduce the threat, not necessarily buffer against any stress,

617
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:38,810
but in fact there are so many reduce your risk of substance use and reduce risk factors.

618
01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:43,930
We'll get into what are protective factors and what are risk factors for substances use.

619
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:50,379
But the idea is to identify these factors in your population or community and

620
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:54,760
in attack those factors or address those factors in their prevention programs.

621
01:14:56,740 --> 01:15:04,240
Create programs that are locally based right relevant to the local community.

622
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:12,340
Where would you intend to work and target the modifiable risk and protective and promoting factors?

623
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:18,800
So you need to develop programs with a clear and deep understanding of the neighborhood,

624
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:22,060
of the community and the social group that you want to work in.

625
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:31,440
Um, and identify what are the factors contributing to the problem in that community and develop a program accordingly.

626
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:36,909
So I think the third bullet kind of highlights that.

627
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:43,480
But really to also think about tailoring programs to specific genders, age groups,

628
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:50,530
ethnic groups and other identity groups that are that are part of your community.

629
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:57,350
For example, you will do something very different in high school kids versus you may what you may do in medical school as kids.

630
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:13,060
Well, men and women, boys and girls, different genders, sexes, use drugs and substances differently and respond to prevention programs differently.

631
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:25,450
So you want to take that into account and think about these and think about developing and implementing programs to enhance family bonding

632
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:35,770
and relationships and include parenting skills in implementing family policies around substance use and awareness about drugs in the home.

633
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:42,190
So families are very important context for substance use prevention.

634
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:50,860
So a lot of programs focus on parenting skills, talking to your kids about substances,

635
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:59,830
developing policies and rules in your home, about use that could be implemented and enforced by the parent.

636
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:07,180
Also, thinking about family environment like family cohesion and connectedness and

637
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:13,120
functioning communication patterns that those things are important for healthy.

638
01:17:13,450 --> 01:17:22,750
And you have a child who is less risk of taking the substances and developing an addictive habit.

639
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:33,220
So intervene early, even as early as preschool to address some of these issues to prevent adolescent substance use.

640
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:39,280
And there are many other principles and there's some book that I assigned to you guys called The Red Book,

641
01:17:40,150 --> 01:17:45,070
different pieces of it that focuses on these principles and gets into them in more detail.

642
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:52,450
But we'll talk about something called a strategic planning framework or prevention framework.

643
01:17:53,410 --> 01:18:02,140
This is a framework developed by SAMHSA, which is a substance, substance abuse and Mental Health Administration SAMHSA,

644
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:07,240
and that's part of the Health and Human Services at the federal level.

645
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:16,180
And that organization is responsible for prevention and treatment of substance use and mental health problems in the country.

646
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:23,530
And they provide a lot of funding to local communities to do prevention programing as well as treatment and so forth.

647
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:28,149
And they have developed this framework which we should all be aware of if we're

648
01:18:28,150 --> 01:18:33,640
working in this field around how to go about developing a prevention program,

649
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:39,129
what steps you should take, what you should keep in mind, and so forth.

650
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:49,210
And they use this framework when they have requests for applications for grants to do prevention programs.

651
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:53,319
So learning about this framework will probably help you if you're interested

652
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:57,410
in this work and you seek resources from the government to do this template.

653
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:02,650
So you start with assessment. You know, what is the problem in the community that you're working in?

654
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:09,430
What is the capacity of that community to address the substance use problem that was identified in the assessment phase?

655
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:18,769
You plan what you're going to do with the community organization board or stakeholders implement the program.

656
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:27,010
You go the program and you start again with assessment. So it's pretty straightforward, but it breaks it down into these nice, clear steps.

657
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:34,240
So you don't miss anything along the way, and you want to think about issues of sustainability over the long term,

658
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:39,130
even after the funding is over, and issues of cultural humility and competency.

659
01:19:39,430 --> 01:19:43,350
So we'll talk about this framework in more detail as class goes are.

660
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:50,020
Okay, so let me give you a I think we were able to watch this.

661
01:19:50,020 --> 01:20:02,070
I hope the speakers walk in here. Let's see this is just a little short the BBC that video and what's happening and I on.

662
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:17,700
Can you guys hear anything here? This. From.

663
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:38,950
Recently. One of the things you used to do.

664
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:57,960
This audible? Very. Not really.

665
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:02,990
Okay. Well, let me tell you about what this country says, and you can watch it on your own at home.

666
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:08,260
So we will learn about the Icelandic model that they have employed over the last

667
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:15,200
20 years to address this issue of substance use in teenagers and young adults,

668
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:29,680
you know, alcohol abuse. Substance abuse was a huge problem in Iceland 20 years ago, the highest rates in European in the region.

669
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:34,270
So what did they do to address this problem?

670
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:41,050
They did several things. They had curfews after 10 p.m.

671
01:21:41,650 --> 01:21:47,770
Kids who were out after 10 p.m. without an adult were stopped and sent home.

672
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:53,350
And actually, parents in the community would try to enforce the curfew so that police.

673
01:21:55,120 --> 01:22:07,540
To, uh, they tried to and they did provide money to each household for after school enrichment and sports activities.

674
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,770
It's one of the major issues for kids is what do you do after school?

675
01:22:12,210 --> 01:22:18,010
The kids are not engaged in any kind of pro-social behavior after school.

676
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:22,060
They're going to do something that's not very good for them, but keep them busy.

677
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,270
And doing good things like sports activities are enrichment activities.

678
01:22:26,270 --> 01:22:30,079
So they made those widely available and accessible to all families.

679
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:34,340
And also three is I big, big tract.

680
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:43,460
They had a great surveillance system being implemented and the surveillance system was designed to be locally specific.

681
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:53,630
So each neighborhood and community and school district got a report about what is the level of use in your community,

682
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:59,390
what are some of the risk factors that protect against a lot of factors present in your neighborhood?

683
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:06,760
So that could give local environments always respond to what's going on and that's happens regularly, right?

684
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:14,150
Just not once, all the time. So those are kind of three major steps they took and they brought the rates down.

685
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:21,080
To one of the lowest levels in the region. So we're learning about this model a bit.

686
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:27,290
But then you can talk a bit about how feasible it might be to do it in the United States.

687
01:23:27,490 --> 01:23:31,990
The U.S. is a much bigger country, nicely in a much more diverse country.

688
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:37,190
But do some of those principles, can they be made relevant to some of our local communities here?

689
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:41,030
So we'll learn about that. I'm sorry about that in the system.

690
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:52,180
We'll try to deal with that next. It's great that this is a nice little short snippet to get you oriented to the Icelandic model.

691
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:58,820
And it's a it's a it's a well-known model in the field of substance abuse prevention.

692
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:06,590
Well, I wanted you guys to take this national drug IQ challenge, but I think you guys can do it on your own.

693
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:18,530
It's a very simple set of questions about, you know, what you may know about substance use problems in the country in terms of adolescent use.

694
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:22,340
So take this a little challenge at home and see how you do.

695
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:31,400
It's a self-guided thing and the answers are at that link. And the questions themselves are in point candles.

696
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:35,990
Okay. Let's talk about the syllabus. It's a thing we can get into.

697
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:46,480
What we can actually do in this class is see here, I'm going to pull up the syllabus on canvas.

698
01:24:46,490 --> 01:24:59,420
I didn't bring hard copies of this stuff, so please go to the canvas website for the course for the modules and under modules.

699
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:04,940
The first day Jan 2010 there is a syllabus document.

700
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:11,090
And open it up. We'll just go through it.

701
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:25,500
All right. I mean, we've talked a lot about what the course is kind of focusing on, so we have to spend too much time on that.

702
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:34,350
I want to get down to the course requirements. Participation is 15% of your grade.

703
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:41,430
That means you all come to class and recession you come to class engaged in the class war.

704
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:49,380
So you can engage in the lecture. But also we're going to do a lot of group activities, so be participating in the activities.

705
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:57,120
It also means that people will be presenting and class will be read in their projects

706
01:25:57,810 --> 01:26:03,570
to be engaged in that those presentations and ask questions and respond to questions.

707
01:26:03,570 --> 01:26:10,889
And so that's a big part of class. And we have an engaged class that there's a lot of discussion happening and

708
01:26:10,890 --> 01:26:14,300
there's a lot of support of each other as we're going through the material. And of course.

709
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:19,370
The second thing is the student led discussion, of course, religions.

710
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:32,000
I have I have indicated two asterisks next to the readings in the reading list, and I would like each of you to sign up for one reading this semester.

711
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:38,330
And when you sign up for that reading, you will present that reading to me, to the class.

712
01:26:39,050 --> 01:26:40,630
Everybody else should also do that.

713
01:26:41,690 --> 01:26:50,660
But the idea is to present it and discuss the advantages, disadvantages, strengths and weaknesses of the reading and the implications of it.

714
01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:55,380
So we all get a better understanding of what the reading material supports.

715
01:26:56,660 --> 01:27:00,620
So while should I sign up sheet just in a few minutes?

716
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:07,670
The major portion of this course is to develop an adolescent substance abuse prevention program.

717
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:19,690
Uh, propose a program. Okay. So this means that you will design a program and design a pilot test of that program.

718
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,040
You will have to implement it, but you're just kind of making it up, right?

719
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:28,870
And I want you to do it in the form of the NIH proposal.

720
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:39,640
I'm the researcher, so I'm most used to writing scientific proposal applications rather than programmatic applications.

721
01:27:40,150 --> 01:27:46,720
So the NIH has many different what they call mechanisms of funding to do research in right of different areas.

722
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:52,260
And I it is the National Institutes of Health, which is also part of the Department of Health and Human Services.

723
01:27:52,870 --> 01:28:00,670
And they are the leading research entity in the medical and health sciences in the United States of America.

724
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:07,630
And they have a mechanism called LA 21. De La 21 is an exploratory grant.

725
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:16,130
So that means that you're exploring an idea, exploring an hypothesis to see if it may or may not work.

726
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:18,680
And if it so, some signal is working,

727
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:30,620
you can go in and do a bigger study to have a better design of that study to really understand whether something works or is a hypothesis true or not.

728
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:44,270
And so there's an exploratory stage, so you can develop a program and propose to implement it in a small group of people and evaluate it.

729
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:48,050
And that's basically what you're going to do, but in the format of the next one.

730
01:28:49,310 --> 01:28:55,040
So what that will entail for you is to look through these links that I've

731
01:28:55,040 --> 01:29:00,350
provided here to give you a guidance on what in our 21 proposals should be like.

732
01:29:00,530 --> 01:29:06,290
Well, talked about this stuff in class and give you more details about, you know, how long it should be,

733
01:29:07,670 --> 01:29:11,870
what are the different sections, what do the different sections include and so forth.

734
01:29:12,350 --> 01:29:23,790
But that's the major project of the course. We can have broken this down into multiple assignments, which you will do in teams of teams of two.

735
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:31,200
Sometimes you have odd number of people in the class, so there may be a couple of teams of three, but two is ideal.

736
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:37,830
And so you will write something called the specific teams page, which is a short summary of your program.

737
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:44,670
And while you're doing it, you'll present that in written form and oral form to the class,

738
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:53,820
and then you present your final project proposal towards the end of class in an oral fashion,

739
01:29:54,330 --> 01:29:58,950
and then you will submit a full proposal at the end of class in this day.

740
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:11,950
And I will go through in detail about what the proposal is on the that but that's the main task and I've heard a lot of you talked about.

741
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:16,210
I want to develop interventions and programs and that's basically what we're going to do.

742
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:27,220
It's in the sense, of course, that in your communication with me, just to know I prefer not to have.

743
01:30:28,410 --> 01:30:33,870
Deep discussions about course content over email because that just gets out of hand sometimes.

744
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:39,720
So if you want to discuss any issue in the class, then more material or anything else.

745
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:49,050
You know, more than just a couple of emails, please set up a meeting with me and when you do send an email to me,

746
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:53,490
please make sure you write each page six, five nine in the subject.

747
01:30:54,450 --> 01:31:02,790
Because if I don't recognize your name off the top of my head, I may not pay as much attention to that email so that six five,

748
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:10,760
nine, eight page 659 will help me make sure that I respond to your email in that time manner.

749
01:31:12,450 --> 01:31:16,260
The lead assignments of all assignments are due on the date.

750
01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:20,010
They are listed in the syllabus without exception.

751
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:26,490
And if you make, I believe assignments do not cut for 10% of the total possible points per day.

752
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:33,900
Now, because we're going through these crazy pandemic times, I have been a little flexible with this rule.

753
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:35,819
Previous to the pandemic,

754
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:42,870
I was quite stringent and I know there's a lot of crazy stuff that it's been happening to us all over the last two or three years.

755
01:31:43,710 --> 01:31:53,230
So I will maintain a little bit of flexibility, but you must have a good reason why you need to be late on some medical or family emergency instances.

756
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:57,990
And it's something that would work, like rating scale is standard.

757
01:31:58,350 --> 01:32:05,850
And, you know, I think the rest of this piece is a think standard for many of our syllabi, you know, academic integrity,

758
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:20,130
we don't plagiarize which untruths we treat, you know, diversity, inclusion, those issues we treat to with with respect and courtesy writing lab.

759
01:32:21,150 --> 01:32:28,020
Some students have difficulty writing. I know it's always felt as a poor writer to incredibly get to grad school,

760
01:32:29,730 --> 01:32:34,049
so we only need help with writing sometimes there's a writing that in our School of Public Health.

761
01:32:34,050 --> 01:32:37,620
So if you need some help with your writing, please make use of that lab.

762
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:45,780
There's also library services as well. There's a librarian assigned to the School of Public Health, and it's a good person to seek out.

763
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:49,560
If you want to do your literature review, it can help do those things.

764
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:57,120
So use those services and we have accommodations for people with specific needs or disabilities.

765
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:02,850
So if you have those, please fill out the appropriate forms and contact me.

766
01:33:03,990 --> 01:33:06,390
And there is, you know, issues around student wellness.

767
01:33:06,570 --> 01:33:14,790
Mental health is a it's a big issue these days, especially, you know, living in a stressful kind of environment.

768
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:18,540
You know, it's getting a little better, but not completely.

769
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:24,450
So there are resources on campus and in our school that you can make use of.

770
01:33:26,710 --> 01:33:31,860
And fortunately, what I've been hearing is these wellness resources are.

771
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:38,090
We don't have enough. So it's a problem.

772
01:33:38,210 --> 01:33:41,660
People have left the university who work in these areas.

773
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:48,049
So we have some labor shortages. So you may have to deal with delays and things like that, which is unfortunate.

774
01:33:48,050 --> 01:33:51,680
But I hear the school and the university is working on this problem.

775
01:33:52,940 --> 01:33:56,060
There's also issues of food insecurity in our student population.

776
01:33:56,750 --> 01:34:03,260
Unfortunately, we've had some issues around that and we need to get help to fix some things out.

777
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:09,620
Okay. Just a quick review of the outline for the course today.

778
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:14,359
We're just doing a brief overview, overview, cursory understanding of what we're going to cover.

779
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:21,890
And of course, next time we'll talk about, you know, the level of substance use and abuse in the population.

780
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:29,810
What is the consequences of that in terms of society, individual economics, etc.?

781
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:34,550
And we'll talk about adolescence. That's a critical period for prevention.

782
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:38,290
So we'll talk about theories of adolescent development now,

783
01:34:38,660 --> 01:34:44,280
what might be going on in adolescent minds and social groups that are important for our work.

784
01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:50,420
And we'll talk about frameworks of substance use, prevention programing.

785
01:34:50,990 --> 01:35:01,610
So we'll look at a couple of different ways of thinking about approaching substance abuse use programing like the SAMHSA framework,

786
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:07,520
but other frameworks as well. We'll talk about finding and adapting evidence based programs.

787
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,350
So how do you look for these types of programs and how do you make them relevant for your community?

788
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:22,339
And then we'll have a series of lectures, one for pharmacology and doctor and the students, which we'll talk about the pharmacology of addiction,

789
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:29,659
what happens to the brain and take drugs, what happened to the therapeutics as well, which are the folks who have issues.

790
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:36,050
And so we study ways to identify solutions for them in adolescent populations.

791
01:35:36,740 --> 01:35:45,020
Mary Thing I'd say is also study substance use but focus on the issues around the adolescent brain.

792
01:35:45,950 --> 01:35:50,690
So she talked about her work in the impact of substances on the brain.

793
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:56,960
Dr. David Silva is part of this social work.

794
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:06,260
It is a lot of family based interventions for substance use prevention to help tackle this work and some information about family based programs.

795
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:12,320
We'll have a winter break. And then we'll talk about school and community based interventions.

796
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:21,730
We'll spend one more session. We will have group meetings with me about your final project.

797
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:27,730
So we with 2 to 3 groups at a time so you can learn about what each other is doing and provide

798
01:36:27,730 --> 01:36:33,160
feedback to you about funded projects and do nothing to spend the whole session doing that.

799
01:36:35,530 --> 01:36:39,850
So while we could three groups at a time, depending on how many groups we end up with,

800
01:36:41,290 --> 01:36:48,260
and then we'll have environmental and policy interventions as another session and then the rest of the course be focused on your final project.

801
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:53,740
So we'll do a workshop day or we'll work on your final projects in class,

802
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:59,320
or you can work together as teams, and I'll go around and and try to help as much as I can.

803
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:05,290
And then we'll end the last two days with the oral presentation and then of course similar.

804
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:12,160
So please take a look at the syllabus. One, jot down any questions you might have.

805
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:16,600
You can try to address those when you come back next time.

806
01:37:17,290 --> 01:37:21,240
Any questions at the current moment? No.

807
01:37:21,390 --> 01:37:25,970
Okay, great. Okay.

808
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:31,560
The next thing I wanted to do is for you to.

809
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:38,790
Sign up for stuff. So if you go to this link on the slide.

810
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:50,070
You will. Just opening up a hockey rink.

811
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:56,630
Put it into Google Chrome.

812
01:37:57,830 --> 01:38:01,070
You should get. Oh, I see you doing it already.

813
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:04,920
Perfect. So. Just sign up for a reading.

814
01:38:06,370 --> 01:38:11,950
And you will present that reading to class next time or the time that it's assigned.

815
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:19,330
And it'll be great. If some people volunteer for next week, you get it done quickly and you have to worry about for the rest of the semester.

816
01:38:20,590 --> 01:38:26,950
So in terms of these presentations are 15 minute presentations, so they're not very long.

817
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:37,620
Right. And and I have provided some guidance in the syllabus of how to approach these.

818
01:38:38,010 --> 01:38:46,710
Right. So you spend a short amount of time summarizing the reading, but most of the time is spent discussing the reading of the class.

819
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:50,790
So you pose questions to the class about the reading.

820
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:57,660
You know, what are some implications of the findings or what did you like or dislike about the reading?

821
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:07,470
So from your gut, your job is to lead a discussion so we get a clearer and better understanding of that reading after the presentation.

822
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:12,630
So everybody should be doing one and it's great that I see people signing up.

823
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:19,020
So they'll be like 45 minutes of each session we spend on us talking to each other and students

824
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:24,240
basically leading the class rather than me standing here and boring you guys for over 3 hours.

825
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:31,970
Excellent. See, that's why the other document is this student interest form.

826
01:39:36,150 --> 01:39:43,890
Great. So fill this form out. This form is designed to help you find a teammate for the final project.

827
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:50,969
So put your name, your contact information, and whether you need a teammate or not,

828
01:39:50,970 --> 01:39:59,400
because some of you may already have a teammate or the week you'll have a teammate you can turn to no into yes and no.

829
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:06,480
Use the list, read it and contact the person if you're in trust, intersect in some way and.

830
01:40:09,230 --> 01:40:15,470
So I think the goal for you all should be that by the end of the third week or so, the players,

831
01:40:15,830 --> 01:40:20,420
you should have your teammates identified so that you can we can work in class,

832
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:28,340
you know, in group projects and group activities to move your final project forward.

833
01:40:29,630 --> 01:40:34,490
And if there are not enough rooms, just add rooms at that point.

834
01:40:34,490 --> 01:40:38,240
And I think there's more. Okay.

835
01:40:43,290 --> 01:40:50,340
And we didn't take a break. So I'm losing my voice. And you guys are probably getting tired of listening to me the.

836
01:40:52,750 --> 01:41:02,040
Okay. So. Yeah. If you don't fill this out now, please fill out both of these forms for tables by the end of this week.

837
01:41:02,190 --> 01:41:09,860
Okay. And the folks presenting next week, you know, contact me if you have questions about your presentation.

838
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,960
Right. And there is also in canvas. I put a couple of more.

839
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:24,320
A little bit more description in the assignments section of canvas about the student led discussions about, of course, readings.

840
01:41:25,190 --> 01:41:30,049
It's not too much information, but just a little bit of guidance I want to give you should develop slides.

841
01:41:30,050 --> 01:41:39,890
It's helpful to have slides for these presentations and upload the size onto canvas so I can have them and

842
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:45,960
maybe even share them with the rest of France if they want to look at your your slides for that reading.

843
01:41:46,550 --> 01:41:49,910
So that way, by the end of class, we'll have some slides about each reading for me.

844
01:41:50,330 --> 01:41:55,190
So it's nice to place research for people to look at. Okay.

845
01:41:57,430 --> 01:42:00,710
Any questions? Any concerns?

846
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:03,770
Yes. For the discussion, the student led one.

847
01:42:03,830 --> 01:42:10,700
How much of that time we're supposed to be talking about and reviewing the article and how much of that should be discussion?

848
01:42:11,210 --> 01:42:17,300
I would say 5 minutes really is the expectation is everybody reads everything right.

849
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:23,690
The idea is to generate discussion about. Yeah.

850
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:28,570
That's a clever rule that you're only signing for one reading.

851
01:42:28,730 --> 01:42:35,050
Yes. And the last the last one on that whole list, there are two readings that you would have to.

852
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:44,210
They're quite short. So the last thing that you have to do, both readings, which is very, very, only a few pages long.

853
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:52,150
Other questions or concerns. I should learn to stand in the middle.

854
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:58,100
But thing. Right. Well, okay.

855
01:42:58,970 --> 01:43:02,600
Well, how many folks are enrolled, not enrolled in this class?

856
01:43:04,710 --> 01:43:08,290
Just three of you. Are you all on the witness? Okay.

857
01:43:09,290 --> 01:43:10,610
Let me know they're all going to get it.

858
01:43:10,700 --> 01:43:17,780
So yeah, I'm just going to look at the signup sheet and I think there was one or two people who could make it today who are enrolled.

859
01:43:18,410 --> 01:43:22,210
But I think it's going to be 20. Okay, good. Oh.

860
01:43:25,130 --> 01:43:31,190
Okay. Yes I think you may other on dates for spring break in the summers is the one I just signed up for.

861
01:43:31,190 --> 01:43:33,260
It's February 28th, but we're on spring break.

862
01:43:35,660 --> 01:43:42,320
I think it should just be changed to March seven on the syllabus, on the syllabus and in the student led discussion.

863
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:49,670
Okay. Thank you for pointing that out. Here's my.

864
01:43:54,670 --> 01:43:58,719
What should it be instead of the 28?

865
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:02,920
That should be March seven. Oh, how do they do that?

866
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:09,910
Okay. So I will fix this date because there may be some adjustments I need to do on the syllabus.

867
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:26,300
Thank you for that. March seven.

868
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:32,490
Right? That's correct. We're not even clear like our break is.

869
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:40,310
Oh, maybe that's why you're school.

870
01:44:43,650 --> 01:44:47,220
Okay, let me double check. I've got to double check that very closely.

871
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:52,090
The dates, but I won't fix it if it's wrong. Your undergraduate is different.

872
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:56,380
I really don't know. Yeah, we have. We have. We have a winter break here.

873
01:44:56,410 --> 01:45:00,560
Should be the same for everybody. Can imagine why it's not so nice of them.

874
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:06,090
Because. So are you saying that Sep 28 is a winter break?

875
01:45:07,110 --> 01:45:12,630
I am also. So Dave, it is for you a winter break.

876
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:17,580
Okay, so I have to adjust to something I hope he's available to present.

877
01:45:20,010 --> 01:45:23,339
Yeah. Okay. All right. I'll fix it.

878
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:28,650
Thank you for that. I appreciate that. Anything else? Okay.

879
01:45:28,710 --> 01:45:31,820
So. Lovely to meet you all.

880
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:40,430
I look forward to spending the semester with you. If you have any questions or if there are any other mistakes in the syllabus, let me know about it.

881
01:45:40,430 --> 01:45:45,360
Correct them. And yeah, you have a great day.

882
01:45:45,410 --> 01:45:50,330
Good week. And we'll meet again next Tuesday. And folks are on wait list.

883
01:45:51,170 --> 01:45:53,600
You signed up. Did you indicate you're on the wait list?

884
01:45:54,410 --> 01:46:01,400
Did you indicate you're on the wait list and you haven't seen the where is that little form that people signed?

885
01:46:05,380 --> 01:46:11,560
Thank you. Okay. So make sure we give you permission.

886
01:46:12,590 --> 01:46:27,100
Thank you. Thank you. So, you know, I was 3 hours and I was like, I'm going to get up there and listen.

887
01:46:28,730 --> 01:46:40,650
Crown Prince still feeling more.
