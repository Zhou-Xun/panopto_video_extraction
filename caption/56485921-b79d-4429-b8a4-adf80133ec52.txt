1
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,545
Hello, everyone, and welcome
back to Nutrition 590.

2
00:00:13,545 --> 00:00:15,570
You may have noticed
that a lot of

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,840
epigenetic findings are
performed in animal models.

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,580
But will the same findings and

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,980
trends apply in human beings?

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,675
Due to ethical reasons,

7
00:00:24,675 --> 00:00:26,010
there are some
experiments that are

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,900
challenging to conduct in humans.

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,960
For example, feeding one
group of babies with

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,610
BPA bottles and feeding

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,595
another group of babies
in BPA free bottles.

12
00:00:35,595 --> 00:00:37,680
However, by collecting

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,525
epigenetic epidemiology studies
from long-term cohorts,

14
00:00:41,525 --> 00:00:42,845
we are able to create

15
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:47,230
epigenetic profiles useful
for epidemiological research.

16
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,260
This field, in specific,

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,480
is called epigenetic
epidemiology.

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,450
The first of three learning
objectives is to understand

19
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,359
epigenetic epidemiology
and approaches

20
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,815
to study the epigenetic
changes in humans.

21
00:01:02,815 --> 00:01:07,175
Second, provide examples
of epigenetic biomarkers,

22
00:01:07,175 --> 00:01:10,225
research methods, and
research results.

23
00:01:10,225 --> 00:01:13,775
Third, delineate
key considerations,

24
00:01:13,775 --> 00:01:15,800
challenges, and future directions

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,970
of epigenetic
epidemiology studies.

26
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,910
Epigenetic epidemiology
studies can be complicated,

27
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,830
especially the ones that focus on

28
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,060
mechanism such as
DNA methylation.

29
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,960
One of the main reasons is

30
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,000
because we are not
sure which specific

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,325
roles epigenetics play in
observed research associations.

32
00:01:37,325 --> 00:01:39,545
Therefore, before beginning

33
00:01:39,545 --> 00:01:42,095
any epigenetic
epidemiology study,

34
00:01:42,095 --> 00:01:45,325
it's important to conduct a
thorough literature review.

35
00:01:45,325 --> 00:01:47,735
Based on previous literature

36
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:50,405
and biological
information you may find,

37
00:01:50,405 --> 00:01:53,210
you can then make a
hypothesis surrounding how

38
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,360
epigenetics may influence
the associations

39
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,150
of say a disease.

40
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,000
There are four common

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,060
epigenetic epidemiology
study designs.

42
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,290
First, you can
evaluate epigenetics

43
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,500
as a direct mechanism
of disease exposure.

44
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,885
That's shown on the
top of the diagram.

45
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:14,120
Second, epigenetics may be

46
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,615
investigated as a
modifier of disease risk.

47
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:22,805
Third, epigenetics may serve
as a biomarker of disease.

48
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:25,580
Lastly, epigenetics could serve

49
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,235
as a biomarker of an exposure.

50
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:30,200
On the right, we have selected

51
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,660
some well-established epigenetic

52
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,935
epidemiological associations.

53
00:02:34,935 --> 00:02:37,085
If you're interested
in learning more,

54
00:02:37,085 --> 00:02:39,770
you can do your own literature
review and learn about

55
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,285
the methodologies and the
results the authors found.

56
00:02:43,285 --> 00:02:46,025
The two major study designs of

57
00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:48,350
epigenetic epidemiology are

58
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,700
cross-sectional studies
and longitudinal studies.

59
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,515
Cross-sectional studies
provide a snapshot

60
00:02:54,515 --> 00:02:56,929
of current epigenetic patterns,

61
00:02:56,929 --> 00:03:00,245
current health status,
and current exposures,

62
00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:03,455
but these can never
infer causality.

63
00:03:03,455 --> 00:03:06,500
Longitudinal study designs,
on the other hand,

64
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,945
are able to conduct
several measures

65
00:03:08,945 --> 00:03:11,960
on the same subjects
over a period of time,

66
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,870
and sometimes this can
be over many years and

67
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,480
thus a longitudinal
study design is

68
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,325
the most optimal design for

69
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:22,640
developmental origins of
health and disease studies.

70
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,100
There are several
considerations when

71
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,965
starting to analyze the
epigenome in humans.

72
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:31,820
Here is a basic flow chart
that investigators can follow

73
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,110
when thinking about how to

74
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,875
incorporate epigenetics
into their studies.

75
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,390
The first question
you can ask is,

76
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,370
do I want to look
globally or do I

77
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,075
want to look at
particular gene regions?

78
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:46,215
As indicated on the left
with the triangles,

79
00:03:46,215 --> 00:03:48,650
cost may help with
this decision as

80
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,544
global approaches tend
to be less expensive.

81
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:54,620
But you also do not get
as much information

82
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,405
as indicated by the data
triangle on the right.

83
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,455
On the right side
of this diagram,

84
00:04:00,455 --> 00:04:03,575
you will see specific
methodologies that can be used

85
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:07,610
depending on which type of
epigenetic analysis selected.

86
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,540
Many epigenetic epidemiology
studies are taking

87
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,225
advantage of a
particular technology

88
00:04:14,225 --> 00:04:16,780
called the infinium bead array.

89
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,450
Bead array microarrays
are technologies based on

90
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,880
three microsilica beads that

91
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,905
self-assemble in micro wells
on either of two substrates,

92
00:04:26,905 --> 00:04:30,755
a fiber optic bundle or
a planners silica slide.

93
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:32,810
Each bead is covered with

94
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,120
hundreds of thousands
of copies of

95
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,450
specific gene
oligonucleotides that act

96
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,640
to capture sequences
in any given assay.

97
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,250
This illumina bead
technology is currently only

98
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,184
available for human samples

99
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:50,060
and can assay almost a million,

100
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,420
well, it's specifically 880,000

101
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,000
CpG sites in one experiment.

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,200
It is also relatively
inexpensive, around $300,

103
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,765
and has standard
analytical pipelines

104
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:06,155
that can be easily adapted
by epidemiologists.

105
00:05:06,155 --> 00:05:08,180
You have already
learned a bit about

106
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,850
the element birth
cohort for Mexico City.

107
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,240
There are several other
cohorts that can be

108
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,130
used in epigenetic
epidemiology studies.

109
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,795
Another birth cohort called PACE,

110
00:05:18,795 --> 00:05:21,860
for pregnancy and
child epigenetics,

111
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,980
has evaluated exposures like
maternal smoking status.

112
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,945
In another PACE study,

113
00:05:27,945 --> 00:05:31,010
Sharp and his colleagues in 2017,

114
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:35,410
examined maternal BMI or body
mass index at the start of

115
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,780
pregnancy and offspring

116
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,735
infant epigenome-wide
DNA methylation.

117
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,940
The scientists found that

118
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,760
maternal BMI was associated with

119
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,280
small methylation changes at over

120
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,760
9,000 CpG sites throughout
the infant epigenome.

121
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,140
In another study,
grooming colleagues use

122
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,305
both the Newcastle preterm
birth cohort study

123
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:01,060
and another cohort,

124
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,730
the Avon Longitudinal
Study of parent and

125
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,520
children to study the association

126
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,680
between postnatal growth and

127
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,405
DNA methylation of genes

128
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:12,845
associated with
childhood fat mass.

129
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:18,035
They observed that the
gene TACSTD2 expression

130
00:06:18,035 --> 00:06:21,385
was inversely correlated
with DNA methylation,

131
00:06:21,385 --> 00:06:23,440
and that this methylation was

132
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,150
also associated with fat mass.

133
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,180
Some of the cohorts listed

134
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,730
here have their DNA
methylation and

135
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,340
other data available
to the public and you

136
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,635
may mine them to answer
questions of your own.

137
00:06:36,635 --> 00:06:39,530
There are several important
considerations when

138
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,410
conducting epigenetic
epidemiology studies.

139
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,930
First, like most
epidemiology studies,

140
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,770
an association does not
necessarily mean causation.

141
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,445
Second, unlike
genetic epidemiology,

142
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,260
in which all cells contain

143
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,415
the same DNA sequence, in
epigenetic epidemiology,

144
00:06:58,415 --> 00:07:01,985
the epigenome is tissue
and even cell specific,

145
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:05,525
and we need to rely on
surrogate DNA such as blood

146
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:09,140
or saliva to represent the
target tissue of interest,

147
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,815
which could be the
brain or the liver.

148
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:14,405
In some cases, epidemiologists

149
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:16,760
are able to collect biopsy or get

150
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,550
access to autopsy
samples to conduct

151
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,830
epigenetic epidemiology
samples on target tissues.

152
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,865
Also, in human studies,

153
00:07:25,865 --> 00:07:28,700
there's more room for
variation, for example,

154
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,535
genetic variation, or exposure,

155
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,545
or lifestyle choice variation.

156
00:07:33,545 --> 00:07:36,895
Finally, age-related
epigenetic change.

157
00:07:36,895 --> 00:07:39,035
It is also important to consider

158
00:07:39,035 --> 00:07:42,575
the window of epigenetic
and exposure measurement.

159
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:44,630
For example, was exposure

160
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,665
measured early in life
or later in life?

161
00:07:47,665 --> 00:07:51,860
Next, epigenetic epidemiology
studies are most

162
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,290
often conducted on the epigenetic
mark, DNA methylation.

163
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,280
This is because that mark is

164
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,800
stable in commonly
collected samples.

165
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,815
While other marks, like
histone modifications,

166
00:08:03,815 --> 00:08:05,810
which are proteins, can rapidly

167
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,430
degrade if not stored
immediately and properly.

168
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,930
Finally, it is important to use

169
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,720
validated technologies
and also partner with

170
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,260
statisticians and
bioinformatics to ensure

171
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,745
that epigenetic epidemiology
data is analyzed correctly.

172
00:08:22,745 --> 00:08:25,940
There are a number of
exciting future directions

173
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,315
for epigenetic epidemiology.

174
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:30,680
These include the
need to validate

175
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,965
peripheral or surrogate
epigenetic biomarkers.

176
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:36,530
In fact, there's an
ongoing consortia at

177
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,895
the National Institutes of Health

178
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:39,670
that is doing this right now.

179
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,840
The TaRGET II consortium was

180
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,630
established in 2016 to explore

181
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,640
the conservation of
perturbations and

182
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,200
epigenomic marks across
tissues and cells.

183
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,260
They use mouse models

184
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,660
and environmentally
relevant exposures.

185
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,095
Many humans studies
have begun to generate

186
00:08:57,095 --> 00:09:00,925
epigenetic data using
surrogate tissues like blood.

187
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:03,140
These have the
potential to aid and

188
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,275
study design and interpretation.

189
00:09:05,275 --> 00:09:08,150
But data from the mouse
TaRGET II study will

190
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:11,269
provide additional exposure
specific insights,

191
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:14,360
and also uses next-generation
sequencing to

192
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,925
evaluate the full epigenome
in one experiment.

193
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:22,220
It is also important
to establish reference

194
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,275
epigenomes both in healthy
and disease states.

195
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:29,375
Also, more epidemiology studies

196
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,150
should employ longitudinal
study designs to

197
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,730
ensure that the exposure
of interest is measured

198
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,155
first before disease
presentation.

199
00:09:38,155 --> 00:09:41,720
Finally, epidemiologists
can partner with

200
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,545
basic scientist to look
at not only human data,

201
00:09:45,545 --> 00:09:47,435
but how human data intersects

202
00:09:47,435 --> 00:09:49,520
with cell line and
animal models to get

203
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,410
a full picture of
how exposures to

204
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:56,053
external factors affect
the human epigenome.
