1
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:19,420
Okay. Welcome back. So today we start a new topic.

2
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:29,350
I can't believe that we are. I. I mean, we're halfway through the semester, so we're going to talk about biomarkers of dietary intake.

3
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:36,610
And I, I want to kind of like, emphasize first that we're going to talk about traditional biomarkers.

4
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:43,930
So we are not going into metabolomics, which is kind of like a new not new anymore because it's been there for a while.

5
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,129
But the reason for that is because in order to understand metabolomics,

6
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,840
you need to also understand the basics of biomarkers, detection and biomarkers.

7
00:00:54,430 --> 00:01:03,280
So we go over to there, we'll take out the in the first part of the class and then we will live there.

8
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:12,669
Love for the second part, but I'm kind of like splitting this topic into I will talk first about the traditional biomarkers,

9
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:17,680
the general principles, and I will specifically focus on fatty acids and you will see why,

10
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:26,200
not only because that's part of my expertize, but also because it's a great biomarker this broad, because you can measure it in many different dishes.

11
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,669
And then the new approach is that I'm actually not talking about that.

12
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:37,450
I'm putting in there with that. I mean, the new approach is now is going to measure everything at the same time, metabolomics and things like that.

13
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:45,669
And for many of you who have already probably attended many seminars or maybe doing research on that, you know a little bit about that.

14
00:01:45,670 --> 00:02:00,490
But we want to show you that then. And then we'll do the the part one level segment and then for next to live in a way for this year for next week,

15
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,490
we will have I will talk for the first time with time, and you will be the ones who will be talking.

16
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,350
So I'm going to have an in-class assignment on a specific biomarkers.

17
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,600
And at the end of today's class, I will give you the instructions.

18
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:26,710
It's already in canvas. So the idea is that during this week you will be individually doing some research on the biomarkers that you're assign,

19
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,690
and then next week you will have some time in class to work with your group to kind

20
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,929
of like organize your ideas and then you will present to the rest of the class.

21
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:44,290
But I think your Monday dose at the end of day, not in but in between the finish in talking and it start in the lab and they will have

22
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:51,129
the second part of the of the lab and probably will need to explain a few things.

23
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:56,950
How about the second part of the lab? So it's not true that it will take will look, but not as much as today.

24
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:09,040
Okay. So that's that's kind of like the outline. So I was always, yes, access to this module, but I didn't publish it.

25
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:21,610
I'm sorry. Oh.

26
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,100
So see, everything else is fabulous. But I forgot to put this and.

27
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,980
No, no, this is the. No, this is the is another one. What is this thing?

28
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,520
Okay. Oh, good.

29
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,200
Now you have access. Sorry about that. Yeah.

30
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,950
I mean, there were no mandatory events this week, so you didn't need to to access this.

31
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,170
Okay. Thank you for letting me know. Okay.

32
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:07,169
So I, um, I always like to see an anecdote of biomarkers with this joke because this actually was my first project as a student.

33
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:16,680
Actually, I started even before starting my, my Ph.D. and was working as a cesspool drummer for my advisor.

34
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:23,190
And I was eager to kind of like do all sorts of complicated analysis and, you know,

35
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:28,620
going to lie looking at diet, you know, nutrition and diabetes associations and things like that.

36
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:34,469
And then the first kind of like I was doing a lot, helping with a lot of analysis for other people.

37
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:41,760
But this was going to be my first project. So my first project I met with her and then she told me, Oh,

38
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:47,730
you're going to look at correlations between dietary fatty acids and adipose tissue fatty acids.

39
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:59,430
And I thought, what you know, so what it is like and just the thing that correlation is not like and um, and initially after that,

40
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:06,720
okay, well, I mean, she did my version of any kind of really saying anything about kind of like, I don't want to do this.

41
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:16,920
But actually it was interesting because later, I mean, as I started going into the topic, I realized that it is not a simple analysis was simple.

42
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,309
It was just correlations. That's all I have to ask for something things.

43
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,370
Right. But the topic was fascinating actually.

44
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:33,350
And actually it became my first page of a paper and also became one of my main line of research in the next year.

45
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,019
So. So yeah, it looks like, wow, this is boring.

46
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,150
But believe me, it's not actually there is a lot of kind of like interesting things about biomarkers.

47
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:52,110
So, so one of the things is that you have seen this is like now like three times, right?

48
00:05:53,220 --> 00:06:01,200
At least three times because we were discussing the different ways that we can kind of like evaluate nutritional status in populations.

49
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:08,340
And of course we spend a lot of time and kind of like talking about food intake with the questionnaires, right?

50
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:12,300
And then we also spend some time on body composition with anthropometric.

51
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:18,550
So now, now we found time to look at the biochemical kind of like the volume markers there.

52
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:26,400
And then because that's the other way of looking at the nutritional status of, of populations, right?

53
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:34,799
So, so the first thing is that clarify the concept of biomarker because the world

54
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,930
biomarker is actually used in the scientific literature in a very wide way.

55
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:47,610
When we are in nutrition, many times we think about kind of like a biomarker of nutrient indeed,

56
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,340
because that's what we get about research kind of like I mean,

57
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:58,440
we really want to use something that we measure in the body as a proxy of what people are eating, right?

58
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:10,020
So but also biomarkers in a more general kind of like way I use as kind of like just biochemical indicators of this is risk centered, right?

59
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:15,870
So people talk about biomarkers above when they talk about anything that you can measure in blood or in dishes,

60
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,450
not only noodles or other things, then nutrients, right?

61
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:25,620
So so you have to be careful about that because I mean, some people will talk about how many people naturally will probably talk about biomarkers.

62
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,690
They don't they don't mean biomarkers of nutrients.

63
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,070
Right.

64
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:40,170
So today we are going to focus mostly on kind of like biomarkers of nutrient intake because that's where the disease and nutrition and epidemiologic.

65
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:48,690
Right. So so how can you I mean, what can you do with biochemical indicators of biomarkers?

66
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:53,280
I mean, first, you will use them as a surrogate for dietary intake, right?

67
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:02,790
So it's a proxy. And usually you do that when you cannot measure diet properly with the other cheaper methods, right?

68
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:08,519
Like with a few. And that happens, for example, when you have inaccurate food composition tables.

69
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,800
So you're interested in certain nutrients that you know that the competition tables are going to be terrible if, for example,

70
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:22,120
selenium because it changes a lot because of the soil and that cannot be captured because of with a with a difficult position.

71
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,620
So that's something that it will be better to measure in disease.

72
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:32,929
Right. Also, when you have situations of recall bias, if, for example,

73
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:37,980
if you're in a situation that you have case control studies and then you are asking diet.

74
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:47,250
Kind of like what's your usual diet cases? You know, that cases are going to recall differentially uncontrolled.

75
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:52,600
Right. That's that's what got you the recall bias because cases just had the disease.

76
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:58,700
I mean, they are very concerned about what they have. And they may remember differently than the controls.

77
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,420
The controls are just healthy and then they don't care so much about their diet.

78
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,360
Right. So when there is differential recall between cases and controls,

79
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,190
clearly there's going to be bias and there's nothing you can really do to compensate for that bias with the dietary information.

80
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:21,980
So in that situation, using biomarkers would be ideal because the issues are not going to remember differently.

81
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,470
Right. So it is what it is. I mean, you take blood, you take adipose and you measure that.

82
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:40,670
Right. And then also many times you use the biochemical indicators and particularly in, um, in feeding trials when you want to measure compliance.

83
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:50,600
Right. Like, for example, if you are doing a clinical trial on, I don't know, omega three fatty acid supplement.

84
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:58,820
So one way of checking compliance, see if people are really taking the pills is taking the omega three fatty acids and increasing in their blood.

85
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:08,090
Right. So that's that's one way. So those those are one I mean, the three main kind of like uses,

86
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:15,529
but also we use biomarkers a lot to validate other forms of diet assessment in particular

87
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:21,649
when we have a few that we want to evaluate and remember that there are many cues there.

88
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,309
But the fifth cues are always specific for the population.

89
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,090
So you have a new population, then you will need to create and you have a few.

90
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,910
I mean sometimes the population is very similar to another one.

91
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:37,100
You can use one that is already existent, but if not, then you will have to create your own excuse.

92
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:44,690
And any time you create a questionnaire, no matter if it's I mean, this is a general thing for population scientists, right?

93
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:49,130
I mean, it can be for diet, for smoking, for stress, for whatever.

94
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:54,800
You have to validate that questionnaire because you have to make sure that your question is measured in what are supposed to measure.

95
00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:02,510
Now, how do you know if your questionnaire is measured in what is supposed to measure using an objective measure like the biomarkers?

96
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:11,360
Right. So you can go ahead and you can use like a small study population because the validation studies are expensive.

97
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:18,440
And then you can basically collect the diet information, collect the biomarker, and then see if those things are more or less the same.

98
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,260
Right. So those are kind of like the those are the things that we use for biomarkers.

99
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:30,680
Now, it's also like important to distinguish between the types of biomarkers,

100
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,630
although most of the biomarkers that you use, most of them is concentration biomarkers.

101
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:42,050
There are a few recovery biomarkers which basically are the only ones that really there is a I mean,

102
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:49,040
the relationship between the values of the market and the dietary intake is it can be quantified in absolute terms.

103
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:57,320
So is it really reflecting absolute terms of which is would be great if everything would be like that.

104
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:06,860
But but that that only happens with, for example, during a reading of a protein and then they label water for calories for then everything they write.

105
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,180
Most of the biomarkers that we usually use are concentration biomarkers.

106
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:20,809
So there is a correlation between dietary intake and concentration, but there is you cannot kind of lay this bridge that aside as an absolute intake.

107
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:27,470
So the idea is that you will use those for ranking so that people who are in the top

108
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,790
of the concentration of the biomarkers are supposed to be in the top of the nutrient.

109
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:40,470
But you cannot say that 50 I don't know, 15% of linoleic in their blood corresponds to 30 grams of.

110
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:49,070
But are making up those numbers, of course. And one example is all the fatty acids, actually, that we will see today.

111
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:57,020
Okay. So what are the requirements of a biochemical marker to be a good biomarker?

112
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:04,430
Because not everything you measure in your tissues is necessarily reflected in your intake.

113
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:09,080
Right. And one example that I can give you is like glucose.

114
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:15,020
Right. If you measure your glucose in blood, is glucose in blood reflecting your glucose intake.

115
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,340
I see. I know. And I yes.

116
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:30,710
Well, I mean, in some ways, but it to a certain extent, I mean, when you have carbohydrates, your glucose is going to increase in in in blood,

117
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:37,930
but is not I mean, because you don't you don't take in workouts, which they can also you take out of this.

118
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:48,330
That could be a system and it could be glucose reflecting carbohydrate intake, but glucose is under homeostatic control.

119
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,380
I mean, the moment that glucose increases insulin comes in, then it will be present, right?

120
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,029
So then it's not really I mean,

121
00:13:54,030 --> 00:14:04,019
we cannot really use the glucose in blood to measure to to rank people as you have a high carbohydrate intake or low carbohydrate like,

122
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:12,580
for example, would be like you're taking tons and tons of sugar because they're eating literally because they're consuming.

123
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,470
Yeah. And then but you're looking to process probably seven below.

124
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,100
Yeah. Because they're doing a lot of physical food this early and everything is going to.

125
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,070
Yeah, exactly. So glucose we can use. Right.

126
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:31,799
So, so one of the important things is that is actually sensitive to intake in a way that it goes in a more or less linear way.

127
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:37,500
So the more you eat, the more you see in in tissues which that to happen with.

128
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:51,360
The other very important thing is kind of like thinking about the range of intake because sometimes and this is very important because remember

129
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:59,010
I've I've been telling you that the problem of a statin diet is the sometimes the variability of diet in certain populations is not that high.

130
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:05,280
So if people more or less in the same way, in particular, either based on the culture, of course,

131
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:10,700
but like, I don't know, in Latin America countries, people eat a lot of rice and beans.

132
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,940
Right. So it must people are eating rice and beans almost every day.

133
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,049
Then it will be very difficult to study the effect of rice and beans on anything.

134
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,250
Right. Because most people is the same as I told you at the beginning.

135
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:29,700
Like if everyone smokes, then we cannot really we wouldn't have a good reference because basically everyone smoking, right?

136
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,660
So with if I am might get the same thing happen.

137
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,100
If the range of intake is very narrow,

138
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:46,110
the biomarker kind of like that is not going to be that sensitive to that range of intake because I mean, there's always error, right?

139
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,550
So then it's kind of like it may increase a little bit, but not enough to see a correlation.

140
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:58,710
And remember what I told you, that the particular the correlation coefficient is that very sensitive to the, to the variability of the range.

141
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:04,710
Right. So then kind of like you will have very low correlation coefficients and you will think that, oh, my biomarker is not really good.

142
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:15,180
Well maybe the biomarker is okay. But in all the population to have a larger range of also you have to think about that.

143
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:23,460
Not everything, I mean not everything that you measure in your tissues is because what you ate.

144
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:28,680
I mean, there are other factors that affect the tissue levels starting with metabolism.

145
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,860
Right. And people have different metabolism, right?

146
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,629
So then some people will metabolize it quickly, some people not that need admission to biomarker.

147
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:40,710
Right. And there are other things like, for example, things like smoking.

148
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,790
Smoking, for example, will decrease the concentration of antioxidants in blood.

149
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:51,100
Right. Yes. Because you smoke, not because you are necessarily eating a low amount of blood.

150
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:57,660
Right. So that there are many things there are, of course, genetic factors that will change that.

151
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:03,660
So then you have to think about that is like there's not a perfect correlation between your intake and your tissue

152
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:14,010
levels because there are some factors that affect kind of like these low levels and of course bioavailability,

153
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:18,150
right? Kind of like, you know, that not everything you read is absorbed, right?

154
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:26,679
And that changes by by people, right? Like you think about the typical example of either no B12 in the elderly, right?

155
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:33,150
So then when when people get old, then they start having issues in their stomach, right?

156
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,930
And then the Association of Vitamin B12 decreases a lot.

157
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,210
Right? So that's why they are kind of like prone to vitamin B12 deficiency, right.

158
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,320
And that doesn't mean that they are not having necessarily in a because I mean, many of them are not.

159
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:51,180
Right. But even among those who are having enough, they are not getting enough.

160
00:17:51,600 --> 00:18:01,290
They are not. I mean, the absorption is not enough. So then if you measure that in blood, you may get like a different kind of like picture, right?

161
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:08,330
Of course, that has different implications, maybe because what is important is how much vitamin B12 you absorb.

162
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,750
But if you are going to tell people, oh, you have to increase your intake of vitamin B12,

163
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,049
well, maybe I have to do something else because I'm not absorbing it.

164
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:22,620
Right. So so yeah. So those are some of the things related to sensitive to intake, right?

165
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:32,160
The second thing, and this is very important is time integration because remember that we are always concerned about long term intake, right?

166
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,300
I mean, I don't care what you said yesterday because what you made yesterday maybe is not representative of.

167
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:44,450
Usual habitual dietary intake. So I'm really concerned about your long term intake, not so much your shoulder.

168
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,559
I mean, there are some studies that may be kind of like interested in the short term,

169
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,800
but most epidemiological studies are interested in the long term.

170
00:18:51,860 --> 00:19:00,380
Right. And the issue with that integration is that it depends a lot in the biological sample that you are testing.

171
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:08,230
So there are some biological samples that will reflect more long term intake, and those are more short the short term intake.

172
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,750
I will talk more about that when we go into it.

173
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:17,690
But if you think about measuring fatty acids in plasma or blood, well, do you think that you are measuring?

174
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:37,490
I mean, based on what you know about the absorption of fatty acids and kind of like how you measuring would you wait a year ago shirt and shorts?

175
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,170
Yeah, it's more like what you eat yesterday and today. Right.

176
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,579
So I mean, it goes very fast, right?

177
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:49,310
So it's kind of like you you eat your digest those things and those things will appear in your blood very quickly.

178
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,710
Right. So is that right? You think about red blood cells.

179
00:19:54,770 --> 00:20:00,290
What do you think that red blood cells are supposed to be reflecting? Remember, fatty acids are in the memories of the red blood cells.

180
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:08,540
So you can measure them in the memories and the redness, maybe through the lifespan of the red blood cells.

181
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,160
So yeah, it's up to, I think three months.

182
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:20,090
No. Yeah. I want to live a social. Yeah. Since interior resources are supposed to be measured in more like months.

183
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,110
So it's not a very long time, but it's better than short.

184
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:28,280
Then we will see something later about that.

185
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:37,100
But anyway, the idea is that again, if indeed you measure red blood cells because the red blood cells have that kind of like lifespan,

186
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:41,810
that is longer than you should with leather. Now how about adipose tissue?

187
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:47,220
You don't need to know that. But what is your sense is.

188
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:54,360
Yeah, because adipose tissue has this low turnover. Right. So then because of that and this this I will tell you about that later.

189
00:20:54,380 --> 00:21:02,720
But this is this classical study conducted in the forties that typical say that we wouldn't be able to conduct now.

190
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,540
Right. And then also you have a captive population in Western now, I think in a nursing home or something like that.

191
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:17,740
So then they gave some people the usual cafeteria food that at the time was super high saturated fat, I think.

192
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:25,640
I mean, the the and we're talking about the forties and fifties and then they gave other people was a randomized controlled trial.

193
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,990
They gave them a diet high in polyunsaturated fat.

194
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,949
Right. So assuming that that was much healthier.

195
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:42,679
Right. So then when they were they collected adipose tissue biopsies and when they were collecting the first ones,

196
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,310
I mean, in, in the first baseline, they didn't see any difference of course.

197
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:52,010
But even one year later they didn't see any difference. And they were like, Oh, this is interesting.

198
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:56,480
But then two years later, actually, they starting they saw the difference there.

199
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:02,810
So actually that's how they calculated and that's what people say that the turnover is more like two years.

200
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,200
They did it for leaner leg. They didn't do it for all the fatty acids.

201
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,550
But anyway, so I mean, that's all the various is maybe have the similar turnover.

202
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,600
But anyway, so this is way because now we know that adipose tissue,

203
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:20,750
basically whatever we measured in our bodies today is reflecting what we were eating two years ago,

204
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,559
which again, we are not talking about long term intake of your whole life.

205
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,310
I mean, that would be impossible. But two years is is pretty good, right?

206
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,060
I mean, compared with a few months or days is pretty good.

207
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:36,170
Now, the issue is that collecting adipose tissue is not that easy.

208
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:40,580
Right. But anyway, but there are other things that are very easy to collect.

209
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,880
And actually also long term. The problem is that you cannot measure everything in those.

210
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:52,580
Right. But you can measure that selenium and also some toxic gas in here and mess.

211
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:59,959
Right. And because they take time to grow, then you are measuring whatever is accumulating in them, then they starting growing.

212
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,710
Right. So those are good also for certain.

213
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:18,200
Right. Okay. So, so one thing also that you have to think about and I already talk about that is about all the non dietary determinants of biomarkers.

214
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:26,060
Right. You have to think, you have to take that into account because maybe you can do something to go right for that in your analysis.

215
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:33,709
So the same as when you are kind of like, remember I'm always telling you that total energy intake introduces a strenuous variation, right?

216
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:39,530
And that's why one of the reasons to adjust for total energy intake is because to remove that extraneous radiation.

217
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:47,290
So then you can do the same with the biomarkers. I mean think about the things that are non dietary determinants and try to remove those.

218
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:54,560
And for example, this is this is a graph showing I mean, this is this made up of course,

219
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,309
but there is a linear correlation between cholesterol and vitamin E.

220
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:02,420
Why? Because vitamin D is a fat soluble diet.

221
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:09,049
So a vitamin. So the the more cholesterol you have, the more vitamin E you may have.

222
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:13,310
And, you know, because the more vitamin E you measure. Right. That is because you have a lot of cholesterol.

223
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:22,790
Right. So then if you go red for baths, when you are doing your correlation between I mean, let's say that you're using vitamin D to.

224
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,470
Validate your for frequency questionnaire.

225
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:37,750
And I look at the correlation between my food frequency estimate of vitamin E and my plasma vitamin E when I do a good correlation,

226
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:42,850
I didn't point to health, which is almost nothing, but I know no correlation.

227
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:48,790
But if I adjust for cholesterol, then I get point 28, which is not great either.

228
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:56,259
But you know, I told you that in addition to being the elderly, that's probably good enough going to handle them error that we have.

229
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:00,130
Right. But you can see that that is a huge increase.

230
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,650
So basically, this is like what we do when we adjust for total energy intake that will remove the energy of radiation.

231
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:12,430
So in this situation, we have identified one source of the strange radiation, which in this case would be cholesterol.

232
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:19,930
And then adjusting for that will help to see that actually there is a better correlation that if we don't adjust for that, okay.

233
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:28,030
There are also genetic determinants of biomarker levels like the one of the classical ones that we know,

234
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:33,579
we know from many years is there are genotype and folate levels.

235
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,060
And you can see here we said, for example,

236
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:43,990
basically you can see that being homozygous for by genotype means that you would have lower levels of folate.

237
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:49,809
So so that's that's a problem because basically you probably will have to adjust for that too,

238
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:56,500
because otherwise you are not really I mean, it's not reflecting essentially your nutrient intake.

239
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:02,920
I mean, you're not really thinking maybe the same, but because you're homozygous, you're will have lower levels of folate in your plasma.

240
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:09,489
Right. So then and remember that the purpose of the volume marker is to measure your intake.

241
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:16,090
I mean, it's true that you can say, well, no, I really care about how much folate people have in their, in the, in their body.

242
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:21,850
Then that's fine. That's another issue. And you know, and just for that, you just look at the eye and that graph right at that table.

243
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:28,140
But if you really want to classify people according to their nutrition, you cannot you have to do something with that genotype, right.

244
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:33,969
Because otherwise you will be misclassifying people. Right. You would think that all these people are having a low intake.

245
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:39,010
Awfully nice to have these. You know that and they say happen.

246
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:42,399
I mean, I give you many more examples.

247
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,260
This is also with fatty acids. This is gamma linolenic acid.

248
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:55,809
They are both omega six fatty acids. And these are these this is I do note that the polymorphism in in one of the they satirizes in the in

249
00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:04,780
the by the way coming from linoleic acid you first go to gamma linolenic this kind of like adding

250
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:13,870
double one and then this happened with a six the saturated release it it and then you go into and I

251
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:19,449
mean there are a few kind of like you I mean you're basically from the Linoleic and also Linolenic,

252
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:22,600
which are the essential fatty acids.

253
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,400
One is their body in fatty acids of the omega three fatty acids, and the other is the pine and fatty acid.

254
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:33,639
So they make a six. Then we have elongates and this had to this is to come up with longer fatty acids.

255
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,020
Right. And those are the body, the omega three and the omega six.

256
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:47,080
So those enzymes have polymorphisms and those polymorphisms actually affect the way that those fatty acids are inundated.

257
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:54,760
Right. So then you have to be careful about those because basically in the end, what happened is that when you particularly for arachidonic acid,

258
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:04,000
would you find in would you find in your tissues is not really reflecting your diet is reflecting your metabolism and your genetics.

259
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:11,970
So then maybe arachidonic acid is not a good biomarker of diet, so you shouldn't use it as a biomarker of diet, right?

260
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,550
So what are the advantages of biomarkers, what they are objective?

261
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:25,920
So you're going to have the problem of bias, right? Because I mean, they are not going to I mean, you can have an error, of course, in the lab,

262
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:30,670
this or whatever, but at least they are not kind of like recalling differentially.

263
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:35,650
They are good when there's no good food intake, they're available.

264
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:49,989
And also you can most kind of like big cohort studies have collected some type of of the specimens have loose

265
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:58,180
blood by and they have a stored I mean most of those studies have repositories that they have frozen blood there.

266
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:03,309
Right. So if you are interested in allies in the diet industry studies,

267
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:08,170
sometimes many of the studies didn't collect that information for whatever reason because they were not

268
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:13,540
interested in initially because there were not enough nutritional epidemiologist pushing to collect it.

269
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,220
So they don't have any of that information.

270
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:22,510
But if you are really interested in something and they have a specimens, you can always get those specimens that at a store and analyze them.

271
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:29,080
Then you will have some information that that was collected in the in the past.

272
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,820
Right. And you can still use that. That's another advantage.

273
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:39,299
What are the disadvantages that not always they are sensitive, very sensitive to intake depending on their face.

274
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:47,250
I told you that in in some instances, depending on the range of that bending on the known and dietary determinants and so on,

275
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:58,290
sometimes the time integration is not the way you want because most of the time the thing that is more readily available is blood.

276
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,580
And we know that most of the things we measure in bladder reflecting just short term.

277
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:08,759
Right. That doesn't mean that you're going to use it, because for certain things you can assume,

278
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:14,100
you can make the assumption that your short term intake on certain things is a proxy of your long term ending.

279
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:18,059
Right. And we will see examples of that. So it's not that you cannot use it.

280
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:26,310
That clearly is a limitation. Another huge disadvantage is that incredibly expensive, right?

281
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,639
You have to analyze those things are expensive.

282
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:36,300
And when you have large populations since kind of like I mean, you may end up in a huge battle.

283
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,379
Right. They are not available for many nutrients.

284
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:46,440
So they are not I mean, for fatty acids, for example, there are many biomarkers that are raised by for carbohydrates.

285
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:54,960
They are not really good biomarkers. And so and the specimens that banana, that specimen, specimen you want to get,

286
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:01,349
they are difficult to tame because even the most simple one, which is kind of like maybe blood is is difficult.

287
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:04,709
Right. Not to mention adipose Synthes.

288
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:07,860
I mean, there are all the things like saliva. Saliva is easy.

289
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:15,340
But so, I mean, this is something that not all participants in all the studies were willing to give.

290
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,650
Right. I mean, many participants are okay with questionnaires, but they don't want to give you an example.

291
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:29,520
Right. Yeah. Okay. There are also some studies and considerations that you had to think about when you collect biomarkers.

292
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:37,170
Like, for example, there may be seasonal timing, like if you are studying vitamin C or vitamin D, for example,

293
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:42,300
and we were studying vitamin D, clearly, depending on the system is going to change a lot because it's coming from the sun.

294
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:53,150
But the time of the day is going to affect, right, because having some biomarkers will be absorbed right away and from from the news.

295
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:59,159
Right. You had to be careful about potential contamination because like, for example, I mean,

296
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:04,260
some of the tools that you use, some have some kind of like covers and things like that,

297
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:11,370
have something that may have something that may contaminate the thing that you want to study less resemble seeing or things like that.

298
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:20,459
And also you have to think about you are going to store them and usually you always store them at least, at least for a few weeks.

299
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:25,500
Because, I mean, you very readily, you collect the specimens and you analyze them right away.

300
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:32,040
Right. And sometimes even for longer. Right. So some things will degrade.

301
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:39,720
So then you have to be careful, of course. I mean, you have to store them at least a minority, but even a minority, they can degrade.

302
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:44,940
And also some things are also light sensitive like carotene, additionally very light sensitive.

303
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,749
So you have to be careful.

304
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:53,660
So they have every biomarker a suspicion and then you have to you have to know about that biomarker in order to be able to to use it later.

305
00:32:53,670 --> 00:33:04,799
Right. One one problem that we had, for example, is something that we were showing when we were working with our fatty acids.

306
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:11,970
We were looking at the evaluation of kind of like different biomarkers in different theses.

307
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:20,730
And we were trying to evaluate whole blood, not only because most people use plasma or even the black, they fractions in plasma for fatty acids.

308
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:26,879
And we were trying to show them actually you use whole that whole body, some mix of plasma and red blood cells.

309
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:33,930
Right. So because both are associated, I mean, for ranking people, I mean, you can use them in the study in in this type of relationship,

310
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:41,670
we were kind of like trying to analyze that whole blood, comparing with plasma, red blood cells and adipose and see which biomarker was better.

311
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:47,519
Right. And one of the criticisms that we had from the reviewers was about the red blood cells,

312
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,630
because our red blood cells were not really that good of a biomarker.

313
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:55,770
And the criticisms were all what happened with red blood cells is that your biomarkers,

314
00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:00,910
your fatty acids, probably have been degraded because of the weaker hemoglobin.

315
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,530
And and they don't homolog will degrade those fatty acids.

316
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:12,689
Right. And we show them this kind of language use for three fatty acids and nicasio linoleic acid.

317
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:18,510
And we were doing repeated measures in some controls for quality control.

318
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:23,100
And then what do you see here? Do you see any. Aggravation.

319
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:34,879
No. I mean, of course there is there are peaks because there is ever much to watch.

320
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,090
Right. But it's pretty flat. The trends pretty flat for the three of them.

321
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:48,200
Right. And we have like a few years that like at least three years and we didn't convince the reviewers and we had to get rid of the information.

322
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,040
But anyway, so, so you had to think about that for the future.

323
00:34:52,040 --> 00:35:00,919
And because you are doing this type of analysis or the lab analysis considerations is kind of like sometimes, I mean,

324
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:07,549
we tend to think that the lab is perfect because it's kind of it's like we tend to think like whatever people tell you is so.

325
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:11,360
So whatever is coming from the lab is great and it's not true.

326
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:17,010
I mean, I mean, whatever is coming from the lab, it can be also kind of low, you know, garbage.

327
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:24,649
Right. So it's not if you don't use the proper techniques or or if there are sometimes there are many problems in the lab.

328
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:35,840
Right. So so one way of minimizing errors in the lab, of course, is as blindly because I mean, otherwise you can get this symbiosis.

329
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:45,020
And then if it's doing more than one, one single run and then of course, always running, kind of like doing everything right in between run analysis.

330
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:51,890
So you can get a coefficient of variation because that shows how well you are kind of like energy in that if you have a huge coefficient of variation,

331
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:57,380
you know that you cannot really rely so much on that fatty acid or that nutrient.

332
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,969
But if you are, you have kind of like a small cohesion of operation.

333
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:05,330
Do see, okay, yeah. They some kind of like error like everything, but it is pretty stable, right?

334
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,710
So they are in the lab.

335
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:14,950
We are usually very rigorous quality control standards both internally and externally will allow you to kind of like compensate for that.

336
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:22,450
And usually when you send things to a lab, usually they, they, those is probably what is the issue because you're paying a lot of money.

337
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:31,760
Right. Anyway, so let me let me tell you a little bit about the biomarkers of fatty acid intake, because that's what I've been working on.

338
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:39,350
Most fatty acids can be measured almost in anything because I mean, all I mean,

339
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,180
any in any cell in the body because all cells have fatty acids, you know, in the membrane.

340
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,310
Right. So but the most kind of readily available is clearly in blood.

341
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:54,170
But even within the lab, there are many different ways of analyzing them.

342
00:36:54,170 --> 00:37:00,080
You can analyze them in plasma. You can either massively for analysis, you can always anything in resources or even in blood for this.

343
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:05,480
And we think less. You can actually go even deeper and analyze the different fractions.

344
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,710
You can analyze the ones from the cholesterol, especially phospholipids and the dialysis.

345
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:13,549
And they have different meanings. I mean, they have different kind of light.

346
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:20,240
I mean, the ratio and different kind of like sometimes they some of them relate better with nutrient intake than all that.

347
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:24,139
Of course, what I told you is that anything that has cell membranes,

348
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:29,120
we have dinosaur chick cells, which is kind of like something that will go into these.

349
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:40,550
But on the best one for fatty acids definitely is adipose tissue, as I told you before, because adipose tissue basically reflects long term intake.

350
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:48,950
And I already told you this is their famous data on classical seminal paper showing that the turnover is more or less like two years.

351
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,549
This is when I my whole life I've been telling people about that.

352
00:37:55,550 --> 00:38:00,470
We were collecting adipose tissue samples from people from Costa Rica.

353
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:05,240
And many times people were like completely like what?

354
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:10,819
I mean, people gave you adipose tissue and it's because we were seeing adipose tissue biopsies and

355
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:16,100
the biopsy work sounds like you're putting an animal in your liver and it's not like that.

356
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:21,829
Right? So then basically what you are taking in adipose tissue, really a very small amount from the upper buttock,

357
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:26,420
which is a place that usually you have a reasonably amount of fat, right?

358
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:34,080
So and of course you name the area with and things like that and it's actually not, not, not is not painful, believe me.

359
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:40,760
It is not painful actually. There were some people who were willing to give adipose tissue were not blood for that reason.

360
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:46,309
They were more scared about blood than I think is because you are not seeing anything because this is from they are provocative.

361
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:50,840
Like I want to see what they are thinking. So it is really a very small amount.

362
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:56,209
So and then of course the needles even though it looks like a huge they are this

363
00:38:56,210 --> 00:39:01,730
nice and it this that actually you won't even notice so so this is the small amount

364
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:09,380
that you need to do analyze those things and then the although I already told you

365
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:14,320
that what a specimen is better and I tell you this is better because is measuring.

366
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:21,280
Yes. And you can really get adipose tissue, then get red blood cells, and if not,

367
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:26,090
then plasma will be okay because we're interested in more long term intake.

368
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:38,550
There was this paper a few years ago that actually showed that the whole thing of red lasers was not going to play that role.

369
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:44,050
Right. So you may think that the glasses should be reflected mad.

370
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:48,459
But what they did here is that they were. This is this what I read in this study.

371
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:53,350
They were giving the information to people and they were measured in based.

372
00:39:53,350 --> 00:40:00,790
Right. And then you can see and finally you have the triglycerides from plasma in panel.

373
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:05,510
B, you have phospholipids in panel. C, you have got a stressors in panel.

374
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:09,130
You have platelets and in panel you have the red blood cells.

375
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:17,630
Right. And what you see here. And these are live.

376
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,610
This is the same skin that we've got.

377
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:30,770
So basically, I mean, what I see is that as you start giving people more linearly, then, you know, they will increase in all of them.

378
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:35,390
Right. And then at some point you start seeing some plateau on.

379
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:40,969
I think they stop being in a like assembly here. So then in some places you're seeing that is decreasing.

380
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:44,810
Some people are kind of like like not. Right. Which make sense.

381
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,480
But but the first part actually, I mean,

382
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,850
the plateau makes sense because at some point your tissues get saturated, you know, that you are kind of like,

383
00:40:52,850 --> 00:41:03,360
you know, getting and this is a usual thing with I this now you are always going to see the extent of the station getting colder,

384
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:08,390
their whole range of intake. You are probably going to see something like that.

385
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:16,040
Right. So it is I suggest that with people who have pretty low intake and you're still kind of looking at people who are very high intake,

386
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:22,940
you're going to see more like a severe relationship. But at some point they're probably going to enter into some sort of plateau because

387
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:30,740
you know that more and more and more is going to be necessarily this thing.

388
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,070
Right. So then those those various can go somewhere else.

389
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:42,049
And that's that's true. For example, for water soluble vitamins, clearly.

390
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,730
I mean, there to just be them.

391
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:51,100
I mean, basically, you may eat a lot with supplements, but, you know, they are not going to stay in your blood or your dishes.

392
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:58,940
Right. You just get rid of those. So but the going back to the issue here is that these are the red blood cells.

393
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:06,620
And what you can see here is that even in the red cells, it's increasing the first days.

394
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,550
And we were saying, oh, we should see like.

395
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:16,969
No, I mean, according to what we know about the lifespan of red blood cells, we shouldn't see that increase.

396
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:22,340
We should see like there's nothing. And then three months later and increase with a new recklessness.

397
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,000
Right. So what's going on here? Right. Why? We're seeing this.

398
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:48,340
Well, because the body is very dynamic.

399
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:51,700
The blood is very dynamic. And there is a change of fatty acids.

400
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:56,340
Right. So that's what we believe that is happening here.

401
00:42:56,350 --> 00:43:01,360
Right. So there is no blood is not the red blood cells that are already circulating also

402
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:08,570
get fatty acids from all the plasma lipoproteins and that's why you see increase.

403
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:15,420
Quigley I mean, it's true that that is the case not lessened because it's like this, right?

404
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:22,120
So it stays for longer. So it's still kind of like you can still say that will replace it will be a little better, like more long term.

405
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:25,690
But it's not that that kind of like as we thought.

406
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:29,830
Right. So it's kind of like this. Well, I mean, this is still is change, right?

407
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:41,230
Anyway, so the other important thing with fatty acids is that not all fatty acids are going to be good biomarkers of dietary fat intake.

408
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:46,990
Why? Because we can make fatty acids, right? We we we can make fatty acids from scratch.

409
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:51,570
From scratch, but yeah. From strong carbohydrate with some energy.

410
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:55,930
So we can make saturated fat and we can make more, etc.

411
00:43:55,950 --> 00:44:05,490
But we are very good at making those. So the ones that are good biomarkers are the ones that are not indigenously synthesized from carbohydrates.

412
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:09,880
They some they bothersome carbohydrates.

413
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:17,950
So so those are the only three and then six.

414
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:23,739
But mostly they actually they're the essential ones, the bottom fatty acids, Linoleic and Asselin.

415
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:27,640
Our because those are the ones that we cannot make them we really need to get from diet.

416
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:32,049
The other one we actually I mean, we can make money for linoleic.

417
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:35,740
We can make it from from left to right.

418
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,200
So then it's kind of like those are probably not that good.

419
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:47,080
Now what happens with the long change fatty acids from the ones that are usually from fish, we can actually make them from Alpha Linolenic.

420
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:52,150
If you follow the pathway, you can make them because the pathway is very tightly regulated.

421
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:58,150
You can still use them as biomarkers of intake because if people have a high intake of fish,

422
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:03,680
they are going to be higher in their tissues to regardless of they of that, we can make them right.

423
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:08,950
So that's kind of like the only exception to them to the to the fat on there.

424
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:15,250
Oh, that would be amazing. Trans fatty acids are also ones that are completely.

425
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:24,130
So generally we don't make trans. Actually, that's why trans are so bad because basically we don't know how to deal with trans double ones.

426
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,910
We only deal with sea level one. Right.

427
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:36,040
And then also the old number, for instance, from the products, usually the saturated fatty acids there, 15.0, 17.0.

428
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:46,050
Also, those are kind of like those are coming from ruminant fat usually because we we don't we are too fat to that then.

429
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:50,860
Right. So that's why the fatty acids are usually 12, 14, 16, 18.

430
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:54,940
So they 15 and the 17 are kind of like, look, we we don't do those.

431
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:58,600
I mean, we can still elongate them. We can take a 15 and then I'll get it 17.

432
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,090
But, but it's not kind of like they are also coming in small amount.

433
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:12,070
So kind of like usually those can be used as biomarkers of dairy, but that's because they come from the women.

434
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:19,150
So, so this is an example of the trans fatty acids.

435
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:29,070
And I know that trans fatty acids is no longer a huge thing, which is wonderful because finally we got rid of them in the in the in the food supply.

436
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:38,000
But but in the past, there were things like Crisco that was full of trans fatty acids because was hydrogenated fats.

437
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:44,710
Right. The trans fatty acids happened naturally in certain things like ruminant fat.

438
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:50,380
So you can find them in the MC 61 trans or you can find them in red meat.

439
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:55,840
Mean in beef meat. Right. So like they're eating one.

440
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:07,900
But then kind of like the most harmful of the most problematic are the ones coming from the hydrogenation of olives, from the industry.

441
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:14,169
And the problem is that those type of fats were the fact that the industry was using also to do kind

442
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:19,210
of like to make cookies and to fry French fries and things like that in the fast food industry.

443
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:24,340
So basically we're like ten years ago we were flooded with trans fatty acids, right?

444
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:32,790
So that was like in this country and in many other countries in Europe saw in other countries, which is interesting,

445
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,390
like because we are going to use that kind of like information from the Costa Rican,

446
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:41,850
how to study the trans fatty acids were actually coming from China, you know.

447
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:53,560
Because it's soybean oil and pay attention to this because this is a story that you will need to answer one of your questions in their lab next week.

448
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:01,330
The soybean oil in Costa Rica was partially hydrogenated, so it was really high in trans fatty acids,

449
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:08,530
which didn't make any sense because you don't have to kind of like hydrogenated soybean oil.

450
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:13,320
It's true that soybean oil is very high enough.

451
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:20,860
Linolenic acid and alpha linoleic acid has three double bonds and the double bonds are very brown to oxidation.

452
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:23,800
So then the oil can get rancid.

453
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:33,440
But the truth is that, I mean, people usually when you use a cooking oil, I mean, it's not that stays in your shell for three years, right?

454
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:37,540
I mean, something that you use kind of like constantly in a way. So then you consume quickly.

455
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:45,760
So it I mean you shouldn't hydrogenated in this country never the industry hydrogenated.

456
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:52,540
So we know. So I wonder why I don't know why in Costa Rica we decided to hydrogenated they one.

457
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:55,840
One of the things that they said is that they will hydrogenated it because of

458
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,560
that issue of shelf life but maybe because the countries are I don't know.

459
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:07,209
I don't I don't know the the the motivations of the food industry.

460
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:15,430
But anyway, well, we found in the in the soybean oil in Costa Rica, there was very high interest fatty acids because it was partially hydrogenated.

461
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:23,590
And the promo shows that not only means that is high interest, but everybody's naphthalene on an egg because you're hydrogenated that unfortunately.

462
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:31,390
So so these are kind of like this is what I told you before about the pathway right.

463
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:36,090
For an alpha linolenic acid to to the the is more complicated.

464
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:44,649
So there are more things in between and coming from here to here replace some of that things not you know that say take a step but you can

465
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:54,190
see that of the legacy these they essentially are one that is coming from things like soybean oil or canola or from seeds in general or not.

466
00:49:54,220 --> 00:50:01,270
But but you can this hardly any longer until you going to EPA in the U.S. so you

467
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:06,790
can get your EPA and DHEA from Alpha Linolenic or you can get it from fish.

468
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,960
Right. Which is the most efficient way of getting it from fish.

469
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:17,440
Because for this, by the way, yes, it just like algae also contains.

470
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:24,130
JJ Yes, yes, yes. Well, the fish that technically the most efficient way to get it would be algae.

471
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:27,540
Oh, yeah, you're right. Yeah. But.

472
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:33,430
And it will be more sustainable. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, but I want to make that point because people are like, no, you have to.

473
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:37,680
You said actually until now you have. Yeah, that's a very good point.

474
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:43,200
But unfortunately is not that well understood and people don't eat it again.

475
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:51,430
Yeah. So kind of like yeah, I'm, I'm not saying that people should increase any they go fish because I know it's not sustainable.

476
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:52,840
There's no fish in the world for everyone.

477
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:59,110
So that's why I was always actually very interested in this, partly because one of the things that we realize is that,

478
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:03,010
oh yeah, before everything we do, you have to eat fish because of those two things.

479
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:07,479
But actually you have to because I mean, you could be okay.

480
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:14,830
So then what you will you have to actually establish is how efficient is this bad with in certain situations, right?

481
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:21,490
So that's why at some point in my life I was studying genetic variation in that way to see if there was any difference.

482
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:28,930
The other thing is that there is also there are other sources of data. I mean, you can find the children in eggs.

483
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:34,150
I mean, there's there's something and and and in a small amount, you know, that,

484
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:38,510
you know, there for which I mean, there's not that it comes only from fish.

485
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:43,899
Right. And also, you learn a huge amount of that fatty as you see there.

486
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:51,190
Right. There's not like I mean, people are sometimes getting like these supplements that are super high in everything and in nutrition,

487
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:55,660
more of something good is not always better. You know that, right?

488
00:51:55,660 --> 00:52:02,860
So it's kind of like, remember the curve was I mean, you can go into the toxic levels which are no good or not necessarily toxic,

489
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:06,650
but maybe you're interfering with other nutrients by having too much of something, right?

490
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:11,320
So you had to find this kind of like nice equilibrium in there in the middle.

491
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:17,260
Okay, so this is the path for the omega three and this is the path for the omega six.

492
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:22,600
There are more complicated in the sense that actually people are always interested in studying.

493
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:35,140
They're happy only to see why. Because while I didn't tell you about these but this tiny carbon would be a and communication they are.

494
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:42,140
You remember from your biochemistry they are the substrates for the cautionary.

495
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:53,390
And you've got this kind of life of molecules that are like a very important inflammation in the in the in your body.

496
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:58,729
Now, sometimes we feel like, oh, inflammation is like, well, the best.

497
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:03,890
I mean, inflammation is go. That means that this is a normal physiological response.

498
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,080
Right. So they that get inflammation.

499
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:14,240
So you need them those and because you need those that way the pathways have tightly regulated because you cannot allow kind of like constant,

500
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:18,680
you know, increase in action is just because you are eating more of the body fatty acids.

501
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:29,120
Right. But the problem is, when you go into the into the chronic kind of like low grade inflammation, that that's what is a problem, right?

502
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:34,520
That's what is related to chronic disease. And that's why we we are concerned about these relationships.

503
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:40,160
But anyway, they is that this this is this is the definitely because of the kind of study.

504
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:47,570
And you can see that they may sources are telling us you to me in this situation they seem so benign

505
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:53,930
because I was the main the main cookie noise in Costa Rica at that point was serving on our bottom line.

506
00:53:53,960 --> 00:54:01,700
And palm oil is highly saturated. Fat has suddenly not even that much in but doesn't have any money by.

507
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:09,350
So we don't have a lot of linoleic acid and a lot of stuff. So then when we were looking at this,

508
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:19,920
we were like in relationship with this is from the diet from the with with the adipose tissue can do we see that the collision proportions was .32,

509
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:27,049
which is probably the highest correlation coefficient that I've seen in my life in nutrition, I mean, looking at a biomarker on a diet.

510
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:31,700
So this is, this is like, well, really for you it shows in your tissues.

511
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:42,530
That's why if you think about the diet, the resources of our academic muscle, they are mostly from animal products, in particular meat of fish.

512
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:47,810
You see the correlation of the diet with any so.

513
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,500
Zero. There's no correlation. Why?

514
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:57,150
Well, because these are up in the Newcastle.

515
00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:04,970
Basically, this argument is not really coming from this is morally kind of like coming from whatever comes from here,

516
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:08,550
from metabolism of whatever is metabolized into that.

517
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:17,970
So your tissue levels are not really reflecting what your diet intake in order for arachidonic acid to live in tissues to reflect your dietary intake.

518
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:24,780
You have to have people eat a lot of are actively gassy which is not the usual thing in a normal diet.

519
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:29,220
Right. So it is not a good biomarker for dietary intake.

520
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:41,070
Okay. So what are the advantages and disadvantages of biomarkers of the rough idea is well, the same as I told you for the general biomarkers.

521
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:46,650
The advantage is that they don't rely on memory, they are self report information the area.

522
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:53,820
So they are objective and the disadvantages is that they are affected by metabolism, genetic factors and they are measures at a relative measure.

523
00:55:53,830 --> 00:56:00,570
So this is a concentration biomarker, remember, so this is good for ranking but is not really reflecting the absolute intake of people, right?

524
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:07,889
This is just an example of how we measure the fatty acids. This is secretary and these are all the fatty acids.

525
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:15,450
And you can see that they are big, big one. I mean, these are the trans, but we have big peaks and lower peaks.

526
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:21,760
And then you can see like for example, for them they are the alpha linolenic is not any of them actually.

527
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:25,590
Those are not big, big society small base. So they are measured with much more error.

528
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:32,270
When you look at the omega six, you can see that they, you know, leg is a big, big.

529
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:38,610
So then you're mentioning with less, you have to think about those things when you use that information needed analysis.

530
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:46,140
Okay. And they said that this is just kind of like they look big, but they are not big, actually.

531
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:50,640
They are very small. Just this is a part because it's kind of like making it bigger.

532
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:56,820
So then you can see the 15 and 17, which are the ones that I told you that are good for the body for that.

533
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:06,299
Okay. So let me show you quickly the relationship between dietary linoleic, acid and adiposity,

534
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:14,670
something look at it in basic and this is my point 58 and this is actually when I do during the night,

535
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:23,310
the other one was the non I mean they were different from a lot of look at this, this is beautiful, right.

536
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:29,780
So remember we were presenting this in a conference and someone came, I say, Wow, it looks too good to be true.

537
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:34,290
It's kind of like they said that made it up. So we didn't.

538
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:41,790
I mean, it's a very nice linear relationship with that, kind of like a reasonable correlation coefficient for the nutritionist on that, right?

539
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:51,420
So, so clearly in that situation, you feel very confident that you can use your adipose tissue as a as a actually I feel

540
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:56,190
better with adipose than me than that I could have in the there has more error than they.

541
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:04,740
Right. But now look at this is the trans. So the trans actually was even a little higher, although I'm going to make a little here the beginning,

542
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:09,570
which may be because it is difficult to measure the thrashing device within this model here.

543
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:14,040
But also these are going to make more or less a nice trend, kind of like linear, right?

544
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:22,860
But now look at the alpha linolenic. Therefore, Linolenic is also kind of like nicely related.

545
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:28,680
The coalition is lower 6.35 and then you may be wondering why?

546
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:38,010
Because I mean, why not the same as there? I mean, it's still okay for nutrition but is no like 8.50 8.60 of the trans and they

547
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:43,559
those three things mostly come from the same source the soybean oil because

548
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:51,879
the soybean oil was the main source of linoleic acid the main source of acid and their main source of trans two because it was partially hydrogenated.

549
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:57,900
So why two of them are going to lead better measure of them than I reflected than the other.

550
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:12,090
To make it work or.

551
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:15,800
No, no, no. It was not like that. I mean, I could be, but it wasn't.

552
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:25,420
Okay. So let me tell you this story and pay attention again, because this is kind of like I'm going to ask you this in the lab.

553
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:31,339
So this is another kind of like analysis of this information.

554
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:40,280
But a little a few years later, when we were able to know that the one the first one is then only among 482 people,

555
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,340
because at that point we only have like 100 controls.

556
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:49,130
And then a few years later, when we recruited more people, we ended up with 2000 to 50, right?

557
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:54,320
So now look at this. Now it's really, really look at this correlation coefficient.

558
00:59:54,830 --> 01:00:00,979
So why is that we have that correlation coefficient. I mean that of course you can think well you have a larger sample size.

559
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:06,980
Well I mean the sample size is not going to increase the correlation, it will increase maybe the p value when they decreased.

560
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:12,379
But no, no, they couldn't. Then you may think like if you have a larger sample size, you have more variability.

561
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:17,270
So that will affect for sure. But the main reason is that will happen.

562
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:26,020
There were two things. One is that at this point we actually use the Soviet.

563
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:32,389
I mean, before we were using this soybean oil, you can apply from just a few samples from Costa Rica at this point.

564
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:37,480
We were using the soybean oil in for a few competition tables for calculating the diet.

565
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:48,139
We were using many samples that we collected from soybeans over the years to calculate the therefore linolenic in diet from the country.

566
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:59,300
Because if we use them, the ones from here clearly live on here have different levels because see, this is the show, you know, from the USA.

567
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:05,210
So you can see this is the amount of fighting organic and the amount of rice is kind of negligible.

568
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,850
This is a seminar focused habit that we had.

569
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:18,170
Some brands were low enough to make them somewhat medium and some were high, actually not more than the brands.

570
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:24,950
What the years what happened is that over the years the hydrogenation decreased.

571
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:32,300
So then when we were collecting the first batch of some, yet we had a huge amount of trans fatty acids,

572
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:38,210
which means that the alpha linoleic acid is going to be much lower.

573
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:43,370
Right? Because remember that you are hydrogenated acid, you're getting trans fatty acid.

574
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:48,860
You are getting, as we've also learned over the years, that decreased almost to zero.

575
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:56,389
Why that happened, we don't know because when we by the time we said all trans are bad,

576
01:01:56,390 --> 01:02:03,590
we thought with the ministry of how they say, oh yeah, we had to address the industry was already here or we already do that.

577
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:07,730
So I think it's like the food industry is always kind of like, Oh, this is going to be a problem.

578
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:10,940
We going to fix it, right? We don't know.

579
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:15,349
We never know. We had some colleagues who developed kind of like qualitative study,

580
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:20,300
interviewing people from the industry of academia and everyone trying to find out what happened.

581
01:02:20,810 --> 01:02:24,900
And it was kind of like a mystery because there was so much, you know,

582
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:33,860
distrust between the everyone in the in the nutrition field, then we don't know who was telling the truth or not anyway.

583
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:36,230
Well, is I mean, for us,

584
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:45,740
what this means is that you have to take into account changes in the food supply because you don't make changes in the food supply.

585
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:50,930
Then of course, decorations are not going to be good because you're misclassifying people.

586
01:02:50,930 --> 01:02:56,960
Right, if you are analyzing, are assuming that all the soybean oil in Costa Rica over the years is the same,

587
01:02:57,770 --> 01:03:01,910
then you are assigning people the same amount of olive oil in the clinic.

588
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:09,650
But their adipose tissue is showing you that no adipose tissue is showing that in the beginning it was lower.

589
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:14,050
But then as they decrease, the trans is becoming higher, right?

590
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:17,500
So then it's a problem of misclassification in a way, right?

591
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:24,770
So that's why we were able once we fixed that, we were able to see a much better correlation.

592
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:30,890
Okay. Okay.

593
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:40,250
So this is also with this comparison,

594
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:47,180
but I'll skip this and this is also kind of like you want to use a biomarker for some measure of compliance is work.

595
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:53,990
This is a graph showing kind of like studies in the studies that we were kind of

596
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,240
like really controlling the amount of diabetes recorded and the change in serum.

597
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:08,479
And then you can see that, yeah, they're more like you give them more like you see in tissues so you can use that.

598
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,470
And this is in cholesterol.

599
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:20,120
Let's, let's, let's stop here because I've been talking too much and let's have a break and then I'll tell you the last part quickly,

600
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:29,010
and then we will go into the into the LA. Okay. Until that monumental.

601
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:59,670
You should. She continued.

602
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:05,250
We're just looking into this decision.

603
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:16,500
Do you?

604
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:41,220
We don't know for sure.

605
01:08:57,650 --> 01:09:32,980
Oh, good. What I really got.

606
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:47,829
Very discreetly. Okay.

607
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:56,190
So the last thing I want to tell you about my diocese is that I already told you that we were talking about plasma, red blood cells, adipose tissue.

608
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,960
But what about all the other tissues? Right.

609
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:11,140
And actually, one of the problems with analyzing biomarkers and collecting information for biomarkers is that collecting the specimens is difficult.

610
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:16,050
People don't want to give you adipose tissue or blood for good reasons.

611
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:22,750
Right. I don't like to be pope either. So I'm I'm one of those that not like to give blood.

612
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:27,250
There's not a good reason why. How about cheek cells from saliva?

613
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:30,480
Because, I mean, saliva is something that I mean, it's pretty easy to get, right.

614
01:10:30,490 --> 01:10:33,610
So it's not kind of like I mean, maybe a little disgusting.

615
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:38,439
Right. But at least it's not I mean, you're not being bulk.

616
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:41,800
I mean, there's not painful. Right? So it's kind of like you just have to spit, right?

617
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:47,920
So so that was kind of like a hypothesis to kind of like trying to do this, this study.

618
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:53,360
And there have been some studies looking at cheap cell phone saliva with with some kind of like mixed results.

619
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:58,870
I'm going to show you some data from a long time ago when we did a pilot, I was a little disappointed,

620
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:07,360
but but we were kind of like we had 60 families in a four week intervention trial and participants in the global schoolchildren cohort,

621
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:11,229
and they were randomly assigned to receive a month's supply of either soybean oil,

622
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:15,700
which is high enough linolenic acid or sunflower that doesn't have any gasoline.

623
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:21,480
Right. And we think cells from saliva and finger prick blood samples to compare.

624
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:27,370
Right now, it's true that this is a kind of like pragmatic, brain controlled trial.

625
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:36,820
So this is not but is particularly I mean, this is like a real life trial because we're giving people just a month's supply of soybean oil,

626
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:43,240
assuming that they're going to use it, but maybe they will use it, maybe they will resell it,

627
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:48,069
or maybe they will just throw it away or maybe they will use it too much.

628
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:58,140
And we know from kind of like I remember one of the the kids were telling us all, my dad is fine everything now because it costs a lot of oil.

629
01:11:58,150 --> 01:12:05,020
So then before it wasn't really very much because oil is relatively expensive and now that has so much oil then is frying everything.

630
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:12,729
Right. So it was not really that the quality control, but at the same time it was like a real life experiment.

631
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:16,390
Right. Because it's like some people will consume more oil than others.

632
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:19,749
Right. And and we wanted to test that, actually.

633
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:27,190
So the main reason for doing this study was to test the the visibility of giving all people and see how they were going to use it.

634
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:31,390
And then as a side project, we were checking again, let's see for let's see,

635
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:39,880
let's use our filing clinic in blood as a compliance and then listed the advantage of this as

636
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:49,059
piggybacking on this particular study to see if chick cells from saliva would be also a good biomarker.

637
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:58,570
Right. So when we the intervention always so you can I mean we actually were very kind of like careful about

638
01:12:58,570 --> 01:13:04,270
choosing good always because we didn't want to have any problems with trans fatty acids in this context.

639
01:13:04,270 --> 01:13:08,920
Naturally, this was interesting because I mean, this was Colombia that was not Costa Rica.

640
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:15,700
We were a little concerned about finding soybean oil, hydrogenated based on our experience in Costa Rica.

641
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:19,719
So what happened in Colombia was actually the other way around.

642
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,930
So then soybean oil was not hydrogenated was not I mean,

643
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:30,040
some soybean bands had some trans but not huge amounts of trans or which was the one that had the most negligible.

644
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:36,250
But actually the one that had more trans was sunflower, which was like what?

645
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:43,360
I mean, we didn't know why because I mean, Sunflower doesn't have any alpha linolenic and they were not hydrogenated in the oil.

646
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:50,950
So we later learned that apparently, I mean, that there are some processes in their industry that because of temperature.

647
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:56,919
So whatever they do, sometimes it creates also trans fatty acids without doing hydrogenation.

648
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:59,950
Right. So then I think that was completely unexpected.

649
01:13:59,950 --> 01:14:02,529
I mean, we were and it was not that there were huge amounts,

650
01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:09,219
but there were some sunflower brands that have more trans that they should beyond the 2% that every choice recommended.

651
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:13,390
Right. So we chose very carefully the ones that had almost negligible amounts.

652
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:21,600
I mean, it's every time you measure anything, you are going to find the trans anyway because of those, because after all, oil is a process thing.

653
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:24,639
So then because of the temperatures, indeed there will always be something.

654
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:29,140
But but these are kind of like, okay, right. So we chose those oils.

655
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:36,129
And then when we were looking at the whole blood, the fingerprint blood, we actually so we were expecting,

656
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:39,130
which was great because that means that people were using the oils, right?

657
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:44,470
So the the people in the soybean oil troop increase.

658
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:51,370
A win over the people in the sunflower decrease. What is interesting here is that you see that the increase is higher than the increase,

659
01:14:51,760 --> 01:15:01,180
which is kind of like telling you probably that a baseline there were more soybean oil users than sunflower users.

660
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:08,000
And this it makes sense because for some reason that either know soybean oil was cheaper than sunflower oil in economy.

661
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:16,000
Right. So then people will kind of like consuming and this is this is because these are low income families.

662
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,080
So then they were choosing the chip at all, which made sense.

663
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:28,720
So so we saw that. But then really supposedly when we were looking at the chip cells, we didn't see any change.

664
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:38,170
So we did not see any, any difference. So it may be because the turnover is longer.

665
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:43,959
So because it was only four weeks, right? So then maybe it takes more time for the excess to change.

666
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:47,800
But other studies have found kind of like changes in our networks.

667
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:50,470
So then we thought that maybe it's because of the contamination.

668
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:55,420
One of the process of collecting chick cells is that they can be contaminated very easily with anything.

669
01:15:55,420 --> 01:16:04,420
I mean, it's like we were following a very kind of like this strict protocol of don't have any food before,

670
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:12,189
don't use any creams or any any toothpaste or whatever because all those things have fat and then they really will contaminate the sample.

671
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:14,559
Right, but does within a year.

672
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:20,140
So then it's kind of like that difficult to kind of like being very strict with protocols within the address of you never know.

673
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:30,790
So the good thing is that so I mean, we saw some correlations with their fatty acid levels between the the whole blood and the saliva.

674
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:34,809
So it's kind of like there is something there. So there may maybe chick cells still.

675
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:37,810
I mean, this was small pilot. I mean, there were kind of like a few issues.

676
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:47,320
So we were not able to see what we were hoping. But but clearly there is there are things that you can measure in saliva and then doing

677
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:51,700
this and I know that environment and kind of like with other populations may work better.

678
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:55,660
Okay. So we are really to the break. Any questions?

679
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,780
Okay. So are you already bored to death with it?

680
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:11,860
But see, I mean, in the end, the fatty acid biomarker seen was was an interesting study given all the things that happened in in Costa Rica.

681
01:17:12,490 --> 01:17:19,480
So anyway, so today the part one of the lab is that now we are going to validate the few using biomarkers.

682
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:24,530
Okay. Remember that you've been validated and I heard you a couple of times already, right?

683
01:17:24,550 --> 01:17:31,390
So the first time was just using the for our records versus there a few the second time you were doing the same, but now.

684
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:35,830
But you were adjusting for total immediately. So then that will improve the correlations.

685
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:42,760
So now you're going to kind of like you're going to use a different file this time it's called Biomarkers The New Dataset,

686
01:17:43,150 --> 01:17:51,520
and this is data in 55 individuals that have both plasma levels of some vitamins and they're very nutrient intakes.

687
01:17:52,480 --> 01:18:01,360
And on those vitamins, turn off with frequency. Question So the idea is that you want to see if there is a plasma levels reflect the nutrient intake.

688
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:06,760
And this time instead of using conversion coefficients, we're going to use linear regression.

689
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:17,230
And the reason to use linear regression is because I want you to adjust for potential variables that will remove extraneous variation, right.

690
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:25,659
So you think that the same as you have been adjusting for totality and this I think that you can still do all of the things that are in the dataset,

691
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:31,630
of course, and you are limited to the variables that you can find in the dataset and and that you can use them.

692
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:41,500
So these are all the variables that you have. So of course you have your avi, you have age sex, you have the height, weight, so you can calculate BMI,

693
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:47,170
you have plasma, triglycerides, blood, natural cholesterol, plasma total cholesterol.

694
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:59,410
You have the plasma therapy on plasma with, you know, the vitamin D, you have the necessary kind of like vitamin C plasma.

695
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:08,530
I think I'm only asking you two of them. I think it might be letting me and you have intake of protein.

696
01:19:08,530 --> 01:19:12,819
You think of any modified intake of a given fat and now you have the intake of the three

697
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:16,150
vitamins and then you have water intake of carbohydrates and you have to do anything.

698
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:23,530
So you have your three vitamins from diet and from plasma,

699
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:33,820
I believe I'm only asking you two of them and you have all the variables that you can adjust for, but you will have to justify that.

700
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:38,110
So then the first part is, I'm going to ask you to examine the distributions of plasma.

701
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,640
And let's see, I'm only asking you plasma carotene, Abdelmalek.

702
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:47,200
I mean, you know what I mean? Okay. I am asking you to make an appropriate statistical analysis.

703
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:57,240
Why? I am asking you that. I want you to really another issue, right?

704
01:19:58,730 --> 01:20:05,720
And then your dependent, whatever is going to be the plasma vitamin and the independent is going to be the nutri birthday,

705
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:07,700
the vitamin from the fifth year.

706
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:20,150
So I am asking you to see a unit transformation of the plasma vitamin E or plasma carotene, if it's the dependent variable in the narrow vision.

707
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:32,059
Normally this is because one of the assumptions of linear regression is that the receiver need to be normally distributed,

708
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:37,370
know that those are the residual, not the outcome variable, but usually the outcome variable is very skew.

709
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:41,350
Most likely the residual are going to be to right.

710
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:50,000
So then you will have to dissect and remember, this is a step in which the normality is in the eye of the beholder, right?

711
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,930
So if it's very skewed, you will see if it's going to like so.

712
01:20:53,930 --> 01:21:03,350
So you may say like it's okay, think I'll take into account that you only have 55 people.

713
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:11,120
So you remember that when you have smaller sample sizes, you cannot really afford huge departures from normality.

714
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:15,890
Right. But but it will be up to you to decide if it's okay or not.

715
01:21:16,850 --> 01:21:30,589
And now what we want to see is that we want to see if the relations between values of carotene and vitamin D of being from a fifth and plasma,

716
01:21:30,590 --> 01:21:35,240
the relationship. Right or how well they have different if you predict plasma values.

717
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:43,490
Right so that what we are doing right so we are going to use linear regression and then I'm going to show you the this ASCO, the worry.

718
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:49,820
And then the question is the first question is that we're going to do it just a

719
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:53,750
simple linear regression like and it will be like a simple correlation coefficient.

720
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:59,629
Just the two are the outcome variable and this push it how and then you have to understand how

721
01:21:59,630 --> 01:22:06,860
well do carotene are very many of them from the 53 plasma respectively in a univariate analysis.

722
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:11,900
So a simple generic. And now why did you see that?

723
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:16,580
And now spoiler alert, you are not going to see any relationship.

724
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:22,490
So it's kind of like not significant at all. They made us out of almost zero, right.

725
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:25,670
Which is now wasted. But now that you see that,

726
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:34,520
you had to think like how this association can be influenced by appropriate adjustment for other biological relevant body of us.

727
01:22:34,910 --> 01:22:42,680
So the idea that if you adjust and you do multiple linear regression, maybe you are going to find some sort of association, right?

728
01:22:43,730 --> 01:22:57,230
So then when you adjust in our model, you have to think about you don't do adjustment trying to find insignificant restoration.

729
01:22:57,260 --> 01:23:00,829
We don't do that, right? So this is not going to lie. That's cheating basically.

730
01:23:00,830 --> 01:23:10,040
Right? So what we had to do is to decide arbitrarily why I should adjust for something or not based on biological reasons.

731
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:19,970
Right. So because there are a few reasons to include everyone in the regression model.

732
01:23:20,090 --> 01:23:25,760
One is controlling for confounding. We may think that something is confounding the the association.

733
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:31,010
Right. The other is to decrease the error in the independent variable,

734
01:23:31,010 --> 01:23:37,850
which would be the plasma negative or the other is to decrease distribution of in the independent variable the fifth unit.

735
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:43,730
Right. If for example, tell me one thing that will decrease is strongest ever in a nutrient.

736
01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:49,110
Yeah, totally. Right.

737
01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:57,090
So then you tell me I'm going to adjust for total energy intake because it will decrease in the decrease in the independent body.

738
01:23:57,180 --> 01:24:00,990
Right. Think about other things that could decrease estrogen.

739
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,030
Also independent volume. Right.

740
01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:13,920
And then the idea is that you have to justify the inclusion of every variable in them will be very modern, both based on biological reasons.

741
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:17,880
And then for that, you may need to search the literature.

742
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:21,990
You may need to know a little more about carotene and vitamin E, and that's fine.

743
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:26,010
So then there are not really many variables.

744
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:31,620
So then you can check those variables as opposed to fat or plasma carotene or plasma.

745
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:37,079
But I mean, you have to kind of like come up with a list of all the things that could be, could, you know, have them in the get at it.

746
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,330
Just look at the ones that you have in the. Right.

747
01:24:41,190 --> 01:24:52,080
And also then you have to see when you enter that variable in the model, when the mother is not changing anything, then clearly is not doing anything.

748
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:55,950
Clearly. I mean, you may think that it would be a confounded application confounder,

749
01:24:56,220 --> 01:25:03,510
but then you put it in the model and the big drivers and change the drivers and changes like it's not my funding, right?

750
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:09,240
It may be because they had an issue with their days by whatever reason.

751
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:15,240
Right. But if it's not changing, then there's no purpose on leaving it in the model.

752
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:25,280
Okay. So. So you will have to assess the tension, the regression coefficient and some that are mostly the relation coefficient.

753
01:25:25,290 --> 01:25:28,890
Okay. And I think university did this statistic, but you don't need to do that.

754
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:33,210
Focus on the, on the change in the confusion, because that's what we usually do.

755
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:40,400
Right. I mean, if you are thinking of ways to measure variation, you're I think our standard variation issued kind of like includes estimator.

756
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:40,740
Right.

757
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:51,180
But and again, this is able I mean, I'm remember, I'm always giving you the 10% rule for the change in the coefficient, but it doesn't have to be.

758
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:54,569
You don't have to calculate. It just. I will. Okay. I mean, do you want to calculate it?

759
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:56,430
Sorry, but no.

760
01:26:01,070 --> 01:26:09,360
So you can present data on different models because ideas you have, you have to come up with a final model or you just come up with your final model.

761
01:26:09,390 --> 01:26:15,290
I mean, it's okay as long as it was justified because but the idea is that you should

762
01:26:15,290 --> 01:26:20,089
be adding one body all at a time of the ones that you think that is affecting.

763
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:25,840
And then maybe you can change a few. Right. And then you find out more that.

764
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:29,629
Okay, the one that I'm going to check is the final intermediate one.

765
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:38,240
So for you to know which things you have to whether or not there is not necessarily a unique answer.

766
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:43,760
So don't panic. You don't come up with the final model because there is no find out along the way.

767
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:48,020
I would love any model as long as is well justify.

768
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:51,290
Okay. If it's well justified.

769
01:26:51,770 --> 01:27:00,270
If you tell me why you are adjusting for that based more on biological reason and the change in the coefficient, then I'm okay.

770
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:04,610
Right. So every one of you will come with a different model and that's fine.

771
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:08,480
And don't pursue the p value change.

772
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:15,500
If at the end of adjusting for things they still you don't see any association, then there's no association.

773
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:23,989
That's fine. Okay. So what I want what I am really checking here is your kind of like your thought process in choosing

774
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:28,190
the variables and why you are choosing the volume of the final product is not that important.

775
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:33,350
Here is the process. What is more important? Okay. Okay.

776
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:42,200
So now all that important hint some people like to use that is square and that's okay in the models.

777
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:52,160
But it's not that okay in the in that just the model Y because there are there are some parameters.

778
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:55,430
I mean, that is what is this is not that predictive model.

779
01:27:55,430 --> 01:27:58,070
This is supposed to be more like a causal model. Right?

780
01:27:58,490 --> 01:28:05,510
So then we are not really interested in how well all the variables predict the plasma level in the sense

781
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:12,230
that if you have some of your potential for finding that are better predictors than your nutrition,

782
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:16,249
then you are going to see a damping your eye squared just because a dot is like I mean,

783
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:24,110
let's say that you have your plasma level and your nutrient and then you enter H and it happens to be a huge predictor of plasma.

784
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:32,270
Then you're going to see a huge increase in that is because it's predicting better, but that doesn't mean that your nutrient value is pretty well.

785
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:36,290
Plasma is H that is predicting plasma.

786
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:39,980
Right. So that's why I would prefer you not to use that is good.

787
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:43,849
Okay. Use the change in the coefficient. So no, no.

788
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:48,469
That is. And again, I already told you this.

789
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:55,040
The goal is not to make the researchers significant. Okay. Just to make sure that the point estimate is not confounded by other variables.

790
01:28:56,210 --> 01:29:01,310
Eventually you may get a significant if you choose the correct the best variable.

791
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:08,150
Right. But that's not very important to justify the inclusion of the values for non-biological point of view.

792
01:29:08,180 --> 01:29:11,530
You have to check the literature. Please. By all means, go and check the literature.

793
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:17,230
Why do you think that LDL cholesterol may be an important factor to digest for?

794
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:21,150
Right. And think about ways of inducing some of the concerns you have a lot of.

795
01:29:21,170 --> 01:29:23,569
Before I already hinted you one. I mean.

796
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:32,720
Well, Nicki was the one who said if you reduce your student evaluation and the not really adjusting for total intake adjust for totality intake.

797
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:37,550
How do you adjust for total energy intake? You know now different ways, right?

798
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:43,730
So be creative. You can just enter the viral pneumonia or you can take the results of your nutrient, right?

799
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,220
If you are in, do it right. I'm not saying that you have to do it right.

800
01:29:48,230 --> 01:29:53,040
You can do the easy way, but kind of like think about how to incorporate all those things.

801
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:58,760
Okay. Okay. So this is the goal that you use for simple navigation.

802
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:02,090
We're going to use the multiple one.

803
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:13,160
Yes. But I read that there are three different types of products that you can use in such really innovation.

804
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:18,800
You can produce them or provide them up where you want to use the more simple one with this program.

805
01:30:19,550 --> 01:30:23,270
So this provides your devices with your library, your phone and the model.

806
01:30:23,270 --> 01:30:28,340
This is having a very modern plasma loading neat with your vitamin D from day one, day 50.

807
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:36,400
Okay, so that will give you the device. And then if you want to adjust for something, then we just start adding viruses with any sample here.

808
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:39,950
I mean. H Right. So you can add as many as you want.

809
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:41,960
You feel that is needed. Okay.

810
01:30:42,590 --> 01:30:52,790
So the SAS code shouldn't be a problem this today, this is pretty simple now is more like thinking about what you want to adjust for.

811
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,990
Okay. And by all means, now you are going to have some time together.

812
01:30:57,230 --> 01:31:01,150
Discuss with your. With your. With your partners.

813
01:31:01,190 --> 01:31:09,350
Okay. And then I have a question like what other factors are likely to influence the decision scene between the plasma nutrient?

814
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:15,829
And clearly I'm only giving you a few variables, but you may be thinking out all these other things.

815
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:21,380
And more important, I don't have information on those. And then you can kind of like tell me this other things would be important, okay?

816
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:25,580
And this has to be done on your own. And finally,

817
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:29,870
I'm just asking you for something that you can find in the slide where the

818
01:31:29,870 --> 01:31:34,700
advantages and disadvantages of using biochemical markers to validate the question,

819
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:47,450
okay. So okay, so now you're going to work on one, but before that, remember that next week you have this in class assignment.

820
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:52,759
So we are going to look at biomarkers of sodium, vitamin D and total energy intake.

821
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:55,220
And I have put you in these three groups. Okay?

822
01:31:55,490 --> 01:32:00,860
This information is in there, not only in the laser, but also in a document that is in the campus site.

823
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:07,250
So that will be the sodium group. That will be the vitamin D group and that will be the total energy intake group.

824
01:32:07,610 --> 01:32:17,240
So then what you have to do with your nutrition and anything that you have is kind of like think about this point this week and check the literature,

825
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:23,840
check some references like first, why is that not really important in terms of how I mean, why why would you like to study that?

826
01:32:24,350 --> 01:32:28,190
Second, what are the biological specimen or specimens?

827
01:32:28,190 --> 01:32:32,600
Because and then there are more than one where you can measure the nutrient that reflect intake.

828
01:32:32,990 --> 01:32:39,379
So what are good biomarkers? So there were the many studies supporting the use of the specimens to measure your nutritional.

829
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:44,670
You have to check some of the literature show. And there's this study that showed that this is a correlation.

830
01:32:44,670 --> 01:32:50,630
Right? What is the recommended ideal or more accurate method if more than one?

831
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:59,209
Right. I mean, I'm like, for example, what I told you in in fatty acids and then you can measure them in blood in and placement of last neighborhood.

832
01:32:59,210 --> 01:33:03,560
But adipose is the better right? So then you have more than one, then you choose the best one.

833
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:11,660
What are the strengths of the methods or methods to measure that nutrient and what are the weaknesses and any other information that you found?

834
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:22,580
Right? So think about those on your own. So you have to do some work on your own and then and during class.

835
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:29,930
So again, do that on your own during glad you will have 20 minutes with your group to discuss all the information you found.

836
01:33:30,470 --> 01:33:34,070
During those 20 minutes, you will have to summarize everything and just a reporter.

837
01:33:34,070 --> 01:33:38,360
You can choose your reporter ahead of time if you want you all to work in groups before, that's fine.

838
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:41,479
I mean, it's just I don't want to boss like that. You have to meet or whatever.

839
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:46,190
I mean, that's why I'm allowing you to do individual work and then working in class.

840
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:51,049
And then each reporter will have like 10 minutes or so to summarize your findings to the class.

841
01:33:51,050 --> 01:33:57,440
Okay. So that will be the first activity we'll do next week at the beginning, and then we will move into other things.

842
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:01,010
Okay. And your questions and this.

843
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:11,090
Okay. So now let's work in pairs four by one. And we have until we still have like 60 Minutes.

844
01:34:20,110 --> 01:34:23,500
And I'm I'm here to to answer questions that you have.
