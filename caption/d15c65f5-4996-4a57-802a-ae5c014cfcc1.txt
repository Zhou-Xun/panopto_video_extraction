00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:06,960
Hey, everyone. First up, I want to say thank you for a wonderful class and for engaging in this really important work.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,460
Thank you, Dr. Charles, for a really engaging and inclusive environment.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,860
I started with my six Americas quiz at 26 percent, so part of the alarmed population.

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,550
They've stayed pretty consistent in my thinking throughout.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:28,770
What's more concerning to me is that only twenty six percent of the population is deeply alarmed, as I am about the plight of climate change.

6
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,880
I think one message that was very clear throughout the class was the importance

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,610
of looking through an environmental justice lens at all times in every capacity,

8
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,540
whether it's doing assessments, whether it's doing evaluations, whether it's doing engagement,

9
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,280
work with communities, always keeping that environmental justice framework in mind.

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,920
I really in particular engaged with that framework when I looked at the community in Puerto Rico and the CUNY in Detroit,

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,350
which I did a lot of my policy and Op-Ed work and fact sheet work with.

12
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,410
Overall, I again came to that underlying thought process around looking through an environmental justice lens,

13
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,910
meaning engaging with communities first and taking action according to the needs.

14
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,930
Autonomy and self-determination of the communities that I'm working in.

15
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,170
And so though I felt I had a strong background in sort of social justice,

16
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,200
organizing and having some of that to ground me in this work, I always can learn more.

17
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,350
And I think a huge takeaway for me was communicating with communities in a way that is professional,

18
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:37,230
ethical and bringing a message of Evidence-Based, but also compassionate communication.

19
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:43,080
And then the solutions oriented part of this class, I really felt that that was one thing.

20
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,310
I came into class really asking professor, like, OK, I'm overwhelmed.

21
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,440
I understand that there's a lot going on in the world. How do we make change happen?

22
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,730
So I looked at case studies in Puerto Rico and in Detroit of adapted to climate change.

23
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,290
So, for example, in Puerto Rico,

24
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:08,490
I looked at how people were planting mangrove trees to prevent soil or sand erosion around the sea wall that's being destroyed by frequent hurricanes.

25
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:16,650
I think also, too, I really developed a lot more skill set in analyzing assessment based solutions or evidence based solutions that

26
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,890
have worked or kind of have been tested a little bit more than some of the strategies that I've heard in the past.

27
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,560
So in Chapter 12 last week, we read a little bit about small scale farming communities.

28
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:36,540
So can I come back to my favorite example of a farm that I lived by for a time and this resilience to changing climate?

29
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,750
So wildfires in particular like this community?

30
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:49,980
So having a regenerative, ecologically sound environment to one feed the community and to kind of build resilience for a changing climate.

31
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,300
So I think that that was my my example that I pulled and try to tie together all the class

32
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:01,440
information with in terms of adapting to the effects of climate change in a resilient way.

33
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,661
So thank you all. I really appreciated working with everyone.
