00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,150
Hello. Welcome to this lecture on

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,340
the computation of a
statistical concepts

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,140
known as a confidence interval.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,770
Now, we know that each
sample of data drawn

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,870
from a population
will be different,

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,000
even if all those
samples are drawn from

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,490
the exact same population.

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,350
Thus, each of these samples would

9
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,020
produce a different sample mean,

10
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,625
and we could create a
histogram of those means

11
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:27,000
to represent the sampling
variability among them.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,090
But in reality, I will
only have one sample.

13
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,830
So can I figure out what

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,080
all those other sample
means might have been,

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,105
if I could have
drawn new samples?

16
00:00:36,105 --> 00:00:37,845
The answer to that
question is yes,

17
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:39,720
it all comes from the
central limit theorem

18
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,150
which we discussed in
a previous lecture.

19
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,510
So therefore, how
might we be able to

20
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,195
tell if our samples
mean was unusual?

21
00:00:47,195 --> 00:00:49,940
In this module, we're
going to talk about how to

22
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,405
compute confidence intervals
to answer this question.

23
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:55,820
So our learning
objectives are first to

24
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,040
understand the purpose
of confidence intervals,

25
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,270
and then to be able to compute

26
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,545
confidence intervals
from summary statistics.

27
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:05,780
Now, as an example, suppose
we have a sample of

28
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,240
100 uninsured mothers and

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,985
we have the weights of
their newborn infants.

30
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:12,920
From those 100 mothers,

31
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,070
we get a sample mean
of 2,350 grams for

32
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,450
these infants and

33
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,120
a sample standard
deviation of 570 grams.

34
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,910
Now, for a given value
in the population for

35
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,105
the mean Mu and its
standard deviation Sigma,

36
00:01:26,105 --> 00:01:28,310
recall that the
central limit theorem

37
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,780
tells us that our sample

38
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,470
mean belongs to a distribution
of many sample means,

39
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,635
that first is exactly or
approximately normal,

40
00:01:36,635 --> 00:01:39,845
has a mean equal to the
population mean Mu,

41
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:42,590
and the sample means have
a distribution that has

42
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,420
a standard deviation equal to

43
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,870
the population standard
deviation Sigma,

44
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,495
divided by the square
root of the sample size.

45
00:01:50,495 --> 00:01:53,120
Now, in this example,
suppose we know from

46
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,670
vital statistics that
the population has

47
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,960
a birthweight with a mean of

48
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,940
2,400 grams and a standard
deviation of 400 grams.

49
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,590
Now, I did not tell you that

50
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,275
the population birthweights
have a normal distribution,

51
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,060
because of the central
limit theorem,

52
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,170
they do not have to have

53
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,710
a normal distribution
in the population.

54
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,680
Therefore, every sample of

55
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,610
100 newborns drawn from
this population would

56
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,740
have a different sample
mean and our sample

57
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,350
mean is only one possible value.

58
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,840
But the central limit theorem
tells us that if we made

59
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,970
a histogram of all
the sample means,

60
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,485
that histogram would resemble

61
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:29,540
a bell-shaped normal
distribution,

62
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,150
centered around 2,400 grams with

63
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,910
the standard deviation
of 40 grams which is

64
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,740
the population
standard deviation of

65
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,255
400 divided by the square root
of the sample size of 100.

66
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:44,795
Here is what that sampling
distribution looks like.

67
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:46,580
This is the distribution

68
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,620
of all the sample
means that might

69
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,760
be drawn from the population
if the sample size is 100.

70
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,724
This distribution is bell-shaped,

71
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:56,990
it has a mean of 2,400 grams,

72
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,030
and it has a standard
error of the mean or

73
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,890
standard deviation of 40 grams

74
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,065
for the sampling distribution.

75
00:03:03,065 --> 00:03:08,355
The sample I drew gave
me a value of 2,350.

76
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,980
So therefore, the
central limit theorem

77
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,170
tells us about our sample,

78
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,100
and how it is related to all
of their sample means based

79
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,265
upon information
about the population.

80
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:22,535
However, often we want to
tell the reverse story,

81
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,670
we want to describe the
population based upon

82
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,355
the information from
R1 sample mean.

83
00:03:29,355 --> 00:03:31,980
So by the central limit theorem,

84
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,150
if sample means have a normal
distribution with a mean of

85
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,875
Mu and a standard deviation
of Sigma over root n,

86
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,900
then by the properties of
a normal distribution we

87
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,705
know that 95 percent
of all sample means,

88
00:03:44,705 --> 00:03:47,420
must be within two
standard deviations

89
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,425
of the mean of the
sampling distribution.

90
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:53,165
So thus, 95 percent of

91
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:56,555
all sample means must lie
in this interval here.

92
00:03:56,555 --> 00:03:59,360
The mean of the sampling
distribution is Mu,

93
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,365
the standard deviation
is Sigma over root n,

94
00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:03,830
and therefore, we add and

95
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,230
subtract two of these
standard deviations.

96
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,895
This describes 95 percent of
all possible sample means.

97
00:04:10,895 --> 00:04:13,940
In other words, we can make
a probability statement.

98
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,215
The probability that
my sample mean X bar

99
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:22,230
lies between those two
numbers must be 95.

100
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,780
So now, I'm going
to do some algebra.

101
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,140
Right now, I have X bar
in-between two numbers,

102
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,910
and what I would rather have is

103
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,400
Mu in between two numbers.

104
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,240
So I take this statement
and the first thing I do,

105
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,300
is subtract Mu from all three
parts of the inequality.

106
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,920
Therefore, Mu is now
in the middle of

107
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,630
the inequality in this knot on

108
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,940
the left and right sides
of the inequality.

109
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,695
I then, subtract X bar

110
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:50,660
from all three parts
of the inequality,

111
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,070
to get X bar which is

112
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,460
my data on the left and right
sides of the inequality.

113
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,120
Then I multiply by
negative one to get rid of

114
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,960
the negative signs especially
the negative on Mu.

115
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,250
So I have this probability
statement here.

116
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,060
It describes where Mu might
lie the population mean,

117
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,160
where it might lie
relative to what

118
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,815
I see in my value of X bar.

119
00:05:12,815 --> 00:05:14,630
So we've changed the interval to

120
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,010
now describe a range of values

121
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,010
for Mu for a given
value of X bar.

122
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,130
However, this interval
still has one unknown value

123
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,520
which is the population
standard deviation Sigma.

124
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,860
We replace this
with our best guess

125
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,140
which is the sample
standard deviation,

126
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,290
and recall that the sample
standard deviation divided by

127
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,930
the square root of
the sample size

128
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,155
is known as the standard
error of the mean,

129
00:05:37,155 --> 00:05:40,250
a concept which we discussed
in a previous lecture.

130
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,200
Thus, we now have

131
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,495
a 95 percent confidence
interval for Mu,

132
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:47,620
that is based solely upon
information in the data.

133
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,665
I take the sample mean X
bar and I add and subtract

134
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:53,660
two standard deviations or

135
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,140
two standard errors of
the mean from X bar.

136
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,845
In my example, that's the
mean of 2,350 in the sample.

137
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:05,360
Subtract two standard
deviations or

138
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,640
add two standard
deviations to this value,

139
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,630
and that produces an interval
with a left bound of 2,236

140
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,176
grams and our right
bound of 2464 grams.
