1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:18,670
In. I think he's just.

2
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:32,580
Answer. And some people think, yeah, no one really is.

3
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:48,980
Hey. Good morning, C.J. Yeah, good.

4
00:01:53,370 --> 00:04:04,940
What? I love your stickers.

5
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,160
Thank you. That's. Yeah.

6
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,560
I like. I mean, I think Canada.

7
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,540
Call my presentation. But it seems like.

8
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,890
I don't know. Do you think it's been better managed? Kind of like integrating, like first nations into.

9
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:45,110
We're. Recent decisions.

10
00:04:50,390 --> 00:05:12,520
So there's. Make.

11
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Yeah. Just like, does a turtle have like me first nation seem to be it?

12
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:33,870
Yeah. I don't know. He does think he's, like, first nation, like, seemed.

13
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:47,090
It seems like. Not the type of theater trio's, but I just want her to know whether that's, like, a preparation or like it's actually.

14
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,190
But he's not here. Q.

15
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:06,050
Just. Oh, yeah, we're just. Yeah.

16
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:19,880
Powerful. Oh. Oh, how cute.

17
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:32,940
Coming from restaurants. Interesting in this industry.

18
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:44,040
They. I thought she was good things.

19
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:52,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know much about the industry.

20
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,770
In Michigan. I think I'm actually.

21
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:13,160
At the end of this year. I like the first month back month like nomination, like walking out of the emergency room.

22
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,520
And you know, as a responsible.

23
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:25,430
Just, you know, and so I just did it this year and I was supposed to go and then I went to do this other rotations to California,

24
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:33,870
but I kind of had to do some competitions. But, um, I just think it's a good, it's a good, important.

25
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:47,720
It seems like, you know, like, you know, like every native population, probably like the most marginalized, like elementary.

26
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,030
Yeah. Yeah. I can.

27
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:05,940
Yeah. I don't know. Like, it's just it's kind of hard to figure out how you fit into, like, the notion of reparations, but I think that category.

28
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:24,549
Yeah. I'm curious about. They're interested in. And good morning, everyone.

29
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:33,490
We'll get started. I think people will be. Turning up at some point, especially I know Lexi is going to be presenting as well.

30
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:37,719
So I'm going to make sure that we give her time to come. All right.

31
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,440
So let me get rid of this.

32
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,100
Today is probably one of the most important topics thinking about dementia and cognitive function,

33
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,750
given that it's one of the sort of biggest public health issues facing an aging population.

34
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,390
But before we get into it, I just wanted to kind of talk a little bit about some of the conferences that have been going on.

35
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:03,040
Conferences are coming back. It seems everyone's going in person.

36
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,489
We just came from a meeting for the Gerontology Society of America in Indianapolis,

37
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:13,270
and it was great to see so many of the students in this class there as well.

38
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:21,370
Morning. Lexi and I also went to the American Public Health Association meetings after that in Boston.

39
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:28,710
Was anybody approaching? Has anyone ever been to Apache before?

40
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,350
Yes. Right now, I just had a lot of experience there, too.

41
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,030
It's got a great disability section. I mean, it's but it is a huge conference.

42
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:43,850
It's enormous. When I was there, they had it was at this massive convention center.

43
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:50,550
There's 15,000 people, I think, that go to this conference. They had security at the entrance, dogs sniffing people.

44
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,240
It was enormous. And I think a lot of people get turned off by that.

45
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:00,479
But it is a good conference and sort of being at the sort of forefront of cutting edge work that's going on in public health.

46
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,680
And Michigan really had a strong presence there. So it was really exciting.

47
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,260
But this is my home conference, the German language Toronto Logical Society of America meeting.

48
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:15,480
If you ever get a chance to go, it's a wonderful opportunity to learn all about aging.

49
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,880
It's social aspects of aging, biological aspects, clinical, medical.

50
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:28,920
This year it was in Indianapolis. So many of us drove down and then drove that with lots of high winds.

51
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:37,140
And it's it's the next time it's going to be in Tampa in November of 2023.

52
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:43,890
The abstract deadline is usually around February, March. If you ever want to, you know, consider submitting an abstract, I highly recommend it.

53
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,980
It's a great it's a great conference. Did you did you enjoy it?

54
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,880
Oh, I love the conference. Okay.

55
00:10:53,870 --> 00:11:01,010
I think the general yeah. You get a chance to see different places of worship.

56
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,610
But how about you in Tucson? Did you enjoy it? Yeah, I enjoyed it.

57
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:12,050
I mean, people from different perspectives like social science and religion and gerontology.

58
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,620
I learned that there's others in there, too.

59
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,770
Yes. Yes. And there's a good international presence there as well. So you get a chance to see scholars from from Europe.

60
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:25,069
And so it's just wanted to let you know about it.

61
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:30,290
It's a it's a great society if you're interested in engaging. Okay.

62
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:36,049
So today we're going to talk about dementia and I'm going to do just a short lecture until about 1030.

63
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,270
And then we have two presentations today.

64
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:46,400
But let's kind of think a little bit more generally in this first part about understanding a prevalence of dementia, including inequalities.

65
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:54,230
We'll talk a little bit about how to diagnose dementia or how to assess for cognitive function, including risk factors for dementia.

66
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,629
Talk a little bit about cognitive reserve.

67
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:04,490
So thinking about ways to mitigate cognitive decline from a life course perspective and then think about the role of neighborhoods.

68
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,010
If I get a chance, I'll talk a little bit about dual tasking because that's something that's related to cognitive function,

69
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,750
but we'll see where we are with time. All right.

70
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:20,600
So as you all know, I'm sure you do. Dementia is a very, very common condition in older adults.

71
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:27,050
It has consequences, far reaching consequences for function and health and mortality.

72
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:33,769
The prevalence of dementia is a little bit tricky to actually identify and actually get a good number on,

73
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,550
partly because of difficulties in diagnosing it. And we'll get into that in a second.

74
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:47,270
But it's estimated the most recent estimates suggest that around 10 to 11% of older adults, those age 65 and older have dementia.

75
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:54,680
And the prevalence increases with amongst with age so that the highest prevalence is actually in those who are the oldest old.

76
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:03,889
So over the age of 85, it's a worldwide phenomenon and largely because of the consequences for population aging.

77
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:10,760
So because we, as we talked about in the earlier part of the course, the world is aging, the United States is aging.

78
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,000
That means that the prevalence of dementia is going to increase.

79
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:24,139
This graph here on the right hand side shows the projected increase in the number of people with dementia in high income countries,

80
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,000
in low and middle income countries.

81
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:35,270
And you can see that that's going to lower middle income countries will shoulder the biggest burden in the increasing prevalence of dementia globally.

82
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:47,230
So what is dementia? So there's different types of dementia that are associated with different sources.

83
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:55,360
The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, which is affecting about 60 to 80% of cases.

84
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,600
Another common relic more about 20 to 30% of cases are result of vascular dementia.

85
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:07,810
So, you know, just like you would have vascular conditions and sort of, you know, low blood flow to the heart.

86
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:12,070
This is low blood flow to the brain causing dementia that way.

87
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:20,500
And then another 10% or so cases are due to other conditions like Lewy body dementia, Parkinson's disease, mix, dementia, other conditions.

88
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,659
So it's a bit of a mixed bag.

89
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:29,890
And when people talk about, you know, dementia, you'll often hear about Alzheimer's disease, but also a number of diseases.

90
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:34,780
It's the most common, but it's also only one of the different types of dementia that there is.

91
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:45,890
So this is an illustration about the impact of dementia on the brain and essentially on the left hand side,

92
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:49,580
the healthy brain and on the right hand side. This is advanced Alzheimer's.

93
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:56,179
And what Alzheimer's disease, what it happens essentially and I am not a clinician,

94
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:02,899
but my understanding my layperson's understanding is that with with Alzheimer's disease,

95
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:08,090
there's the development of these plaques that get in the way of the the synapses,

96
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:17,059
the connections in our brain that allow for communication and allow for signals to be transmitted through the plant brain,

97
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:25,040
to allow things like movement, thought, memory, all the things that we do that are the sources of what's going on in our brain.

98
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,899
And they get in the way of that and they actually then cause those neurons to die so that

99
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:36,440
essentially the brain becomes smaller and smaller and smaller with more and more holes in it,

100
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,470
like these different spaces here.

101
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:50,089
Is that a fair representation? Yeah. Yeah. And and I think, like, importantly, like, there's no way, like,

102
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:55,010
kind of the weird thing about Alzheimer's is there's no way to diagnose Alzheimer's unless you autopsy the brain.

103
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,700
You can't see plaques and tangles on any test.

104
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,140
You have to autopsy the person to see it.

105
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:10,040
So really the only use clinical signs and then you can take you can do like CAT scans of the brain and you can see this like shrunken brain,

106
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,970
but like a lot of things can cause like that kind of atrophy. Shrunken brain.

107
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,020
So it is fascinating, but you can't actually diagnose unless you autopsy.

108
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,440
Yeah, exactly. And that is pretty profound, right?

109
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:29,180
This is a health condition that's so widespread. But we can't diagnose diagnose it unless we cut someone's head open and look at their brain.

110
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,170
So how do we go about diagnosing it?

111
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:42,649
So we look at things like symptoms of dementia, which are the key features of dementia, our declines in memory attention,

112
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:49,430
which is like, you know, awareness of where we are and executive function, which is things like problem solving and planning.

113
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:54,470
And this is the DSM four criteria for a dementia diagnosis.

114
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:04,490
So it's you have to have impairment in short and long term memory as well as at least one of speech impairment,

115
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:12,990
failure to recognize people or different difficulty with this executive function, the planning and managing piece, you've got to have that.

116
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:17,180
So the key thing is impairment in short and long term memory plus one of these,

117
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:22,880
and that's got to have an impact on your social or occupational functioning

118
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,070
and it has to be a significant decline from a previous level of functioning.

119
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:34,160
So clinicians diagnosing dementia in the clinical setting have to kind of come up with,

120
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,650
you know, these markers to kind of assess whether they would make a diagnosis of dementia.

121
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,870
And forgive me if I'm going to call on you again, you know, how hard is it to do this?

122
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:54,320
It's pretty hard. I mean, to the point where I think it's really hard to different, like when you when you brought up the different dementia types.

123
00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:03,860
I think there is a lot of. Subjectivity in how clinicians land on the diagnosis.

124
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,230
The. It's because you have to actually diagnose the type.

125
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,880
It's not just dementia.

126
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,730
I wouldn't be surprised if we're actually over diagnosing Alzheimer's because it's just so difficult to kind of differentiate between.

127
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,800
Between all of them. Yeah. Interesting.

128
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:25,140
Yeah. No, I mean, it seems very, very difficult to do. Um,

129
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:30,110
so what are the other ways that we are kind of trying to assess outside of the clinical setting

130
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:35,350
of cognitive function in dementia is through screening tests in population based samples.

131
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,430
So this, for example, is a screening test that's used called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.

132
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,460
This is a pretty effective test for assessing cognitive function.

133
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:50,650
It's given to older adults in a paper or pencil format.

134
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:56,440
This is this is a test of complex cognitive functioning in terms of the executive functioning.

135
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:04,900
It requires you, you're told, to sort of start with number one and then you're to go to the first letter of the alphabet.

136
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,840
They go to number two with the second letter of the alphabet.

137
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,870
So to make the connection moving between numbers and letters in your head and the ability to do that is actually,

138
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,590
you know, does require some complex cognitive processing in your head.

139
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,550
Copying a cube to something else that's required and drawing a clock.

140
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,560
This is a very interesting you do see, especially for stroke patients,

141
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,059
really different interesting things about the way they're drawing a clock and that, in fact,

142
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:39,100
for people with tiny spatial neglect, where they really just ignore or are unable to process things on one side of their their spatial awareness,

143
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,090
they'll just draw half a clock, for example. So it's interesting to see what comes out.

144
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:52,210
But one of the actually this is, you know, the Montreal cognitive assessment is only for people when you're seeing them in person.

145
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,380
But what do we do for many of our national stories, which are actually on the telephone?

146
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:03,880
So this is a very common way that we assess cognitive functioning in nationwide surveys on the telephone.

147
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,890
And I'm going to actually administer it to you. So we will assess your cognitive function right now.

148
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:14,320
This is the prompt that the interviewer says. Now I'd like to ask some questions dealing with memory.

149
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,760
Even people with good memory sometimes seem to forget these things from time to time.

150
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:23,680
So, like giving people a sense of it's okay to get things wrong, don't get stressed about this.

151
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:36,820
These are routine questions that we ask everyone. So what is the day to day to 1.0?

152
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,280
What day of the week is it? Once, like I said at one point.

153
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:47,420
What is the name of the president of the United States trying to.

154
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,840
What is the name of the person who was president just before him? John.

155
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,800
Please subtract three from 20 and tell me the number you get.

156
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:10,520
Now subtract three from that number and each new number you get telling me the result as you go to do it.

157
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:23,040
One point. Now I'm going to read you a set of ten words, and I'm going to ask you to recall as many as you can remember.

158
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:29,399
This is over the phone. We have made the list long on purpose so that it will be difficult for anyone to recall all the words.

159
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,950
Most people recall just a few. Listen carefully as I read the words, because I cannot repeat them.

160
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,070
When I finish, I will ask you to recall aloud as many of the words as you can in any order.

161
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,450
This is clear. These are the words.

162
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,860
Hotel. River Tree. Skin.

163
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:56,340
Gold Market. Paper. Child King Book.

164
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:04,830
All right. Tell me the words that you can recall in terms of.

165
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:19,489
Excellent. So all right.

166
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:25,250
Then the interviewer goes on and asks all sorts of questions about, you know, marital histories and their health conditions.

167
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:31,250
And it goes on in about 10 minutes later, the interviewer says of the four respondent.

168
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,810
A little while ago, I read you a list of words and you repeated the ones that you could remember.

169
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:46,850
Tell me the words that you can remember now. Tell her the truth and go on to try to come to terms with it.

170
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:51,740
You guys are great. You get ten points for that too.

171
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,330
So then a summary score is great. This is global cognitive function, right?

172
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:01,969
It's tapping all sorts of things like memory, immediate, like recall of memory, and sort of like longer term memory.

173
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,750
How much can you remember the words that were given to you 10 minutes ago?

174
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,050
Orientation to time and place. What's the date? What's the day?

175
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:14,690
You know, orientation to the current president. So it's a global, global measure of cognition.

176
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:20,600
And a summary score is printed by summing the number of correct answers with a higher score means that you've got better cognitive function.

177
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,370
If you if someone refuses to answer a question that is coded as incorrect.

178
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:32,510
And then there are different algorithms that are used to sort of identify cutoff scores for dementia or for mild cognitive impairment,

179
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:39,740
which is, you know, mild dementia, but not mild cognitive impairment that is not actually reaching a threshold for dementia.

180
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,540
There's a couple of things here that are a bit tricky.

181
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:49,809
So there's a possibility for practice effects with this kind of a test and with all cognitive assessments, essentially.

182
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,780
So imagine if you are a participant in the Health and retirement study.

183
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,670
You have an interviewer who has got, you know, that calls you every two years or in this study.

184
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:03,370
And this question is administered the same way every two years.

185
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,459
And so there is a learning effect that could go on, right?

186
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,620
That you could actually begin to remember all the different words that you're will remember this test,

187
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,880
prepare for it, even you know, know that you better know what the day is in the day.

188
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:23,170
And then the other thing is that if you're on the telephone, I mean, who's not writing down the words that you're given?

189
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,030
Right. There's a possibility for that as well. Some of the some of the studies call that cheating.

190
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:36,769
There's a cheating marker that if the interviewer suspects that the respondent has written down those words, then they'll,

191
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:41,650
like make a note that they think there's just too much accuracy that they've remembered, remember too many of the words.

192
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:50,020
So that's just something to think about when we're trying to assess this. So, you know, it it's a pretty messy assessment.

193
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:59,200
There's a number of different kinds of these tests that are just assessing cognitive function through these, you know, sort of screening tests.

194
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:05,740
This is a list of tests. It's actually coming from the reasons for geographic and racial differences in stroke study or regards.

195
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,600
This is a fantastic study. It's ongoing since 2003.

196
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:16,420
They assess people every year by telephone as well as some in-person visits.

197
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,480
The sample is about 30,000 people. Half of the sample is black and half the sample is white.

198
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,000
So it is the only study that actually gives a racially diverse sample with

199
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,560
respect to black and white race to examine differences in cognitive function.

200
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:40,180
So I had a grant that use the study to do a lot of work in understanding how neighborhoods are associated with cognitive function.

201
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:49,240
But the measures of cognitive function or data are the same kind of confusing or I'd say messy measures that are based on cognitive screens.

202
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:56,140
There is, you know, this there's a six item screener which is good like we just talked about, which is like global cognitive status.

203
00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:00,250
There's measures of learning, which is the wordless learning that we just did.

204
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,090
And then there's delayed recall, which is the memory and there's other indicators of orientation.

205
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:11,739
And then there are some all these things that are we actually create a factor score out of these which

206
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:17,080
seem to be more powerful and more reliable in predicting trajectories of change in cognition over time.

207
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:24,430
But one of the most actually powerful measures to actually assess cognitive function is this animal fluency test.

208
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:32,290
And let me show you what this is. This is a test that actually is very good at picking up on language and executive function.

209
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:41,230
So these are complex cognitive processing that are that we use on a day to day basis in terms of solving problems or complex action sequences.

210
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:54,189
So I'm going to give this test to you. It's called the basically the interviewer says to you, please name as many as many animals as you can.

211
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:59,410
So there's a typo here, please name as many animals as you can. You're going to be getting 60 seconds.

212
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:05,770
I'm going to press start and I want you to keep time on your fingers how many you're actually remembering.

213
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:09,160
All right. One, two, three. Go.

214
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:54,310
I've got 30 seconds left. 15.

215
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:10,310
5 seconds. And that's it.

216
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,890
All right. It's not hard, you know.

217
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,770
How many did you name?

218
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:33,940
32. 32. 21. 17, 18, 17.

219
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:40,270
24. How about you, Victoria? 25.

220
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:45,100
It gets to sort of be like, what is an animal, you know?

221
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:51,469
What do you like? Different.

222
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:55,220
Like fish are different. Exactly. Yeah. So that's allowed.

223
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:03,709
So different. Like you can do like a spaniel type a poodle, but that actually is allowed, which I didn't think.

224
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:08,300
You know, that seems like that's cheating. Yeah, but it's hard.

225
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,390
And you but you can imagine what's going on in your brain. You're trying to do that.

226
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:14,690
Like you're actually trying to think through what's an animal?

227
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,560
What, what? What is counting in an animal? What is it called?

228
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:23,180
Trying to go through all the different, you know, visual images, letter images that you might have in your head.

229
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,190
If you actually say something that's not an animal, you get points deducted. So.

230
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:36,050
Oh, no, yes, yes. So that is actually quite, quite powerful predictor of or an indicator of cognitive function.

231
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:41,930
The mean score of this in a cartoon is 17, so you guys were probably right around that in terms of that.

232
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,730
But he's got a huge distribution of what people can name.

233
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:52,880
And of course, there's a large inequalities in in responses to that.

234
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,780
I want to maybe just stop here and ask you,

235
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:06,200
do you think or do you think some of the differences in the number of animals people people can name that might vary by education, for example.

236
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:12,180
That's not actually someone's cognitive function. It's just exposure.

237
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:17,100
Exposure to, you know. Yeah. Education and schooling.

238
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:22,890
Before you left. Put me maybe where you live.

239
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:31,070
Exactly. Yeah. But anyway, so there are these large inequalities in dementia and cognitive function.

240
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:38,399
Some of the things we saw in regards is that the black participants had lower scores on this and fluency test,

241
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,780
but it wasn't actually as predictive of poor health outcomes.

242
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,579
So we were, you know, that there was this assumption,

243
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:51,030
there was this question whether there was actually tapping into some kind of education effect as well that wasn't specifically dementia.

244
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:56,310
But there are large differences in dementia in older adults.

245
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:59,310
This is a recent study that just came out at the end of October.

246
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:04,020
Jim Manley is a neuropsychologist at Columbia.

247
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,649
She's one of the principal investigators in the REGARDS study.

248
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:14,520
But she did this with the health and retirement study. This is using what's called the harmonized cognitive assessment protocol, or H pap,

249
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,729
which is actually taking a random sample of about 4000 people in HRC SE and doing extensive cognitive

250
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:30,900
tests and interviews with their caregiver spouse to get a good estimate of dementia in in the population.

251
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:39,420
Right. Because we just have a hard time diagnosing it. And overall, the prevalence of dementia is around 10%.

252
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:45,420
But there are large differences in the prevalence going up to 35% in those over the age of 90.

253
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,700
No differences by sex.

254
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:54,090
This is a relatively recent finding, I think, because it used to be evident that women had much higher rates of dementia than men.

255
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,850
But it could be that as women's education has been catching up to men's and you know that that's more prevalent,

256
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:04,440
that those differences in dementia are actually no longer significantly different.

257
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:14,550
But we see large differences in dementia prevalence by race and ethnicity, 15% prevalence in blacks compared to 11% in whites.

258
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:26,030
And again, our other category and 26% prevalence in the other category, which includes, of course, as we know, this grab bag in.

259
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:39,390
But yeah, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, Asians and I know that we should all get really upset with that other category yet again.

260
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:45,780
We're just talking about the higher prevalence of dementia in her, US and the other category that we don't.

261
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:52,319
Yeah, there's the other and then but we do see these tremendous differences by educational attainment

262
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,290
as well where less than high school has a 13% prevalence of dementia you can't see here,

263
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:01,530
but compared to college, which has only a 9% prevalence.

264
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:11,400
So if we're going to think about how we're going to actually do, you know, address cognitive impairment and dementia and plan for,

265
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,930
you know, the widespread impact of dementia, how are we going to treat it?

266
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:22,990
There are no effective treatments. This is a couple of quotes from different papers.

267
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:27,549
None of the pharmacologic treatments available today slow or stop the damage and

268
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:32,410
destruction that the of the neurons that cause Alzheimer's SIMPSON symptoms.

269
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,640
So we don't have any medical treatment. We have no way of treating it.

270
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:42,370
There's no radiation. There's nothing to actually effectively treat Alzheimer's disease or dementia.

271
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:47,770
So we have to think about how we can prevent it. So there's a genetic component.

272
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:53,140
There's a gene that is shown to be increasing the risk for dementia.

273
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,639
We can't do much about that,

274
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:01,629
but we can do a lot of things potentially to address some of the other risk factors for cognitive impairment and including things that are

275
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:13,450
affecting inflammation and the pathways that could actually stop flow of oxygen to the to the brain promoting things like physical activity,

276
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:22,030
again, to promote vascular pathways and vascular health as well as there's been associations of lower

277
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:27,760
incidence of dementia in people who are more socially interacting and more integrated within society.

278
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:34,510
And again, individuals with more formal years of education and better quality of education have a reduced risk of dementia.

279
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:41,020
So Josh Erlich mentioned this at his last last week when he was presenting on Vision.

280
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:46,030
But this is a paper that's been cited quite a bit, which is the Lancet Commission on Dementia,

281
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:50,769
which really tries to attribute and sort of identify what are the modifiable

282
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:55,000
risk factors for dementia and how much could they actually prevent dementia.

283
00:34:55,570 --> 00:35:05,440
So we talked last week about hearing loss. 80% of the dementia prevalence could be eliminated if we got rid of hearing loss.

284
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:12,040
But some of the other factors down here, like social isolation, physical activity, air pollution, you know,

285
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:18,160
these are things that are happening that people are exposed to throughout the life course that could actually have an impact.

286
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:23,140
And we could actually if we could address those things, we could manage and minimize dementia.

287
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,550
One of the biggest factors is 7% here.

288
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:36,700
Early life is education, and so 7% having more education in earlier life could actually reduce the prevalence of dementia by 7%.

289
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:44,620
And we've we've seen this that really education is such a big part of what is affecting dementia risk.

290
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:53,920
We've seen this is data from Ken Leggett's paper comparing the prevalence of dementia or cognitive impairment in 1993,

291
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,650
in 2002 in the Health and Retirement Study.

292
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:05,890
And you can see that severe cognitive impairment, the prevalence has gone down in this period as well as the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment.

293
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,280
So there's been a reduction in dementia.

294
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:14,410
We know that dementia is actually declining, but because of the aging of the population, the prevalence is increasing.

295
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:19,749
But one of the reasons why people think this is declining is because of the increases

296
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:23,800
in education that have occurred in the more recent cohorts of older adults.

297
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:31,510
So in between in 1990, half of the older adult population had finished high school.

298
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,640
In 2008, that number was 77%.

299
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:41,410
So there's been a huge increase in the number of older adults more recently that have finished have achieved a high school education,

300
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,640
and it also an increase in those that have achieved college education.

301
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:52,660
And so education has really been thought of in a number of ways to benefit and to prevent cognitive impairment.

302
00:36:52,690 --> 00:37:02,740
And part of it is this cognitive reserve hypothesis, which essentially is getting at the idea that even if your brain is getting,

303
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:08,560
you know, having the symptoms of dementia or not, I shouldn't say symptoms has the pathology of dementia.

304
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:14,290
And I should say that the dementia pathology actually is said to happen about 20 years before you even start to get symptoms.

305
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:18,489
So we're all demented or we all have Alzheimer's pathology,

306
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:24,430
but it's not necessarily going to make us demented in terms of the declines in function and declines in memory.

307
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,250
And part of it is, they say, is that education,

308
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:35,559
people who are with higher education have the capacity to still perform at a normal functional level in terms of memory and function,

309
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,520
even if their brains are deceased.

310
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:43,930
And it could be potentially for a number of different reasons.

311
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:52,990
But there's, you know, that the networks have more capacity so that the the, you know, our intellectual edge, you know,

312
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:58,389
the intellectual processes that happen in education with higher education and the,

313
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:01,629
you know, the occupations that you can end up going in with higher education,

314
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:07,600
which require more complex thoughts that your brain is actually like in better physical fitness,

315
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:16,900
that it's got more neurons that are actually more robust and more less susceptible to this decline in the products.

316
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:22,870
But it could also be that people who have higher education, that their brains are more active.

317
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:27,340
They're actually even if there's a plaque there, they can bypass that.

318
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:33,070
They the ability to tap into other parts of their brain to actually then compensate for that decline.

319
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:40,290
And this idea came from a study that was done in 2000 about London taxi drivers.

320
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:45,220
Has anyone been to London taking a taxi? No, there's not.

321
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,030
There's the system. And the system does not exist in London.

322
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:57,160
So taxi drivers before GPS, you know, really had to know their way around the London taxi London Street System.

323
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:06,490
And they found that the longer that these taxi drivers had been driving in London, the actual more they had more brain volume in their brains.

324
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,690
So this was an idea that if you keep your brain active,

325
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:16,690
then you can actually maybe mitigate some of the declines in dementia and mitigate the onset of dementia.

326
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:24,520
So we're going to get into this when we talk about it, when we're talking about the papers today.

327
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:29,740
And that's why that some of the work that's been done is looking at sort of complex occupational career.

328
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:37,330
So, you know, what kind of work do you do? Is it just mindless work or is it something that requires some complexity to keep that brain active?

329
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:44,410
In addition, you know, other things like social interaction can actually strengthen processing and working memory skills.

330
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,780
So in the work that we did with the regard study, we really focused on this idea that,

331
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:53,410
gee, where you live could actually be a source of cognitive reserve.

332
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:58,060
If you have to live in a place that gives you more opportunities for physical activity,

333
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:02,320
then you might actually then be able to prevent cognitive decline.

334
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:07,059
Or if you have more opportunities for social interaction like, you know, community centers,

335
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:12,130
senior centers and intellectual stimulation like libraries and bookstores,

336
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,930
would that actually mean that you could actually have a slower rate of cognitive decline?

337
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:24,160
And so Jessica Finley is, as someone who really took the lead with this kind of work, and she did indeed.

338
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:36,040
Indeed, she did find that if older adults in regards and if they're living in areas with more coffee shops and like fast food,

339
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,240
which is kind of small places where people could gather and engage in conversation,

340
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:46,750
had better cognitive function, living in areas with more civic and social groups.

341
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:56,670
So these are the things like civic organizations like the Legion or Rotary Clubs and better cognitive function and living in areas,

342
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,140
more senior centers, just giving you better cognitive function.

343
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,130
So these are we did not find that any of these resources shaped the rate of decline in cognitive function,

344
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:13,030
but there were strong differences in just a cross-section section that with these living in an area and having lived in an area with these resources,

345
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:19,540
was associated with better cognitive function. And she coined this term cognitive ability, which is like walkability.

346
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,450
And if you click on her in this link here,

347
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:28,180
it takes you to the Web site where you can actually put in your address and it will tell you how cognizable your neighborhood is.

348
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:34,870
So it's been sort of a new a new direction to think about how we might prevent dementia and cognitive impairment.

349
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:38,640
When we can't. We there's no treatment and we can't diagnose it at least.

350
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:43,240
What can we do to buttress and support people and resilience?

351
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:55,790
Okay. So now we only have one question. Does that mean that if you live in a big city, that's kind of like a protective act for the nation?

352
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:03,919
Not necessarily. Victor, you want to say anything? I actually was just thinking I don't know if it's really a study in nature.

353
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:13,100
And that came out this year in March of 2022 is called The Entropy of City Streets claimed his future spatial navigation ability.

354
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:19,729
And these researchers at King's College then created the video game and cognition task.

355
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:23,030
And now they have a sample size of like 400,000 people.

356
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:29,650
And it's enormous. And then they took a bunch of demographic data on the people who took the video game,

357
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:39,920
people who grew up in big cities that were more complicated, like ones that performed better later, grew up in cities like New York or Chicago.

358
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:46,170
And like this, it's related to similar to like likability and overall like green spaces.

359
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:55,139
Yeah. Very interesting. Yeah. So again, from a life force perspective, what have you been exposed to over time?

360
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:58,350
What has promoted, you know, kept you going in terms of your cognitive function?

361
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:05,129
And then, Emily, to answer your question, I think studies can be useful in terms of having that stimulation, but they can also be risky.

362
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:09,060
So one of the things that's in Jessica's cognitive abilities score is a polluting site.

363
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:17,850
So if you know that proximity to highways and polluting sites is actually associated with very robust risk associated with worse cognitive function.

364
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:24,660
So it depends on your neighborhood, it depends on your environment. And this work that she does is all based on the census tract area.

365
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:30,210
So it's very localized. So I think sort of depends on which neighborhood you live in within that city.

366
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:41,440
Any other questions, comments or thoughts? Already.

367
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:45,730
Okay. So now we've got two presentations we're going to do today.

368
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:52,850
Let's see. Do you want to go first, Lexi? When I had the.

369
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:59,470
What was it called? Yeah. Okay. Right.

370
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,979
The role of occupation. Do you want me to email it to you or.

371
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:08,010
I, i. I can pull it up here.

372
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:15,820
Yeah, just in my head. Is it in?

373
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,670
It's in the campus. Yeah. I just thought this.

374
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:39,480
Now, has there been any research really stratified types of socialization like just with like other older people or like with children,

375
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:50,120
women by stratifying places like just kind of passing out like all the different types of, like, socialization.

376
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:59,220
I'm multitasking here and I'm failing. What's your task to do about it?

377
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:17,180
Yeah. Or is it just. Yes, I did.

378
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:21,030
Yeah. I was like, you know what?

379
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,490
Don't you do? It's okay. Yeah, yeah, whatever.

380
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:30,310
I'll do what I do. Okay.

381
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:41,389
Just on this. You also just press the down.

382
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:46,240
But there was nothing you could do. Okay.

383
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:57,010
All right. So let's see is going to dive deeper and talk about how occupation experiences over the life course might be related to cognitive function.

384
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:06,370
Yes. So I'm going to be talking about this paper about the role of occupation in explaining

385
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:14,140
cognitive function in later life and education and occupational complexity in the US.

386
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:29,820
Between black and white. So some background education is positively associated with cognitive function in later life.

387
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:41,520
And this is due to the access to healthier ways of living, healthier foods, health care.

388
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:47,410
Because education by way of like.

389
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:53,860
Better education or higher income usually.

390
00:46:55,350 --> 00:47:04,450
And there's also a positive association between complexity of work as a as an adult and a cognitive function in late life.

391
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:10,330
However, racial minorities are less likely to have jobs that equate to their education level.

392
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:21,620
And so the objectives of this study were to study racial differences in occupational complexity and to analyze

393
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:29,350
the mediating effect of complexity of occupations on the association between education and late life cognition.

394
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:42,860
So they're not looking at like age, which they kind of did a little bit in the end or whether they currently held a job or their geographic region.

395
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:48,410
Really, that was just part of like the regards study, which is where they ended up collecting the data from,

396
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:56,390
but they're mostly looking at education, race, occupational complexity and late life cognition.

397
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,520
Yes. So they ended up.

398
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:12,870
We talked about the regard study today the reasons for geographic and racial differences and stroke cohort study and their inclusion criteria

399
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:23,460
where they all had to be community dwelling resident people who and the people in the study were non-Hispanic black or non-Hispanic white,

400
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:32,940
and they ended up including participants 7357 participants from a cohort of three 30,000.

401
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:40,230
Their exclusion criteria were people who they didn't include anyone who had been self employed.

402
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:43,560
And I'll tell you why in the next slide,

403
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:49,560
people who are on a waiting list for a nursing home because they're worried that that

404
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:56,460
would change from the community dwelling people who may have a diagnosis such as cancer.

405
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:02,880
I think they were worried that they might lose them to follow up because they followed them every two years.

406
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:17,700
Yeah. So this is where this comes in. Participants were asked what their highest educational attainment was their self-reported age,

407
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:24,600
gender and race, and the longest job that they held and the job that they held.

408
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:31,830
That's part of why they weren't allowed to talk about like why they weren't included if they were self-employed,

409
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:46,290
because the job that they held was given was put into an honor system, which was which has a certain category and like an occupational category.

410
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:52,830
And there was a study done that, like I'm trying to think of how to explain it.

411
00:49:54,360 --> 00:50:00,540
There were 11 categories such as deductive reasoning, active learning, gathering, necessary information,

412
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:07,020
frequent decision making, and there's like a whole list of all these occupations.

413
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:13,880
And in order to talk about in order to give a,

414
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:18,420
like a complexity score to different jobs and like self-employment was included and

415
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:22,650
all those because it's so different in all the different types of self-employed jobs.

416
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:29,040
And so each person was given like a complexity score.

417
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:35,490
And so every two years people would come back for cognitive function like follow up,

418
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:41,190
and they were tested for their learning, their memory and their executive function.

419
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:55,420
And so in the end, more than 10% of blacks didn't complete high school as compared to less than 4% of whites.

420
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:05,950
Black women had the lowest mean substantive complexity scores and less than high school and high school categories,

421
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:15,760
while black men had the lowest in some college and greater than or equal to college but just graduated college.

422
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:23,920
All gender age stratified groups had significant associations between education in late life cognition.

423
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,370
However, the only group that was not positively associated was white men.

424
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:36,170
And that was kind of first. Okay.

425
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:43,370
And so here's where we get to the mediated scores by a complexity of their occupation.

426
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:48,300
So right here, this is the men and this is the women.

427
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:55,860
Sorry, I'm standing in front of it. So the where is it?

428
00:51:56,130 --> 00:52:01,800
The can't see the college graduate or above category.

429
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:07,290
The only significant association that they're seen was in white men and.

430
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:23,520
The smallest mediation was always seen and I'm going to talk about that know the lowest mediation effect

431
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:29,120
was in the category of some college versus high school graduates for all categories except for white men.

432
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:40,740
And I yes. You talked about the white men was the only group that had the significant association in the college graduate or above category.

433
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:57,270
And this is important because it supports the cognitive reverse hypothesis that right about how jobs and it's talking in this could be they talked

434
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:03,509
about how like job simplification does not just result in like short term

435
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:10,020
consequences like economic problems or health issues such as like depression,

436
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,740
work ethic, attention at work.

437
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:22,050
It can also result in long term consequences such as like worse cognitive function later in life.

438
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:27,870
And they also discussed in the paper they kind of talked around it,

439
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:39,150
but I think they were getting at like the idea of designing jobs around like cognitive enhancement or like adding that into jobs like work,

440
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:43,110
workshops for skill development and like making sure that those were in their.

441
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:56,580
And some strengths in the paper were that on its items used were based on some pretty substantive research.

442
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:02,200
It looked like they were they used a.

443
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:15,260
Yeah. They studied the 11 items that were used for the job categories quite a bit from the study that I looked at.

444
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:25,400
And then they restricted data from those who had worked for a job for ten years or more, and then they also opened up the restriction as well.

445
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:28,639
So it's not like they were restricted, restricting themselves.

446
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,290
They could look at both groups. And the analysis was the same both ways.

447
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:44,570
The results were the same both ways. They looked at a broad range, range of professions from the large sample of black and white participants.

448
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:48,650
So they weren't really limited in legal way of professions.

449
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:54,170
And they look they use a strong mediation analysis.

450
00:54:54,950 --> 00:55:02,810
One limitation of the on that scale is it looks it doesn't really look at unique experience and psychosocial factors.

451
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:10,460
So the unique experience of different races, it doesn't account for that within the work experience.

452
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:22,460
And so people like black men and women are more likely to be biased towards the null in the results.

453
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:37,620
And then another limitation is the regard study only used one wave of study data and longitudinal study you may be better for.

454
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:47,460
But our analysis. So some discussion questions that came up with, um,

455
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:54,770
one of the limitations that I talked about was the own that's generalizing of job psychosocial characteristics.

456
00:55:55,550 --> 00:56:02,570
How could this be changed to account for the unique experience such as those people of a different race or gender?

457
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:14,780
In this paper it was discussed how a person as people I didn't I guess I didn't mention that, but it did mention how people as people grow older.

458
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:20,300
Racial differences in cognition increase. What can be done to mitigate this?

459
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:27,860
And so could be policy, racial, local programing, accessibility, etc.?

460
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:35,540
And then why would white men not have the positive association between education and late life cognition?

461
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:47,960
Can you take us back to the point where it talks about what's used in own net to help with that job score?

462
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:53,270
Yeah. Yeah. Has anyone ever worked with Wood on this?

463
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:57,370
It's a it's a cool data source.

464
00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:04,070
And you it's a you know, you can actually just go into it and kind of see what the occupational complexity is of different jobs.

465
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:08,190
It's it's often used in the sense of reading the survey data.

466
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:15,630
But it is interesting that, um, things that are not in the workforce like some self-employed and not.

467
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:23,669
But what about childcare? You know, like raising children. Deductive reasoning, active learning that's going on, right?

468
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:29,909
There's a lot of stuff that could be gathering information. There's other things that, you know, other restrictions in the in this kind of work.

469
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:33,270
It obviously is limited because it's only paid labor.

470
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:39,570
Interesting. Yeah, like self-employment could be, like, really complex.

471
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,560
Yeah. If you're to figure, like, if you're building your own system from scratch.

472
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:47,220
Yeah. Like hustling for work. Yeah.

473
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:53,220
Sort of like defacto you would say that's actually quite complex, you know, so you can retain those people in the bottom.

474
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,330
It's great from your discussion question.

475
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:03,740
Yeah. I mean, so what?

476
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:11,450
Let's do this. How about take a couple of minutes just to think about one of these and what you kind of would like to hear, what you think about.

477
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:19,040
And then we'll do we'll just pair up and choose and you can kind of share some ideas about what you're thinking, maybe talk through it.

478
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:24,970
We'll do that for about 5 minutes and then we'll have a break and.

479
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:31,500
And then we will. Just a quick question.

480
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:36,560
You like the white men thing. So they so they what was so like?

481
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:40,820
It didn't matter how much education they have, they still or what was like the relationship.

482
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:46,249
It was a negative association between education and education.

483
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:52,220
White men had the worst. The condition. Yeah, it was like very, it was small but it was still like negative.

484
00:58:53,370 --> 00:59:02,450
Mhm. So yeah. Obviously a result that might give her that.

485
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:06,380
Yeah. It's like he says in the paper that I'm going to prison today.

486
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:14,870
They find that they early life education is positively associated with later life combination no matter in black or white.

487
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,430
Yeah. Maybe it's because. Danger limitation. Yeah.

488
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:23,530
Yeah. And this is that's early life education.

489
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:27,950
Yeah. And this is total education. Like the highest level of education.

490
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:31,080
Yeah, maybe. Strange.

491
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:35,020
Yeah, super weird. All right.

492
00:59:35,400 --> 01:00:16,450
Okay. And so the first question everything even things like when you just.

493
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:20,530
My experience is around that. Yeah.

494
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:32,660
Yeah. That was what was talked about. And why?

495
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:39,700
I wonder if there had been an intervention.

496
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:56,650
Yes, John. Yes, I know you've spent eight years in your career living their lives.

497
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:08,520
Get a standard of. I think it's something we're going to try and do again if you have minor.

498
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:16,800
Yeah, I know. High pressure job. Like some manager, right?

499
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:26,650
Yeah. As long as it really hard for Superman.

500
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:42,620
Yes. I really think part of the pressure pressures being like that. However, this means that there are a few new people.

501
01:01:45,780 --> 01:02:06,980
Maybe. But let me ask you whether these people do not want to be so sorry at the moment at the moment between the.

502
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:25,160
John Deere that much like most benefits, complete education levels in my life was quite no matter what I was doing at first.

503
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:30,070
So yeah, it definitely was.

504
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:42,250
The most potent medication was with an all time.

505
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:55,070
Yeah. Well, nothing personal. Like their complexity was the highest, but my.

506
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:21,900
Yeah. I just want to show that primary secondary school is a.

507
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:39,490
And I think especially the black executive, black residents, white just kind of made the energy, she says.

508
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:45,620
He's had a very large in the year degree.

509
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:49,650
This is part of the whole you're talking about.

510
01:03:51,080 --> 01:04:09,920
And Chris wanted to ask you, I guess, but considering how I feel about you and I feel like this is what I was into something,

511
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:14,430
that's what I try to make them interact with.

512
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:20,340
Yeah. It's. Have you ever been to a hospital?

513
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:37,790
Yeah. I. You know, I a lot of my friends, because I'm from almost 80% off I mean, I don't know, like jobs are to me.

514
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:41,860
Yeah, well, because that's hiring attorneys.

515
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:46,360
Yeah. Sorry. 15 years later.

516
01:04:46,570 --> 01:05:00,410
Yeah, I was. And I was like, I just thought it was so nice and much more because it's not.

517
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:07,110
I have. I'm not really into that now.

518
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:16,440
Yeah. Yeah. Because they like, you know, we all like just your business.

519
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:29,210
Yeah. So you can tell from up here like this and they're like, yeah, like, I don't know somebody I know or she's.

520
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:39,160
Yeah. Because they are related like celebrities and a lot more personal stories like.

521
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:47,000
I would ask that you had information because I saw that you don't have.

522
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,209
It seems like they didn't use that here.

523
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:58,940
And I'm just. One protocol that you have to take into account is cause it's called qualification college,

524
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:13,579
an obligation on oneself if you or your team get pretty to have are you wait to see something say something so much as it's so easy to get at it.

525
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:23,770
You should see what we can learn more about and they are probably going to and higher education or I know.

526
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:29,200
Yeah. You're hearing about him and her.

527
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:37,480
And I thought he went there to tell you how you learned the lesson I to preserve.

528
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:45,510
Yeah, right. Actually. And second of. Especially at this time of year.

529
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:51,510
Yeah, it's about the year I've seen the entire series.

530
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:56,590
Like something about education. I'm like, Oh, my God, you know?

531
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:00,420
Yeah. You try to make other things. Yeah.

532
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:06,550
Yeah. Yeah. 5 to 6 is very different.

533
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:27,490
And what are like the topics I tell my kids that I let's say, for example, most people have a session based on that and I know some I don't know.

534
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:38,290
I just have to say. That's how I responded to activate.

535
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:50,090
Make sure you know what it's.

536
01:07:52,710 --> 01:07:58,310
He's refusing to take. Like it's.

537
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:04,870
It is also important to note salvage operation.

538
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:12,420
I mean, according to my knowledge, pragmatism. I think you use a similar situation as any other.

539
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:18,000
And I know it's not that isn't really. Oh, that's nice.

540
01:08:18,690 --> 01:08:26,760
It's like there's going to be a separation, especially.

541
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:38,560
If you want a reason to communicate with others, especially during the relations with our families first.

542
01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:50,280
So you know for sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

543
01:08:51,030 --> 01:09:05,570
It could make that much easier when to get down to the top and come down off the top.

544
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:13,219
It really has to look like a traditional level of progression.

545
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:18,490
But we'll take a quick break and have a.

546
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:33,520
So let me turn this off. So you're not going.

547
01:09:35,530 --> 01:09:41,020
You know, you feel as like you want to just look and I think you do.

548
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:48,760
If you could just tell away from the cameras. Oh, it's on the other side as well, because, I mean, it's not published yet,

549
01:09:48,760 --> 01:10:00,160
but I feel like the PowerPoint version is more easier to use than a Google ask questions and they're be collected.

550
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:06,610
This one here. Yeah. You know, security is not scarce on the screen now.

551
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:15,690
And you don't have to leave your.

552
01:10:37,940 --> 01:11:02,070
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Not.

553
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:15,710
Well, I think the more I think about.

554
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:34,930
The filter application designs and designs for a lot of.

555
01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:43,730
Okay. She's right.

556
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:58,530
That's good, right? Because. I have like my.

557
01:12:06,970 --> 01:12:15,340
Right. Okay?

558
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:29,000
Yeah. Yeah. Actually, I'm not having that conversation.

559
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:33,260
I don't know which part should.

560
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:41,340
25,000. 20.

561
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:47,860
Terms of stories like that. It was intense, and it's actually that's national.

562
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:07,180
We don't know where the students are. You know.

563
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:27,260
So I just thinking about how the sanctions are the voices of the.

564
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:06,750
This was like 90 money. And that's something for me.

565
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:20,350
It's funny to me that what you're doing is a kind of old.

566
01:14:22,850 --> 01:14:30,100
Ladies and gentlemen, I have some wisdom to provide.

567
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:40,500
Like you're. That's.

568
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:49,700
Only because. Such numbers.

569
01:14:57,470 --> 01:15:09,200
Christopher Francis. Oh, program officials familiar with that just saying, listen, we want to do that.

570
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:22,070
What does this mean for you know, it's one of the things that we have to come out of the council areas with gender issues.

571
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:26,660
So just because it's usually chosen.

572
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:34,250
So I think you have to consider just how many.

573
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:47,190
Oh, yeah.

574
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:54,450
We before it was settled.

575
01:15:54,990 --> 01:16:00,460
How do you think this wasn't working?

576
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:08,310
Well. I. I feel like.

577
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:38,730
That's for sure. 2001 was named after the Falcons game, so it wasn't a true Tigers.

578
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:55,110
Year. All right?

579
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:13,410
Yeah. So this means that, you know, we're going to take a little bit away towards education and Justin is going to walk us through this.

580
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,950
Yeah, you just got me here, so.

581
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:25,739
All right. So the paper that I'm going to present today is race day in school attendance across the Jim Crow South and

582
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:32,880
its implications for black white disparities in trajectories of cognitive function among older adults.

583
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:41,070
So before we get started, I would like to introduce has historical background of this study.

584
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,040
So it's about the Jim Crow South.

585
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:53,939
So it is also known as Jim Crow laws, which are referred to at state and local laws that enforce racial segregation in US housing.

586
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:59,100
When I say as between 1877 to 19 fifties.

587
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:10,259
So the results of enforcing these laws, they result in severe racial segregation in all public facilities like this.

588
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:16,290
Two pictures. You could see that for the white persons and the color process, they use different facilities.

589
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,830
It's it happens in all public facilities.

590
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:25,740
So in this study, they collected both individual level data and state level data.

591
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:34,530
And for the state level data, they extracted them from 1919, 19, 19, 1922,

592
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:43,080
1953 and 1954 period, which was during the time that these laws were being enforced.

593
01:18:43,410 --> 01:18:50,340
So that's kind of the reason why they focus on black and white disparities during that time.

594
01:18:51,840 --> 01:19:02,729
So the objective of this study, first of all, several previous study has already identified that a different race, a differential,

595
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:12,200
self-reported years of schooling could result black white disparities in cognitive outcomes, differences among older adults.

596
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:21,270
But the the this study found that even after adjusting for the differential self-reported years of schooling,

597
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:28,890
there are still some remaining disparities in cognitive outcomes that are not explained.

598
01:19:29,130 --> 01:19:39,930
So the they hypothesized that maybe the differential rates of school attendance could also affect the disparities in cognitive outcomes.

599
01:19:40,170 --> 01:19:50,400
So they were wondering whether the differential rates of school attendance could explain more in the black white disparities in cognitive outcomes.

600
01:19:52,930 --> 01:20:01,930
So they collected the pulse individual how well do I steal our data and they extractive individual our data from the HRA study and they

601
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:13,180
X-rayed the state level data from the BI annual survey of education in the United States and this B data were collected every two years.

602
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:20,169
So that refers to another limitation that we will discuss later and they will

603
01:20:20,170 --> 01:20:26,470
link the PSC data to the HRC data by another single matter that they create.

604
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:38,499
They ask the respondents where they lived during their school age and for the respondents who didn't attend school, they ask them Where do they live?

605
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:41,799
Which state will living in your age?

606
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:42,640
Around ten.

607
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:54,400
So first of all, they extracted all the black and white, the respondents who lived in the southern part of the United States during their school age,

608
01:20:54,790 --> 01:21:05,530
and they should have began their primary school at 1990 or after 1919 and completed by 1954.

609
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:15,700
And then they excluded all the respondents who didn't have a cognitive matter from 1995 to 9 to 2016.

610
01:21:16,030 --> 01:21:20,650
And they also excluded the respondents who were missing a sampling weight.

611
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:26,590
So finally they got their analytic sample of 4003.

612
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:35,319
For our three participants and for all Americans of this study, they have two parts.

613
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:41,979
The first part is cognitive outcomes. They measure cognitive function, episodic memory and working memory,

614
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:49,150
which are you'll that in our data and exactly use the telephone survey that we tried before.

615
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:53,229
And for the second part is the adaptation part.

616
01:21:53,230 --> 01:22:00,670
They measured self-reporting of years of schooling and the duration in school and the duration of school measurements.

617
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:10,090
As kind of a newly constructed measure in their study, they designed a new formula to calculate this measurement.

618
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:22,870
So basically what they did is to they calculate another thing to magic why the self-reported years of schooling and this formula is the

619
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:32,890
sum of actual school days that the participants attended divided by the sum of maximum number of school this student could have attended.

620
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:39,520
So they think that by doing this, they could somehow normalize the days,

621
01:22:39,790 --> 01:22:50,859
the duration that these participants attend school and the covariates that they wore adjusted in this study include race,

622
01:22:50,860 --> 01:23:03,760
gender, education, cohort, interview mode and state apparatus, school age and the highest level of education completed by either parent.

623
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:09,669
And there are many missing values in their DNA.

624
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:16,990
So for their missing matters on their school attendance and time landslides in the five states,

625
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:24,700
there are five states that do that report, part of their school attendance and term last NBC data.

626
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:35,139
So they just do some VRA inspection and use linear regression to predict the estimates by state because they rewrite

627
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:43,060
is back dated the data and they find that there is or is there is a clear trend linear trend in this data set.

628
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:53,019
So they use linear regression to predict the estimates for the missing period by state and for the as we mentioned before,

629
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:58,750
the BBC two that were collected every two years. So they only have the data on every year.

630
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:01,929
They don't have data on odd years. So again,

631
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:07,959
the use of error is backwardation and the interpolated values using data from the

632
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:15,490
two adjacent years in each state and for the highest part parents allocation arable,

633
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:18,790
which is one of the covariates in this study.

634
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:27,340
And for the missing values in this variable, they just coded the missing observations as less than eight years of schooling.

635
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:37,000
This is because they have some previous studies showing that the people who didn't

636
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:44,140
respond their parent allocation information have similar house and economic profiles,

637
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:51,070
with two of the people who reported their apparent allocation as less than eight years of schooling.

638
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:55,180
So they just recall them as less than eight years of schooling.

639
01:24:55,810 --> 01:25:04,720
And for the statistical analysis they use the linear mix, the models and also the applied person level weights.

640
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:11,799
And these are the three models that they have used in their studies.

641
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:24,280
So as I mentioned before, there are three cognitive outcomes in total and these three models were used in each of these three cognitive outcomes.

642
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:27,070
So there are nine model models in total.

643
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:37,150
So the first model is the cognitive outcome related to demographics, parental allocation, childhood, state of residence.

644
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:40,809
And the model two is based on model one.

645
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:48,220
They additional all additionally added self-reported years of schooling and degree attainment.

646
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:55,630
And the Model three is based on the Model one additionally added adoration in school and degree attainment.

647
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:59,049
So by comparing the first of two models,

648
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:08,500
we could get the results of how much the black white disparities in the cognitive outcome were explained by this tool in your face,

649
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:12,640
which are the self-reported years of schooling and degree attainment.

650
01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:16,330
And by comparing the model three to model,

651
01:26:16,330 --> 01:26:26,860
while we could get information of how much that disparity were explained by these two durations, go and integrate attainment.

652
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:34,390
So to help us remember, like the saying,

653
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:42,760
the objective of the research question of this study is to measure whether duration in school could

654
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:51,850
explain more than self reported years of schooling in the race disparity in cognitive outcomes.

655
01:26:53,830 --> 01:27:00,810
So here are the results. So before they linking the two data,

656
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:11,350
they are looking at ABC data for us and they find that students attending black segregated schools have greater period of variation,

657
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:15,400
which is shown as a longer school year here.

658
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:26,350
And as second finding it found is that black students attended less school term compared to white students on average,

659
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:32,230
which is shown as appear like the mean value of, for example, for Alabama State.

660
01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:40,719
That means that black segregated schools where black students go is less than 1.6.

661
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:44,140
But here for the white students, it's more than six.

662
01:27:46,690 --> 01:27:58,030
And for the simple characteristics, we could say that for all of the cognition, health, including cognitive functioning,

663
01:27:58,030 --> 01:28:07,990
episodic memory and walking memory, all of these three cognitive outcomes that white people perform better than black people.

664
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:15,370
And one thing that we need to it's pretty interesting to me is that the age here,

665
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:22,360
the white participants is slightly older than the black participants because you're really aware,

666
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:28,270
think that cognitive functioning is not actively associated with age.

667
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:32,530
So as age goes up, your cognitive function could decrease.

668
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:39,190
But we could say that black people have lower age, but their cognitive function is worse.

669
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:49,270
So this kind of reinforce that there is a huge disparity among white and black people in cognitive functions.

670
01:28:49,540 --> 01:29:02,949
And one thing about the clinical cutoffs of the cognitive functioning questionnaires is that if your you'll have a score larger or close to 12,

671
01:29:02,950 --> 01:29:14,470
it indicates normal cognition. And if you have a score in the category of three, all 7 to 11, then you have cognitive impairment.

672
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:24,040
And this is a category that black participants may value lysine, which means average.

673
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:39,650
The black participants in this study have cognitive impairment and for the other scenes they had an average allocation and also the degree attainment.

674
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:45,370
The white adults perform better than black adults.

675
01:29:48,530 --> 01:29:52,280
And here are the results for their linear mix of the models.

676
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:58,790
So first of all, we look at everything that they set hx7.

677
01:29:58,790 --> 01:30:04,100
Sorry, we could say that in model one, model two and model three.

678
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:07,930
Let me maybe this. Yeah.

679
01:30:08,410 --> 01:30:13,149
At the age when they said age at seven history,

680
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:25,170
we could say that black being black is not actively associated with your cognitive functioning outcomes and being white,

681
01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:33,310
which is which means you said race variable because of that race variable is coded as one zero variable.

682
01:30:33,340 --> 01:30:37,390
If you're black, you're white. If you're white, you are zero or so of a constant.

683
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:43,100
The constant that results represents for the results of white people.

684
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:49,150
So being white is kind of positively associated with cognitive function.

685
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:58,180
And we could say that for the cognitive functioning here, compare one model, one model to our models.

686
01:30:58,180 --> 01:31:08,920
Or you could say that Model three has the relatively smaller decrease for the black adults in their cognitive function.

687
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:15,910
And the model three is the one that account for duration of school.

688
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:25,150
And a summary of this table, we could say here the figures that at both all of this tables,

689
01:31:25,450 --> 01:31:31,120
all of the cognitive functioning outcomes, they decrease as age goes up.

690
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:39,430
But this decreased trend disparity arrested, Chris, kind of constant in the cognitive function.

691
01:31:39,790 --> 01:31:50,380
And as age goes up and as age goes up, the episodic memory, this one, the disparity kind of going down,

692
01:31:50,710 --> 01:32:01,090
the disparity which is the the difference between these two lives and for the walking memory, the disparity is kind of going up as age goes up.

693
01:32:04,690 --> 01:32:08,980
So they'll finally be kind of.

694
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:21,560
The kind of proves their hypothesis that of all of the cognitive outcomes at all, the selected ages,

695
01:32:21,890 --> 01:32:30,140
that duration in school could explain more of the racial disparities in cognitive functions.

696
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:38,290
So the strengths of this study, first of all, is it construct a new measure,

697
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:44,799
which is that the original school and if you could remember that in that formula the last term is the CII,

698
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:48,580
which is the self-reported years of schooling.

699
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:57,760
So for me, I kind of understand this new way to construct the matter as a upgraded version of the traditional one.

700
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:10,629
So and and also they have compared the percent of this disparity and were explained by this newly constructed variation or by traditional narrative.

701
01:33:10,630 --> 01:33:16,900
And they have proved that the newly constructed measurement could explain more.

702
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:25,420
And then they have assessed this association across several different cognitive domains,

703
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:30,250
including cognitive function, episodic memory and the working memory.

704
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:41,260
And they also have taking consider of institutionalized racial equity by focusing on this specific time area.

705
01:33:41,740 --> 01:33:48,879
And they also pointed out the importance of examining state level differences in allocation

706
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:55,090
policies and practices rather than an average matter of school attendance for us.

707
01:33:56,890 --> 01:34:05,650
And here are some limitations to construct that new formula to the duration of school,

708
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:12,969
the kind of use several assumptions because they extracted their state level data from BCE,

709
01:34:12,970 --> 01:34:21,610
which our governmental government reported to do that instead of individual self-report data in BCG, that is,

710
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:33,820
it includes every information about like how many, how many days you attend school and your maximum that you could have attend a school.

711
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:40,630
So they assumed that each participants in this study really attend that school by a,

712
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:50,860
by the average stay that that report by the state government and also by learning when they link the b c data to IRS data,

713
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:56,710
they ask where the respondents lived during their school age or around age ten.

714
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:03,800
So this matter didn't account for those who moved between different states during that time.

715
01:35:03,820 --> 01:35:09,250
So they only ask which state used it most during that time period.

716
01:35:09,550 --> 01:35:14,230
So for these participants who moved a lot during that time period,

717
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:21,580
zero cognition outcome may be different, but they didn't account for that in this study.

718
01:35:21,910 --> 01:35:28,900
And also, except for adaptation and schooling, there could also be some other aspects caused by this Jim Crow.

719
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:42,790
And they did account for that. Either they only considered the schooling phase and they also point out several future study directions.

720
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:52,810
First of all, they think that the risks in equity use in school resources still exists even after the Jim Crow laws were stopped.

721
01:35:53,170 --> 01:35:56,530
And they think the but after Jim Crow,

722
01:35:56,530 --> 01:36:08,079
they think that the new aspects of this school resources approaches are largely a allocation such as at school quality,

723
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:15,160
content or contacts instead of the term class and school attendance that they measure in this study.

724
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:28,240
And they think that, oh, the following two part is my conclusion kind of is I think that we should not only focus on black white disparities,

725
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:35,440
but also we should focus on disparities across all other resources and more historically informed

726
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:41,890
data and studies are needed to accurately measure the early adaptation experiences of older adults.

727
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:49,630
Like in their studies, they create some new formulas, which is an upgraded version of their traditional measurements.

728
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:56,079
So and it questions if not, and there's other discussion questions.

729
01:36:56,080 --> 01:37:01,840
First of all, except for yourself, school integration team levels and school attendance rates,

730
01:37:02,230 --> 01:37:08,450
what do you think of any other measurements that can be used to assess schooling and adaptation?

731
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:13,629
Are they feasible enough? And secondly, except for adaptation,

732
01:37:13,630 --> 01:37:23,860
what are other potential factors that could have contributed to black white disparities in term in their cognitive function among older adults?

733
01:37:23,860 --> 01:37:31,780
And why? And what are some possible state and individual interventions that could be taken to eliminate arrestees?

734
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:38,290
School of tennis. This is kind of similar to Lexis second discussion question.

735
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:45,780
So yeah, that's I think that's ahead of the question.

736
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:54,300
So in the models that you have the years of schooling and they also account for highest degree.

737
01:37:54,630 --> 01:37:58,590
Yeah. Yeah. Degree of attainment.

738
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:04,860
Yeah. What do you think about that? Why why do they have to put degree attainment in there as well as duration of school?

739
01:38:05,430 --> 01:38:13,589
It's kind of like they before they consider to construct this new since they're

740
01:38:13,590 --> 01:38:20,459
we're thinking what could effect this disparity in later cognition outcomes.

741
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:25,460
And they found that it's self-reported years of schooling and degree attainment.

742
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:32,819
And for me, I think they think that their thoughts were that degree attainment is already a thing

743
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:41,440
that can be wildly explain the disparity so they don't need to appropriate it.

744
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:46,650
But the self-reported years of schooling they think is not accurate enough.

745
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:49,170
So they kind of operate it.

746
01:38:49,170 --> 01:38:57,650
They think instead of the self-reported years of schooling, it is the actual duration of school that effect this disparity.

747
01:38:57,690 --> 01:39:03,660
So they kind of. Yeah. So, like, why include why not just have degree attainment and something else?

748
01:39:05,730 --> 01:39:10,170
Because degree attainment could only explain part of it.

749
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:17,650
It cannot explain all of it, even though they include this duration in school.

750
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:22,670
You could say that here it still cannot explain all of it.

751
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:27,870
But they well, they always want to explain more why there is this disparity.

752
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:33,540
So they kind of trying to figure out how to explain more about this disparity.

753
01:39:34,230 --> 01:39:37,260
But I think that to a large degree.

754
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:42,439
Q While Coulson has read between the original story and cognitive function.

755
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:50,660
Yes, exactly. And also, I think degree attainment could somehow related to the duration in school.

756
01:39:50,930 --> 01:40:01,250
And I think that's part of the reason why they use linear mix the models because it can can adjust for the independence of the data.

757
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:10,940
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if it would take account of the fact that those two things are are just so tied together.

758
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:13,820
You know, degree attainment and years of schooling.

759
01:40:14,270 --> 01:40:19,820
But it we also think about which which one of those things is going to be associated with cognitive function.

760
01:40:20,150 --> 01:40:24,250
Is it the longest that you've been in school or is it the degree that you got?

761
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:29,930
Is it the credentials? You know, you can be in school for a long time and not actually have a degree.

762
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:33,350
Yeah. Just like a degree.

763
01:40:33,350 --> 01:40:36,710
Like, is that a proxy for, like, the amount of, like, engagement?

764
01:40:37,610 --> 01:40:40,460
Like, it's like someone who's in high school for ten years that never graduates.

765
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:49,890
Well, I, you know, like, is that because, like, were they really like receiving the of benefits at school if they were just there for ten years?

766
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:54,020
Right. And then they have a three of them. Does that limit what occupations they could go through?

767
01:40:54,050 --> 01:41:01,190
Yeah. And also, sometimes that degree attainment could also represent a little bit of your cognitive functioning.

768
01:41:01,190 --> 01:41:10,970
Like if you are cognitive very well, even though you didn't stay at school for long, but you still could have a degree.

769
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,660
So it's like that. They're kind to. Yeah.

770
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:23,030
Yeah. There's a flier out there. All right.

771
01:41:23,030 --> 01:41:26,900
Let's pull up there. Discussion questions. These are great.

772
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:32,930
Let's talk about this together. What about number one?

773
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:39,110
So you talk a little bit about degree attainment and then different kinds of school attendance rates.

774
01:41:39,110 --> 01:41:45,590
But what other measures can be used to assess schooling and education that would be important for cognition of.

775
01:41:47,390 --> 01:41:56,900
Sequence education, the timing of and education degree and their management structure life.

776
01:41:56,910 --> 01:42:00,230
The transition from high school to university of.

777
01:42:01,220 --> 01:42:05,750
High school to college and to university. I think there are some differences between college.

778
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:18,200
Um. Yeah. Yeah, well, it's like, I mean, colleges don't have graduate programs attached to them.

779
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:22,510
And then two year earnings euphoria and euphoria has been okay.

780
01:42:22,570 --> 01:42:25,580
Yeah. Like like Williams or Spice or.

781
01:42:26,090 --> 01:42:30,370
Like. No, it's like. It's like, I mean, they're like fantastic colleges.

782
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:34,550
They like to think the best in the country, but they don't have graduate schools.

783
01:42:34,730 --> 01:42:42,950
So once you finish undergrad, like you have to leave because there's no graduate programs like you can't go to universities have like both,

784
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:45,910
but you still have a degree. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

785
01:42:46,790 --> 01:42:52,100
Like you're saying that the timing of it so you're think what what are you thinking what's your hypothesis

786
01:42:53,090 --> 01:42:58,810
about the timing of like when you when you start different degrees or different parts of schooling?

787
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:11,440
I don't know, maybe that individuals have their like bachelor degree or are there the age of 18 who

788
01:43:11,450 --> 01:43:16,460
have higher cognitive function compared to those who have their bachelor's degree?

789
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:20,350
There certainly is. I don't pass it.

790
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:28,500
It's just a hypothesis. I wonder if your passport.

791
01:43:30,410 --> 01:43:34,580
There are times for integration of school at that time.

792
01:43:35,090 --> 01:43:46,570
I used to work for Denver Research Center here based in Dallas, and the director grew up in Richmond, Virginia, and he is a 65 year old black man.

793
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:54,920
But when he was born, technically Jim Crow was alive, but his school wasn't actually integrated until he was a junior in high school.

794
01:43:56,510 --> 01:44:06,090
Like. But conservatives in the South are dragging their feet to actually implement any changes.

795
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:12,240
He said it was wildly disruptive to his education because you have these, you know,

796
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:19,230
people you see every day and tell me in front of these eight year old classes with all white students and one or two black students and.

797
01:44:20,850 --> 01:44:30,650
I mean, anecdotally, the three other students, you know, when they integrated his high school who also pursued in class and all have years.

798
01:44:31,490 --> 01:44:42,090
So I just I think I wonder if like adding some sort of measure of actual integration time because we have the legal like illegal dates,

799
01:44:42,090 --> 01:44:46,440
but that's not the reality. Yeah, that's a great point.

800
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:51,380
What are those data out there? Yeah. Or if you have to collect it, sort of like from a qualitative.

801
01:44:55,380 --> 01:45:00,630
I know that the regard study has linked their confidence with measures of school quality.

802
01:45:01,830 --> 01:45:05,639
I think, you know, getting at, I think some of these historic databases,

803
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:15,330
but the average term length like how long people are in school you to find this but things around like whether books

804
01:45:15,330 --> 01:45:26,080
were available to take home or the school and teacher absenteeism teacher student ratios and those kind of things.

805
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:31,229
Yeah, that's kind of the thing that there are all sorts of there's not a point always saying

806
01:45:31,230 --> 01:45:37,379
that we should marry different participants by cohort because I differ in time point.

807
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:46,500
The historical background is different, so the historical things could affect whether you attend school or not.

808
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:52,740
Something like that. And I was thinking that not only in this study, maybe in other studies, that,

809
01:45:52,980 --> 01:46:00,420
for example, you measure diet, diet habitats, diet lifestyles for different cohorts.

810
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:09,389
They may have different lifestyles, diet and have different house behaviors due to the historical background.

811
01:46:09,390 --> 01:46:14,280
So for example, in China, for example,

812
01:46:15,180 --> 01:46:25,919
for before before the alcoholic consumption was identified as actually harmful for people's health and people in China,

813
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:35,729
I think drinking alcohol could help your body, especially your cardiovascular system, work better.

814
01:46:35,730 --> 01:46:41,160
So people tend to consume some alcohol before.

815
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:50,220
But now, as it is proven that alcohol consumption is harmful for health, so people tend to lower their consumption of alcohol.

816
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:58,440
So for these two different cohorts of population, they have different alcohol consumption behaviors.

817
01:46:58,770 --> 01:47:06,479
So that's something like this. Yeah. So. I mean, I guess a centrist is really very problematic.

818
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:13,080
But I'm curious, like what the pros and cons would be of using them as a proxy for like the amount of schooling.

819
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:20,040
Yeah. More education. Yeah, I started thinking that too. But then I was like, okay, depends on what we're actually trying to measure.

820
01:47:20,580 --> 01:47:24,720
Is it the amount of time that a person use their brains?

821
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:31,800
I can't answer faces and like to a certain extent when they're younger and are remodeling that,

822
01:47:33,630 --> 01:47:41,190
in which case like all these different factors school attendance, quality, you know, the teacher absence.

823
01:47:43,110 --> 01:47:49,380
And like having subs and all that, because that would impact how much you're actually using your brain per day.

824
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:55,830
So yeah, I think that's what we're trying to model is like how much you're using your brain every day while you're down.

825
01:47:56,430 --> 01:47:58,650
Exactly. And so yeah, yeah.

826
01:47:58,950 --> 01:48:07,230
So the testing may not after that, but it would be a good model of like what your actual cognitive ability is at that time.

827
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:14,180
But it's also hard to measure of like how to measure that is something problematic.

828
01:48:14,190 --> 01:48:21,630
Yeah. Yeah. The third, um, I don't know, I was just thinking like they have like reading and like,

829
01:48:22,290 --> 01:48:25,380
you know, how you go in and do like the reading tests when you're younger and stuff.

830
01:48:26,250 --> 01:48:35,730
Um, I didn't know because I think they keep those scores, um, or like reading interventions, I guess you could even measure like how many,

831
01:48:35,820 --> 01:48:44,790
um, extra resource teachers and stuff that they have in schools, um, how often they use those schools.

832
01:48:45,120 --> 01:48:48,220
Um. Whether they exist.

833
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:55,030
Yeah. Yeah. Like a district, it sounds like.

834
01:48:55,530 --> 01:48:59,410
But I know nowadays I'm, like, released from, like, a year from.

835
01:49:00,250 --> 01:49:10,659
They had, like. Paul, the public school system in some studio in Florida they do they know they like have like a school district take like

836
01:49:10,660 --> 01:49:19,750
us didn't arrived just to see how the school performs and they actually can be detailed to individual school level.

837
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:25,300
So I wonder, is that like a way to actually determine like school policy wise?

838
01:49:26,110 --> 01:49:37,839
Because like, again, like a student grade indicate like a lot of what's going on stands like for the for the years that,

839
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:41,770
you know, this research was conducted. Yeah.

840
01:49:41,830 --> 01:49:45,280
I think there's a lot of, you know, the standardized testing in those testing.

841
01:49:45,290 --> 01:49:47,610
I think there is also to allocate funding right to.

842
01:49:48,170 --> 01:49:55,240
You know, if you're not performing well at your school, then you have implications for the funding of that school.

843
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:59,080
But I also think, you know, I don't know how well those testing scores.
