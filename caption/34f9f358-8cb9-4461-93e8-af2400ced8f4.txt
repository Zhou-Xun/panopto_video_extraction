1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:17,620
Good morning, everyone. So thanks for being here and I am distracted by it.

2
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:44,950
Okay. So today the plan is to finish what we have from last year to last week and start a new section on newborn screening and a new logo for that.

3
00:00:47,450 --> 00:01:01,150
Let's see. So we all feel so that's due Thursday, Tuesday before class.

4
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:07,960
If you have any questions, I got some questions. I'll try to get to them today.

5
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,030
And if you have any questions, make sure to email me before the time line.

6
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:20,830
And I need you all should have problems at three.

7
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,230
Yeah, I know. Yeah. I'll be here today.

8
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:32,139
April hours. So it's 1030, 1130, second floor.

9
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,650
It should be on the syllabus. Yes.

10
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:40,060
So you should have a problem. 350 for that.

11
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,770
Make sure to look through it if you if you get at the keyboard,

12
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:57,759
most people did okay if you got it 14 or like you see that there are lots of comments in your in your problem set.

13
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:05,490
Make sure to go through the answer key and know what you got prompts that you don't do the same mistakes in the exams.

14
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:12,640
Most people had the form of the likelihood function correct.

15
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:22,749
So this form and then even the like plugging in the numbers, they got the form right.

16
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:29,770
But then when it comes to actually calculating the lots or there were some errors there, so make sure you do your calculations right.

17
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:39,140
Works within the brackets. You then add the top terms and divided by them all.

18
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:48,800
So make sure to work through the math tactfully. But you don't do the same mistake in the exam room.

19
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:55,760
Any questions on that? Okay.

20
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:07,400
So you should have all those with you. And I did post the solution to the quiz for We can do it today if you want my.

21
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:14,330
And then. So let's.

22
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,690
Let's. Last time we were working on this.

23
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:29,040
The practice problems that I was having to refrain from trying to break down haplotypes for those people who are double heterozygous.

24
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,340
So let's kind of refresh our memory and what we were doing.

25
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:46,670
You go through the problems and I'll answer any questions that you have, any questions before we get started.

26
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,040
Okay. So this was kind of the.

27
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,670
So this was part of the practice problems that we had.

28
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:09,370
We had one Audi, so we had 1500 people who were genotyped to loci, the gene and the age.

29
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:18,940
And then for each of those loci, there's two options big load and G and then we gave of H, big H, little H.

30
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:27,520
And then these are the observed frequencies of the different genotypes.

31
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:36,920
Then we did calculate the number of people simply by multiplying frequency by the number of people

32
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:47,710
at point one and 16,000 to get 150 for this first and didn't have any questions up to this point.

33
00:04:54,070 --> 00:05:04,300
Okay. So, so next, when we're trying to do is calculate the observed haplotypes.

34
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:12,730
So remember, haplotypes are a combination of the same of the two, two or more snips on the same strand.

35
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,170
And then for four all of these, it's pretty straightforward.

36
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:28,680
But then when it comes to this, this kind of genotype, we were we need to do a little bit a little bit more calculation.

37
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:34,390
Some of you were able to figure it out, but I had to kind of like write it down to really see it.

38
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:42,100
So so I think the best way to think about it is that snip one could be.

39
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:52,419
Okay. So snip one. So let's call the snip one.

40
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,739
The G, the big g, the g.

41
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,210
And then it's meant to be the big h h.

42
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:14,320
It's not set right. So I'm just going to try to use a kind of table to kind of think about all the haplotypes that I could have for those people.

43
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,050
So. So I can have a combination of split one.

44
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,220
So I'm doing and I'm doing these people. Okay.

45
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:30,290
So for snap one, I could have a big G and a big H combination.

46
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,880
So that would be one haplotype.

47
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:43,610
And then I could have a little g big h haplotype, I could have a big g, h, I could have a little g, little h haplotype.

48
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,670
So these are the possible haplotypes for those people.

49
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:54,780
Okay. And then just looking at the number of people I have, 389.

50
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,690
And so each of each person of these has two, two copies.

51
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:10,020
So we're looking at two chromosomes. So I know that of the GLC there's 389 of the little G O'Neal.

52
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:20,280
These are like column total, 389 389 for the Big H, 389 for the little H.

53
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,960
Okay. Okay.

54
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:33,030
And then if I add those, then I would get the number of haplotypes, which would be the 778.

55
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:41,160
Okay. So now the question gives us that ten where it says that there are 270 g h.

56
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,630
So I know in this box here I have 270.

57
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:51,930
Okay. And then just by simple math, I know I'm going to be able to fill in.

58
00:07:52,080 --> 00:08:05,459
So if I have this many copies of the Big H and I know 270 are taken for this haplotype, I would know that for here I would have 119 left.

59
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:11,640
So 389 -270, I would I would know that I have this, this many with this haplotype.

60
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:22,600
Okay. This year. What about this haplotype here?

61
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,270
How many would I have when 19 to.

62
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,940
So it's also 389 to 70 were taken for this haplotype so 119.

63
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,900
And then how many would be left for for this haplotype here.

64
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:47,460
70 to 70. Okay. And you would see here like all your math will add up across rows and column for the haplotypes.

65
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,710
So does that help to break it down? Like how to haplotype so distributed.

66
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,910
You would only have to do that for the case of double heterozygous.

67
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:06,930
And then as you fill in the number of haplotypes, those question marks would be the numbers inside the table here.

68
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,360
So that to 71, 19 to 70 would get the number of haplotypes.

69
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,030
Okay. Okay.

70
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:23,420
So since the key is already posted, I'll just go through the answers and see if you have any questions.

71
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:31,589
So for frequencies, this is just the simple number of haplotypes divided by the total number of haplotypes.

72
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,960
So the 3000,

73
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:42,920
we're going to calculate the to type frequencies and then we will use the haplotype frequencies to calculate that we have frequencies for big G.

74
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:51,770
That would be adding this frequency here, using this frequency here, and we'll do the same for all of these that levels.

75
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,180
And then this is maybe the new part. So the linkage is the equilibrium.

76
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:11,650
So the of the g h haplotype think always it's the measure of the observed minus expected under end of independence.

77
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:17,229
So this is what we observe. So 0.3173.

78
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:23,870
This is how many of this haplotype we observed minus a multiplication of values frequency.

79
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,660
So this is. This would be under independence. So if the G and H are.

80
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,500
Segregating independently, like they're not close to each other.

81
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:41,520
So then we would assume that this would be the haplotype frequency.

82
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,520
And so it's multiplication or at least frequency.

83
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,840
And then we would get a difference, which is point old for nine stream.

84
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:55,110
Okay. Any questions so far? Okay.

85
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:01,140
And remember, we said that this deal is not a perfect measure of linkage disequilibrium.

86
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:07,260
So we're going to calculate D prime there's and then there to refer back to the slides.

87
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:19,350
Two scenarios two ways to calculate d prime depending whether the D here this first D is zero or less than zero,

88
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:27,550
and then if it's better than zero, then we will be a division of d h.

89
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:36,750
So that 0.0493 that we got here and then we would choose whatever term is smallest out of these.

90
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,410
So we would calculate those two terms.

91
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:46,200
This 1.238 is the smallest and this is what we would use here.

92
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:57,630
And we calculated crime. So this is sort of like standard standardizing the D by frequency.

93
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:03,930
So remember how we said that the D is susceptible or affected by frequencies?

94
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:16,890
So D prime is a better measure because we kind of take into account the frequencies and then calculated adjust, adjust the D for that.

95
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:29,970
And then this question is asking about how l d will kind of break down over time after seven generations.

96
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:36,060
So this would be a factor of the original D and then the theta and the time.

97
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:42,090
So we'll fill in. Um, this, it's just the d we just calculated.

98
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,879
And then when minus theta to the power of T, so theta is given to us as point three.

99
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,530
That's a combination faction and then T is seven generations.

100
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:57,420
Okay. So that means in seven generations the.

101
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,530
Linkage disequilibrium will kind of go away.

102
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:05,090
It's kind of close to zero. So. Oh.

103
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:12,150
Closer to equilibrium? Yes. More like deep prime in R squared.

104
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,180
Is there like a threshold for like high versus low?

105
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:27,280
So I guess mostly for R squared, we would say that 0.5 is like moderate.

106
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,870
I mean, things like nine is kind of correlated.

107
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,570
It's not they set like what threshold you would use.

108
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,040
Similar to how we use in our screens and other studies. It's kind of relative.

109
00:13:52,060 --> 00:14:12,180
Are they questions on the of disequilibrium. Do you want me to go over quiz for?

110
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:21,640
Based on your. No, it's pretty straightforward.

111
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:28,630
I think most people do. Okay. And I have a key if you have more questions.

112
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:34,320
I mean. Okay.

113
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,330
Okay. So that's kind of how you should start something.

114
00:14:47,360 --> 00:15:03,150
You have seen the exam, but we'll try to work through this and use that union in these campaigns.

115
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:15,889
Okay. So we're going to be starting a new section looking at newborn screening programs and then conditions that would start

116
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:23,750
early in childhood or kind of genetic diseases that would start either early in childhood or they have more adult onset,

117
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,920
which we'll talk about next week.

118
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:41,750
And then I think we have one lecture to eugenics with that, and then we will shift more into ethical legal affairs.

119
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:51,860
And so for all of these studies we're going to have over all of these diseases, I'm going to have.

120
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,959
It's kind of hard to know what you need to know about it because there could be a lot of information.

121
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:09,970
So I'll have a study guide for Exam two for you to look at early on as you review this material so exempt you will be on canvas or before time.

122
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:19,990
So it's good to kind of stay up to date or stay on track with what you need to know for all these different conditions.

123
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:27,500
Oh, yeah. So today for a newborn screening program.

124
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,460
So how many of you kind of have an idea what I mean when I talk about newborn screening?

125
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,620
So what do you think about screening in general? What do I mean when I say screening?

126
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:57,220
Yeah, you can. Valuation evaluation. How do you think that would be different from I don't know if you've heard the term like diagnostic tests or um,

127
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:10,110
so we are evaluating if someone is, has a disease or has a mutation maybe, but screening is, is generally applied to asymptomatic people.

128
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:16,980
So people who do not have any like they didn't come to the doctor did not have any symptoms.

129
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:21,269
We're going to apply testing on a like a wide scale.

130
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:29,520
We're going to kind of test everyone. So what do you think would be a criteria for us as public health professionals or

131
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:40,349
practitioners to kind of apply this kind of wide scale intervention where we're going to say,

132
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:46,860
oh, we're going to test like in this case, we're going to test all newborns for those certain conditions.

133
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:53,690
What what do you think would make the cutoff point for for for for testing?

134
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,200
Yeah, it should be like relatively accurate.

135
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:05,850
Like you should know it says you're going to develop disease that you will you don't know how how accurate it has to be.

136
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,910
Yeah, definitely. So we should have a good test. I should have a good test for it.

137
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:19,110
A test that is kind of maybe low code, low cost, not very expensive.

138
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:28,080
That gives us good results. So you could hear like things like sensitivity specific, like how well this test works,

139
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:36,540
how likely it is to me to have like because not none of the tests would be perfect.

140
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:40,170
Some test would give you false positives. Some tests would give you false negative.

141
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:48,060
Of course, we want to minimize those. We should have those at sort of low before we kind of implemented tests that

142
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:53,910
would kind of would yield sometimes false positive or false negative findings.

143
00:18:54,390 --> 00:19:01,380
So what else? Yeah, I think it should be pretty quick, especially with like you don't want to wait two weeks for your results.

144
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,489
Exactly. Yeah.

145
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:10,260
So yeah, if you're like telling people you're testing and then you really want to be able to run that fast and get them back to results.

146
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,970
Yeah. That kind of touches upon this other point.

147
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:24,510
Like you said, PKU, because it's kind of like life threatening and we need to kind of intervene quickly or do something about it.

148
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:32,820
So we should know. So it's so this is so screening would be applied to like life threatening or like

149
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:41,130
diseases that could have huge impacts on development or health anything else.

150
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,540
Another thing that might come to mind is like having something to do about it.

151
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:05,070
Like we don't want to just identify all those people and then just not have any

152
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,910
intervention or something to help them or treatment or something of that sort,

153
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:21,330
or even counseling or some form of knowledge on what the next steps could be before we identify those conditions.

154
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,140
So that kind of helps maybe set the ground of what we're going to be talking about.

155
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:38,430
So newborn screening programs are implemented in the U.S. and other countries,

156
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:47,700
and they've been around for a while in the U.S. since the 1950s or sixties.

157
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,669
They are applied in all states.

158
00:20:50,670 --> 00:21:05,480
There's some variation in what conditions are tested, but overall there's a bare minimum of conditions that are tested for for all newborns more than.

159
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:36,700
Okay. So so the beginning of the newborn screening program in the U.S. started with this condition that we will talk about in details today,

160
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:50,890
phenylketonuria, so PKU. So back in the 1930s, this Doctor Foley, he he had two two children with mental retardation.

161
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:59,259
And he found out that they do have a certain molecule and their urine.

162
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:09,970
So this molecule was higher than you would expect in what you would observe in an otherwise cognitively normal somewhat people.

163
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:17,800
So this molecule, this kind of acid was detected in the urine and you sort of make that association that

164
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:24,790
the mental retardation is sort of related to this molecule that is found in the urine.

165
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:39,200
And then about 20 years later, by kind of walking back the chemistry and knowing how this molecule is derived,

166
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:52,160
we had an intervention where a diet was developed that would limit the precursor for this acid to kind of help prevent mental retardation of PKU.

167
00:22:53,750 --> 00:23:03,530
And then it wasn't until the 1960 that we that Dr. Robert Guthrie had a blood test that would.

168
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,710
That was fast. I think they could test like 200 samples a day.

169
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:18,860
So it meant that pretty fast and somewhat accurate that we had the ability to test for PKU.

170
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:29,200
And if you read more about the that test. So. So the basic basically a prick for the heel from the heel of the infant would

171
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:37,520
would he would be able to get like drops of blood that that would be our sample.

172
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:49,370
And then that this the testing mechanism for PKU was on like a bacterial inhibition plate so that we had the guard plates.

173
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:57,379
And if you remember those from undergrad or high school biology, that would kind of grow bacteria.

174
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:03,680
But the fact but there would be a material or a compound that would prevent the bacteria from growing,

175
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:10,490
but then using the blood the blood spot that would have that philanthropic acid that

176
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,380
would kind of degrade that material and you would have growth of the bacteria.

177
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:22,280
So using that way, they were able to test for PKU or, you know, terrific acid.

178
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:33,350
So that was like the basic idea of that test that was that kind of kick started the newborn screening programs in the US.

179
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,680
Okay. So what do you notice about that test?

180
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:42,070
Like we're talking about? We're in genetic class. We talking about genetic disease.

181
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,480
Like, how how are we testing for those genetic diseases?

182
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,940
At least for a peek at you. Did we? So we're not doing any genetic testing.

183
00:24:52,940 --> 00:25:03,620
And in that case, we're just looking at a biochemical or a change in biochemistry that is indicative of this of this genetic disease.

184
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:10,300
Okay, so. So and that's. That's what we do up till till now.

185
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:19,300
So we have about 80 tests, 80 genetic diseases that we test for, and they're all tested.

186
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:29,999
Using. We'll talk about the method now, but it's not using actual genetic testing like we're not we're not looking at mutations.

187
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,560
We're not looking at genotypes.

188
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:41,790
We're just looking at changes in the biochemistry that could be related to a mutation or person being a carrier for a disease.

189
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:46,170
And any questions? Yeah.

190
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:54,030
It says, like, more than 80. Like diseases. And they're, like, expanding, like, once, like a criteria for, like it to be used in,

191
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:57,330
like, a whole population rather than maybe just like a specific something.

192
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,540
Yeah. So we'll talk more about it then.

193
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:08,310
The criteria would be similar to what we talked about, about it being like how prevalent it is,

194
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:12,780
is testing, would it be maybe having an intervention for it?

195
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:20,190
And then like in the U.S., there's there's a bare minimum like there's the panel of,

196
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,750
I believe maybe it's 28 diseases that every state should test for,

197
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,920
but there's like an additional panels that each state can decide whether it wants to test for it or not.

198
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,060
And with that comes like policymakers and I don't know, like at the state level,

199
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:45,060
that would be decided based on maybe how common it is or how much of it is seen in the state.

200
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:57,690
Yeah. So, yeah, so there's, there's this some sort of segregation, but there's like a fair amount of testing that that is applied anymore students.

201
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:07,250
Okay. So how how is this how are those tests done?

202
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:11,330
So these are done using tandem mass spectrometry.

203
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:18,200
So molecules are kind of separated based on charge and mass.

204
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:26,050
And this kind of tests can detect many disorders from a single blood spot.

205
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:35,480
It is relatively fast and then we can easily add testing for additional disorders.

206
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:46,730
So looking at you, I know this is kind of hard to see, but we'll, we'll try to see it.

207
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:59,840
So PKU is a disorder where the enzyme that changes final alanine into tyrosine is kind of not working as you would expect.

208
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:10,850
So in that case, you have a lot of the final alanine kind of sitting there and a lot less of the tyrosine, which is the product of that reaction.

209
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:24,980
And then so the the yellows here are kind of the the standard of what you would expect in an individuals with PKU.

210
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:34,370
So look here for the Senate and the level and the yellow here and then what it would be for a person with PKU.

211
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:41,989
So as you can see, the finish line would be much higher. And then for the terrorist scene, you would expect higher levels.

212
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:46,250
But what you observe is less in individuals with PKU.

213
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:54,050
So that's how we're kind of able to tap to say that this baby likely has PKU.

214
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:12,810
Okay. So so the newborn screening disorders cover wide systems and endocrine disorders and they like to see me as and different

215
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:23,069
different disorders affecting different systems in this class today not today will this class we will talk about as I said,

216
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:29,380
PKU, we're not talking about Maple Sirup ongoing disorder.

217
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:35,579
We will talk about hypothyroidism, we'll talk about cystic fibrosis.

218
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,090
So these are some sample of conditions that we will talk about.

219
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:49,739
And then these the majority of these diseases are classified as inborn errors of metabolism.

220
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:57,809
So so these are conditions that mostly are single gene disorders.

221
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:06,200
So they those diseases happen due to a mutation or multiple mutations, different mutations in a single gene.

222
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,840
So you have single gene being affected and they're usually affect.

223
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:18,809
What happens is that you have an enzyme that that is not working as you would

224
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:23,100
expect it to work as what you expect of how you expect it to work normally.

225
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:37,770
So so if you look at the figure here, so if you have a certain molecule or substrate A being converted to B and then B being converted to C,

226
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:47,549
and if you have a problem where your enzyme here is not working, then what would you expect?

227
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:55,050
What do what would been like as a result of a broken system here?

228
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,960
Which which molecule you would have more of.

229
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,470
Yeah. Street access, whichever one.

230
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,189
Like B in this case, whichever was the substrate. Yeah.

231
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:18,340
So you can have multiple things happen. So be would have to have buildup of substrate access,

232
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:27,669
we would have less of see and then sometimes you would have just because the body has

233
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:38,710
multiple sort of pathways and multiple mechanisms that could kind of be acting on the same.

234
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:48,399
The same. Things like this could end up being shunted into a different pathway and being converted

235
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,410
to a toxic metabolite that the body doesn't expect or doesn't want this much level of.

236
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:57,849
And you could have a buildup of that toxic metabolite.

237
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:01,510
So in the case of PKU, remember we talked about Fennel.

238
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:06,340
Ella needs to maybe think about it as B needing to be converted to tyrosine.

239
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:11,200
It's not this is this pathway is not working as well.

240
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:17,079
So you'd have this kind of irony and kind of convert it to the final perfect acid,

241
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,730
the molecule that was detected in people and kids with mental retardation.

242
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:31,740
Any questions so far? Okay.

243
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:40,190
So we kind of touched upon this as we were starting the lecture.

244
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,040
So views of newborn screening,

245
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:53,390
we do think of them as essential preventive preventative public health program that can help early and early identification of serious disorders.

246
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:59,600
And that kind of process where you have a diagnosis, you have treatment,

247
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:08,840
and then significant reductions in harmful effects, deaths or associated disabilities.

248
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:19,190
But something to keep in mind is that this is not maybe shared or historically this kind of vary from state

249
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:28,910
to state and there's always concerns about mass screening or kind of think about the ethical legal issues.

250
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,120
Related to applying a screening on a wide level.

251
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:50,470
So we talked about kind of difference in state. Why state so the difference this can be can be related to what disorders are being screened,

252
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:57,309
how much money is available for each state consent and notification processes.

253
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:07,510
So. So it's it's actually not required that consent is for those testing.

254
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:19,270
And I think as a parent or going as a parent, going to give birth consent is not required like they would test the baby anyways.

255
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:25,360
Unless you kind of apply for an exemption or have a reason why you don't want your baby tested.

256
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,720
But otherwise testing is done without.

257
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:33,340
Like no consent is needed. So that kind of comes into.

258
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:48,170
It comes into play as an issue, potential issue, and then genetic counseling practices, also educational information available to parents.

259
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:54,410
So there's variation with that. Only 25 states would require educational information.

260
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:58,880
And then there's also variation in long term follow up procedures.

261
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:09,710
So these are other issues that we kind of talked about, like false positives.

262
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:21,080
So whenever we're screening, we're always worried about false positive because of course, that could be.

263
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:32,090
Well, first will you will need to do additional testing to kind of confirm whether that's like a true positive or not.

264
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,300
There could be potential for stigmatization.

265
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:48,680
And then there was evidence that this false positive can result in kind of an anxiety syndrome where parents or families that had kind of a run,

266
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:57,219
where they had a false positive result, they end up using health care more often than a normal parent.

267
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:03,260
And that just it's just creating this sense of anxiety where the parent is like not sure what's going on and

268
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:13,460
just ending up going to the to the to the to their doctor or just seeking health care or more than usual.

269
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:25,080
And then something that we also think about when we talk about screening is whether disorders are characterized clinically.

270
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:36,590
So how much of a good definition we have for the disease that we want to test, we want to screen for, and how much of a good treatment we have for it?

271
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,940
So so we want to be able to have a good sense of the disorder.

272
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,980
Some of these are super rare,

273
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:54,700
so we might not have enough information that we are able to really advise them and know how to treat or how to kind of characterize those conditions.

274
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:11,520
And this is also this is kind of what I was just saying and then related to screening is that sometimes we can maybe end up detecting a carrier.

275
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:23,340
So that would be a person that does not have the condition, probably not develop it as an adult, but pass that on to their children.

276
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:27,389
And like you identified that information early on as a baby.

277
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:34,830
So it's not really that yet, but it's like that burden of knowing before that.

278
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:38,310
It's before it's useful before the active age.

279
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:45,540
And just also understanding of what it means to be a carrier.

280
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:53,220
That kind of that can also be confusing to a parent, like not knowing what it means exactly to be a carrier.

281
00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:04,150
Any questions so far? Okay.

282
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:13,090
So this is what I was talking about, about having kind of a division of the court panel.

283
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:17,560
So conditions that we that all states are required to test for.

284
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:29,840
So about 31 conditions. And then there's the additional 25/2 rate conditions that the states can either kind of opt in or out for testing.

285
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:33,690
And I think in Michigan, it's I think that's the next slide.

286
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:42,580
Now you can look up the information. I think in Michigan, it's like 58 conditions now.

287
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:52,180
It's kind of. That would include hearing, hearing screening and cystic fibrosis.

288
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,880
So that's not a chemical test. It's actually an actual human test that is done.

289
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:09,490
And that like in Michigan, that this program kind of detects a disorder and one in every 400 or 500 birds.

290
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:17,130
So we're able to. Detect a good number of newborns that would otherwise have.

291
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:29,950
You go undetected and it's it's low cost, relatively usually covered by insurance or waived for families with financial hardship.

292
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:43,180
Another thing that we kind of.

293
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:52,209
So this is like a great program, as you can see, like in detecting disorders and then historically, like the baby would be put through the heal.

294
00:39:52,210 --> 00:40:00,160
And then I believe now they take six blood spots and those would not all look just to make sure that we have enough samples.

295
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:07,330
But not all of those could be used eventually for the for the screening purposes.

296
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:14,650
And some of those leftover dried spots with kind of stain the Michigan Needle back.

297
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:23,170
And those are de-identified blood spots that could be used for medical research.

298
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:31,090
And before May 2010, though, like no consent was required.

299
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,549
So remember, there's no consent for the actual screening.

300
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:43,180
But then there are issues or concerns about the leftover or the extra blood spots and what's going to happen with them.

301
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:52,569
Like how are they being used for research purposes? So in May 2010, it wasn't like a consent form was introduced for that.

302
00:40:52,570 --> 00:41:02,730
And then what kind of consent for that? They're asked at birth for what they would like to be done with the extra blood slides.

303
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,420
And as you can imagine, concerns about those leftover samples just being.

304
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:16,070
I know it's available for anyone.

305
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:21,160
Now, with genetics, we're able to tell like who is who easily, more easily than us.

306
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:30,630
And we have more technological advances with that. So there were some concerns leading to destruction of blood spots in some states.

307
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:41,780
Okay. So. You can look up those kind of information.

308
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:47,910
On one condition, what conditions are included in your state or as a parent?

309
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:55,010
And you can like kind of look up that information like multiple sources that would kind of help you through that.

310
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,180
So these are just examples of such websites.

311
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:16,400
And then, as I said. All these tests, all this testing that we do for those genetic disorders is based on an actual kind of biochemical change.

312
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:29,870
There's just testing of a molecule or byproduct of some pathway, but just to throw it out there that potentially in the future they might be.

313
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:40,930
Might be a consideration of applying sequencing where you kind of use that those blood samples to actually test for mutations.

314
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,610
You would be able to get a whole lot of information,

315
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:53,270
but also there's a whole lot of complications related to ethical legal issues that could come with with that.

316
00:42:53,290 --> 00:43:03,730
So so that. So as sequencing becomes more cheaply available, more rapidly available,

317
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:13,040
that could be a conversation that we could we need to have as public health professionals or practitioners with.

318
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:19,990
It will have the advantage of diagnosing multiple remember like the mass spectrometry.

319
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:26,700
You will be only able to tell whether the baby have the conditions that you were testing for.

320
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:36,130
You're not going to get additional findings other than what you're looking for versus sequencing where you're able to tell everything almost.

321
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:47,800
So what do you think? Some of the like things that would go into such conversation about using sequencing for for for newborn screening.

322
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:55,600
What are some issues that could. Some of it are really similar to what we talked about, but.

323
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:07,690
More complicated. Yeah.

324
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:15,850
I feel like with sequencing data you can detect different things that you can't detect with, like in your chest or whatever.

325
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:21,400
Like if your baby has, like, a certain mutation, like they might be.

326
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:30,510
Like they might have, like, Alzheimer's, but like. Knowing that ahead of time might not be good for me.

327
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:35,190
I guess. Knowing that I might not be like. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

328
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:43,049
So you're you're really haven't you're getting a really detailed look on the genome that could

329
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:51,900
kind of detect other mutations that you really wouldn't have to worry about until like older age.

330
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,740
But you're you're you're going to be able to know that.

331
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:00,660
So that's kind of similar to any genetic test that you have kind of detecting information.

332
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:07,049
And then what do you do with that? And if if to apply that for newborn screening,

333
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:12,720
we're going to have that ethical issue of like disclosing that to the parents or what do you do with that?

334
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:25,370
Yeah. I was thinking also we were talking about how a lot of times it's just an association between like a genetic region and a disease.

335
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:32,570
So like it might not always develop later on and also like if there's no treatment available.

336
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:43,570
Yeah, yeah. Exactly. So. So it's kind of like to point out that having the mutation we might not necessarily meet.

337
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:49,819
No. How would that translate chemically and then down even to the phenotype?

338
00:45:49,820 --> 00:46:01,580
And as we look over the PKU readings, it might not be kind of straightforward to say, oh, this mutation will cause this,

339
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:08,820
this to be like this is how it's going to look like when, when the baby's kind of growing up.

340
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:15,490
Yeah. Like kind of unrelated, like the, like the legal issues, like of having like a stored, like,

341
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:22,200
whole genome for somebody, like using that for like criminal investigations, like if it's like publicly available.

342
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:29,359
Like exactly. Yeah, exactly. You're going to have your data somewhere, the baby's genome sequence,

343
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:39,530
somewhere that could be breached somehow or could be used for other purposes that like beyond medical research.

344
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:46,069
I know like there's, there's laws protecting against discrimination,

345
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:52,820
like for health insurance coverage, but like life insurance is still like not included in that.

346
00:46:52,820 --> 00:47:01,700
So, so maybe discrimination like life insurance could detect something like that could tell you something about life expectancy.

347
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:05,280
So. What else?

348
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:23,800
So it's also related to having the genetic data is like storage like this is a huge dataset that we have to kind of find a place for and pay for.

349
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:37,450
So yeah, so storing that data insurance coverage and having good sense of what the mutation is and what it means,

350
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:41,709
having good treatment results over time.

351
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:45,100
And then another factor, maybe we didn't talk about education,

352
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:51,040
like having a good understanding both on the parent level or the family level and the

353
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:59,650
health professional and what those findings are then perhaps more so than in normal,

354
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:03,220
not normal, but the traditional newborn screening,

355
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:11,670
you really have to think of whether we have to make it mandatory or voluntary that impact on health care system.

356
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,880
So that's kind of related to all those conditions that you're going to detect.

357
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:24,100
And then you're going to have to have you know, it's more likely that the those families are more likely to seek care,

358
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,800
come with questions more so than it was undetected.

359
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:36,940
That would be the case if it's not a kind of a genomic screening program.

360
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:45,670
Any questions on that? No.

361
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:51,040
Okay. So let's.

362
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:57,390
And I move forward. We talked about one.

363
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:15,000
One condition that GQ touched upon that in this last slide, as you've been conditioned, that kind of kick started the screening programs.

364
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:26,490
So as I said before, like, we're going to have maybe a number of conditions, like three or four conditions that we're going to talk about in detail.

365
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:37,530
And for all of those, I have the learning objectives that you would kind of need to know about those conditions and the exam to

366
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:43,470
study guide that kind of that should detail what you need to know about all those each of those conditions.

367
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:49,980
So we're going to talk about basic epidemiology symptoms and what organs it affects.

368
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:56,360
It's genetics. What biological pathways are disrupted and treatments.

369
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:04,370
And so how many of you are familiar somewhat with PKU?

370
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,800
Look, it's kind of a classic example of.

371
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,480
It's not. Not many. Okay.

372
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:20,880
So so, you know, he's in new area or it can have different names.

373
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:28,620
So as I said, it's a disorder where you have an enzyme that is not working as you would expect.

374
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:32,370
So it's this enzyme, it's kind of hydroxylase.

375
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:38,610
So another name for PKU is and I took this deficiency,

376
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:49,590
other names related to the doctor who first kind of described it and then hypo fennel island anemia,

377
00:50:49,890 --> 00:51:02,440
which we we it's one of the papers and it's kind of like an early step or like an excess of fennel only.

378
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:08,910
And that is. That would not necessarily lead to PKU.

379
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:13,060
So it's kind of a description of an excessive hyper phenylalanine.

380
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:19,510
So finding is an amino acid.

381
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:24,310
So usually it's like a composite divided by dietary intake.

382
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:29,020
So it's, it's a protein rich foods.

383
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:39,520
So in like milk and some fish and then once it's ingested, it's usually converted to thyroxine and delivers.

384
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:48,250
So this, this pathway or this yeah this pathway happens and deliver where you expect to have this enzyme.

385
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:53,760
Paige working on that conversion from lean to type.

386
00:51:55,330 --> 00:52:04,350
And as we talked about the deficiency of this enzyme will lead to elevation of amine or its

387
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:14,260
life so it can be converted to some other molecule that kind of build up in the in the body.

388
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:25,610
And so fennel only in with this excessive foul kind of affect brain function.

389
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,810
So it'll be kind of builds up.

390
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:39,250
We will have buildup of it that would affect neuron development for brain development, especially in younger babies.

391
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:51,820
And that that buildup is what eventually leads to changes in IQ or mental retardation and all like the host of condition,

392
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:58,600
other symptoms that we see related to. Okay, you have to show this as a slight.

393
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:06,250
Oh, so pass away. This is the final molecule.

394
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:13,300
This is the type of scene. This is the enzyme that we we need for that conversion.

395
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:18,180
And it happens alongside the as byproducts.

396
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:29,139
You have oxygen being converted into water and then tyrosine itself would kind of go down the pathways.

397
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:40,680
And you have other enzyme like this enzyme that would use the tyrosine for other cycles like this citric cycle, I believe, for the assets of us.

398
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:49,900
A So these, this tyrosine is needed for other biological functions that the body would need.

399
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:59,140
So the, the problem we have when we have a use that you have this step not functioning as you expect or as,

400
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,960
as well as you expect, as we will talk about.

401
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:12,729
So you have this buildup of alanine that's out there and you could end up having this enzyme working on the convert,

402
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:24,880
converting the alanine into the pyruvate which which is excreted in the urine and and and observed in individuals with PKU.

403
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:32,110
So you kind of have this pathway affected and you have this shunt pathway that's kind of like

404
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:37,540
taking the lead and putting it somewhere else instead of the pathway that it's intended,

405
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:46,750
intended for it. Any questions related to that?

406
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:56,500
Yeah. So is the PKU detected in the urine or the blood?

407
00:54:57,790 --> 00:55:01,930
Um, it's blood red. So it could be both.

408
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:11,490
So the final pyruvate, if you think about the example that we set the blood testing, the blood test that we take.

409
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:14,220
So that would be based on the blood test.

410
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:32,380
It probably could be both could be excluded from the blood and then detected in the urine in some form for the purposes of the testing.

411
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:39,730
It is done in the blood. Yes. And is it tech detecting PKU or the fetal alanine.

412
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:48,910
So so that we will talk about in the paper so think about PKU as not like although we talk about it as one thing,

413
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:54,430
but it's not really like you could have mild PKU, moderate PKU,

414
00:55:55,900 --> 00:56:04,090
you can have just an excess of all that excess of the external alanine, but it's not really PKU.

415
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:19,270
So. So there's, like, more steps, like. Between detecting the that's the the substrate in the blood or in the urine and actually saying that you have.

416
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:26,520
Q the kind of the same. But there's like it's not like a straightforward relationship.

417
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:33,420
I don't know, does that make sense? But it is like having the buildup of at least for this slide.

418
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:42,420
What we're trying to say is that having the buildup of an empire fade or the alanine in blood or serum is like an indication of PKU.

419
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:50,040
There could I think there's like this pathway accounts for I think 75% of the cell.

420
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:54,000
I mean of like metabolism.

421
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:57,479
It could be other pathways, like we're fennel and alanine.

422
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:05,250
It's like converted to something else. But having the buildup is kind of an indication of PKU.

423
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:20,480
So we kind of talked about this just just now.

424
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:25,820
The discovery of PKU was by Dr. falling back in the 1930s.

425
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,500
And it wasn't until kind of 50 years later.

426
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:38,930
We kind of have like discoveries related to how the Met, how, how it really happens.

427
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:45,230
But it wasn't until the fifties, like 50 years later or 1983,

428
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:55,489
that we were able to pinpoint the genetic focus that is causing PKU and or affecting the function of this enzyme,

429
00:57:55,490 --> 00:58:00,590
the enzyme and it map to the region chromosome 12.

430
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:07,910
So it's it's really that gene that encodes enzymes that is affected.

431
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:18,530
Okay. So in terms of genetics of PKU,

432
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:28,940
it isn't autosomal recessive in the sense that you should have both copies of the for the enzyme you're going to have or the gene

433
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:39,200
and you're going to have to prove it is a result of recessive in the sense that you should have both copies kind of malfunctioning.

434
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:49,730
So both copies have a mutation. Now, now we're going to talk about how it might not be necessarily be the same mutation, but both copies are affected.

435
00:58:50,180 --> 00:59:00,389
Affected. So domains of the page.

436
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:05,610
So how does it look if we're going to look at it in terms of like protein structure?

437
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:11,129
So the enzyme, so you would have a catalytic domain.

438
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:15,720
So this catalytic domain is what actually does the conversion.

439
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:25,370
So this is the actual. Doing that is doing that kind of catalysis kind of entire scene.

440
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:38,770
And then you have the regulatory domain, which is kind of like a sensory domain that would activate the enzyme and so on.

441
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:45,109
And then we talk about the specialization domain, which we'll talk about it.

442
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:52,970
But just for you to kind of picture that, like I don't want you to know all the kind of biological details of that or the.

443
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:59,840
More than having that. It has multiple domains.

444
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:16,010
Ones that's like kind of. Kind of influences how active the enzyme is an actual unit that does the actual reaction that we expected.

445
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:23,300
And then in here you see that we have an iron molecule that that is also part of this enzyme.

446
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:29,960
Now this enzyme, this is like one unit of the enzyme. It doesn't act on its own.

447
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:36,830
It's actually it's actually like using this Tetra migration domain.

448
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:41,810
It actually exists in like a four subunit form.

449
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:52,040
So you have kind of four molecules of the enzyme kind of bound together with that with this last part.

450
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:56,120
And it exists in a texture metric structure.

451
01:00:56,270 --> 01:01:04,490
So tetra means four. So you kind of have four molecules of the enzyme existing in that in that shape here.

452
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:12,680
So so this is just showing for each of those monomers.

453
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:17,470
So a monomer is like one part of this four unit structure.

454
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:24,150
This is the number of. Amino acids that would make up each part of it.

455
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:28,450
The alpha HeLa cells and the beta pleated sheets.

456
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:37,680
That's just like. So the bottom seeded would be kind of like those arrows, like part of the protein.

457
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:44,040
Alpha HeLa cells are like copies of the thin structures that are kind of like looped.

458
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:57,159
The main idea that we want to get from this is that other than the the actual amino acids making up the protein,

459
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:06,650
we kind of have this folding shape that also comes into play and affects how well this enzyme will work one time.

460
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:14,040
Any questions on? You can break.

461
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:37,290
Okay so we kind of so men and look at like the the main chain of this enzyme you can see that on the finger here.

462
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:45,960
We have the mutations that have been discovered that are known to cause PKU or HPV.

463
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:59,100
So in yellow or orange or. Mutations that can can affect how the protein is folded.

464
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:05,670
So so those are mutations that would affect the hydrogen bond.

465
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:09,840
So if you have like a change of amino acid, that amino acid,

466
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:18,540
the new amino acid might not be able to bind as well with the with the with the like

467
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:25,920
the other amino acid that it needs to do that needs to bind to to make this fly.

468
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:36,720
It's been resolved through this folding of the enzyme. Now, another part that kind of that can also be affected is what is shown in green,

469
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:51,690
where you kind of have mutations that affect how well the the the the iron molecule here is is bound to the to the to the protein or to the enzyme.

470
01:03:52,990 --> 01:04:02,800
Can all this to show you don't have to know like a lot of details but all this to show us that a lot can go wrong where even if it's like a miss,

471
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:15,280
like just the mutation, the synonymous mutation that just that that you would think would not affect the protein that much,

472
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:21,670
but you could end up having the structure or how the protein or the enzyme is folded being affected.

473
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:25,270
Um, and that could affect the function.

474
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:33,710
Okay. Any questions? Okay.

475
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:42,410
So I said before that the PKU is a result of mutation in one gene, and it's not one mutation that we're talking about.

476
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:55,700
So about 600 mutations in this one gene can result or lead to an increase in film and a mean or a PKU.

477
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:01,100
So most of those mutations are missense mutations.

478
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:09,329
Some some are deletions spliced.

479
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:15,000
Remember that's when you have variation in the exons and end to end terms when you're making your final protein.

480
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:19,170
So it's not mutation the coding level per say.

481
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:26,400
You guys remember those terms. Tell me what a MISSENSE mutation is.

482
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:36,700
Is that like the. Non synonymous.

483
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:41,230
Like if you change an amino acid, it would change or you change.

484
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:49,660
Yeah. Not it will change the amino acid if you change the nucleotide.

485
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:54,580
Yeah. So you have a change in the nucleotide leading to a change in the amino acid.

486
01:05:59,310 --> 01:06:05,670
Silent mutations. When you have a change in the base, but you're you end up with this thing, you know, as the.

487
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:11,950
Nonsense mutation. Anyone? Yeah. Premature stop codon.

488
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:17,469
Yeah. So you kind of you change the code, so you kind of code for a stop codon.

489
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:21,520
So your protein is truncated, so.

490
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:27,489
So, as you can see, most of most of the mutations we talk about are missense.

491
01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:37,570
And they can vary sort of on very, very, very severity on their effect on the enzyme.

492
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:46,060
Okay. So this intensive figure here kind of shows a little bit the 600 mutation.

493
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:52,750
So if you look down here, that's like the sequence of the.

494
01:06:54,410 --> 01:07:03,840
The gene encoding the enzyme. You can have mutation those those are the blocks like the x blocks, the dark lines.

495
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:08,260
So those are the coding section of the gene exons.

496
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:15,430
Introns are then the non-coding part.

497
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:23,190
So you can have mutations in the interesting part of the gene.

498
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:29,650
You could have them in the x one part. They can happen basically anywhere on that gene.

499
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:39,940
They can have different effects on the function. Any questions?

500
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:49,350
So yeah, the drones only like you would need the intro there for those mutations to have an effect, right?

501
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:52,840
So you'd have to have a splice like mutation in one of these.

502
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:57,640
It could be it could be a supply side mutation like leading to somewhat the.

503
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,830
Protein being truncated differently.

504
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:09,380
Remember when we talked about in trials and the like back in early in the semester, it could have like some regulatory effect,

505
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:17,840
like affecting how much of the enzymes expressed, for example, could have something to do.

506
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:22,790
I mean, depending on if they end up in the protein or not.

507
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,430
You can have it. They can have things like folding or something like that.

508
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:40,990
So how does PKU present clinically?

509
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:53,700
As we said, we have the buildup of this alanine that can affect the brain development and leads to mental retardation convulsions.

510
01:08:53,920 --> 01:09:02,260
Some think of like epilepsy type, like seizures, skin abnormalities and behavioral disturbances.

511
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:11,250
And detecting early is important because you can prevent the buildup so continuous process

512
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:18,150
that where if you take away the the intake of people eliminate early on or limit it,

513
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:25,650
you kind of prevent that from happening or the manifestation clinically from happening.

514
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:32,070
Okay. Okay.

515
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:36,800
So so as I said, like peaky is not one thing.

516
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:48,150
Like when we talk about phenotype, we could have like have a mild build up of learning that it's not really leading to PKU.

517
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:56,100
So those individuals can somewhat tolerate a certain level of intake of phenylalanine,

518
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:07,410
and then you can have more extreme forms where individuals can have really low tolerance of how much mean they can take.

519
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:28,509
So this is kind of what we will talk about. I think we will start it today, the the scraper paper where it's like we we talk a lot about,

520
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:31,990
you know, type and having a mutation and leading to a phenotype.

521
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:41,679
But when we look like in details, and especially for those simple kind of diseases where you have one gene being affected,

522
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:51,069
we're thinking it's not multiple genetic mutations that affected a complex disease.

523
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:58,070
And we think it might be straightforward to say, oh, we have a mutation here, we're going to have PKU.

524
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:07,510
But if we look at like we'll go through this paper and see how even though it's one gene,

525
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:15,159
it can be sort of a complex disorder where that like an example that they talk about in the papers,

526
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:24,790
having siblings that have maybe the same mutation, but the disease would manifest differently, differently in each of them.

527
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:35,870
So we would think about environment, we think about maybe other pathways that are that can vary or be affected,

528
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:39,490
that can have a role in how PKU kind of manifests.

529
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:47,440
So we'll stop here and then for, for next time we will start by going over the Survivor papers.

530
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:56,770
So the monogenic traits are not simple. So we make sure to kind of refresh on that at least once a month working on your exam.

531
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:16,540
So next I'm going to speak to you and really talk about lessons like.
