1
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,530
All right. Good morning. Hopefully you all recognize me a little bit.

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:18,620
I'm Jan Brewer. And if you decide to discuss this interesting time today, I'm going to be talking to you all about something a little bit out of that.

3
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,210
We've been speaking out so far in class, already talking about global health,

4
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,740
governance and how does it apply to COVID 19 vaccination efforts around the world.

5
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:42,060
All right. So let's start with a couple definitions here. One for global health is a little bit out of scope for most of the content of this course.

6
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,120
So just taking a moment here to define what is global health.

7
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,790
So global health is looking at the study and practice of issues that can be

8
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:57,029
either directly or indirectly related to health that are beyond boundaries.

9
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,329
They don't respect national lines. They can be problems all over the world.

10
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:11,770
They can be local. They can be. Affecting directly in a different country or they can indirectly affect across borders.

11
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,010
And it's a little bit different than when you might hear the term international health.

12
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:26,570
International health is when, from one country perspective, you're intervening in the health or health related work in a different country.

13
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:37,700
So that's more like when USAID is piloting a prescription program in Kenya for a small rural health clinic.

14
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:44,030
When they're funding that work, that is international health, when they are kind of working bilaterally like that.

15
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:54,470
Whereas global health, we're looking kind of more from a bird's eye view, from a perspective that reaches beyond the idea of antibodies.

16
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:03,550
And then we have global health governance, which is how decisions are made and implemented in this global forums around these global issues

17
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,510
and how those things are implemented at that global level have kind of two main approaches.

18
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,160
We have a horizontal approach which is looking at across the health system,

19
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:21,340
how do we strengthen the system so that we can better respond to all health related issues?

20
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,680
And there's also a vertical approach,

21
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:31,630
which is looking at a specific disease area or health issue and kind of focusing across there from local to the global level.

22
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:38,020
How can they address this issue and improve outcomes?

23
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,320
So who are the players in global health? There's a lot going on here.

24
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,780
Let's see. We have multilateral institutions and organizations.

25
00:02:51,790 --> 00:03:00,580
And so what those are are organizations that are jointly supported by multiple governments and often other partners and players as well.

26
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,590
And this is different than bilateral work where you're just kind of working,

27
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,980
like we said, for individual country to country or organization organization.

28
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:16,420
So these are large groups of stakeholders in each of these organizations.

29
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:22,180
So we have those U.N. agencies which are multilateral, obviously have buy in from governments across the world.

30
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,650
We have the international financial institutions, which are also multilateral.

31
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:34,810
They're getting support from a lot of high income countries around the world that are helping support these efforts.

32
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:41,860
And we have multilateral funding mechanisms, which are a little bit different than both of those previous groups,

33
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:48,760
where they are independent from U.N. agencies, and they aren't a kind of global financial institution,

34
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:55,810
but they are essentially our pooling mechanisms for funds for a disease area or a global health area of work.

35
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:05,320
So these include GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, which focuses on vaccination before a couple of years there once they go through childhood vaccination.

36
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,710
We also have the Global Fund to.

37
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,460
By AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria and what you guess what diseases they work on.

38
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:20,430
And we have in the TB drug facility, which is part of a larger TB, it's got to be partnership.

39
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,240
So those are kind of our multilaterals. There really can be elephants in the room.

40
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:35,780
We also have. Donor countries, countries with more income that donate directly to other countries.

41
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:42,410
They also have their own or then have their own international development agencies like USAID or the German.

42
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:49,290
Commonwealth Development Office, which used to have DFID, but then they just kind of crumbled and died in Brexit.

43
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:56,870
So now we have the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which is a whole lecture in itself,

44
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,870
and we they are also of course engaging through these multilateral organizations.

45
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:11,600
So these donor countries kind of have those two faces on how they're engaging as a unit and also individually

46
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:17,810
promoting what they are saying about what they want to focus on in their national development work.

47
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:26,089
We then have NGOs, we have, you know, be in Africa duration of Red Cross and Red Crescent, Doctors Without Borders,

48
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:33,260
Save the Children, Oxfam, which, for better or for worse, have stood the test of time that they were working,

49
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:40,300
generally providing direct aid in country, often independently from country governments,

50
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,170
which is a bit different than the way that the UN agencies and the funding mechanisms work.

51
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:53,319
And then we have the public health consulting organizations.

52
00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:00,400
So what those do occur for a small level. They kind of know worker bees often for these multilateral agencies and donors.

53
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:06,920
They get grants to pilot programs and do implementation research mostly.

54
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,739
So these include smaller organizations, which you might not hear in the headlines,

55
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,810
these organizations like John Snowden, National Health Access Initiative and Goals for Development.

56
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:26,050
We, of course, have the pharmaceutical industry. They are always looking to expand their markets and expand their profit margins.

57
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,520
So they are obviously involved in global health in terms of.

58
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,640
Growing access to medicines and healthcare devices.

59
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,530
And then there's the recipient countries, the countries that are receiving support.

60
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:47,340
And these, you know, range around the world.

61
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,960
We had oftentimes, you know, you think about recipient country as.

62
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:03,250
An African country, a kind of stereotype. You see the the you know, you see those commercials of like, let's get water to this community.

63
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:11,850
And, oh, well, I've been granted in this case a lot of the work that needs to be done in terms of COVID vaccination before we talk about it,

64
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:12,760
it is in Africa.

65
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:23,169
That being said, I mean, I think this past year we've seen a lot of need in Ukraine and Afghanistan, countries that are incredible, complex settings.

66
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:27,100
These are not always in sub-Saharan Africa. So important to to consider.

67
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,200
So this is about the big, big thing.

68
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:39,820
We also have Jeff Skilling, one of the Gates Foundation executives right there in the middle, because they have a very special place in global health.

69
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:50,740
They are leaders in global health without having that governmental influence or that multilateral.

70
00:07:53,060 --> 00:08:00,070
Space. They just have a lot of money and have been big donors from the get go.

71
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,390
They actually founded the Vaccine Alliance.

72
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:10,710
With a massive donation of their own, which now has been obviously picked up into a multilateral institution.

73
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:17,730
But they have this history in the space and a lot of a lot of influence,

74
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:23,700
despite there being out of what you would think of any traditional power position.

75
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,400
So how does the U.S. fit in? What do.

76
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:39,470
The United States do for global health. What kind of power do they hold and how do we engage?

77
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,000
So does anyone have any thoughts on on this?

78
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:49,640
I'm going to go into more detail of anything off the top of your head on how the United States is involved in war.

79
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:58,930
Absolutely.

80
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:10,210
They provide a lot of funding and a lot of funding both into their own domestic agencies and into global agencies to support global health efforts.

81
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:17,490
So that is the main one we have more of. Haskell is a research and development.

82
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,720
There's a lot of research done through USAID.

83
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,750
There's also a lot of research done through our agencies, the CDC.

84
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:31,890
I think there's a lot of global health research. And I h also provides grants for health related projects.

85
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:40,880
And then, of course, executive grants from time to time just has an interest project that they that they have their own stuff to do.

86
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:51,820
So trying to. And we are nothing but peaceful Zoraida.

87
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:56,380
Peace for Peace Corps. Absolutely. So they actually provide manpower.

88
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:01,480
So they they have a Peace Corps. They're also actually a global health corps.

89
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:10,330
Now, there is also then, of course, the employees of USAID that often are working in country as well.

90
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,650
I that we'll be talking to our.

91
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:33,300
Absolutely. So there is also oftentimes military intervention that includes bringing medical supplies or food or other types of resources.

92
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:39,460
To visit many countries, whether that is. One thing that is.

93
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,579
Great. All right. So I think you guys touched on a lot of us.

94
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:53,140
We have a lot of international health programs that the United States runs itself for technical assistance.

95
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:02,349
They fund research efforts, actually also have congressional funding that directly goes towards international organizations.

96
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:09,070
For example, GAVI actually has to lobby the U.S. government and the U.S. Congress for their funding on an annual basis.

97
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:13,150
The Senate just kind of signed off by the executive branch.

98
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:22,030
And lastly I want we might not have touched on is representation on these governing bodies of international organizations.

99
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:33,129
So the U.S. actually, by providing funding to a lot of these multilateral institutions, have a power by being a board member as well.

100
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:40,030
So they sit on the boards of these organizations like for the World Bank, like for GAVI.

101
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:45,910
And that actually gives them a lot of governing power on the direction that these organizations go in their programing.

102
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,510
So we've got a little bit of a global health or a zoom in here onto global vaccination.

103
00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:01,930
And so who are the global vaccination stakeholders? These groups a little bit familiar and similar to what we've seen on the previous slide,

104
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,550
just a little bit more specifying or what we're looking at in the whole vaccination.

105
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:15,500
So I'll start with GAVI because they are kind of a convening mechanism among many of these organizations.

106
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:22,059
So GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, which, if anyone is curious, is actually the Global Alliance for Vaccination Immunization.

107
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,290
And then we decided to shorten it and then still have an IV vaccine alliance because no one knew who they were.

108
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:40,930
So GAVI, they are a funding mechanism for vaccines that get distributed to the majority of low income and some middle income countries in the world.

109
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:49,719
So GAVI essentially pulls a bunch of funding from donor countries and then they purchase

110
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:56,800
vaccines in bulk in massive amounts and distribute those vaccines to country governments

111
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:03,550
so that they can then use them in their expanded programs for immunization programs and

112
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:09,550
vaccinate children while not having to worry about that upfront cost for the vaccines.

113
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:17,210
They do this with obviously partnership from their donor country governments that provide that funding.

114
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:25,350
They actually use UNICEF mechanisms for the use of supply provision for all their procurement services.

115
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,600
So UNICEF actually ends up being the one that purchases those vaccines.

116
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,020
They work with the World Health Organization when there's new vaccines that are being added to that portfolio,

117
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,940
when they need to provide technical assistance in country.

118
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,360
UNICEF and WTO are often the first point of contact.

119
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:58,049
To help support at the ministry level. The World Bank also helps GAVI with some of their more innovative financing mechanisms, as they call them,

120
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:05,040
which is really kind of just creating loans with donor governments that are committing

121
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,420
over the long term funding that they can then front for vaccination campaigns.

122
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:17,740
Gabby also employees in these consulting research agencies like design and Science

123
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:25,160
to help them when they're struggling around areas of health system strengthening,

124
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,460
which is also a bucket of their investment.

125
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:40,729
And of course, they're working with vaccine manufacturers to negotiate prices for these large purchases and also

126
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:47,630
regularly contacting with humanitarian organizations and civil society organizations on the ground level,

127
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:57,800
especially supporting their efforts to work with countries, governments, and keep countries governments accountable for the donations that they see.

128
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:07,510
And we also have something at the bottom here, which is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.

129
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:08,790
Very simple.

130
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:21,700
And they're a little bit higher up in that extreme where they are focusing on research and development for these new vaccines, making sure that.

131
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:29,700
These vaccines that might not be as much of interest for high income countries traditionally are still

132
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:35,670
receiving support for research and development to then be rolled out in countries that need them,

133
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,290
even if they are claiming at the center stage of.

134
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,680
The Pharmaceutical industries priorities.

135
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:52,380
So this is what will help in terms of vaccines.

136
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:59,400
Sounds a bit messy. It's a little bit all over the place. First, we also have go on with the gates here at the top.

137
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:06,360
They were like fun, innovative projects, especially driving things like.

138
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,920
Drone vaccine deliveries and other pilot projects.

139
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,780
So this is what we have in global health for vaccines here.

140
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,910
It doesn't seem obviously like there is a clear, fair cure path.

141
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:34,120
That is because there is not a thing about global health is that we don't have, you know, a veto power.

142
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:39,870
We don't have a rule where we move forward with something if it gets a certain amount of votes.

143
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:46,680
There's a lot of different interests without a statute, without a clear governing structure.

144
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:53,790
So how does this work when we're faced with a.

145
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:01,750
Global Pandemic an emergency for dealing with distributing COVID 19 vaccines.

146
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:09,650
So this is where we come to COVAX. This COVAX was meant to be.

147
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:19,340
We'll start with the idea of the Chinese and the idea of early 2020 in what was supposed to be so much better,

148
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:29,210
came out of an idea in a white paper by Richard Hatchett, who's the CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.

149
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:37,670
And he's actually proposed this idea where countries would round the world pool

150
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:44,930
funding together to incentivize research and development for COVID 19 vaccines.

151
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,810
They do this by essentially pulling that money together.

152
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:54,950
Some of this money could go directly towards research development, but most of it would be essentially this holding as an advanced market commitment.

153
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:04,639
It would incentivize these doctors to develop a vaccine because there was a guaranteed purchase and this would be a massive purchase.

154
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,640
This would be purchases for countries around the world.

155
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:17,400
And from there, once a vaccine was available, these doses would start to flow through this facility.

156
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:24,970
COVAX and COVAX would distribute these vaccines equitably around the world covering all.

157
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:31,839
Most at risk around the world first and then essentially working their way down tiers

158
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:38,280
of risk levels by providing proportionate levels of vaccine to each country more.

159
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:48,910
Sounds like a great idea, right? Of course this didn't end up working out as beautifully as its laid out right here.

160
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:55,239
But we'll get to that in a minute. So does making a pass.

161
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,750
Is anyone off the bat just see any red flags for this model?

162
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:07,570
And obviously you're down the line so of, you know, what happened to say if you just have an idea theoretically what is going to work?

163
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:25,470
No free press. Everyone vaccinated more. At the manufacturers of vaccines?

164
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,970
Absolutely. Yeah. That is definitely one of the challenges we had.

165
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:39,840
So we're going to get to why that happened. So first, here's where we are today.

166
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:49,470
This is updated at the beginning of September where it's showing a secure vaccine and expected vaccine supply.

167
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,580
As a proportion of total population by country.

168
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,780
And it's the darker red. It is smaller, it is more blue.

169
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,889
It is the higher that cover is expected.

170
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:10,300
That seems like that. So. What does this map tell you?

171
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:24,440
It's not a trick question. A certain set of like.

172
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:31,580
The countries are most tougher. And it's just like particularly in Africa.

173
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:41,270
Absolutely. So if COVAX had worked as they had been proposed in March of 2020.

174
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,070
This map should have been monochromatic, which have all been one color, maybe all in event, dark blue.

175
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,670
Maybe it would be one of these other medium shades of blue.

176
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,890
Maybe. What about wind or blue?

177
00:20:54,160 --> 00:21:04,420
But we wouldn't have these splotches of yellow and orange here, especially as you can see, it's really concentrated on the African continent.

178
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:15,850
In most of these other countries that have lighter colors outside of Africa are facing really fragile and conflict ridden situations.

179
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:21,040
And I know we have North Korea so that up.

180
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,239
So on the other hand,

181
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:34,060
we have pretty much the entire concept but just seems to be like glaring here in the middle of our map where we look at why this happened.

182
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,600
All right. So we take you back to early 2020.

183
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:47,310
We're starting to hear about this virus you have come February.

184
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:50,160
The W.H.O. declares a global pandemic.

185
00:21:52,530 --> 00:22:01,290
A little bit later, coming to March, Dr. Tedros, who is the director general of the World Health Organization, announces the.

186
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:09,570
ACT, Accelerator, AZT and access to COVID 19 Tools Accelerator Project.

187
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:17,760
And so this included a COVAX pillar. So remember early in COVID 19, you can have vaccines, you're worried about PPE.

188
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:25,080
We were worried about developing treatments. In addition to vaccines, we were just kind of scrambling.

189
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:33,960
So this is one of many pillars in the ACG, but COVAX is supposed to focus on this issue of vaccination,

190
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,650
both vaccine development and non vaccine distribution.

191
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:49,280
And so the COVAX facility was founded out of this pillar and was deemed to be a partnership between Cepi.

192
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:55,960
GAVI and WTO is going to be key players for COVAX first.

193
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,450
Early in the early days. Cepi was really involved in dealing with this vaccine development question.

194
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:06,889
And as time has gone on, GAVI has kind of evolved more and more.

195
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:18,560
COVAX it is. How is that GAVI? I can tell you it is just one wing of one form of the two force academy, both in the global health campus in Geneva.

196
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:28,270
It's essentially interchangeable with the Secretariat on a day to day basis when you're functioning in the system.

197
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,890
But here we are. We have COVAX created in 2020.

198
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:42,080
Guys remember, this was supposed to pull global efforts from countries of all income levels,

199
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:50,180
from the highest income to the lowest income countries, providing whatever money they could that would then be pooled and distributed.

200
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,490
Doesn't occur. All right. We have like a two week lag.

201
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:05,170
And then President Trump announces Operation Warp Speed, which in which the US government decided to front a bunch of money,

202
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:12,550
including the advance market commitments in advance purchase agreements for COVID vaccine development.

203
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:17,460
And of course, other rich countries were following suit.

204
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:27,390
They were all providing their own funding directly to manufacturers to reserve doses in the case that they were successful in throughout the 1990.

205
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:33,120
So this is already causing problems.

206
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:41,190
Remember that initial diagram that will stream where the countries were not only getting donations,

207
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:51,000
but their own funding for vaccines into the system has officially shrivel up and destroyed.

208
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:02,000
And of course, by the end of 2020, you're going to get the first emergency use authorizations for COVID 19 vaccines.

209
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:10,870
Vaccines begin to roll out across most of the countries, but start vaccinating across their priority groups and quickly into 2021,

210
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:14,510
start their larger vaccination campaigns across the population.

211
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:28,520
All right. We make it to 2021. So while the US government was and other rich countries were buying up vaccine doses, what was COVAX doing?

212
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:35,930
Well, COVAX was waiting because they hadn't received all the money that countries had pledged to them.

213
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:44,450
And without money, you can't make a purchase because everyone's all these pharmaceutical companies.

214
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:48,500
But we're getting actual agreements from these countries directly.

215
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:52,400
And you haven't got money yet, so why would we sign an agreement with you?

216
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:57,480
So they're waiting patiently to get their funds from all these high income countries.

217
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:04,530
And finally, by early 2021, they have gotten their finances enough in order that they were able to start making

218
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:08,490
their own purchases for months first by the time that they get to the table.

219
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:19,350
And a lot of the doses are spoken for, but they are able to make a agreement with the Serum Institute of India totaling over a billion doses.

220
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:26,070
These doses are going to cover vaccination for countries all over the global south.

221
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:32,240
I think 94 countries were supposed to receive these billion doses the start.

222
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:43,900
And they start to receive some doses early, early mid 2021, they're starting to think their first COVAX deliveries to recipient countries.

223
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:52,510
And what happens. That's right. So the Delta variant picks up and we have the surge in India.

224
00:26:54,230 --> 00:27:00,470
Which then proposes the Indian government similar to what Western countries had all done as well,

225
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:06,230
to allow any export of vaccines until they were able to vaccinate their population.

226
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:16,350
As Institute is based in India and we had these vaccine doses people are dying also seems to make sense that they would do something like that.

227
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,740
Of course, the Indian population is 1.3 billion.

228
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,000
So it's going to take a while to that to make that calculation.

229
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,650
So in the meantime, the Navy is scrambling.

230
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:36,980
What do we do with COVAX? How do we start to get vaccines back out to the rest of the world?

231
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,719
Well, that was at this point that countries that had made these massive,

232
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:53,420
massive amounts of purchase agreements for vaccinations had kind of worked their way through their populations,

233
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:57,860
especially the populations that were interested in getting vaccinated and willing to vaccinate,

234
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:05,300
had mostly been vaccinated, got two doses by the time we're in the middle of 2021.

235
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:13,460
So Gallegos door knocking country to country, asking for donations of extra doses.

236
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:19,140
So this started with a promise for 100 million doses provided.

237
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:23,220
This obviously increased over time. He made this first commitment.

238
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,570
And other countries were making similar commitments across the border.

239
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:40,030
So COVAX and GAVI, which have always functioned as a system in which they only deal with pooling money and they don't take any kind donations.

240
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:45,880
They don't even take earmarking on their donations to going from a system where they're dealing with

241
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,710
receiving funds to make their own purchase agreements for their own systems that they have in place.

242
00:28:51,920 --> 00:29:00,500
To essentially receiving trying to do something logistically received doses and supplies from countries across the world.

243
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:05,430
So obviously there's challenges in first.

244
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:17,149
There's a big difference between a commitment that makes us believe doses of the vaccines and how long it actually takes for that to be implemented.

245
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:21,710
And it can take years for donor commitment to actually fully committed to it.

246
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:30,510
Oftentimes, it's set up in two installments over time. And there's just bureaucratic delays in actually just getting these things started.

247
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,120
There's also the concern of inflammatory materials.

248
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,680
So in order to vaccinate people, you just have to vials of vaccine.

249
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:43,550
You need that little solutions. You need syringes.

250
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:49,580
In the global south, they only use disabled syringes, eight syringes.

251
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:59,600
And they work out, especially the Pfizer vaccine uses a very specific syringe because it has a very specific dosage.

252
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:08,110
But. They didn't have enough supplies, so they don't have the supplies bundled with those doses to some of the country.

253
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:13,659
There is these delays. There's also issues of receiving doses that were near expiring.

254
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:19,150
They're expiring by the time they're getting to COVAX or Copenhagen, UNICEF supply division.

255
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:24,250
Imagine by the time they actually get it in country, that actually needs that.

256
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:31,660
And then from that central store in country to get it out to that last mile and to the people who need to be vaccinated,

257
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,290
we start to see the logistical nightmare here.

258
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:45,930
So it's about the time you probably saw one or two headlines of expired doses being donated left and right.

259
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,380
And what that means and why?

260
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:57,100
Why are we not seeing people getting vaccinated when there's available supply?

261
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,590
Well, it wasn't just the supply.

262
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:12,760
It was the actual implementation of of these vaccination programs from Start House all the way to country and then out to to that last mile.

263
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,959
So simultaneous. We could have round one though, where I started to hit African Union,

264
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:30,090
which had been placing quite a bit of faith in GAVI and COVAX, started to have some rumbling rumblings like.

265
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,600
They they don't seem to be figuring this out. We got to figure this out ourselves.

266
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:45,840
So the African Union had done their own fund raising among their member states, and they collected the funds to purchase vaccines themselves.

267
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:52,680
And of course, by the time that they did this, they were even further behind than COVAX in the queue to buy vaccines.

268
00:31:53,370 --> 00:32:03,060
And essentially all the vaccines were purchased through 2021, through the beginning, 2022, and now the pharmaceutical companies will even see that.

269
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:14,540
Eventually we get to the end of 2021 and the US finally agrees to do a to swap with that union.

270
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:20,760
So essentially they're going to continue to buy more vaccines with their original commitments

271
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:28,830
and they finally let the EU skip the line a little bit to make a agreement of their own,

272
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,480
and they were able to purchase 100 million doses of the vaccine.

273
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,470
I mean, this is end of 2021. At this point.

274
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,890
Most people in the US had already gotten their booster.

275
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:47,550
So think about that here. We're looking at 3 to 0 across the world.

276
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:53,770
And of course, this wouldn't be complete without another variant.

277
00:32:54,370 --> 00:33:01,330
Only crime starts to surge. It was first identified in Botswana and then early surge in South Africa.

278
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,910
And then of course, the time of the new year came around.

279
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:15,340
It was circulating world becoming the predominant variant of COVID that we are facing a variant that like that was much more resistant against

280
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:26,440
the vaccines we developed and of course was coming out of a place that had pretty low vaccination coverage and high speculation of COVID 19.

281
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:36,290
So here we are, finally, 2022. And there are other things going on.

282
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:40,040
Like, I feel like every step of the way to me to hear about this till now.

283
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:46,010
So there's finally a COVID 19 IP waiver that is agreed.

284
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:53,900
So this is intellectual property waiver so that essentially people outside of the Pfizer

285
00:33:53,900 --> 00:34:01,070
emitter and Johnson Johnson plants could manufacture COVID 19 vaccines using those formulas.

286
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:10,200
So this is actually coming out of a 18 month deadlock and negotiation for these IP waivers.

287
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:19,360
And these IP waivers were actually on the mind of a lot of people working on global vaccination from the start of the pandemic.

288
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,540
They knew that this was going to be a problem.

289
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:30,730
They knew that a lot of vaccine manufacturing was concentrated in some countries and the of countries that

290
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:40,870
would be wanting to serve their own interests and that in order to combat the global next level pandemic,

291
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:51,580
you need global access to vaccines. In fact, the W.H.O. among its member states actually has these kinds of agreements in place as a baseline.

292
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:56,360
They just made the mistake of specifying that they're only for influenza vaccines.

293
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:04,570
So this is yeah, they didn't think that a word about this would be the issue you were going to be facing in a global pandemic.

294
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:14,110
So took an extra 18 months, but they finally were allowed to start to produce these vaccines across the board.

295
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:19,720
India and South Africa that had more of this refactoring capacity has jumped

296
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,440
right in and started producing some of these contracted COVID 19 vaccines.

297
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:34,850
So we're getting closer to present here. The governing board decided to extend the administration of Kovacs for another year.

298
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,110
So CapEx is going to continue to work on.

299
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:48,530
Providing vaccines for another year, and then we hope to integrate that into their daily business.

300
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:56,000
Supporting COVID vaccines the same way they would any other vaccine at a country level,

301
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:04,400
country makes a request that interviews, requests and helps develop a plan on how to.

302
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:11,639
Read those vaccines over for amount of time and they eventually kind of went off.

303
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:18,720
That support as a country takes on more and more of that purchasing power themselves.

304
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:28,330
And so here we are. We're in fall of 2022.

305
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:34,030
COVAX has distributed over a billion doses of vaccines to over 140 countries,

306
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:41,860
and yet only 21% of people in low income countries have received the single dose of COVID vaccine.

307
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,060
Whereas on average, those in high income countries.

308
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:51,040
80% have received 2.5 seems at least.

309
00:36:53,560 --> 00:37:02,310
On the flip side, Pfizer has a projected COVID vaccine sale of $32 billion this year.

310
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:15,130
That is the largest single product of a product, profit of any product in the history of the whole industry.

311
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:21,390
And you get here. And we're going to hear it.

312
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:28,440
So here's our growing map again, some slightly different. We're looking at share of people who have received at least one vaccine dose.

313
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:35,020
And we were just talking about. Looks pretty similar to where we were in terms of supply.

314
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:44,500
So we obviously are seeing that formation there. Obviously, there's some countries that are seemingly much far worse off than others.

315
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:50,230
You see the DRC, the Republic of Congo here in the center really in challenge.

316
00:37:53,840 --> 00:38:05,630
That says also speaks to the issues of these conflict settings, as well as fragile health systems that are being particularly challenged.

317
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,330
But again, seeing this African continent here just.

318
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:20,970
Lagging so far behind the rest of the world. So why was Africa left behind?

319
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,920
Africa isn't the only continent reverse. Well, some countries.

320
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:36,470
Why? Why, why did this happen? So thinking about what we just went through in that timeline, does anybody have any thoughts?

321
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:41,830
Obviously, there's not a single thing that one straw that ended up causing this to exist.

322
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:49,430
There's a lot of factors. Anybody. Have any thoughts on one of the factors that led to this change?

323
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:03,040
You can look at this location here. See that? Johnson where do you think that they went wrong?

324
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:07,240
They. Not.

325
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:26,000
Okay. So start again. So we started the supply.

326
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:32,959
Why? It was the African continent compared to other continents not able to vaccinate their

327
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,440
population when these high income countries started purchasing up all the vaccine.

328
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:44,970
It's because Africa has very little. Vaccine manufacturing capacity or actually any health products manufacturing capacity.

329
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:59,660
The South American continent was able to rely on Brazil and Argentina that had their own vaccine manufacturing systems in place.

330
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:05,280
In Asia and they had their own factory for cooking as well.

331
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:12,630
We had, obviously in India, this Serum Institute, which is a massive operation for vaccine manufacturing.

332
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:20,610
Had countries. Like Russia and China that develop their own proxy.

333
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:29,160
Granted, these maps that I showed do not track vaccine efficacy as one of their factors.

334
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:32,520
So that's something you can think about as well. But.

335
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:42,190
These countries have their they don't have to rely on the generosity of high income countries for their supply.

336
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:56,460
So why is it that if this happens?

337
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:03,980
Why was Africa so ill prepared? Pollster Ashley Olsen said.

338
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,070
During the pandemic,

339
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:16,520
there's housing crisis and ships were getting stuck at certain ports and filling up and they weren't able to deliver the goods in the right places.

340
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:27,470
And maybe because there's not one country on the same continent in Africa that had supply, like there was a lot of time there.

341
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:33,020
Absolutely. So especially earlier on in the pandemic, there was a lot of closures.

342
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:39,860
A lot of times there was challenges in getting access to these supplies, and that also feeds into it.

343
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,970
So they were finally gifted these doses of vaccine.

344
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:51,790
And then they start to ship them. They get locked in a cork, they get lost somewhere.

345
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:55,030
And then by the time they get to the country, they're inspired.

346
00:41:56,350 --> 00:42:03,640
So this is actually was a key, which is to go challenge in getting vaccines into the continent of Africa,

347
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,140
both from just being able to access vaccines.

348
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:16,660
Even at a theoretical level, be able to purchase them all the way to logistically getting them in-country when there wasn't any local manufacturing.

349
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,120
So why why is ethanol high vaccine manufacturing capacity?

350
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:28,980
Well, the African continent has the most eligible countries in the world.

351
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:34,250
I think. Of the gang portfolio.

352
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:42,650
The African region is definitely the largest, largest recipient of COVID or of all vaccines,

353
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:50,930
and that is the largest purchaser of vaccines in the world. They're purchasing vaccines for over 148 countries.

354
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:58,550
So. You'd think that that would be a pretty major player.

355
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:06,170
They're bringing vaccines into Africa, delivering vaccines to a country, country by country basis.

356
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:18,200
But a wonderful vaccine for polio. By one I forget if any other fever vaccine from the States at all.

357
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:30,030
That's it. All the other vaccines that are purchased by GAVI and funneled into the continent are purchased outside of Africa.

358
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:38,380
So if the main buyer for African vaccines isn't buying vaccines in Africa, who would buy vaccines?

359
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,990
And they already have an impact globally.

360
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:52,920
So without that demand, this industry never developed in Africa and they weren't really able to develop.

361
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,420
They weren't even able to try to start to compete because.

362
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:06,860
These other established manufacturers are giving away these crazy prices on vaccines because of the quantity of vaccine they're purchasing.

363
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:11,350
But they're also established enough to be able to do that. You're a new vaccine manufacturer.

364
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:20,640
You can't cut your vaccine price into tent and expect to be able to compete with the other the states.

365
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:30,330
So we are a continent without significant vaccine manufacturing capacity.

366
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:35,330
That. Means vaccine manufacturing capacity.

367
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:45,310
And where where do we go from here? So this is not something that was flagged out of COVID 19 as a response, as an issue.

368
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:57,130
Mind you, this response and this solution was also proposed after the H1N1 virus, after hours after Ebola.

369
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:04,500
But find that off the headlines finally starting to get more interest from the global health sector.

370
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:13,200
I mean, who beforehand had never really expressed interest in supporting African vaccine manufacturing specifically?

371
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:21,300
And they're always looking for that low price to be able to buy the most amount of vaccine, to vaccinate people, to be vaccinated.

372
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:32,990
From a business perspective, that makes sense. But even they are actually recently proposed and released a white paper supporting this effort.

373
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:37,070
The IMF has been writing support.

374
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:42,340
And the African Union has launched its partnership for Africa in the U.S.

375
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:57,050
And they developed a framework for action and a plan. So the Africa CDC has announced their plan to produce 1.5 billion vaccines by the year 2040.

376
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:03,700
This is not just for vaccines, but just. To meet 60% of its need.

377
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:11,230
As a matter. This is a $30 billion project that is projected to take 20 years.

378
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:21,780
It's a big undertaking and currently they have 12 production facilities across the country

379
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:27,989
that are either in process of ramping up to being able to manufacture or storing them.

380
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:35,210
And that's already. Of course, beyond just creating more manufacturing plants.

381
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:39,300
For vaccines. There's also a lot more that goes into this.

382
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:43,190
They need regulators. So pressure regulators coming into power.

383
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:49,130
They need stimulus. They need commitment from people that are going to be purchasing their vaccines that sustainable.

384
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:57,969
And they need technology transfer. So making vaccines is not always easy.

385
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:00,370
And there's lots of different methodologies.

386
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:11,200
There's lots of different kinds of vaccines each that requires their own specific methods and technologies to actually create a vaccine that works.

387
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:22,630
So it's a lot to do. It seems kind of like this big solution that everybody is excited about right now.

388
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:27,980
Will it come to fruition? Will it work? We'll see.

389
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:34,460
Go back to the beginning. Yeah. But I mean, this is this is a much longer timeline.

390
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:42,320
This is looking at a larger systemic problem that the COVID pandemic and the lack of COVID vaccines has highlighted,

391
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:46,280
particularly around the African continent and their access.

392
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:55,030
So that's a lot. We're going to take a pause here.

393
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:02,710
I'm going to have you take just 2 minutes and this reflect on what are some of the challenges you might see in this project moving forward.

394
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:12,110
You saw some of the challenges that are faced with. That global health sector and in terms of the liberty vaccine distribution.

395
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:18,010
What do you think might be some challenges in that global health space, in that global governance?

396
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:25,560
When they're trying to establish this Afghan that's a manufacturing network.

397
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:33,990
So take a few minutes reflect and then I'll spend 2 minutes and I'll have you just show up in either that booth and.

398
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:21,450
All right. When you're ready to turn to a neighbor or two, just share something with us.

399
00:49:51,230 --> 00:50:09,920
Ever since I was a little girl, I.

400
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:50,130
Thank you for your time.

401
00:50:53,030 --> 00:51:00,120
I love you. Just a minute.

402
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:05,640
And if someone was willing to share with you, talk about.

403
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:14,380
All right. So anyone like to share with these?

404
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:26,480
He. A couple of things that we talked about were figuring out where,

405
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:32,680
how actually the funding for developing the entire like a physical structure that has these vaccines.

406
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,990
Also like which particular countries in Africa the take on vaccines.

407
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:48,610
And then how they get those vaccines to other countries, especially when like with COVID, like those vaccines have to be that cool and sterile.

408
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:54,040
And those things could be hard to maintain that you're dispersing across numerous countries.

409
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:02,590
Absolutely. And actually, the cocaine, the ultra cold chain has been a really big challenge with COVID vaccines in Africa.

410
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:08,040
A lot of countries already have countries under quality for vaccines.

411
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:16,610
So looking at how to get out of these ultra cold storage that were developed at a central level to getting

412
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:24,130
them in country or out into the knees where they need to be once they are taking it out of the pool,

413
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:29,000
can have a really short lifespan of any use injected.

414
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:39,229
So that was a huge challenge that we face and we continue to be if you even if you're bringing manufacturing into Africa,

415
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:44,510
if you have those proteins at that central storage, how does that translate down one?

416
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:47,010
Absolutely. And.

417
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:05,999
I agree with you that even if you are able to build the kind of the structure to have these things and to make actually the vaccines in five,

418
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,620
ten years they build on, which I estimate at that point some of it to make some money.

419
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:18,870
It is not meant to fall into it or to need help and anything that should act as a 44 year old widow.

420
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:27,570
Absolutely. That's a great point as well, because I like I mean, there's lots of access going into that for all sorts of diseases.

421
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:33,540
But a lot of these vaccines have different technologies and all of them have different technologies and vaccines.

422
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:37,440
The first time I see that ever come to market.

423
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:42,810
So those is a completely different technology to produce those and to do those.

424
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:46,840
So what do you do in that situation? Absolute.

425
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:59,730
You also like building your shots for the local community so that you know what the vaccine is.

426
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:04,720
You actually have to declare in the first place. Absolutely.

427
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:14,920
Regeneration is often forgotten by people that are focusing on the back end of the day and that will make the system single.

428
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:30,720
We said to the see that this is a priority, but there are other things that also affect other countries and other places besides the.

429
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:42,760
And yet other her. That's great.

430
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:48,129
Those are some great points he issued that I'm sure that these are going to

431
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:53,320
have to address in the coming years as they start to develop this hamburger.

432
00:54:53,980 --> 00:55:01,810
They're traveling really fast as well as much of they already trying to get 12 manufacturers up and running.

433
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:07,400
Currently that they're claiming are either already up and running or very near up and running.

434
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:17,800
How those. Turn out in the round robin, learn how long they last, and if they're able to then make those types of agreements.

435
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:23,820
If we're really just like Avi to be able to provide vaccines in country is is another.

436
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:33,050
Much. All right.

437
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:39,020
So from here, we're going to wrap up in just a moment. Before I do so, I have to give my disclaimer here.

438
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:43,010
I actually worked for years before getting accused.

439
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:52,070
I was part of the initial public response team, actually, this before we had vaccines this early 2020.

440
00:55:52,400 --> 00:56:04,879
Right now with lockdown, we are mostly focusing on reallocating plans we have for health system, strengthening interventions to PPE.

441
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,000
So persons within the countries.

442
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:13,730
I want to say at that point, you're already facing challenges in that space.

443
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:21,010
So that balance of being able to purchase when those countries were already purchasing our supply,

444
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:27,520
we were also facing challenges on getting those supplies actually in-country because of all those COVID restrictions.

445
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:32,680
So this wasn't a surprise and a surprise.

446
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:40,970
Turns out it was. Anyways, still a lot of challenges. Needless to say, there's a long way to go.

447
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:51,499
But we'll see where we go from here. If you have any questions about all that and the difficulty of that for free, any questions?

448
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:56,680
Well, before we finish up this moment, think of one thing that you've taken away from this.

449
00:56:56,690 --> 00:57:03,560
It doesn't have to be leftover cake. Out of this of vaccines.

450
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:07,080
Maybe it's just what would you learn about global health more broadly?

451
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:12,890
Maybe it's. Just that I don't think I'm going to be I don't know.

452
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:20,840
I think something that you are going to take away you today. And then the I question and then how do you share your passion with your neighbor?

453
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:30,110
Once you have that question. Something I use for this kind of sparking you when you have that little help.

454
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:39,460
Seems that. When you're ready, you can share that question with your neighbor.

455
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:49,920
Also share your take away. If you want to know why.

456
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:58,310
I actually like the idea.

457
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:36,840
But no, actually, I was like, Oh, it's all right.

458
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:46,530
Thanks for sharing your neighbors. This is absolutely no pressure from this to yourself.

459
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:51,720
You're welcome to ask me before we have a question they want to share in my house.

460
00:58:55,600 --> 00:59:00,730
And the story I heard today going to happen is that.

461
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:10,960
I'm wondering if there is a way to kind of regulate the vaccine distribution in the

462
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:17,930
global community so that it doesn't get to the point where in America people are.

463
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:23,960
This is and then in Africa, people don't even have their first dose is.

464
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:29,960
I feel like the answer is no. Is there a way to regulate that?

465
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:39,110
Or I would put something in the books to avoid that inequality or that.

466
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:50,959
So you never use the word? Certainly, no. In order to do that, you need to have buy in from different countries to actually see their sovereignty.

467
00:59:50,960 --> 01:00:00,560
When it comes to COVID 19 vaccine purchasing, to a little entity like COVAX, or they've got something else that they wanted to create.

468
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:05,960
But what we find is that no one likes to see their sovereignty.

469
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:12,860
The only difference between rich countries and poor countries is that rich countries for afford not the promise.

470
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:22,130
So at the end of the day, I mean, if it was reversed, I mean, of course we like to think that if it was reversed and,

471
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:31,520
you know, the Ethiopian government had all the vaccines, that they would be better about it.

472
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:41,480
And you feel that? You know, actually, I think that, you know, because like we saw with, you know, when we got to India,

473
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:52,520
as soon as they faced a similar situation as the US where they were having surging cases and they had vaccine doses available in their territory,

474
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:58,130
they immediately shut down that export so that they could keep the vaccine from itself.

475
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:08,900
Actually, in South Africa they did the same thing because there actually was the vaccines are being developed in the U.S., in Africa,

476
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:19,130
South Africa and other plants that were then meant to be shipped out to Italy that had just left doses from even bigger in Africa.

477
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,610
So not in fact of but for African countries.

478
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:27,890
And now another is on the way. And they also have that effect here.

479
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:34,190
So it goes all directions. At the end of the day, these countries are responsible for their constituencies.

480
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:38,290
And they also I mean, they like to be more focused on health.

481
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:41,780
So there you go. And you.

482
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:56,780
My question was that is going to be extremely vaccinees in Africa and ideally with the people from Africa,

483
01:01:56,790 --> 01:02:05,250
but that just, you know, goes back to like the lack of infrastructure and services like that.

484
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:16,680
So getting the vaccines there is one thing, but getting them to people and making it a safe place to get vaccines is a whole different challenge.

485
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:23,400
Absolutely. So it's a huge challenge here for for health in a lot of these countries is a big issue.

486
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:31,150
We have investments in nurses and health problems that no one is in private.

487
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:41,400
There's no funding to countries to hire that. But often pregnancies that are frozen, underpaid or overworked, especially during COVID.

488
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:47,909
Just like health workers around the world are getting these extreme challenges and

489
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:53,399
situations where they're trying to help people as they can in a lot of African countries.

490
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:59,600
So they have systems for they have vaccinators that are trained as vaccinators, the health workers,

491
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:04,890
they're not nurses and doctors, but they are trained specifically to vaccinate.

492
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,639
So really how to thank you guys when you were vaccinated,

493
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:15,210
went to one of those nation sites where you had the firefighters and civil servants vaccinating.

494
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:28,510
Yes. Space Force, Space Force, Space Force deployed a bunch of the trucks in Arizona to more fuel taxes on area.

495
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:37,460
So I guess my question is, how did that see that operation?

496
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:45,710
Mm hmm. So how have you see the role evolving?

497
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:56,060
Yeah, like. Like I was I was one of the first that I spoke to the president, but.

498
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,910
01274.

499
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:04,280
Oh, well, that's funny.

500
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:13,360
So that I could think of how did it how did we not see it coming through was so ignorance.

501
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:27,680
I think I think they thought that since these countries going into Caracas that they supported its mission and supported its system.

502
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:34,340
I don't think they saw it coming, but they would donate to Caracas and then immediately buy up all the supplies,

503
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:37,730
essentially rendering their innocence completely useless.

504
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:44,750
I think that was a surprise. Even if you make.

505
01:04:53,090 --> 01:05:01,420
Okay. Well, if not, they are the group that you guys had a couple minutes that you have any other questions they might need.

506
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:18,970
I think that has to be dealt. We will be meeting on Wednesday for your regular programing and we have a lot on Thursday.

507
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:25,670
So if you have questions or deeper in depth questions about the papers with or about.
