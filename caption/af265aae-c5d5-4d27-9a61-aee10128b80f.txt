1
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay, hello, good morning, Everyone that's get started So first again, we will go over quickly.

2
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The the quiz are you just tired in that's always.

3
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Most of you did really well, so i'll do it relatively quickly.

4
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But if you do have question, please let me know

5
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So the first question and the the whole quiz is about its sampling concepts.

6
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The first question asked about. you know what kind of a study design you gotta take for this particular study where you want to write a report of all the current lab levels and drinking water in household in flint.

7
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I think this was referring to the front of the flint.

8
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You know that problem and drinking water for those of you are familiar with.

9
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So there are 4 study design you know all of them are possible right here.

10
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
We're just trying to see which one is the best I think the key is not to the best answer, but rather hard, you know.

11
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Argue. Why, why that's the best answer So the first one is driving Flint Michigan, but dividing flint magic into 50 district regions and clap water for 5 random household in reach region so this

12
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:33,000
is reasonable post, and then use it. Second lines Use the data from 22,001 study clock daily, late Michigan.

13
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
30 is similar to the first one dividing Flint, Michigan to 50 district region, a clock water to a from 2 random housing.

14
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Each region. I finally drive through a flint michigan and find 200 homes waiting for you to clap.

15
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So that's a convenient sample so I think the the choices are sort of a randomized.

16
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So the the order, you see, that may not be the same thing as I see it here.

17
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So both of you did really well on this I I I like to have a volunteer to tell me which one you're close, and why

18
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I know It's a little early in the morning but I was like chose to answer c.

19
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Or see the third option, Why is that

20
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Oh, sorry. I think it was the first one. Oh, yeah, and why is that?

21
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Because I thought that that option would gave me the population with or the the sample with which was generalizable to the largest population.

22
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And would be a random sample that those 2 were my arguments compared to the other ones.

23
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Thank you very much. Yeah, this is absolutely the right answer.

24
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So So maybe we can actually look at the other 3 to see what, what? what problem they have Right?

25
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So the second one, the data from a Who's on the one study clock Daily Land level in Lake Michigan.

26
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So here we want to study Flint by your clacking up from Lake Michigan.

27
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Just not a populator, you're studying so it's totally off.

28
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And then this one is not too bad dividing, flimmering into 50 region, and cl from 2 random household.

29
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
This is pretty good, except the first one is even better because we have a larger sample size. Right?

30
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So both of these 2 are sort of a representative sample but the first one has a larger sample size, so that one we'll have more information, and the final wise you know it's a convenient sample

31
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:53,000
from 200 house or volunteers. So anytime, you collect from a Communist level, you have to be aware that you know there could be a potential bias, right?

32
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:01,000
People who wasn't here to to give you data may have a certain kind of resting that may not be totally random, but not here.

33
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This is a you know It's random sample so random sample is more of a Z people than communism, or in general.

34
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Thank you very much. Any questions regarding this

35
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Okay, Now let's move on question number 2 so here it's a different study Us women who has a double as talk me as treatment for graph cancer.

36
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Right. So again, which sample you think is good. This one is a little higher than the first one.

37
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I think most of you still did well, so the first one is the database of women receiving a double.

38
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That's not going to need in this period from Michigan cancer Center.

39
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Second one is the same period, but from 30 different Canada, Michigan.

40
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
By the third one is a database of mo major, Us Private Company insurance Company.

41
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You know women, you dialing for this company are receiving this and finalize a database cloud by nci.

42
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So again I wanna volunteer to help you, you know.

43
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Answer this question and tell me, you spectrum. Tell me why?

44
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Why is that answer? Yeah, I think, Tracy, maybe you wanna go Okay.

45
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I chose a database collected by that Cancer Institute for Women, receiving a double mastectomy.

46
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The dates might be a little old, the other ones, but because the Nash National Cancer Institute is more of a general organization.

47
00:14:49,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I thought that was the best choice, because, as the other ones are limited to the University of Michigan, and then the other one was a database from a private insurance company.

48
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Thank you very much. I was the the other person wasn't lying, or you.

49
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I got it. Let me know. Do you have anything to add up?

50
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
No crazy, basically said everything. Thank you, yeah, thank both of you for following hearing.

51
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah, you're absolutely right. this one is my favorite I i'll go over them as this one is more trickier because you can argue, you know some of them.

52
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So the first one is only university. So here we want to study the whole us right, if you only sample from University of Michigan.

53
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Apparently it's a not representative but you do not really cover the whole.

54
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Us similar for second one, the second one is better than the first one, because it's covered the State Michigan, but it doesn't cover all this thing right both of the third and the fourth choices they supposedly cover the whole us so

55
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
geographically, that's better i'm done you know Now we compare right.

56
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So the time time here is Ip, for the Si is a little not as good as as the other one, because, you know you always want to recent something possible.

57
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
If you take this one, your you have to assume, you know.

58
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Women, you know, receiving this particular procedure you know their characteristics and their outcomes.

59
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Probably didn't change for a long time so the time here. do not play a major role, but that's kind of assumption you're making right everything else equally like a more recent sample.

60
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
But the difference here is that this is from Nci is a government institute.

61
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I mean supposedly cover the whole Us. and this one is a Us.

62
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Private insurance company. So he's really I mean at this stage is really sort of a subjective judgment.

63
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I think we trust the Government agency more because they were sort of a nonprofit right, and they were deal to.

64
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
We improve public health, right? They they they keep that in mind.

65
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And and also, you know, basically, they have. They are less biased.

66
00:16:47,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Had a private interest company because first of all there's a building bias, because not everybody's insured by private insurance. but many people now use robot private insurance, and the people who insured by private interests probably is different from people

67
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
who utilize nonprofit insurance. therefore, you know they they will have some you know.

68
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
That's a second Secondly, is that if you think about it right?

69
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The inference Company will not build. to do research. Right research is not their priority at all right?

70
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So, although they have the data, but because the data was not collected for research purpose rather than Sci data.

71
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So a parity they they probably are. not well designed and they probably are. Do not collect all the information which is needed here.

72
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So that's all you know distinguishing 3 and 4, a little bit more subjective.

73
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So. personally. I like full. I think many of you, Dick, but I you know I I can see 3 has a little bit argument not like it.

74
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The other tool Is that in now? So any question, any comment?

75
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yes, please I was just curious. so like you said I mean I told you D.

76
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,000
But, like you, said the time was more appealing than the other ones compared to D.

77
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But when go to question 3 yeah I thought the time in in option d for question, 2 is better because it increase the sample size, and when you go to d that's why like I didn't collect that that's why

78
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I do pick collect sample. theorem samples over a short period of time, because that would decrease my end.

79
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So I I I was just curious like for question, too, If there were 2 answers, one was basically saying a database collected by the Nci on on women receiving double mesectomies 2,012 to 20

80
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
17 versus that other option, do you? Which one would you pick?

81
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So Yeah, good question i'll i'll go over that yeah, you are right.

82
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Right the time in this period they have, I think it is a 5 year.

83
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
This is a 4 year. So then, one year more, and also, I think more important is is more recent, Right?

84
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Everything else equal. We like to take a recent data, but you know, so it time wise.

85
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000
This one is better, and also insurance Company because, you know they they they call our meetings.

86
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You get not hundreds of minutes of people right? They probably have more data points than 9 years.

87
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So the sample size is do not, may not be fully reflected by the number of years, but rather, I think I I think Insurance Company.

88
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Paul had more data points on Nci because nci collect data, you know, for research purpose, right?

89
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
There's a add on cost. so they they do not have unlimited resource to like a large sample.

90
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
But here, no, they already have the data. They just need to extract the data right.

91
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So I assume the sample has scarce bigger, so sample, size, wise time, wise.

92
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:01,000
This is better. But, however, you know, everything else equal right. there is a There is a higher rocky in terms of the importance.

93
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So the biasness or representatives is number one. So so. so.

94
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The idea is this: if your sample is biased, large sample size actually do not help you.

95
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Even that actually give you more lines. So if you, if your sample is not representative in the first place, right larger sample is basically the bias is fogg and large, however, will reduce the uncertainty.

96
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But because the sample is biased, the conclusion you made will actually more likely to be a false positive.

97
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Given a large example, because you think your sample is not biased but it's actually by it.

98
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You have large samples, so you make a very strong conclusion, which is a long conclusion.

99
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
So if your sample is buying the first place, then the sample size is the secondary problem.

100
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
There, so everything else equal on the larger sample size. But the bias.

101
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
This is number one. So I I think the nci sample, because it was well designed, you know, by a File Research Institute license research back.

102
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So they should have higher quality income representatives and the private comedy.

103
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Really they do not collect the data for research progress. So I do.

104
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I do not believe the private company. we will have a representative level.

105
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Call the whole us. They may right but there's so many private insurance company, and they have different focus.

106
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Some of them focused on the East coast. i'm hoping the last poll that they're they're representing is to make sure should not be asking. I think we just look at the branding right We trust the trust the government

107
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
organization more. but there is some subject in still dealing. I hope that.

108
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Answer your question. there is a question in the chat.

109
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Take any regional difference into account compared v because it's national.

110
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Yeah, I think we already talk about that right? yeah, the B. only talk about Michigan, right?

111
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So it's not representative so so representative in this right or for oh, on biasness, this is more important than assemblies.

112
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:04,000
To begin with any comment.

113
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
So this, you know. study design sampling issue a little more tricky. That's why I want to spend a little more time here before we move on.

114
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
This is not usually something we do every day. Usually, when we got the data set, is already there, right? We don't even think about holiday.

115
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
That war more up type right by if you're aware of the bias building the data.

116
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You know I could. Oh, fact, You know, your interpretation of the final finding right?

117
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:44,000
So if the data was biased, no matter. what you find there will be biased, it'll be actually more dangerous for you to assume the data unbiased and analyze the data interpret you know accordingly, But actually data wise that's even

118
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:54,000
worse. Okay, if there's no question i'll move on number 3 3 under 4 a little trick here, because they have multiple choices. right?

119
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
This is always tricky. but again you, you know most of you did pretty well while I was slow down here.

120
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So you are studying Sarah and cortisol level.

121
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You married woman? Experience domestic violence, right? which is the poly.

122
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You effectively reduce the sample of our ability to sample.

123
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
We imported the level who do not reduce the generalizability.

124
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Right. So there are 2 things. Why is the generalizability the thing I talk about?

125
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
If your sample is representative, and unbiased the generalizable right.

126
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:37,000
That's that's not one so whether the sample is generalizable. depend on whether it's biased or whether it's representative second thing is the sample variability that has something to do with you know the population

127
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:51,000
variability, and also to do is sample size right I thought. Well, that's exactly your first one, or some vote will be generalizable that you want to reduce the uncertainty by by you know reduce the variability so here.

128
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
We want to reduce availability while keeping the generalizability on under packing right?

129
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,000
We don't want to compromise the more important thing by improve on a second or anything.

130
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So choose every response, and there are 4 them first collecting the serial sample over a short period of time.

131
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's not gonna email the number of women providing Sarah sample. there is restricting the sample woman to live in a specific geographic region.

132
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Finally, use a more accurate instrument. So anyone volunteer to answer this

133
00:24:40,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I can answer it. So question number 3, I picked using a more accurate instrument, because it would like lower the noise, and then also increasing the number of women because it would increase the sample size cool yeah, I told

134
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
it agree. But what's wrong with the other one with the other 2

135
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I think someone else i'll said this but if you collect shorter or serum samples over shorter period of time.

136
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You would have a smaller Sam end, and then, if you restrict the sample to a geographic region, it would reduce the generalize ability.

137
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Thank you Yeah, me you're right right so let's let's go over the are.

138
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:45,000
We go ahead. I would also say that collecting over a shorter period of time, but also decreases general generalizability of the sample, right? because cortisol levels vary during different times of day So If you collect in the short time.

139
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
period. Then you'll get you'll get one representative sample of the larger population.

140
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Yeah, you are absolutely right. So essentially, if you collect a sample over a short period time, then your sample will only represent it for that period. time.

141
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Right. You cannot really generalize the other time. Time points, for example, the the the the Sarah and Portisol level might actually change, depending on when the domestic violence happen.

142
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
If you only collect that for example within 3 days you'd already know what's happening after like one week or 2 week, right?

143
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So you want to get a whole picture. Then you need to study that, you know.

144
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Overall over a larger period of time, and over a larger group of people right?

145
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
That's also to the third point where If you restrict yourself on living the specific geographic region.

146
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Maybe you will Reduce the sampling variability but the cost is that you also reduce the generalizability, because if you only collect sample from Michigan, you don't know what's going on in other states I mean maybe they're the

147
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:51,000
same, or maybe they're not. you'd never know right so you have to look you know, based on your assumption that all the States behave the same right.

148
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,000
There's much by a little collapse data and verify assumption rather than just make make assumption without tracking, but increasing the number of women.

149
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Everything else equal. This never hurts, because that increase your sample size and use a more accurate instrument also never hurts, because i'll give you more accurate measurements.

150
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So the sampling variability is A is a the sum of many factors.

151
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Right not include, you know, not include like a inter individual variability.

152
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:29,000
So from me to you, to other people that include intro individual in intro subject variability.

153
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:38,000
For example, the same person at different time of the day. They have different, you know, variability at a different level, and also that include measurement, arrow, right?

154
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Suppose So, for example, your block pressure is 1 30 right now. but if I use a very poor machine, the number I got maybe 1, 20, maybe 1, 40. But if I use a very accurate machine then. a number of hours would be very close to

155
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
true right? So the so the final sampling of our ability to see, you know, data actually has many, many contribution from different factors, right?

156
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Reducing any of them will. How but to read you know reduce the intern or intro individual vulnerability.

157
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
We'll reduce the generalizability because those are Bg.

158
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,000
On reduce the measurement. Error will help you, because the matter is simply on noise that has no information in there.

159
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Right so that's the the right answer should be 2 and 4.

160
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:33,000
So any question here. Comments.

161
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Okay, finalize a little bit numerical. So you clap data that produce a sample mean of 13.6. and the sample standard deviation is 6.2.

162
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Now it's asking what are the plausible value of standard error of the mean.

163
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Choose. you know it's again audible for it there are any volunteer?

164
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Yeah, I can go with this so yeah that's not my thing is the standard error is the value of the standard aviation divided by descent of the sample size.

165
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,000
So the sample, so the square root of the sample size must be about one that may

166
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So that's not arrow must be a number which is less than 6.2. that's help me exclude 7.4 and after that the course the emphasis should be an integer.

167
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So I just use the the X point to the standard deviation to be divided by the other 3 options.

168
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I have. and then I got a potential square root of the sample size, right so.

169
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And then I make the square of the value I count it and i'll see which value is very close to an integer.

170
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Then it can be the answer, and that's helped me to exclude 5.3, and yeah, that options.

171
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Thank you. Thank you very much. Yeah, you absolutely. Why, that required this question required to to use the formula that we showed in class the standard arrow.

172
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,000
The mean is stuff standard deviation, divided by square root of the sample size, and this the sample size has to be.

173
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You know samples as a one just doesn't make sense So Sam was That has to be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, right?

174
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You just plug in those in you will see. I think this is when the sample size equals 10.

175
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,000
This is when the samples are equal. 3. Ivb: This one can never happen, and this one just do not happen.

176
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
You mean some of us too you don't get this number and of course this number are wrong.

177
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Then right. For example, if you really plug in sample at 10, you probably got 1.9, 6, or 9 9 7 something.

178
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
But you know when you're wrong, out is 2.0 so the crap has one on the 2.

179
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Wait Can you repeat your reasoning why 5.3 doesn't work?

180
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I can I get. I understood why anything greater than the inter deviation would then create.

181
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Sure. let's try right though the standard so the standard deviation is 6 point, 2 less.

182
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Go on to who go, so that will be so let's try 6 point, 2 divided by square root of 2 that'll be 4.4, right?

183
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So, even if sample size is 2 you should get 4.4. I've done with Sambo.

184
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Had this 3, you got 3.6 that's this one So when a sample has increased, the standard dev error will decrease.

185
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So that means you never really. you can never get 5. point 3 out of it.

186
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So the largest standard arrow will be 4.4.

187
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
So yeah, I mean, this is this question is a little tricky, right?

188
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
If you just look at which one smaller, you might pick this one.

189
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
But you really plug in the number you'll see these ones never possible.

190
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Yeah, I take one step further, so that's Why, some of you told this one.

191
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It's Okay, it's just you know a a a quiz right?

192
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:31,000
But you know, you have to think about what possible samples that might give you this number any other questions

193
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Okay.

194
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So now let's move on to lecture 5 so this lecture has 2 parts.

195
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
It will take longer than usual that's all the lecture in the you know.

196
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Future life on like this. So today we'll try to do one of the projects. but we will not be able to finish.

197
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So good news is that there's nothing due on Monday.

198
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:09,000
So both of this will be due on Tuesday, so we will have the whole weekend on Monday.

199
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Who to summit. but if you like, you could probably sum in you know, over the weekend, or even today they just they. they.

200
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,000
They are due on the up tuesday morning Okay, and that's now. we'll move on today. we're gonna talk about normal distribution central limit.

201
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Theorem common intervals. So so, for the previous port lectures. right?

202
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:38,000
We talk about some you know, overview, and then the realization and the summary statistic and finally sampling sampling concepts, right?

203
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Those are sort of a more warm-up. But those are actually very important concepts, especially the sampling concepts right and the whole framework we talked about yesterday, although short, That's A very important lecturer because that view

204
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
the foundation everything we do later from now are we gonna do more?

205
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,000
You know more mathematical, technical things for some of you may you may not be so familiar that's why we will slow it down and take some time.

206
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So this things are important. but not you know I want to emphasize that it's not, you know.

207
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Of course, everything else equal. The more you know it, the better right.

208
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:22,000
But I would say, remembering the pop formula, the mathematical parameter is the least important thing on this course, cause you know, unless you use the format every day.

209
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
No one remember right after like 5 years I have to go back and you know I don't remember the father either.

210
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:35,000
So understanding what the kilometer is poor and where they come from? what is for It's more important than remembering the formula Right?

211
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
How do you reality? You never need to use the formula and the calculus do it yourself.

212
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
There's always a little software you plug in the data.

213
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
You know the number is up right. The the software will build the phone in the population for you.

214
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So it's key to now what formula is for what we are doing here, and how to interpret the result right? which formula to use. those are more important. And even you know the the we're gonna talk about many different pointer and

215
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
so on, and so forth, even which one to use? Is not that important?

216
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Because in other few years you forget about the details right although we'll talk about the details here.

217
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
But the other data is not important. Important is understand what they are trying to achieve.

218
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Here, because in reality I believe right. when you really do analysis will really, you know, do something unless you are a you know sanitation by yourself.

219
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:29,000
You're very comfortable doing that that's probably great right but if you're not so comfortable, you're gonna work with some vows at the position together, right so it's it's more important that you know the other

220
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:37,000
person's more important for the way work with someone is always The most important thing is is that both sides understand the language of the other side.

221
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Right. Once you can talk to about the teachers using their language, and they can talk to you.

222
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Use your language. that'll be the best so this whole course is teaching you how to, you know, understand about the Google language the thinking right.

223
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,000
That's a loss of behind by system analysis do that that number one.

224
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You know the important thing, the technical details is good to know but it's not that important compared with the number.

225
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
One thing I hope that i'll make it clear here let's do.

226
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I'm gonna go over there. so the first part is about normal distribution, because that's the foundation of many things we do, and also central limit theorem.

227
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
So i'm going to talk about Why, do We use sample mean you believe the data is not normal.

228
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Okay, that's based on the central limit deal So yesterday we we learned this right. the cycle.

229
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:41,000
We design a study, draw a sample, cut the data, explore the data, build the model and the build the model, and, you know, analyze the data and finally make new inference about the population.

230
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So we have done this. We have done this. Now we move on to this right, this part of a little tricky, because depend on different kind of data.

231
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:56,000
We have different kind of model and different kind of hit points that's when things called go, you know, in e in the details right?

232
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
So that will also be. You know what we are gonna focus on for the rest of the course. number.

233
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:08,000
One thing is that we want to study, you know. why the same whole sample, one variable and one distribution.

234
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And just look at the mean. So the simply text, So what kind of calls through the cycle.

235
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So we will talk about yesterday. Is that the song always song? Although very important while in office it's not of the the the primary interest the private interest is to use the phonehole to say something about the population.

236
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:38,000
We did not see right, and that all of this is possible because we use a probability and a suitable model to model the data. right?

237
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
So how can we really say things we don't see that's because we use map no period.

238
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So we're gonna talk about how probably exactly pulling that so the particular model we're gonna use this probability model.

239
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So in real statistical department, right probability on the statistic.

240
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
There are separate courses, the problem even probably itself, as a as many courses right.

241
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:09,000
But apparently I do not have time to go over those but i'm going to talk about the basics. so I understand what we are up to.

242
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:17,000
So the probability model is a mathematical model, where, based on some assumptions based on some parameters right, the model can help you.

243
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I mean you can use the model to calculate the chat.

244
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Something happened. I I think the most basic example is that, you know, if you have a fair point, I have flipped the coin.

245
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Then you all know that you have 50% chance getting a hat versus a tail.

246
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,000
That's the simplest probability model. but based on that we can have more complicated models, Right?

247
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
What if the coin is not fair? What if you throw the point like 3 times? How many times you've got one?

248
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Have 2 tails right? All those things can be calculated based on that medical and probability models. right?

249
00:38:50,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I'm not going to go over the formula to compute them. I'll i'll introduce them as I need. but you understand whether i'm up to i'm trying to build calculation based on this kind of

250
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
model. A problem with the model can help us answer many, many questions.

251
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Right, for example, what proportion of a it's gimmick stroke patients leaving hospital within 10 days of the stroke.

252
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Right. So this this look like, hey? You know, real world problem.

253
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
But this is not that much different from flipping a coin. right?

254
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Essentially you think about right every patient when they call me in the hospital, they have a chance of living a hospital either within 10 days or after 10 days.

255
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:38,000
That's like a flipping on i'm bearpoint. We don't know the proportion. we want to estimate it, but the proposal exists in the population right so unknown.

256
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Private on the asking me, because that's just like if I give you a point that is not fair.

257
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:51,000
You can throw it many times. I want you to tell me you know what's the probability you gotta have the same question here.

258
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And the second thing, what proportion are you for pregnant women give birth to baby weighing less than plus 5 500?

259
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Grand is exactly the same, you know a mathematical point of view.

260
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:11,000
This 2 questions are the same, of course in reality that's all the different right, but they both are trying to estimate the probability of something happen.

261
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Where is it not happening? And finally, the same thing? What proportion of children living in poverty, developed with carried by age?

262
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
6, you know, from a mathematical point of view.

263
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,000
All of them are same type of questions. So that's why we can use the same type of map for answer them.

264
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Apparently each time different data and definitely presentation. right? So you have to separate, depending on study design.

265
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Some of time. You have a, you know, randomized control trial.

266
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Sometimes you have a observational data, sometimes you have pay for control, sometimes your cohort study right for regards to study design.

267
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You always have data, and you always analyze the data. use some mathematical tool.

268
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
If the data is sort of a similarity format, and the question is similarly in this.

269
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,000
You know format, then the mathematical tool may be at the same.

270
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I use the same mathematical tool, analyze different.

271
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Then you got different answer, and then the answer you know the way you interpret.

272
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
The conclusion will also be different, depending on your study.

273
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Design. right? So different staff in the in the study will, will have an impact on different parts of your of your analysis have to be aware of that.

274
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:29,000
So let's now start introduce some you know no pay for to do an calculation and the inference some of them we already talk about earlier, Right?

275
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So things we compute. from our data are to statistics What's the statistics are things we can compute, and also they are random in nature.

276
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
But in reality we observe one right. So X bar remember the sample.

277
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Mean and assax is a sample standard deviation there's also something called Sx Bar. Right?

278
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
That's a sample that's a standard arrow I mean which is not written here.

279
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Okay. So we also talk about their parameter parameters.

280
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Are things about the population capitolization of the population which we are of interest in studying, but we never observed.

281
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So last time we talk about this, right? so private are the things of interest.

282
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
There are they are there, but we don't know that's the peak are things actually not of the interest.

283
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,000
But we, we, we actually observe them a calculator. We use statistics to make inference on parameter.

284
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,000
So because they are separate, although they are very much related. use different notation for parameter.

285
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Usually we use a Greek ladders for craft parameter, not always, but usually right.

286
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
For example, Mu. we use meal to start a population mean it's just a convention.

287
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
There's no other reason about it. and We use a Sigma to stand for public and standardization.

288
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
The idea is that Mu and the Sigma are the things we want to know.

289
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Especially new mu is usually the thing we want to know Oh, Oh, we don't know.

290
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:00,000
We never observed them, and x bar and sx are the thing we observe, but it's not of interest right.

291
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
So we use this 2 quantity to estimate these 2 quantities.

292
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So in principle, if you're samples at large this 2 should may make this 2.

293
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:19,000
So the whole problem we will allow us to quantify the difference between these 2, although the difference is also random, or we can qualify the distribution of the difference.

294
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Okay, So that's the hope framework so I hope you can understand what I'm saying, and also get used to the to the notation, because we don't want to keep writing public I mean properly for me right we're

295
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
gonna use a new from now on

296
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:46,000
So. if you have questions, please let me know otherwise I'll just move forward always feel free to to having the chat or unmute yourself, or raise your head, you know.

297
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,000
My Gsi is you know, monitoring, so she will let me know.

298
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:08,000
And so in reality we cannot simply know the problem. You want to save me. When I think about something out there we never observe.

299
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
We can assume they are some viable if we never know for sure.

300
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:21,000
They are sometimes. Furthermore, me on the Sigma are some sort of a summary of the population.

301
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:32,000
How about it for mean probability and standard deviation they're just 2 number, but the real population is so. it has some distribution which we actually never observe fully right. and Q.

302
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
You really investigate every single subgroup in your population which is most likely impossible.

303
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:44,000
You don't really know the distribution of the population fully. so we summarize the public in the 2 number me one Sigma.

304
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,000
In this case they cannot possibly fully categorize the population.

305
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:57,000
For example, there may be many population with different distribution, yet they have the same mu and the same signal.

306
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:11,000
For example, this population is sort of a normally distributed right it's a age of a population. Then they have a mule, which is the center sigma, which is the the you know sort of the with just on the shoulder

307
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:18,000
so Sigma is about a distance Here you know it's hard to draw by some other distance on the shoulder of the distribution.

308
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:27,000
However, there could be another population which is narrower you'd have the same mean and the same meal, or another one which is actually skewed.

309
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
But you may also have the same you on the same right. in principle.

310
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
You there are into the number of shapes, have the same meal with the same sigma.

311
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
So think about that, right whenever we summarize something equal numbers we lose information.

312
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,000
But that's the price we pay because we want to simplify our study.

313
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Okay, So how do we know which exact shape is plausible for the population?

314
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Right. We never do, because we don't really observe the full population.

315
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
So that's why we put some a function so simplification always come with the songs.

316
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Keep that in mind Right? So here for simplicity. we assume the population is normally they should do it.

317
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I'll talk about normal, but this is something that i'm making here.

318
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
You might be wondering what if the assumption is not?

319
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Who? what's the price we pay I will talk about later on actually, but not a lot.

320
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Okay, this is Assumption has a very, very good mathematical poverty that you know.

321
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Give us some some confidence in using it i'll talk about later.

322
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,000
So now we use a probability model to model the population that's now, assume, yeah, just just bear with me.

323
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
We assume the population has a source of distribution called the normal distribution.

324
00:46:44,000 --> 00:47:00,000
He has many names, also called the Gaussian distribution, because Gauss, you know, discovered it, and it has this bell shaped right, as we have always seen, this file shaped the distribution, and also it's symmetric

325
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:08,000
remember it's symmetric therefore mean equals Median that's why the mu stands both for the mean and the meeting of the distribution.

326
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And, what's more important, the 2 parameters. are you and a Sigma completely describe the entire shape.

327
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
So this is a This is a shape which is parametrized by 2 parameters.

328
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It's just like a you know, a square is parameterized by one number, which is the length of the of 1 5 right.

329
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Our rectangle parametrized by tool number high and with right, and the triangle is probably privateified by 3 numbers.

330
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Right, the lead and the 3 sides. So this particular shape is parameterized by tool number.

331
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:54,000
The center and the work, once you know the standard, Well, this shape is competitive, determined.

332
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Okay, there's a formula for it i'm not going to show because it's serve no partners.

333
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:08,000
It's pretty complicated formula but just just you know bear with me this shape is completely determined, just like a rectangle is completely determined by the left with and height.

334
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
This shape is completely determined by the center and the and the the

335
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:27,000
The web, not the shape also the location. so let's see what this 2 parameter does right So first of all all the normal that you're with the same set.

336
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
We'll have the same scale or spread essentially they have the same shape.

337
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Okay, So this is the normal distribution with, say, my equals 7.

338
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:46,000
By the way, a certain meal, because 20. but this is not a normal with the same Sigma 7, but some mu is 24.

339
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
So you see, this 2 normal has the same shape but they have different location.

340
00:48:48,000 --> 00:49:00,000
It's shifting right, so keeping sigma fixed while changing new will simply shift the location of the normal distribution.

341
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So Mu stands for the location. that's a location parameter with the center, and this is you know same thing about me as well. No, that's that's back number one right sigma the formula shape Well, the scale

342
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:29,000
or the spread right fact. Number 2. Once you fix the thing once you fix meal right, you fix the location So meal stands for the location or the center.

343
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So this is the normal way, I mean with a certain Sigma.

344
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
But this is normal with Mux Funny with that smaller Sigma.

345
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
And this is the normal with a mule. Funny with the largest thing mine.

346
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Talk about this one here, right? so the meal determine where the center is but a sigma determining the shape right.

347
00:49:47,000 --> 00:50:07,000
How thin or how fat the bell shape correct? Yes. So with this 2 prominent are we fully determined where and how? As you know, the the the distribution is so normally should be raised by our shape, by the not all file, shaped distributed on

348
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:13,000
normal later on. we will i'll show you another side of this you're gonna call a p distribution is also balancing.

349
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:20,000
But it's not normal. so there is a number of different Fileship distribution. They look at normal, but they're not normal.

350
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Normally it's a specific balancing distribution any questions so far

351
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Okay, Now, let's move on because normal is is a specific bell check distribution.

352
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:50,000
It has many nice properties. Number one property is that, you know.

353
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I I like to use the pen. Okay, not right now.

354
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Maybe later, so mule is the center. A sigma is the wood on the shoulder.

355
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:09,000
For double this normal has a mute 20. therefore the center is funny as a single sport.

356
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
If you look at here right from 16 to 20, this is 4.

357
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:19,000
So the Sigma pretty much measure the the width on one side, on the shoulder.

358
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Right. Where is the shoulder? It seems like a very informal, but the shoulder is where you know.

359
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:34,000
You see this curve right it's it's actually stretch is extensively invented in just 2 things to see the curve first bend off right.

360
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It's been awkward and after some point it's not a band download right, so there's 1 point is switch from bending our couponing down and that's where the shoulder is it's hard

361
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:53,000
to see by somewhere here, and from the shoulder to the to the center. That's the signal.

362
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Okay, this is the normal with me is plenty, and Sigma equals 4.

363
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:09,000
And what this fact 3 says that if you look at the area right within mu plus minus sigma, right?

364
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
This is mu minus sigma, this mu plus sigma, which in this case is 16 to 24.

365
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:27,000
The area in this region. it's 68% of the total area under the per

366
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
So, no matter how you know how fat normal is, so you can change Sigma and change a mu.

367
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,000
But this property never. That might change this area is always 68%, you know.

368
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:45,000
To be exact, it's like you know could be 6 7 point something like if the source of a number of precision after the decimal.

369
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
But let's just say, Rule of thomas 68 is a close approximate.

370
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:57,000
So this part is 6 8. Now, my question is what this this part?

371
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Oh, what percent of area in this part? Anyone on the tell me

372
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Is it 32 it's close but it's, not 32 I'm.

373
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Talking about specifically the left hand side divided by 2 because it's on both the side.

374
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:28,000
So 16. Yeah, that's right so this is 68 so both sides is the yellow part is 32.

375
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Then each side is the 16 a simple algebra but you know.

376
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Eventually it'll become very helpful alright and then let's now move on right.

377
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,000
So the same principle actually applies what you might ask why do you only do vo plus minus sigma?

378
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:52,000
No, we don't have we can do meal partners. hardly. for example, we can do mu plus minus 2 sigma.

379
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
So this is 20 minus 8, 20, plus 8, from 12 to 28.

380
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
This area is 95%. Actually, this is a fact use more than the previous fact.

381
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:07,000
The 68% is rarely used, but this one is so often in youth.

382
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Okay, So this area is 95%. So the same calculation will tell you.

383
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Each tail is 2 point, 5%. That is a 2 point.

384
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
5% is a 2 point, 5%,

385
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Okay, This is the most widely used for pack, and the other one is also more more often use.

386
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Is the this one. So if you do 3 sigma instead 2 sigma.

387
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Now you can see we almost cover the whole thing it is In fact, this thing cover is like 99.7%.

388
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:50,000
So that's the nearly 100% but not quite right because the normal distribution is very hard to talk is actually extensively infinity.

389
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:58,000
So there's a very tiny payout there very tiny but the middle part muse, plus minus 3 sigma is this, you know, nearly 100%.

390
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:07,000
It's over 99.5%. Okay, So this 5 is also quite often used.

391
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:13,000
So how do we use them? right? We can use them this way, For example.

392
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
So, Paul, I. Everything now is a based on assumption because math will not work.

393
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:25,000
If we don't make assumptions so suppose human height is normally distributed, let's just say say mail.

394
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Okay, suppose the high, the mail is normally distributed.

395
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
And suppose we know the Mu and the Sigma of that distribution?

396
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Suppose, for example, mean is that this I don't know 6, 6 feet, and the standard deviation is say let's say 4 inch.

397
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Then you can copy it. You know most of the population live within 5 to 7 feet of the male population, right? because that's meal cost minus 3 signal.

398
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
If this is 6 feet, then this is 5 feet. This is 7. P.

399
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Because the Sigma is 4 inch right, So 99% of male have a higher between 5 to 7.

400
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Of course the number I just made off of i'm just telling you how to met with the calculation right There still will be people, you know, about 7 people.

401
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
There'll be a low 5 feet but altogether They are left on, you know, point.

402
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:30,000
3% of the whole population. So it's you should be you know, I'd like to see them in a small sample.

403
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Okay, So that's how we use this kind of calculation to help us do some back of the envelope calculation to to ask me the probability.

404
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Find any question here

405
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Alright. So as a summary right. this our rule of form in statistics, right?

406
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
So keep on the normal distribution. 68% or you could say 2 third.

407
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
It's about 2 thirds, right 2 third the value will be within one standard deviation.

408
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,000
95% will be within 2 standard deviation, nearly everybody.

409
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Not not not quite, but merely everybody will be within 3 standard deviation.

410
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
So you can't say everything beyond 3 standard deviation you could call them all I as well.

411
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:22,000
What's the level right? because they are rare they do occur But they are right. Let's do the calculation here.

412
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:28,000
So suppose we are studying the population of children living in poverty.

413
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,000
We are starting the age of their first develop tooth carry.

414
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Suppose that distribution of the age is a normal distributed with a mean of 3 years, with a standard deviation one year.

415
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Okay, all of these are assumption. You just have to assume now so far to do the calculation operas.

416
00:57:48,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Now the question is, would it be more likely to observe a child who first developed, carried at age 8, or a child will firstly volunteer in page 4, and the Y.

417
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I want to give up minutes like I think about it that I want to take a volunteer to answer this question.

418
00:58:51,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Okay, are there any volunteer I can try I think it would be a child who first developed carriers at H*, cause that's within 2 standard deviation.

419
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:17,000
So you have 95% chance that yeah you'll find a child good about carries at that age.

420
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Okay, thank you. Yeah, I mean it's it's definitely actually, it's actually only one standard deviation right?

421
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Cause meal plus sigma is 4, right? but this one is actually 5 standard division way, super unlikely to work.

422
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:38,000
0. Okay, give an assumption. I I think I can you know for those of you.

423
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:46,000
We're not familiar with this yet. i'll i'll draw it right. So always draw a bellship curve right.

424
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,000
The center is mu, because 3 the with the Sigma equals one.

425
00:59:51,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Therefore, boys here but 8 is here right apparently as much more likely to see some some data point at age 4 rather than a h 8, right?

426
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Because there's a one. sigma away this is the fourth thing on the way. I don't think you can see My, you can see my mouse right?

427
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:16,000
So this is one signal away which is likely 4 sigma weight is very unlikely, of course, that's based on assumption.

428
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:24,000
All this shape and automatically any question and thanks for the one i'm hearing.

429
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Okay.

430
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
We have 3 more slides, and then that's the perfect time for for a break.

431
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Now we are not done yet, so normal distribution has so many property.

432
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,000
We'll go over them right you don't have to remember them, because the important one will come back to visit anyway.

433
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Just on the you know what i'm talking about So now we are assuming the population is normal.

434
01:00:50,000 --> 01:01:02,000
If the population is normal, then the sample it's also normal. and not only the sample is normal, you know the normal distribution has so many nice property.

435
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
If the sound was normal, the sample mean is also normal.

436
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
These are 2 different things, because the sample mean is something you compute from the sample.

437
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:19,000
It turns out that the sample is also normal. Okay, and they have many nice problems.

438
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Okay, so is the population is normal. Then the sample mean will be a good estimate for the mule.

439
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:36,000
I could ask you, I mean this 2 number will be closed, and this this number will be unbiased.

440
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,000
It does not equal me. so. so let me take back a little bit.

441
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Here, Right X bar is something you compute from your sample, which is the number you see.

442
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Place Random, because every time you do it the change meal is something you assume for the population, which is number.

443
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Now run them. it's a fixed number but you don't See right This one.

444
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
This is fixed, but you don't see this one you see but it's not it.

445
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,000
So now you want to use this to ask me that I can tell you I can actually prove it.

446
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:15,000
But I don't have time to do it here. now. this one is a good athlete in the sense that first of all is unbiased which means it can go up or down around mule.

447
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:22,000
There's No, there's no tendency for it to go webinars on the other is unbiased.

448
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Second one is is is good in the sense. You know. the distance between X Bar and the mu is small, right, but that distance depend on assembled as a many other thing.

449
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Actually, this number is the bad, happy night You can use a number, for example.

450
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Remember you. If you ask me. this is natural, right? I mean how you say this is good.

451
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
But you know, I just don't have any other way of having actually you do.

452
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:53,000
For example, once you have a sample, not only a computer sample mean, you can also computer sample media.

453
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,000
You can also compute the sample, for example, the sample mode of all of those things right?

454
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
You have to give them anything from the sample actually turn out.

455
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,000
All of them can estimate me, and they have different poverty.

456
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Some of them buy a some of humbiot, some some are called so.

457
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
This one turn off in some way is the not only a good, but the best.

458
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I think so. If the population is really normal, this one is the best application in a sense, if it's a closer to me on average. alright, then similarly, Sx is a good estimate for Sigma which means It's

459
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:41,000
not by it's unbiased and also it has a small small variability, you know, technically speaking, as acts is still a little bit biased, but sx square. the sample variance is unbiased.

460
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:49,000
For sigma square that's why you know that's why? I remember when we compute as acts there's a one over n minus one in the formula people put in there?

461
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Because the only unbiased. when is divided by n minus one, it will be biased and divided by all.

462
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Those are technical, you know. mathematical detail. I want to. I don't want to go deep, there, but you know everything.

463
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Come from a you know, at medical foundation, so essentially this 2 statistic we can compute from the data are good estimates for the parameter.

464
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:22,000
We don't observe in the population and that's based on the normal assumption that's why we used the function. Because with that assumption, mathematics can I guarantee managonize properties Okay, so both

465
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:30,000
of this assume your phone is generalizable and representative right? So what I'm saying is that if your population is really normal.

466
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:40,000
If your son hope is, say, or simple random sample which means it's unbiased and representative, then this probably can be guaranteed mathematically.

467
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:49,000
If this assumption i'll violate it you'll have problems, sometimes bigger problems, sometimes smaller problems.

468
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Bye, the representatives and the generalizable is a strong assumption.

469
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:59,000
This is, if these are valid, you have bigger problems. If these are valid, violated your sample.

470
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,000
If your sample is biased, then both of this will be biased by the normal assumption.

471
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Is actually not that important? That was part of the data even if that is i'll violate it.

472
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:25,000
We are still good. most of the time as long as the sample size is not too small, so that's why, personally, you know. generally speaking, i'm not too worried about a little skeweness of the population, even if the population, is

473
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:31,000
not fully symmetric is fine. Okay, because the normal assumption is actually not that crucial, although it's good.

474
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:42,000
It's useful for us to to start learning this but later on we'll show It's not that crucial, but it's the sampling is actually more more important so that's why i'm saying have a

475
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
unbiased sample is the most important thing in the first time.

476
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:52,000
If that is violated, anything you do afterwards cannot really save you.

477
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
How good it is I talk to talk about it. Is there a good asked me.

478
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Actually, this one is the best estimate, anyway. how good is it depending on how far away this, as far as from new, it turns out that not depend on the Sam honey vulnerability of X.

479
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Bar. I'm not even an ensemble line right larger assemble size, to use more accurate happiness.

480
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Now everything go into more, you know, mathematically more rigorous way of stating it right.

481
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,000
So sample size reduce something variability make x bar or more accurate.

482
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:39,000
That's made from you any question

483
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Okay, I think we're time for a break and there you know there are 2 slides left, but I want to spend enough time on them.

484
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:50,000
So let's take a break for 10. minutes. and Come back Continue with lecture at 9 40.

485
01:06:50,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Thank you.

486
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Okay, that's continue. So we first finished this half of the lecture.

487
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Then we look at some video, and then to part of the project.

488
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,000
And then we continue with the second half the lecture. No, otherwise the either path.

489
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,000
I used to lecture both first and i'll pick too long kind of boring.

490
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:36,000
So okay, that's all the property of the normal right before we move on.

491
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I mean during our exercise we'll come back to this priorities because they they, you know, become useful.

492
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Now let's talk about I am important theorem well, which is underlying all we do here.

493
01:18:52,000 --> 01:19:06,000
So this gave us the theoretical foundation. Why, we could have done this without warning, you know assumption right? cause every time you make assumption about something you don't see like a population is normal. you worry about What if the sound is wrong.

494
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
First of all, I cannot even check it because I don't see the whole population.

495
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Second, that is, that if the something is wrong, then is everything I do based on assumption wrong.

496
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:21,000
So this central limit theorem gave us half of this in saying that the assumption is not that crucial.

497
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Even if it's wrong, we're still good essentially so remember if we have a population which is normal with some new and some signal, and then we know previous fact.

498
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:50,000
5 right, The x bar the sample mean. We all have a sample in distribution which only exist.

499
01:19:50,000 --> 01:20:01,000
If you draw many, many sample when you reality, you don't. But you know there is a sound distribution of the sample mean, it turns out that if the population is really normal, then the sampling distribution of X bar is also

500
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:08,000
normal with the same meal. By the way, the smaller standard deviation right?

501
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:13,000
The original population has a normal with Mu and a sigma.

502
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:17,000
So the sample mean exp bar as a normal with me.

503
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Mu. and the sigma over squared event that's where I come from.

504
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Okay, So these are the fact of the normal distribution. How we use this fact to make inference about the population.

505
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Mean that's exactly why I would make the inference about the population mean not a population meeting, because the population meeting is much harder to do with what the population mean can easily do. the Now we go West.

506
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Have you on? What if our assumption is wrong? What if the population is not normal, which most likely will be the pace right? Because nothing is perfectly normal?

507
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:57,000
There will always be some skewers of any of the solution.

508
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:04,000
So if the something is wrong, the public is not normal. Can we still do anything we do here?

509
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:10,000
It turns out that we still can so there's a fact 6 which is young.

510
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Anything you will meet or man most people can imagine which is based on this central limit.

511
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Theorem, which is the most important theorem, is statistical in probability.

512
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Here same time, even if the population distribution is not normally can't have any distribution, pretty much any you mean.

513
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,000
In that case you can still have a meal have a sigma define right?

514
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:43,000
You can still compute that mean and standard deviation. are you guys still get a sample and compute expon.

515
01:21:43,000 --> 01:22:00,000
That's bar will still have a fundamental distribution It turns out that in that case the sum of the distributed X bar, we'll still look approximately a normal with the same mean with us not a Db.

516
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:10,000
In a signal over as well. Okay, that's so called central limit theorem, which is the foundation of the inference.

517
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:15,000
We will use here. this approximated actually can be qualified.

518
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:28,000
So essentially, when the sample size increase, the proclamation become better and better when the sample size is large enough, not so hard, say for 10 typical distribution with the sample size is larger than 20. You already see, a difference between this

519
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:38,000
approximate normal versus a real normal. So the convergence to normal distribution of the sample mean is fairly quick.

520
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:48,000
So basically, when the sample that's worked on point we don't really care whether the original population is normal or not, we can still make an inference as long as me.

521
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:54,000
So the problem is not about a new for itself. The inference on the population mean will be accurate.

522
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,000
I mean fairly hybrid. I find the sample size is not too small.

523
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:09,000
The problem happening in the interpretation right? If the population is is highly skilled, you can steal your central limit theorem to make inference out of me on infrastructure.

524
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Me will not be very meaningful, so you lose interpretation when the population is highly skilled.

525
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:21,000
You don't really lose the math the math is still guarantees you to inferences bye bye.

526
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Oh, bear with me here I I think it's very important to distinguish. So, for example, let's make an example.

527
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Suppose we study block pressure, I will soon blow up pleasure, follow normal in the population.

528
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Suppose we have a particular drug which can reduce blood pressure by 10 right on average.

529
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Now we can compare. You know the the drop. Why, we can compare before and after use the drop right.

530
01:23:48,000 --> 01:24:05,000
We can use this to make inference on the mean of the population, which totally works rabbit, because we know the drop measure pretty much follow normal distribution, even though you may not follow exactly by roughly so. the average block pressure in the public domain is biologically.

531
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Meaningful concept, so that's what we're doing in in public health in biology all the time.

532
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:21,000
However, if we study some other trace, for example, we study like average income.

533
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:32,000
If we say there's a particular policy, well increase the average income of household in a particular state, say by $10,000 a year, and then we can do the same analysis, right?

534
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,000
The data, you know Mathematically, these are the same problem.

535
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:43,000
We can do the same analysis, we can make conclusions, saying, Yeah, it indeed does.

536
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:50,000
But given, you know, income, tend to have follow highly skilled distribution because some people aren't allowed money right. Some people are.

537
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Most people don't learn that much so the question is There are 2 questions.

538
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:03,000
First question is that is, that is that inference, right? That conclusion is still valid.

539
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Given the population. The future is now normal. Second question is that you might if it's valid, is is is that still meaningful.

540
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:27,000
So these are 2 separate questions. So the answer is that yes, it's still valid, because, even though the population is now normal, based on central in the funeral, I want you friends about the population mean the average income is the population need right it's still valid

541
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:37,000
mathematically, How about him may not be meaningful because if you think about it? The policy could make the rich richer.

542
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:51,000
If there's a policy, make the rich twice as richer. and then make the poor poor right on average, the whole average income could still increase. But it doesn't mean most people will become richer.

543
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Actually it could be. Most people become poorer, but average still become racial because they reach ourselves right.

544
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,000
If you make a 1 billion there twice as rich, then you can see the average.

545
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:08,000
I could go well. but most people still go down so basically for those kind of high school distribution, the me and the media may say a different thing.

546
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
You'll make inference on a meeting it's not representative to the question you had to address.

547
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Do you really make most people richer? Actually, it may not be the case.

548
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:25,000
If you make the average block pressure drop, then it's more likely everybody you know, most people have a black black price and lower.

549
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:31,000
But if you make the average income higher, you may not be the pay for everything you know.

550
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Most people have become higher, it could just be a small portion on the higher end.

551
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:41,000
So the difference line in the interpretation. now line the math, I hope that's clear.

552
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:46,000
But if you have a question, please let me know now on this line.

553
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:51,000
And Dr. Jean, I have a question so in the with the central limit theorem.

554
01:26:51,000 --> 01:27:00,000
We're just assuming that the sample distribution of the mid you're assuming the fact 6 right how do we?

555
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:10,000
How do we know like this? is the central name of theorem is powerful because it doesn't require a function.

556
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I mean oursama function. but It doesn't assume.

557
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,000
The distribution is normal that's why it's powerful. so the signs are even, it holds regardless.

558
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:22,000
The population is normal or not, it could be highly skewed it's due host.

559
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Okay, So So this like the fact. 6 so this has like mathematical proof and Oh, oh, okay, okay, Okay, You know, of course, I'm not going to show the probe But it's done like a 100 years

560
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,000
ago by mathematicians right? so I I will show some simulation to give.

561
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:53,000
I mean this seems like a counterintuitive bye i'm not going to prove it. i'll i'll give you a simulation afterwards to show you actually it is the case the population that you're doing kind of

562
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:57,000
look like anything. but the sample means it still looks like normal.

563
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:01,000
So this normal diffusion is not a i'll be treated Bellship.

564
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:12,000
It is a very, very mathematically unique, Okay, that's also the reason why, you know many biological trades actually look like normal, you know.

565
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,000
That's another reason there, because, for example, our human height humor.

566
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Height is determined by, you know, hundreds, if not thousands, of genetic and environmental factors. right?

567
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Each one of them is small, but because there are so many factors, right?

568
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:31,000
So the height you can think about as an average of all those factors because it's the average of many things.

569
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:36,000
It turned out to be normal. So if something is average or many other things, it turned out to be normal.

570
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:43,000
That's actually exactly the same central name we're backing at all, So it's actually playing a role in in nature.

571
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Thanks for the President and any other questions

572
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Okay. So So basically concluding this right? if your sample size is not too small, say larger than money, and if you'll population, that's not too extremely skew like you know the the the income that we are confident of making

573
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:23,000
inference about the population mean based on the central limit theorem and that's most of the case where we study say biological trades and things like those, because they're not extremely skilled.

574
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Some some degree of students is probably fine, because nothing is perfectly normal, anyway, right?

575
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:46,000
But when you'll have a sample, sound really small like 3 or 5, or no more than 10 now, you cannot count on central limit 0 in those cases, as I will, say, you still do what you can But statistics actually play a little rope, here, because if you only

576
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
have 3 numbers, No matter what you do, you only have 3 numbers.

577
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:54,000
You just do it. not have enough information. right? So small sample study are fundamentally flawed.

578
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:59,000
You can still do many things, for statistic cannot rescue you from small sample.

579
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Right. So whatever you learn from small sample study are sort of a limited in nature.

580
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:10,000
You can pick them as a pilot study, give you some insight, but eventually you need a larger skill.

581
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Study to confirm what you learn in small sample study.

582
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Alright, so final slide. I already talk about all of this. right?

583
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:26,000
So where where does this come from? Right? The central means central means, you know, as a limit, you know.

584
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Sample size goes larger and larger. right. The assignment will converge to the to the population.

585
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Meet that's called the central right let me limit means the sample time.

586
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:41,000
If the sample size becomes bigger, right things will convert right.

587
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:55,000
So based on central limit, theorem we can make this One inference using sample mean without knowing the population distribution. As long as it is not extremely skilled right when it is extremely skilled, it's not central limit theorem

588
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:04,000
fail like I mentioned earlier. central limit here send your limit term still works it's the interpretation black it's black blacks is practical, meaning right?

589
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:11,000
You change the population mean. So what when I publish I mean increased, publish a meeting could actually decrease right?

590
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:20,000
So it's an invitation actually a process. okay, the mass still works for the invitation.

591
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Right now. Okay, that's all for the lecture right again.

592
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,000
If you have a question, let me know, and otherwise I will move on to.

593
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:44,000
You know some video, some simulation and some packers on That's a that's a question could you maybe go back to the previous flight? Maybe it's a stupid?

594
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Question, but i'm a little bit, confused Why, they use like the same mathematical signs for the sampling distribution, mean and standard deviation.

595
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:02,000
This same as the the the population parameter that's a little bit confusing to me to be honest.

596
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:07,000
But what's the you mean the same mule here?

597
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Yeah, because we used it before for population parameters.

598
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Right yeah, you're right you're right so It's not like we use the same parameter.

599
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:24,000
This because mathematically, this too normal they're too normal one is the population, you know.

600
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Why is the population? distribution has a meal? Why is this family did you do?

601
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Really has a new. It turned on that manager this 2 meal are always the same.

602
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
It's not like which host the same meal we turned on mathematically.

603
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:41,000
They are always the same number, but the Sigma are not the same right.

604
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:46,000
The the sum of the distribution of the sample mean always has a smaller sigma.

605
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:52,000
That's why, you know it's actually sigma over square root of that.

606
01:32:52,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Okay, : Yeah, definitely, Thank you. welcome any other question.

607
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Okay, I can. I can. You know I can live the slides here.

608
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:15,000
When you have question we can come back now, let's watch some interesting videos here.

609
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,000
You know the second part is about comedy, you know.

610
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:24,000
I I want to save that for later today or on Monday, So let's now.

611
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Do you know things we could do about central limit Theorem: Okay.

612
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,000
So there is a video. You could actually watch it that yourself.

613
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:38,000
But you know we could watch it together here

614
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:55,000
I'm not sure why the my audio will transfer to your place?

615
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:00,000
So let me know if it doesn't work for you in that case you could just, you know, mute me and watch it yourself.

616
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:12,000
The link is there otherwise let's watch it together

617
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Somewhere in the field the brave ecologist is studying wild rats.

618
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:30,000
He plans to recall the weights of every single ram he he follows this plan. You will notice that most of the rabbits are close to the average, and that there are some rabbits, but not many that are

619
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:37,000
much larger or much smaller than the average. The further from the average you get the fewer animals that are.

620
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:42,000
This particular bell-shaped card is called a normal distribution.

621
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Sadly. He has to give up his experiment, but it will cost him a fortune and carrots to complete it.

622
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:59,000
So he changes the platform. Instead of measuring every rabbit in the whole group, he decides to measure rabbits in small groups, chosen at random from the whole group.

623
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:11,000
He knows that each small group won't necessarily be perfectly representative of the whole group, so he measures many small groups, and then compares the averages of each.

624
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:17,000
He starts by weighing 5 rabbits at the time, and he finds that the distribution of the average is someone bell-shaped.

625
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Then he increases the sample size by weighing 20 rabbits at a time, and then 100 rabbits at the time.

626
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Surprisingly. as the sample size increases, the spread decreases.

627
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:33,000
The distributions of average weights becomes more and more normal.

628
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:39,000
What our great ecologist has just demonstrated is the central limit theorem.

629
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:43,000
The averages of samples have approximately normal distributions.

630
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:52,000
If the sample size increases, this distribution of averages becomes more normal and narrow.

631
01:35:52,000 --> 01:36:01,000
What is the population? Distribution is not possible. To begin with. For example, the distribution of dragon wingspan is known to be by modal.

632
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:16,000
If an even brave ecologists were to study wild dragons and measure dragon wings fans, the distribution of the average wingspan would still be a approximately normal, and again, the more dragons are ready to

633
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:23,000
colleges could measure at a time. the closer the distribution of their average wingspans will be to a truly normal distribution.

634
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:38,000
The distribution will also be narrow on. So now we know that, regardless of a true distribution, the central limit, theorem shows that the average of values drawn from the distribution will always be approximately normal above the month the bigger the

635
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:48,000
sample size, the narrow the distribution of average becomes, and the closer the mean of sample gets to the true mean of the population.

636
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:58,000
This is why sample size matches, so much in any statistical analysis, whether it is a political poll or evaluation of a medical procedure.

637
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:08,000
There is something very special about the normal distribution. Not only do many things we measure in biology follow a normal distribution, but it also crops up when we look at estimates and variables.

638
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Even when the variables themselves don't have a normal distribution as we saw with dragon wings.

639
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Because of this we can use the normal distribution to test ideas about the world, even when the underlying variables don't follow a normal distribution.

640
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:39,000
My name is This video was created by Shui Cho, and dropped to you by for more stories.

641
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Visit, preach, cast dot, org.

642
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Okay. Did the audio work well for you?

643
01:37:54,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Yeah, it works awesome, thank you Alright, the second one we'll wait until we talk about confidence interval. But now let's run a simulation of synonymic theorem for you to you know see a little

644
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:12,000
bit better. Right? So here is a single simulation. What we do is that this is the population distribution.

645
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,000
So it is some some other distribution called the Pay.

646
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,000
The distribution where they're a parameter alpha beta.

647
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:23,000
So when they both are one, it's sort of a uniform.

648
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I, when when you know why small wise are it's highly skewed.

649
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:35,000
So this is the population is highly skilled alright so let's first talk about the population.

650
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Distribution is sort of a unique model I like this I mean let's say this look like a normal.

651
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:46,000
But it's not normal. This is the beta and then we take us random sample of size.

652
01:38:46,000 --> 01:39:00,000
If you take some of the size one you're basic drawing sample right? and then you'll make one draw You're got the data point here. i'll do another draw i'll do another draw How do you do like a

653
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:07,000
50 draw. You essentially have a histogram from the population that will have similar distribution.

654
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:18,000
The fifth program is random, which means, if you do it again, you got a different hit program, and there will be a theoremical one, which means, if your sample size goes to infinity, right?

655
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:30,000
That Instagram will look like this if you increase your sample size. give you a sample that you will see the sampling distribution of the sample.

656
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Mean we'll have the same mean but it will be narrow and narrow, and the the with reduced by a speed of square root of the sample size.

657
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:43,000
If a sample size is like 15, it will be very narrow.

658
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Okay, and you can see each time we let's go back. Okay, say, we draw a sample of 15 data points.

659
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:58,000
So you've got 15 data points of capital one mute I do that again.

660
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:04,000
I do that again until you do it like 50 times Now, You've got a sampleing contribution to Sample.

661
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Mean i'm gonna turn out the sample if distribution assembly.

662
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,000
We will have the same mu of the original population, but a smaller standard deviation.

663
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:20,000
This, this Sigma will be this sigma divided by square root of that.

664
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:29,000
And this works well when when your population distribution is normal or what give you a publicity number is not normal, so you'll populations. Distribution is, you know.

665
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Let's make it easier. it's skilled like this when you're sampling way assembly size is one.

666
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:40,000
You see, the sample mean is just a sample right?

667
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,000
And assembly distributed. some on me look like the population.

668
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:51,000
5. you increase your also size, You see that it become more normal and normal when the sample size is 5 and more.

669
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:59,000
You don't really see any difference so I I can tell you this is not normal, but you can already visually see the difference between this and normal.

670
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,000
I'll show you all we have assembles at the 5 right?

671
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,000
We draw a phone number 5 from this copy of the Mute.

672
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:13,000
We do it many times. we do it 50 times

673
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:32,000
And another 50 times. we cannot, We cannot find any difference between this distribution of the normal, and that's the power of Oh, So the population is highly skilled, for the sampling.

674
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:38,000
The tiger is still normal. so I hope this simulation you know. let's assure you i'll give you confidence.

675
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:43,000
The Comp. and the standard limit. theorem is actually working magically, but not working.

676
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:51,000
So we can always use the sample mean and assemble standard deviation to make inference about the population meeting regards the distribution of the population.

677
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:58,000
So when the publish of high school the downside is in the invitation, it's not in the inference itself.

678
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Alright any comment on the question

679
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Okay.

680
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Is there a question

681
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Okay, Now let's take some time to do the project because I want to take a break.

682
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:54,000
So open. project 5, 8,

683
01:42:54,000 --> 01:43:03,000
So 5 A is about the data in the paper that's the the air pollution, and the precursor in Southern California.

684
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,000
So some of the questions are to do with what we learned yesterday.

685
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:14,000
So we found that, you know, review, which is what we learned earlier, especially this question some more to do with what we learned today.

686
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:25,000
There's one question We are not you know and and the second part is to do is the data set that is given on the website.

687
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:31,000
So there's 1 one question we are not capable of answering, I believe.

688
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Let's see here, right they ask you the computer 95 for some common interval.

689
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:55,000
So please keep this question, for now we'll we'll come back to it, you know, after our second part of the lecture you should be able to, you know, may maybe give this to because you know C depend on B right So

690
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:59,000
skip this, too, but you should be able to answer the rest.

691
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Okay, and you may not be able to finish everything but that's Okay, we can come back to it later.

692
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:08,000
If you don't finish and this won't be due until Tuesday morning. Right?

693
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
I just want to take a break for you guys to, you know.

694
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Take a break from lectures and do some exercise, so the first part require the you know.

695
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Let me see, require the manuscript. this one: Yeah.

696
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Air pollution required a table, you know, manuscript I believe is this table, and then, the second part require this data set.

697
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:47,000
I'm eps data set here so please take some time you know you don't have to finish the key is that, you know.

698
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Do some a group working, and again I will send you to 2 groups.

699
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:03,000
So. So please get right. Skip this too, because that way. part of the interval which we haven't talked about.

700
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:22,000
But you can do everything else. Any question

701
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:40,000
So what I will do is that I will give you 30 min on this? because it's a little long, and you know, after the 30 min it will be our second break time.

702
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:50,000
So I think. Take break after this, so you can continue working out If you don't want to take the break so i'll give you a breakout room for 30 min and then a 10 min break. Now we've got back.

703
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:56,000
To kind of review it, you know, at 1050.

704
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:05,000
So in 40 min or so, any question before I send you off

705
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Okay.

706
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Hello, welcome back as we as mentioned. already or let's take a 10 min break after the break.

707
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:49,000
We'll go over the product again, thank you

708
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Okay, let's continue so let's call where the the project 5, 8, and again, it's not due, and 2 Tuesday morning, because we see give some of the questions here.

709
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:47,000
So for the first question actually ask about this study design.

710
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:56,000
So They're they're you know 5 small questions there. i'm not sure.

711
02:26:56,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Yes, they are gonna go back for So Group 5, Would you mind answering this one?

712
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:10,000
8,

713
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:23,000
Yeah. The population of interest is all day pregnant women in sort of in California.

714
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:31,000
The sample size is 143,000 trying that women.

715
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:34,000
But the main population that they wanna do. The inference, too, is the old.

716
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:41,000
I guess all the population, every now population in Southern California.

717
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:47,000
Thank you. Yeah. So apparently the data was collected in the Southern California.

718
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:51,000
Right. I I guess you know I read a paper and I I didn't really.

719
02:27:51,000 --> 02:28:02,000
That they they ever mentioned their population. Interest so you will be I mean they talk about. they want to study the relationship between air pollution and the pre from birth. Right?

720
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:07,000
So didn't really specify the only one to study association in Southern California.

721
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:13,000
So I I suspect, actually their population. The interest is at least, you know, the whole Us. population.

722
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:20,000
But nevertheless they only study the Southern California, so they they did a really specified Well, you're probably from interest to solve.

723
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:25,000
I mean the gas. I think you are Why, they're they're study, only apply to Southern California.

724
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Probably when you're generalized through the whole us no that's the question for right.

725
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:39,000
So there will be more or less on problem. yeah, I understand the number 2, right? So the main question of interest is, study.

726
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:43,000
The reason that you, an air pollutant and the proton bar.

727
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:50,000
So maybe a group 4 you can could You tell us you know there are 2 variable air polo, and the prism birth, which one is the exposure always for Allcom.

728
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:58,000
I think it's pretty clear how could you how off

729
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Exposure is the air. population, and outcome is P.

730
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Term birth. Yeah. Maybe you can also tell us because it's not asking Right?

731
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:15,000
What time study is. It is! What type of study is it?

732
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:26,000
Prospective reg perspective is a, you know, whole whole of case control have to follow all that

733
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:32,000
What's the perspective city right sorry I I didn't hear you produced.

734
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Repeat it's perspective it's not case control because there's no controls.

735
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:48,000
It's all cases, so it's a perspective study Okay, it's a cohort study per prospect poker study

736
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:54,000
So I didn't really pay attention so for those of you who just ride the paper.

737
02:29:54,000 --> 02:30:04,000
So they enrolled it, the the subjug, and they follow up in time to plot the outcome.

738
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Or they actually figure out the information backwards in time so I'm just asking Zip prospective or retrospective.

739
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:14,000
I thought it was retrospective just because they lived at birth.

740
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:19,000
Certificates of the birds that have already happened. I see.

741
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Yeah, it's not the case it's more or less like a retrospective co-host study. It's a typical but you know it's it's doable so really it doesn't this

742
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:39,000
this prospective and again this prospective and the retrospect here.

743
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:43,000
They don't really play a role in your data analysis you're analyzed the data same way.

744
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:53,000
They only play a role where you target right? as I mentioned retrospective are subject to more bias. because we trying to figure out data from the path.

745
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:57,000
There's a chance you might miss something right they are not recorded.

746
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Prospective is is better in the sense that you know.

747
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:06,000
You record data yourself as time goes right. so you have more control on the data collection than the retrospective.

748
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:15,000
But it doesn't have anything to do with your analysis the analysis is the same actually, even even call for study or or okay, controls.

749
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:19,000
Button sometimes do not play a role. You know data analysis.

750
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:23,000
You still are not analyzed. The data same way but the invitation will be different, as we'll talk about either.

751
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:34,000
How we talk about our case control stuff. So studies design most most often play a role in the interpretation of the result, not in the analysis itself.

752
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Okay, One c. maybe group 3. What are the variable?

753
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:44,000
That being collected

754
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Yeah, I can answer that. There were different variables related to the mother, to the children, the number, and also to the levels of pollutants.

755
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:12,000
For the mother was me. This session, related to the children low birth week. She tired of female gender pronouns all see blans, and

756
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:17,000
It also measures the quartial levels of different pollutants.

757
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:23,000
So those are the variables. Hmm: Thank you very much. Yeah. there there are many variable.

758
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:29,000
They are. Mac, I mean is, if you think about any study like this will be very costly than to to get the population.

759
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:35,000
So in that case they will, you know, collect as much as information as possible to see case that need them later on.

760
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:43,000
But the main, my name, exposure variable. Here are air pollutants, and for that they collect essentially, I think, 4 measurements. Right?

761
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:53,000
Yeah. and then the main i'll call is the pre-time birth. for that they collect the length of jet justration right?

762
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:58,000
They also collect other, you know, variable, like age, or other things of family status.

763
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:05,000
Those we call them a covariance, so usually we control them for confounding in the model which we'll talk about in, you know.

764
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:08,000
In a in a third week we would have about multiple regression, right?

765
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
So there are a different kind of variable, and they serve as different roles. Right?

766
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:22,000
So they both are the main main variable for explanation, and i'll i'll come on the main variable, you know, manager, the on the outcome, and the finally other variables are whole errors.

767
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:27,000
They use look as well. Thank you very much. So group 2.

768
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
Would you mind answering whether you think the result of this study can be generalized?

769
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:43,000
And why why not?

770
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:55,000
I can speak to that a little bit. I think what we discussed was that yes, it could put potentially be generalizable, because the sample size is quite large.

771
02:33:55,000 --> 02:34:06,000
But that only comes when we're considering the Southern California area, if we're thinking like the nation, the United States as a whole, and maybe less likely.

772
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:11,000
Thank you. Yeah, I totally agree. I think it depends on the answer to question one right.

773
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:16,000
They didn't fully specify the population of interest if their population interests.

774
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:21,000
Southern California. Yes, it is sorry off to otherwise the one representative.

775
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:25,000
But just the population of Southern California is less of the interest.

776
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
Right to study the air, pollution and prism birth.

777
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:41,000
If their population interests the whole Us, then they have some issue of generalizer. because I guess most people will not agree that Southern California is a typical area in terms of pollution through represent a whole Us. right?

778
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:49,000
So it really depend on the population interest. And then but there, you know, sample size is pretty big, right?

779
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:57,000
So that's good. But you know generalizability has last to do with sample size. rather to do with the sampling scheme.

780
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:04,000
Final question one Yeah, go ahead. sorry so so to that point, though.

781
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:18,000
I thought if they again I didn't read the whole paper but if they had detailed levels of each of the pollutants right, and had been able to show a minimum level of exposure that was that was associated with pre term

782
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:31,000
mirth couldn't you extrapolate that to a place like Pittsburgh, where they have pollution as well, just different levels. and say that, you know, based on you know they found I don't know point 5 whatever

783
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:38,000
of carbon monoxide was associated with pre term birth couldn't you then extrapolate that to Pittsburgh?

784
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Okay. Very good question. I want to emphasize a word.

785
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:46,000
You just use X traveling. So I extrapolated.

786
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:50,000
We all know it's not as reliable as as in traveling.

787
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:53,000
That's because you know you will extrapolate things to to population.

788
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:56,000
You don't see you're always based on assumptions.

789
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:02,000
So, for example, yeah, there could possibly be association between parapolitan as a pre-term birth.

790
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:11,000
But there are a lot of interaction with other things going on like, for example, temperature like, you know, humidity, like, you know, surrounding, you know.

791
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:16,000
So social economic status, you know, even racial. all of those.

792
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:25,000
If you already want to measure one group you only study the interaction of all of this in one group, when you go to another place, things might change in an unexpected way.

793
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:32,000
You know, I'm not saying if you stop the association in Southern California, and then other place. don't have the association.

794
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:36,000
They very well be may have association but it's unpredictable.

795
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:46,000
Whether the association will be the same strength will become stronger would become weaker, right, and even the associator may be gone or go to the other opposite direction, which is a lot unlikely.

796
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:55,000
But because you don't collect the data you just don't have the confidence saying that so so that's the weakness of extrapolation Exactly.

797
02:36:55,000 --> 02:37:07,000
Okay, you're welcome that very good question I I think you use the right word to act population in talking about this that that now weren't exactly represented the lack of confidence when we try to otherwise.

798
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:20,000
But you know, nevertheless, if you find something in Southern California, there's a strong association, I think it's very fair to assume, you know, a similar level of you know at least you know some somewhat level association existing other

799
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:30,000
places that will allow you to design a larger across the whole country, even about the whole world, right to see whether the association you know the strength of association.

800
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:36,000
How do they vary at different places of the of the of the country?

801
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:41,000
Sorry Google question. So finally, group one, would you mind answering a one?

802
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:58,000
E.

803
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:02,000
I'm. I don't Remember if I were in group one or 2.

804
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:08,000
But I can answer the question. if there's no one from group problem.

805
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:25,000
What I thought that it's not possible to establish a castle relationship, since I think there are other maternal factors which influence breeds in pre term such as just giving some of sounds like

806
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:29,000
alcohol, intake, drug intake or drug abuse.

807
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:38,000
Internal disease during pregnancy. so many different factors which actually influence the gestation length.

808
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:45,000
So I think what it's not possible. thank you yeah you are right?

809
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:57,000
Yeah, go ahead, go. i'm in room I was in group one but To add to that, we thought that the study design itself without allow you to sort of dictate causality because it was sort of a

810
02:38:57,000 --> 02:39:03,000
retrospective cohort study as opposed to them, doing an intervention and then measuring that intervention.

811
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Against the population. Yeah, you're absolutely right thank you Yeah, the The key word here is that it is an observational study.

812
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:14,000
So it is always subject to confounding potential, confounding.

813
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:24,000
They could well, very well building this this, this this problem, right by managing all possible confounder and adjust them in the analysis.

814
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:28,000
But nevertheless, in the end there will be limitations of observational study.

815
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:40,000
In the first place, you cannot always, you know, rule out. So there are some ongoing research trying to use observational study to establish or try to infer causation as much as possible.

816
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:45,000
But all of them are based on more or less some some degree of assumptions telling me the end.

817
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:49,000
This could hands you right things, You know things from a visual study could hand you.

818
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:54,000
There could be a causal relationship cannot be the final.

819
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:59,000
You know conclusive evidence. you need a experimental study to.

820
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:02,000
Really, you know, enable the cop, and I will say things like those right.

821
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:12,000
So that's that sometimes we just do not have option for example, for example, you know, smoking and lung cancer.

822
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:23,000
It's a very strong association we all know it. by it took decades of study right? It took many many observational study to reproduce, you know, reproducibly, Please stop the association between smoking, a

823
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
lung cancer, but because all of them are observational.

824
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:32,000
So people still have the dance, you know I measure the confound, or that could be causing this.

825
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:36,000
You know, this this association rather than causation. right?

826
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:44,000
You could also do experiments in in mouse studies right to establish, for example, smoking and long hazard. But mouse is still come from human.

827
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:50,000
So in the end there's always this gap but because we have seen this so many times right repeatedly.

828
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:53,000
So now we believe it is actually pausing with all the evidence collected together.

829
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:58,000
Nevertheless, we still cannot do a randomized trial, apparently for ethical reason.

830
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Right, so it's not like I I think in the end it's. it's the degree of believe in call the radiation.

831
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:09,000
This one may provide like a 10% of confidence, but we really have 100.

832
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:14,000
100% confidence. You need to have a randomized control trial, but sometimes we cannot do that.

833
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Okay, So the ads are largely is a No observational study in general cannot establish call, but they they somehow can hand you.

834
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:26,000
There could be something going on to. you know. you can repeat the study, you know.

835
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:33,000
Use other means right to establish evidence. but just one study like this by itself is not enough.

836
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:39,000
So there, there's some degree of complexity here right I don't wanna cause there are people who trying to you know.

837
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:46,000
Study cause our relationships using observational studies use various advanced, you know, physical matters based on some assumption they can do something right.

838
02:41:46,000 --> 02:42:07,000
I don't want to totally rule up it's not a 0. one thing, but in general, observational study is is not able to to establish any question

839
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Alright, Let's move on to part 2 part 2 We only need to look at, you know, first part that the other Pm.

840
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:26,000
3 will do on Monday after we talk about common interval on table 2. we ask about the population distribution of this, whether they are normal or not.

841
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:43,000
So let's go to that's why they both True, right? So ask about the variable of I think of the 4 exposures they ask for whether the population is normal or not. bye apparently it will be battery if they show a

842
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:47,000
hilogram or box block, but in case you know things they don't have it here.

843
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:51,000
We only have the table, so now I i'm open to the whole class.

844
02:42:51,000 --> 02:43:15,000
Anybody want to answer this question?

845
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:21,000
My first thought here was that the the mean and standard deviations for each of these measurements are pretty darn similar.

846
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:27,000
Between 6 weeks before birth and the first month of pregnancy, so that could suggest something more normal.

847
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:43,000
But then the range of each is pretty wide so it's hard to know if if that means the mean has been skewed to one side or the other, helpful to have a media here

848
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:51,000
So anybody else have some some thoughts.

849
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:58,000
I think earlier. The lecture you mentioned, like most of the data, has to fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean.

850
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:08,000
So if you look at the for example, like if you look at the 6 weeks before birth region of the table, the, for example, like the Pm.

851
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:22,000
10. The range extends beyond 3. extends beyond 3 standard deviations from the mean same thing with the carbon monoxide, and also the metric oxide.

852
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:39,000
So I guess my interpretation was that the the data might be skewed towards the right because there's some values within the range that fall beyond the third standard deviation from me.

853
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:43,000
Great. I I like your argument. I I want to tweak a little bit. Okay.

854
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:48,000
So. you know, once we go down to dial level, we need to be a little careful.

855
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:52,000
So you are absolutely right from, you know, normal distribution, right?

856
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:57,000
They are roughly the matching, or from the range we see that they are asymmetric along the mean.

857
02:44:57,000 --> 02:45:03,000
So that's a sign of non-normality when you talk about the 3 standard division.

858
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:10,000
Yes, right not. You know, almost 100%, almost right. Not exactly the 99 point.

859
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:16,000
7% of data are with them 3 standard deviation to me so that's fact.

860
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:20,000
So we are unlikely to see something beyond 3 standard deviation for a typical data set.

861
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:24,000
But this data set is huge, like 97,000.

862
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:30,000
You know, data points. right? So even point, 1% of this will be 100.

863
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:35,000
So from a data side like this, we actually will see things beyond 3 standard deviation. because you know the sum of that.

864
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:41,000
Just 2 cube right the range towers there is the data set There's a data point, you know, very very very large.

865
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:54,000
I didn't tell us how many of them right there could be so i'm saying it's unlikely to have all our normal distribution. but with with such a large sample size all are do happen right, but if you look

866
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:59,000
at the That's 1 one layer of of argument but then go go back to it again.

867
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:05,000
If we look at this, you know this 152, which is the largest data point.

868
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:21,000
It is not 3 standard deviation from if you do it it's like a 6 standard deviation from and I didn't talk about this, but in normal distribution it is impossible meaning impossible to see things 6 standard deviation from money you

869
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:27,000
see that the probability drops so quickly right to have 6 standard deviation from me.

870
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:33,000
You know, you need to have a sample size like one trillion, even one or not to see one data point going that one.

871
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:40,000
So it is I like it to be normal from that argument so it's It's the double labor argument right for from other management.

872
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:45,000
You know this 8, this 8 is about like a 4 standard deviation from the me, or something like that.

873
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:51,000
Then it's hard to say, because for standard division from the need there could happen with such a large sample size. Right?

874
02:46:51,000 --> 02:47:01,000
So. but this 1 11 is unlikely. So all putting together, I think the data, I think of the the stronger piece of evidence that it is a symmetric.

875
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:06,000
So it's unlikely to be normal but just from the range.

876
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:11,000
It doesn't seem to be crazy you know i'm not normal right?

877
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:14,000
So I mean it's hard to say because we don't have the Facebook account.

878
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:17,000
But what i'm trying to say is that if you mean I don't know.

879
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:24,000
We're not doing one. B 2 b 2 c what we do that will say, based on the central limit theorem, although the data is not normal.

880
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:37,000
We've got still making inference about it so that's about to be a 2 Cs, and I will revisit on on Monday, because, you know, they rely on regard confidential but not for the last yeah so would be it's

881
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:41,000
unlikely to be normal, but nevertheless, you know, we can still make the inference upon it.

882
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:48,000
Any question here. How do you know that value of 1 52 isn't just an outlier?

883
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:52,000
It. It is all I mean, all are is a very big term, Right?

884
02:47:52,000 --> 02:48:02,000
You are absolutely right you could totally define it as all layer right. That's totally fine, although what i'm saying is that if i'd like to have extreme all are in normal.

885
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:06,000
But all that do happen. we have a large sample size.

886
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:11,000
So this whole argument, based on all are you just doesn't lead you too far.

887
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:25,000
Right here. I was a moral look at this this the symmetry in this right of the the ring around the me that give more information

888
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:29,000
So what i'm saying if there's all I should have all are in both sides.

889
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:32,000
But because you know this, this whole data arm are positive, Right?

890
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:40,000
You just cannot have all I on one side right? You can only have all on the other side that already give you some asymmetry building.

891
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:48,000
Right. So again I cannot say for sure how i'm now normal It is because I don't really see the past program.

892
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:51,000
But my guess would be that there are some skewers.

893
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:56,000
Just look at the ring. Yeah, I mean all of you. I think the first building is totally right.

894
02:48:56,000 --> 02:49:06,000
If if they provide a medium that'll be very helpful well, unfortunately, they do that

895
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:14,000
Okay, Now let's move on to 3 3 is totally for a different data set.

896
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:21,000
Let's do it together. So 3 is to do with this an Eps medical expenditure panel survey.

897
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:28,000
We're gonna use this data actually for a few exercise later on Alright, let's go back and download it.

898
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:35,000
I'm going to close this one so this is an epsilon.

899
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:54,000
We're also gonna use this data for 5 b on my name Okay.

900
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:57,000
So a little bit about this data set this is a pretty big data set.

901
02:49:57,000 --> 02:50:06,000
That's why we keep using it it has manny right 9,000 subjects.

902
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:12,000
I'm done many variables, too, right you know pens of variables.

903
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:17,000
And then if you look at the dictionary right, there are medical expenditure. right?

904
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:22,000
Are there subject, Id and the region of us, the age of sex, and so on, so forth.

905
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:25,000
There are different kinds of variables, some continuous some categorical.

906
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:32,000
That's why we like this data set for for exercise. So for now we're gonna use the Vmi.

907
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:36,000
You see the Bmi here, and then there are sets.

908
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:47,000
So this particular analysis we use sex and bmi so let's go back to the question, right? create a new column of data that takes each Bmi value and subtract them.

909
02:50:47,000 --> 02:51:03,000
Mean. Okay, So i'm gonna do it together with you especially for those. for now, when it was excel, so let's let's take you know.

910
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:17,000
Let's create a new new sheet okay that's cool, and the sex column and the Bmi has copy this 3 column I'm pulling the new sheet.

911
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:21,000
And now we have a subset of data let's work on this right?

912
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:30,000
So now the question is, we want to subtract all the behind by the week.

913
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:34,000
Okay, So what they can do we can do a talk about the Bmi shift.

914
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:40,000
It right, or you can you can call the center or what's the level right?

915
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:50,000
So we'll take this value equals you can just click this one and subtract the mean will be the average of this whole call right.

916
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
And now you need to keep driving on that. Take a will.

917
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:57,000
Take a long time, or you could use a Shortcut I think it's shipped control.

918
02:51:57,000 --> 02:52:08,000
Hey, Jan, and that will give you shift control page end that will give you this, and then you'll call it up.

919
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:15,000
No this one. I think this actually may not work very well, because if you drag this. You see the second one.

920
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:25,000
We'll we'll have a different range so I think what we really want is to the $2 here so that it won't change.

921
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:32,000
Okay, So when you have dollar C*, I will drag it here.

922
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:36,000
The second one is the same ring, hey? So we just saw.

923
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:45,000
Remove this one click here and double click the corner every single thing. Alright, sorry.

924
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:54,000
Go ahead. Oh, no, quick question. just about the just about the formula to use at the top.

925
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:58,000
I just didn't care to I was just trying to get the data set.

926
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:01,000
And so you know, this is a little advanced right? c.

927
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:05,000
2 is this cell. When you drag it down it will be shifted, as you know.

928
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:09,000
Basically, this one is based on this one and this one will be based on C 3.

929
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:17,000
That's why you know I use the dollar to so that I've fixed this particular column when I can be the average when they drive down.

930
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:22,000
They they don't share. I think an easier way. okay let's let's do an easier way. right.

931
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:31,000
We can simply compute the average here right, and then select the whole column.

932
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:36,000
And then we got average right and then once We have this number Let's let's change it to be a simpler one.

933
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:43,000
I think I don't want to spend too much time so that would be equal to C 2.

934
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:48,000
And then we can just type in 28, point, 4, 8 P.

935
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:51,000
Now that way you will pick the number when we double click.

936
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:59,000
It will be much easier because it doesn't really you know the the conference always a constant, I hope that's easier.

937
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:04,000
You just compute the average and fix it. Does that help?

938
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:11,000
Yes. So now this is a shifted one. Now you see that anything below the mean will be negative.

939
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:22,000
Anything above the mean will be part of it. Okay? Okay. Oh, well, alright, Well, just one more question: What was the the for me that you put in?

940
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:29,000
I guess the D. the D. cell i'm just trying to this one right? Yeah. You see, this is d 2 d 2 right d 2.

941
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:39,000
Simba yeah, i'm i'm referring to the actual the yeah average you're talking about this one.

942
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:45,000
No i'm on prior to the dsl i'm talking about the actual formula that you put in right here right here.

943
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:51,000
The format is always on the pop. Yeah, when you click itself.

944
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:57,000
The formula we have clickers. sorry when you click the cell. The formula shows up on the top.

945
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:06,000
Here right? I just know, I understand that I was just saying like when you, when you actually put the formula in. I know you have to put which sale you want to use with cell numbers, and all that or correct.

946
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:12,000
Right. So when you put the when you made your formula, did you use sales?

947
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:16,000
A, B and C. or is it just the Are we just taking the average of sales?

948
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:22,000
C. Okay, I I I think the question sean's asking is that Shawn?

949
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:34,000
I think, what he was trying to do here. The task here is to do the Bmi for each one minus the average

950
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:42,000
C. 2 is the Bmi for patient one minus the average Bmi, which was the 28.4, 4.

951
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:51,000
Yeah, Thank you. Yeah. So d 2. The formula in D 2 is here equals C, 2 minus 28 point, 4, 4, 8.

952
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:59,000
So c. 2 is key. So it turned out to be 45.3 minus 2848. so that's the formula for d 2.

953
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:09,000
Once. you're feeling the formula for t 2 you just double click the lower corner that will automatically fill out the pointer for all of the

954
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:20,000
Did I answer a question. a little bit maybe i'm maybe i'm just not guessing how you got I guess to be like shifted.

955
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:26,000
But I don't. I don't know I don't wanna Yeah, this has not need to do A A and B.

956
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:33,000
Yet. Right now we are Yeah, i'm i'm gonna say that I probably I think I just missed how you got to the Bm.

957
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:39,000
I shifted. How you got those terms that's my whole thing I did it that's the new.

958
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:50,000
That's the original thing. I got right So I just randomly pick a cell and computer average typing in this formula from C 2 to see 9,232.

959
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:56,000
Right using this phone, and I compute the the average of this of the C call.

960
02:56:56,000 --> 02:57:01,000
These are the average of the whole bmi that's 2840, 44, 88.

961
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:17,000
Now as a talk, start a new column Yeah. don't have this question so far, cause I wanted to take time to vote for everybody to follow

962
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:32,000
Is that everybody with me so far. Yes, so here i'm just computing the average of the sea home hiding in this formula, you know, in a Harvard tree cell

963
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:38,000
Dr. Jean, this. This may be like a like a stupid question.

964
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:42,000
But how do you get that average for like? How did you come to that formula?

965
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:47,000
I mean we are selecting from the off link from the auto sample tab.

966
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:50,000
We can select average. But how did you get to that formula?

967
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:57,000
Oh, let let me let me re going back you know I I set up any cell right, and then start hiding equals.

968
02:57:57,000 --> 02:58:02,000
Once you'll start equals anything can be a formula afterwards, and they would type average.

969
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:19,000
How much is the mean right with my average and then type left Bracket a promise Now they ask you to enter the number you want to average, You could pot, for example, you could keep tiding c.

970
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:30,000
2, Colin, c. 9, 2, 3. that'll be the whole thing. If you know the number now, you could pipe it, and you will get it.

971
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:36,000
You could totally do it by hiding but what if we don't know the number that's like.

972
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:44,000
That's my question. What if I don't know it's 9, 2, 3, 2, 9, 2 3.

973
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:47,000
2. Yeah, you can look at a number before you pipe them.

974
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:52,000
Yes, the other way would be, you know, you go back typing right equals average.

975
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:57,000
And then brand this. Now you just move your mouth and select the whole column.

976
02:58:57,000 --> 02:59:06,000
Oh, okay, So we just manually do it. Okay, oh, take a while, or you could use, you know, keep or shortcut. that's a little bit involved.

977
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:13,000
I don't want to touch that now, that could help you still like very fast.

978
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:16,000
That's the 3 way I know if there are others students you know for the Gis.

979
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:22,000
I knows better way that'll be helpful but I think it's hiding will be the use. it.

980
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:28,000
I just select everything, and then you go back and type of close practice, and you are done.

981
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:31,000
You can go to the top you know if it's here it's the same thing.

982
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:37,000
I think the hiking is the easiest

983
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:43,000
Is everyone with me now? Yes, awesome. yeah cheers that's great, You know.

984
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:49,000
I know this is hard to follow, especially for you know people who are not familiar with itself.

985
02:59:49,000 --> 03:00:03,000
But once you're familiar with it's a so powerful and Now let's start a new column because the question asked us to subtract the mean from this to Yeah, right So we started a new call Let's name it that's called the

986
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:08,000
Vmi, you know. shift it you got maybe however, you want i'll be on my center.

987
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:14,000
I'll be on my you know whatever so what we want is that we want this number to be this number.

988
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:25,000
Subtract this number right but we don't want to type in, because we want to type a parameter, so that when we drag all out of number will be calculated accordingly.

989
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:31,000
Right? So we do is that we type a formula here because you can directly stop Track 45, point 3 out of that.

990
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:37,000
But then you have to do that for every single cell that will take forever right Instead, you type of formula equals.

991
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:56,000
You could type C 2 here, that's the same thing, and then type. Subtract right, and then you'll type in 28.4, 8, 8 see 2 subtract 28.4 8 name type.

992
03:00:56,000 --> 03:01:01,000
Enter.

993
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:11,000
Oh, I see There you saw healthy, you know, mentioned a shortcut keeper Shortc in the chat. right?

994
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:15,000
How do you select a whole column in excel using a keyboard?

995
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:18,000
Shortcom. Yeah, that that's very helpful thank you so much.

996
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:26,000
Yeah, cause I never remember them right. control. Shift the down arrow to select everything you could try that, you know, but that also depend on whether you use the windows or Mac right.

997
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:35,000
If you use Mac you'll probably replace control by command, but nevertheless, you know, once you got used to is super fast right, but you can always pie.

998
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:40,000
So now, once you type this, you got this formula. you got it calculated.

999
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:46,000
You can double check 45.3 minus 28 point 8, 4, 4 equals.

1000
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:51,000
This on the ninth thing of a formula is that now you don't have to do anything on the rest.

1001
03:01:51,000 --> 03:02:01,000
You just put your mouth here. When it shows this cross you just double click, and then everything downwards will be a quality, you know.

1002
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:08,000
Populate it. For example, T. 3 now equals C, 3 minus 1, 80 point, 4, 4 exactly what you want right?

1003
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:17,000
And the that's how I do it I'm glad that now you all, you know not follow me. now.

1004
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:26,000
That's great any question

1005
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:33,000
Okay, yeah, let me know, and have you have a question that's it's quite important that you can follow this.

1006
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:37,000
I know yeah, go ahead real quick, just as a

1007
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:42,000
How did you get it to keep the like in the formula?

1008
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:47,000
How would you get it to keep the average in there? as it goes down like?

1009
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:58,000
Is it? Yeah, I got it? If you hard call a number, the number will not change right right now.

1010
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:02,000
But if you're gonna use the the j whatever how would you do that. Yeah, if you do that, you can subtract and then type it, i'll be jay 9.

1011
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:09,000
Right. If you do this, then you have you have trouble, because, see, now, this will be C.

1012
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:15,000
3 minus J. 10, but J. 10 is empty, right? So if you really want to use J.

1013
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:24,000
9. you can do a dollar j dollar, not? Oh, okay, you go stay there.

1014
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:30,000
Okay, some sort of a trip that's Why, I I manually pipe 28.4 4.

1015
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:37,000
You know that's that's easier for everyone cause I I think if you don't use excel every day.

1016
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:42,000
It's hard to remember this kind of tricks

1017
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:49,000
Any other question.

1018
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:57,000
Okay, cool. I'm so sorry. this no another question you got to 16.8.

1019
03:03:57,000 --> 03:04:04,000
But I you back to that, and then how did you fill up the rest of the the rest of telecom You're yeah there.

1020
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:08,000
And then you selected something from the key. Yeah.

1021
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:18,000
Yeah moving i'm off here, you'll see across and then double click gotcha.

1022
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:22,000
Yeah, is this: Yeah, it's very convenient once you guys use it.

1023
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:33,000
Okay, Thank you.

1024
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:41,000
Any other question.

1025
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:53,000
Okay, Now let's. go back now. is the same thing right click another column and take the value created in part a divide by this sample standard deviation.

1026
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:59,000
So now you can. You can do it right. So we just need to find somewhere capital sample, standard deviation.

1027
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:05,000
So this will be equal to that's called it you have to have no, there are there.

1028
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:11,000
Are you caught? Std with the Ev Is standard deviation right?

1029
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:16,000
There are 2 version: Dot P. and dot test the piece population version.

1030
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:18,000
The S is sample version. The only difference is I O.

1031
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:22,000
Divided by one over N and one over the minus Y. in the formula.

1032
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:28,000
Here we use this you know. Here, we use this because as T.

1033
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:32,000
V. dot has we use this function that's the sample standard deviation.

1034
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:37,000
See the see the Node estimate standard deviation based on a sample.

1035
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:46,000
You just have to remember this function itself. and Then the rest is the same thing right from C 2 to c 9, 2 3, 2 right same thing.

1036
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:53,000
And that's the sample standard division of this Bmi.

1037
03:05:53,000 --> 03:06:02,000
And then you do have same thing. Vmi: You could call the standardized.

1038
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:08,000
Yeah, my standard that neo pot equals now it's not c.

1039
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:20,000
2 is actually d 2, divided by 6.6 6 3 d 2 divided by sample standard deviation. and then you'll enter.

1040
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:25,000
You got is 2.5, 2, and then you double click.

1041
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:34,000
No, you have to move. Shift your mouth here, and you will see this black black cross and then double click, And now everything's gone.

1042
03:06:34,000 --> 03:07:04,000
Yeah, please take a minute and do it and let me know. if you put a follow I will take a repeat usually got the same thing as I showing on the screen

1043
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:16,000
Okay, let me know you have any questions. Okay, just all right i'm back at the standard deviation.

1044
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:20,000
So. I'm just making sure you said the formula is c.

1045
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:28,000
2. no here he is. This is called F. P. Dv.

1046
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:37,000
Dot s standard deviation dot sample, and then from c 2 to C 9, 2, 3, 2. Okay.

1047
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:48,000
Well, i'm trying to do that. 9 2 3 Oh, c yeah, 9, 2, 3, 2, No.

1048
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:56,000
Okay, 660 Gotcha. And so from there we go.

1049
03:07:56,000 --> 03:08:07,000
Do you 2 divided by, divided by the number. you just copy there 6.6, 3, and then enter.

1050
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:29,000
I'll do it

1051
03:08:29,000 --> 03:08:35,000
Yeah, excel in a way right formula is a little bit like programming.

1052
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:41,000
So it takes on learning part. I still use it on programming, but similar to programming it.

1053
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:46,000
Doesn't take any pipes right so you have to be very careful with your piping there.

1054
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:49,000
But once you got used to it very convenient.

1055
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:58,000
Okay, what this 1 point is. you Well, yeah, I guess how many discipline did you use? Well, I I just use 3.

1056
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:05,000
I think that's sufficient for the purpose but you know no one guidelines have a 2 or 4 or 5.

1057
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:14,000
No. I just hear 3,

1058
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:21,000
Are you able to fill the whole column without having to scroll down all the way to 9,000?

1059
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:30,000
Yeah. one of the students just mentioned right? If you put your mouse here, and then you, you know, press down all 3 button at once.

1060
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:39,000
Control shift page down. No, no page down. Sorry control shift.

1061
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:45,000
Well, with that. Okay, I i'm not even familiar with that arrow down arrow.

1062
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:51,000
Now. alright, yeah, control ship arrow, though not to select the whole thing.

1063
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:57,000
Arrogant is going on that's very very very convenient, just hard to remember.

1064
03:09:57,000 --> 03:10:04,000
Once you got used to it so so cool it's in the chat

1065
03:10:04,000 --> 03:10:16,000
So what i'm saying is that here instead of typing it right instead of piping it, you could actually no select this one and then control shift error down 3 button at once.

1066
03:10:16,000 --> 03:10:23,000
Now that you see c 2, c, 9, 2, 3, 2, 3,

1067
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:34,000
Yeah, that's fine cool I never really remember that combination that's really cool

1068
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:46,000
And another question

1069
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:51,000
Yeah, for Mac. You have to replace the control by command.

1070
03:10:51,000 --> 03:11:08,000
Back, Andrew in the pan, measuring them in the in the chat

1071
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:13,000
Okay, yeah, feel free to let me know about question, and I will move on.

1072
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:20,000
Now so part 2, so any any for any variable right.

1073
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:27,000
If you subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation. That's something we we often do that's called a standardized.

1074
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:33,000
That's why I find the pmi standardized and the standardized A variable has a special name called a Z school.

1075
03:11:33,000 --> 03:11:38,000
So basically you could say, this is a Bmi standardized.

1076
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:45,000
I could say, it is vmi z school. the z score from Bmi.

1077
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:52,000
So Z stands for normal, so normal distribution. You know there are many different normal distribution, right?

1078
03:11:52,000 --> 03:12:05,000
But one of them is called the standard Normal distribution. which has mu of 0, and the Sigma of one, so that I think a normal distribution is called a standard normal distribution, and it's also called a Z distribution.

1079
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:08,000
So that's where the Z come from I know it's hard to remember.

1080
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:12,000
So you don't have to remember that but the z stands for standard standard normal.

1081
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:16,000
So if you subtract the mean divided by the final deviation, you got this.

1082
03:12:16,000 --> 03:12:22,000
So how does this call so? This call has some nice property in that?

1083
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:41,000
If we assume that Bmi is normal then the Z score come from the Bmi will be standard normal if it's standard normal, which means how's this score of 2 will be correspond to our original vmi 2 standard deviation above the

1084
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:50,000
mean right. The Z score minus 2, correspond to a original Bmi, 2 standard deviation below the mean.

1085
03:12:50,000 --> 03:12:54,000
So the question here is that, yeah, for the regional Bmi is normal.

1086
03:12:54,000 --> 03:12:58,000
How many of the we couple of here will be above 2 right.

1087
03:12:58,000 --> 03:13:10,000
This one is about 2. This one is about 2, but the next one is, you have to go all the way down to find the maximum about 2 right actually very few.

1088
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:14,000
So my question is that if the pmi is normal we don't know.

1089
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:16,000
But let's assume it's normal how many of the Z.

1090
03:13:16,000 --> 03:13:23,000
Score about 2, you might expect

1091
03:13:23,000 --> 03:13:35,000
Anyone wants to answer

1092
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:51,000
Around 1.5%. And why is that? Well, I stop that between these scores of 1 point No?

1093
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:57,000
Oh, no, no! no! Sorry I did Dr. Jean, can you?

1094
03:13:57,000 --> 03:14:05,000
Can he just repeat it

1095
03:14:05,000 --> 03:14:11,000
If this is the normal then the Z score will oh, value right.

1096
03:14:11,000 --> 03:14:16,000
How many of these score? large number 2 do you expect in this calling?

1097
03:14:16,000 --> 03:14:23,000
If a Z school is to what does that mean that the Bmi is within 2 standard functions? Yeah, Z score.

1098
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:28,000
A 2 represent the Bmi is 2 standard deviation above the mean.

1099
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:39,000
So if you have it, 2 standard deviations. above the mean there's 2 point, 5% of the data above, and then 2.5% of the data below to standard deviations.

1100
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:46,000
So the because you've got 95% of your confidence interval within 2 standard deviations of the mean.

1101
03:14:46,000 --> 03:14:52,000
Thank you very much. so you you're absolutely right right so this is the original Bmi.

1102
03:14:52,000 --> 03:14:57,000
If you see that the mean is 2828, point, 4, 8, 8.

1103
03:14:57,000 --> 03:15:07,000
This kind of deviation is this 6 right immune is this number we with standardized? when we do standardized, we didn't really change the shape.

1104
03:15:07,000 --> 03:15:11,000
We just change the me and the Sigma. So the standardized the Vmy.

1105
03:15:11,000 --> 03:15:19,000
We'll we'll call the z right the z will have a center of 0, and the standard deviation will be one.

1106
03:15:19,000 --> 03:15:29,000
Okay, and then, therefore, you know, a Z larger than 2 will correspond to a Vmi larger than 2 standard deviation, 2 stigma away. right?

1107
03:15:29,000 --> 03:15:34,000
So this 2 are corresponding to each other, this minus 2, also correspond to here.

1108
03:15:34,000 --> 03:15:44,000
Right. So if the shape is normal, that this 2 area will be the same, therefore, we expect in the middle will be 95%.

1109
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:52,000
That's one of the property we taught by in pop then on both tail above 2 and below 2 will be 2.5%.

1110
03:15:52,000 --> 03:15:55,000
That's when the whole distribution is normal if the distribution is not normal.

1111
03:15:55,000 --> 03:16:08,000
This rule do not apply. You repeat that one and once they meet you said, If Z score is over, or more than 2, then it has something to do with the standard deviation.

1112
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:20,000
I just So the the Z, the Z. These score will have a standard normal distribution with mean of 0, with standard division of one.

1113
03:16:20,000 --> 03:16:27,000
Therefore these 4 2 is exactly 2 standard deviation above the mean right Gotcha.

1114
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:31,000
So these world 2 correspond to original management, which is 2 standard division above the meet.

1115
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:40,000
So Bmi, equal to 28 plus 6, I would say 12 equals 41 or 42 something right?

1116
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:44,000
42. This number of course follows these 4 of 2.

1117
03:16:44,000 --> 03:16:57,000
Okay, Sorry for my math and messing there. i'm not a someone with a group had the right

1118
03:16:57,000 --> 03:17:05,000
So the answer would be, There will be 2 point, 5% above 2, 2, point, 5% below minus 2.

1119
03:17:05,000 --> 03:17:09,000
Yep. You, assuming the original Bmi is normal right?

1120
03:17:09,000 --> 03:17:21,000
The further away the Bmi from normal. The The further way, this number of from 2.5. can you see the woman time I was the last celebrating that?

1121
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:27,000
Yeah. assume the Bs Pmi e is normal in the population, which very well might be assuming it is normal.

1122
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:34,000
The the proportional above 2 and below 2 on the Z score will each be 2 point, 5 or so.

1123
03:17:34,000 --> 03:17:38,000
Right. If the function is wrong, say the Bmi is not normal.

1124
03:17:38,000 --> 03:17:40,000
Right, then, of course, the 2 proportion will not be 4.5.

1125
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:48,000
So the the further away the Bmi from normal, the further away this proportion will be from Google Point 5%.

1126
03:17:48,000 --> 03:17:56,000
Gotcha bye everything is based on assumptions but we have a good reason to believe the Bmi is normal or rough. You know.

1127
03:17:56,000 --> 03:18:02,000
Therefore this estimate won't be too off

1128
03:18:02,000 --> 03:18:07,000
Alright. Now I will explain the reason why we even do this is call.

1129
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:12,000
Okay, think about for many traits, Right? like a Bmi like high, like a weight.

1130
03:18:12,000 --> 03:18:17,000
Like many other things, right, Mayo has a different distribution than female.

1131
03:18:17,000 --> 03:18:23,000
So, although both are probably normal. but they may have a different me on different standard deviation.

1132
03:18:23,000 --> 03:18:35,000
And if that is the case well, who mail and the female to gather right, they will have a sort of a mixture.

1133
03:18:35,000 --> 03:18:45,000
So here. what i'm doing is that i'm calculating you know the Z score altogether with everybody.

1134
03:18:45,000 --> 03:18:52,000
Both may want a female right here i'm ignoring the sacks when computer is equal.

1135
03:18:52,000 --> 03:18:57,000
But is that what I could have done? Is that take mail separately?

1136
03:18:57,000 --> 03:19:06,000
I take female separated. you and computer Z school within each group

1137
03:19:06,000 --> 03:19:20,000
You. if I do that, not everybody we've got a Z call within your you know gender group, and that's this call is somehow you can say it's control for for gender.

1138
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:30,000
In fact, already you know right now, if I tell you I have a V 4, 2, you know I have a Bmi like 2 standard deviation above the me in the population.

1139
03:19:30,000 --> 03:19:36,000
But because these 4 2 means different things for male and a female in the population.

1140
03:19:36,000 --> 03:19:49,000
But if I tell you how was this girl too, email then you know I'm: the top 2.5% a Bmi email rule which will be different in a in a female group, right?

1141
03:19:49,000 --> 03:19:54,000
So this scroll tool somehow take out the the gender effect.

1142
03:19:54,000 --> 03:20:07,000
If your computer's gender specific Z school Okay, I've these scoring just a different way of talking about the phoneage, for example, you could easily say, I have a bmi of Z score, 2 which is the same thing

1143
03:20:07,000 --> 03:20:16,000
as saying, I have a Bmi of like 90 97 point, 5% time assuming the population is normal.

1144
03:20:16,000 --> 03:20:27,000
These 2 statement are the same. However, a bmi of 97.5% power in a population suddenly say much about the Bmi.

1145
03:20:27,000 --> 03:20:42,000
If I don't tell you on my gender, because that that number may be different for male or female, right? So instead, we can do a gender specific person how or gender specific via z quote and that way will be more

1146
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:45,000
specific.

1147
03:20:45,000 --> 03:20:49,000
Okay, so to be my may not be so easy to understand.

1148
03:20:49,000 --> 03:21:02,000
But if you replace the dmi as high right if I tell you i'm the top one person in high, which is not very meaningful if I don't tell you my gender right but I tell you i'm point

1149
03:21:02,000 --> 03:21:09,000
1% you mail you can pretty much guess i'll i'll tell I am right, which will be a different number if i'm 21% in email.

1150
03:21:09,000 --> 03:21:12,000
So the Z. scoring just a different way of talking about percentage.

1151
03:21:12,000 --> 03:21:23,000
But you know this call of of 2.5%. you know Z: score of 2 muse, you know 95 point, 5% person.

1152
03:21:23,000 --> 03:21:26,000
Now

1153
03:21:26,000 --> 03:21:43,000
So that's the benefit of using Z score versus the actual Bmi value, because that takes out the you know the particular media and the standard deviation right, especially using a gender specific disease school that take out the 10 or any

1154
03:21:43,000 --> 03:21:48,000
time, so you could say that this world 2 is either male or female.

1155
03:21:48,000 --> 03:21:55,000
They have the same sort of a person. how in their home gender group

1156
03:21:55,000 --> 03:22:02,000
Yeah, this is unclear not very clear what's the use of this, for now well, later on, when we talk about multiple regression, right?

1157
03:22:02,000 --> 03:22:11,000
So you want to use. You want to study the different the associate between Bmi and, for example, hard disease.

1158
03:22:11,000 --> 03:22:18,000
In that case it's not very helpful to use the Bmi itself.

1159
03:22:18,000 --> 03:22:20,000
It will be much helpful to use the gender specific.

1160
03:22:20,000 --> 03:22:26,000
Vm. i z school as a variable

1161
03:22:26,000 --> 03:22:32,000
Because that pay called the gender, in fact. so if gender be your confounder, there be at the agenda specific.

1162
03:22:32,000 --> 03:22:39,000
Vm: I. Z. score will take out that potential contamin.

1163
03:22:39,000 --> 03:22:45,000
Okay, So that's one way of controlling for polynomial compounder right by regress up right?

1164
03:22:45,000 --> 03:22:56,000
When your standardized by gender specific bmi, you regret how the gender you had

1165
03:22:56,000 --> 03:23:02,000
Okay, So any any case, yeah, any case, the Z score take out the me and the standard deviation, right?

1166
03:23:02,000 --> 03:23:09,000
Because they standardize. And then, if you do this call within the gender specific group, you also take out the gender impact.

1167
03:23:09,000 --> 03:23:17,000
So gender specific. These 4 is very easy to use as a predictor rather than the original Pmi cell.

1168
03:23:17,000 --> 03:23:47,000
Any question.

1169
03:23:51,000 --> 03:23:57,000
Okay.

1170
03:23:57,000 --> 03:24:08,000
That's good. So because we haven't finished so please don't submit, and also please don't go to the quiz until Monday, when we finish the electron conference in the vote will complete this and 5 B and an

1171
03:24:08,000 --> 03:24:13,000
aquest right, of course, will be due on tuesday morning.

1172
03:24:13,000 --> 03:24:20,000
They'll also have a another video link so I I don't wanna go over today because it's this Friday, and this has been very long.

1173
03:24:20,000 --> 03:24:25,000
But if you go to the homepage, and then you go to excel freshies.

1174
03:24:25,000 --> 03:24:32,000
There are 2 sheets here central limit, theorem with normal sample and central limit, theorem exponential sample exactly.

1175
03:24:32,000 --> 03:24:35,000
It's very similar to the simulation I just run on a website like here.

1176
03:24:35,000 --> 03:24:39,000
We use excel to run a simulation that shows you, you know.

1177
03:24:39,000 --> 03:24:47,000
The central limit theorem, essentially right. So basically the same homie will follow normal, regardless the original population distribution.

1178
03:24:47,000 --> 03:24:52,000
If you're interested, kind of take a look at this if you're, you know, interested in familiar with itself.

1179
03:24:52,000 --> 03:24:56,000
But these are not required. Okay, i'm just sure enough that exist.

1180
03:24:56,000 --> 03:25:03,000
So on Monday I will. I will continue with the 5 electrophile B.

1181
03:25:03,000 --> 03:25:07,000
And manage 5 a and do 5 B. and then we'll finish this?

1182
03:25:07,000 --> 03:25:16,000
Any question before I close and for the day

1183
03:25:16,000 --> 03:25:23,000
Okay, thank you very much. I'm really appreciate you stay with me for the whole week, as being a long week.

1184
03:25:23,000 --> 03:25:41,000
And then It's Friday. so have a great weekend all see, on Monday morning.
