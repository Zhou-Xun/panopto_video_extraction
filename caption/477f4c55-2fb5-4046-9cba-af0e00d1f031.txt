1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:09,060
Again, I show this picture of a couple of times with great people like Chris Oakley.

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,960
Chris. So surely you want to probably want to jump into it.

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:25,600
Take a swim. Enjoy. Wait. But if you look in the microscope, just get a job of that water.

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,870
Put a microscope. This thing would probably see.

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,960
Okay. You see. A drop of water from a microscope.

6
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,570
If you amplify, you will see these bugs. In the war.

7
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,360
Okay. Well, more amazing. The chemistry, chemicals, chemicals. Just the microorganism.

8
00:00:50,620 --> 00:01:01,040
You may be just given a while. So many. Microbrew sales in the water give scale, but most of them it's not really considered you.

9
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,090
Okay. Most not really considering so depending on what talk about contacts.

10
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,920
So most of the time we will not call these infections effective.

11
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:21,470
This is commensal bacteria, given the bacteria or the amount of microorganisms that don't really cause the disease for the disease.

12
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,300
But that wasn't me. There's no passive right to be impacted.

13
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:34,490
So how do we deal with it? So how do we make sure that the services we sell, produce and with our costs?

14
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,780
High rate of infectious disease. Don't get me wrong.

15
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,930
So don't say there's zero infections. It's not really.

16
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,340
Come on with chemistry. And also the things don't say zero risk.

17
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,710
It is New Zealand. This is just what is acceptable except acceptable risk.

18
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,360
Okay. What's the level of the risk we can't accept?

19
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:08,550
So that's the the the the why didn't with the water areas the same but because this is what we're dealing with is just in water.

20
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:19,200
Every place you see can see. Mark owns it all, including our drinking water in our tap water.

21
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:28,320
So if we get a tap water. Looks clean, but you see not as many organisms as you can see here.

22
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,220
But you do see microbes. Sometimes it could be 10 to 15.

23
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:40,090
See if you put me in. Okay. 2000, 100,000.

24
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,710
That's pretty high. But I mean, it's tiny. It's more so.

25
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:54,550
So this is what we were dealing with today. We'll talk about micro contamination, the one with waterborne diseases.

26
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,150
And then one thing I want to focus on is the biofilms.

27
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:06,709
And that's the way this microorganism, probably in your mind, works, which is really the issue we have.

28
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:15,000
We have. When we know we have these waterborne diseases.

29
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,690
When historically in the record, we know that we have 1.8 billion.

30
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,380
Anyone ever feeling queasy when we're feeling queasy and we need to have drugs to do it?

31
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,690
No, anyone has a we talk about that.

32
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,790
About that. Anyone that's away from epidemiology. Okay.

33
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,410
So so with a cholera outbreak. Yes.

34
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:53,960
That's the first kind of funding that that is a common we know the world on diseases and before.

35
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:03,580
Even before that, people can see how there's something come from the air and then actually take control of it.

36
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,960
You do something, come here, and then something that is some mystery.

37
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,640
But the effects, the first. Confirmed in the report is the London operate cholera outbreak.

38
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,590
So they do the epidemiology study. They found in Ebola streets the where.

39
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:31,430
Where they dump all these waste commercial vehicles all the time and then they contaminate the surrounding wells.

40
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,530
People get the water from dead bodies. It's in the 1800s.

41
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:43,299
That's a first. But Joan Cousteau was was it considered the father for the epidemiology?

42
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,290
So so that all we know. Right. That's all the chemical contamination.

43
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:59,000
But. This a wide variety of the mosquitoes or pathogens you can find especially for the war.

44
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,320
Anyone extremist issue with one.

45
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:12,110
No. But if we have any issues of perception, let's.

46
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:22,710
Or actually actually I mean actually. I mean, it didn't personally affect me, but growing up I think it was like late nineties in Illinois,

47
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:27,780
the way the major league there was infected with leptospirosis.

48
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:38,330
Okay. Yeah. I went to Thailand and there is and my girlfriend, she was on a mission trip there as well.

49
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,680
And some of the people,

50
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:48,889
they went island hopping right just outside of Bangkok and they drank the water there and they got sick and they don't know exactly what's wrong.

51
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:59,230
But even though it was processing cleaned by their standards, they still had some residue remains that cause some type of adverse effect.

52
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:09,280
Okay. So yeah, I mean, waterborne diseases, for example, if you travel especially to developing countries, you probably were exposed to that minus.

53
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,680
I mean, if you do the summertime, you do the tea.

54
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:16,460
You mean all together? Diarrhea, if we if we don't take care of the water.

55
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,060
I travel a lot to the different countries.

56
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:31,580
And once I went to the Peru and then I went there and and I it's not really from the water per se, but it that's that's water related.

57
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,870
And I caused a very bad diarrhea in that time during the trip.

58
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,160
And most days you'll see that people especially from the Western countries now, you really see some of the developing countries.

59
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,250
You will probably experience the diarrhea, very likely.

60
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:53,030
That's one of the symptoms, one of the common very common diseases you have in that so really caused by this microbe.

61
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,230
You ask why the local people don't have the problem. They have the problem.

62
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,440
We just don't report it or the some of them get used to it.

63
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,259
We develop the immunity against that. They we we don't really exposed to that.

64
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,280
We don't really have the strong immunity against this. This is Paget's.

65
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:17,060
But for local people either they don't report you still see the diarrhea and then all the equator they

66
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:24,370
you have this this immunity so that they can can can protect the most of our body that has a difference.

67
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:33,230
Most of the cause the the intestinal diseases diarrhea is a common sometimes blooding is also if it's contaminating the water.

68
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:40,760
Okay most of the bite ingestion of come by just hitting the water foundation.

69
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:52,729
We think about inflammation if you really look at this information can also cause the oral diseases with a lot of great so we had a study

70
00:07:52,730 --> 00:08:00,530
before we tried to look at the long microbiome was the bacteria was microbial and then what is why they have a pretty big overlap.

71
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:08,930
Okay, the overlap. So evolution also could be quite quick and then this survival because survive period can varies.

72
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,840
That's the issue we have. We have the setting, the temperature.

73
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,720
All this could could affect the survivability of this tragedy in the war.

74
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:29,340
So what's the major source of all positive? What are the major sources of water?

75
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:36,680
You. Well, what is the wisdom of how you come from?

76
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:49,970
You come from, like being out in, like in natural environment, like soil, soil, oak, ocean, any, any, any, any other sickness.

77
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,350
What is it like? We know these chemicals come from industry.

78
00:08:54,350 --> 00:09:01,630
The discharge bodies. I mean, the daily life was a major source for the World War.

79
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,880
When it zoom, it's the physical material that's indicated the slide.

80
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:16,990
Physical material. Okay. This has really coming from the human and from animals.

81
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,000
Okay. From human, from animal, because that's where the major source is.

82
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:30,450
Some of this really is the very small number living in the water.

83
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:38,620
Okay. But our source of these major passages could come from fecal material we discharge.

84
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:52,400
So every time people flushing toilets that could discharge tons of patients, especially in the hospital, get sick patients.

85
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,100
The media said a lot of material or even just the on the on the.

86
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,370
Healthy people looks healthy. They can also dump hazards.

87
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:11,330
This is a major source from humans physical materials and animal fecal materials where

88
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,800
the animal can also discharge the pigeons into the water that we could infected.

89
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:22,920
Okay. So the survivors of the time, how long they can survive.

90
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:34,200
So think about that dependance I more really I mean they like the human because we have the constant temperature, right?

91
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:42,660
37 degrees was five and then we have how much of it is it?

92
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,470
You provide, you eat their foods, but in fact, you also feed the food for the.

93
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:59,920
Surely we have some anti-microbial peptides and try to kill them, try to control them.

94
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,390
But very few species. We have the good environments to survive.

95
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,350
They have good food spots. So they're happy to new using Eve.

96
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,780
Okay. Surely we have our immune system or how to anybody to have all these to try to kill them.

97
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,010
That's true. But in terms of survival, yes, they can survive.

98
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,190
If they don't have this anti-microbial, they will be happy to survive.

99
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,740
25. Okay. But when they get into the water or have it.

100
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:36,340
But according to what will happen, they reproduce because they have the water and typically other food supply.

101
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,700
So the water producing the water, thinking about the water.

102
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:47,499
Right. So the temperature when temporary jobs, most scarce temporary jobs like compared to your food,

103
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:56,680
to your to your body in terms of nutrients for which will have more reaches, which might be more richer in terms of the fruits of.

104
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:04,140
Our body bags are in the water. This allows some to some water hook them up.

105
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,950
You just kind of walk with you want to be part of it.

106
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,590
There's no really nutrients, obviously.

107
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:21,280
And we also have the chemicals have a unique through all these shows the effect is not even favorable for micro you can just amplify multiple.

108
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,930
Okay. Could still grow by the may not be empty, but it could survive in an empty lot.

109
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:34,190
So level five quote when the president decided to the water.

110
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,930
You see the coast of reducing the concentration. Okay.

111
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,010
Is the big difference, though.

112
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,819
People are coming because they can go away.

113
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:54,350
Happy to what? Okay. So this is that really varies can virus grow in the water?

114
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:03,730
Provide security in the water. Human cages.

115
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,940
Human bias. They were padded during the war. No.

116
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:15,260
Has the virus and the host failed to reproduce.

117
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,380
So unless you have the. System there.

118
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:24,080
So it's not they will not be able to prevent bacterial protozoa.

119
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:29,490
They can. Okay. Not every every bacteria can, but virus truly cannot.

120
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,890
So right as you'll see, the it's just how we can survive.

121
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:41,080
But they have to recover quickly. Bacteria is the largest group of water borne packages.

122
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,790
A minimum infected dose could be one 700 to several thousand.

123
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:52,960
So again, think about the effect of the dose of the vaccine doses always need to take into consideration.

124
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,870
We just said this.

125
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:06,829
Normally, it's not really easy for them to to survive, to compete with with other organisms by the low temperature sediments of absorption evolution.

126
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:10,580
And the anoxic conditions sometimes can prolong their survival.

127
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:15,469
Most of the time, those temperatures of those that can survive for the survival the most,

128
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:19,430
the remainder amplify to reproduce for this for their survival.

129
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,280
Okay. Typical example.

130
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:28,770
I have one, four, five, seven. And we still have this we still have this outbreak.

131
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,910
Associate with the correct. A very recent one.

132
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:46,200
And the. The spinach, some salads because they use the water for them to do this.

133
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,940
And the virus, we have so many viruses, infectious diseases.

134
00:14:51,630 --> 00:15:04,270
One of the typically is hepatitis A. So some of this virus, they could survive for very long, the time they could sustain the course state.

135
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,750
They could also adopt to surfaces or to the particles in the water so they can survive.

136
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:16,190
But most for the virus, we know that they cannot produce bacteria.

137
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,390
Well, some of them can reproduce. But virus we know they cannot reproduce.

138
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:29,130
So what do you find if on the water is very likely come from someone source from human faithful material all this.

139
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,560
Um. Some of the virus could be still infectious.

140
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:44,740
That could be infectious if exposed to that immoral virus with damage to control mice, that could still cause the infection.

141
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:50,550
But some viruses that might be. Okay you exposed to that the loss lost the.

142
00:15:52,290 --> 00:16:00,570
So one of the typical for Kobe in Kobe's says Kobe to having fun and people get infected to the water.

143
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:08,229
Okay so in the water and that's also depends on Norway's because you U.S. is mostly in the

144
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:13,870
digestive tract not in the Greece type of attack like when you took the water because the virus.

145
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,110
They get infected. So. So.

146
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:25,390
Wires. But one thing you need to keep in mind, the virus cannot modify,

147
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:33,040
cannot reproduce in your environment because the other is really the become the concern

148
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:41,260
right now as the the idea and the crypto becomes the the this that you carries that.

149
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:52,780
But crew that with us they can survive in the water when they also become deceased because the closest they have different life stage.

150
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,910
When you're flipping the body, they have this and then we get in the water.

151
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:05,500
They make an assist format. So what's the format is really that can also sustain for a very long time.

152
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:10,610
We use chlorine or this will not be able to kill. You've got to get them.

153
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:20,370
So. Now Georgia becomes the most preventable disease in the United States,

154
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:29,000
exposure in the United States associated with swimming pools, with some of the water system, even with swimming pools.

155
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:33,490
That's also the case, including in Canada.

156
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,670
We want to know if you the Milwaukee, we'll talk about the cases in Milwaukee.

157
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,920
Really the call this one, more diseases associated with protozoa.

158
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:49,770
So we have the bacterial pathogens virus poses over some other organisms.

159
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:58,799
But is your typical waterborne diseases horrible hazards including bacteria, salmonella, skinner Vibrio cholera.

160
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:07,709
We just talk about it. And then the virus, the hepatitis A, some of the viruses, protozoa, we'll talk about the idea.

161
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,700
And this is a disease that could cause a major source here.

162
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,950
You can see here we get a major source of this causes bacteria.

163
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:22,380
A lot of microbial candidates come from human feces for any cases.

164
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,220
So that's different from. Chemical dependency.

165
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:37,540
On what? You gave him the gift at them in the water as a major source from human sources or animal source.

166
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:53,140
Okay. On the materials. In fact, what about it is very severe, still pretty high, although this is a relatively speaking the data.

167
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,790
But the case or the situation does not really change much.

168
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,360
I mean, in the recent days.

169
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:08,910
So every year you have this morbidity or mortality could be severe, meaning people die from or from the waterborne diseases,

170
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,530
most from this diarrhea, especially for children under five years old.

171
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,670
Okay. How about meaning? Like people's kids died for this?

172
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:29,320
Now, again, if you think about what's the major source, what's the major way to find all these cousins?

173
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:39,850
In the suit. But in the future, we correct the system.

174
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:44,920
We have. We agree here. We took all the. Human.

175
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:51,750
West sometime in the west. Also some of the sewage system pipes didn't get through with whatever event.

176
00:19:52,500 --> 00:20:05,280
And then that's kind of mixed it together. If you look at. All these different group of microgreens peasants you can find in the.

177
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:11,150
So some of them could be very high concentration. Okay.

178
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,660
All constitution de facto, both parts of the law.

179
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:23,070
So some of them. How many sides will are viruses, different types of viruses and bacteria that can cause these waterborne diseases.

180
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,690
So EPA has that regulation. I mean, talk about regulations.

181
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:33,920
EPA has the regulation that cryptolocker idea ever some of them legionella or we have the the

182
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:40,710
of virus some of these to confirm that the fecal materials indicate was a fecal contamination.

183
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,660
If you have that's that that you may think of this fecal contamination in the water.

184
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:55,700
Again, we are not rigorous, all the women.

185
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:59,550
So if you just think about that, the rest of the present in the water.

186
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:05,270
We are not we are not regulated, all of them right now. Okay.

187
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:10,130
For the Safe Drinking Water Act. The thing about the how do we regulate them?

188
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:16,030
It was a process that we regulated. EPA How was the EPA? Regular citizen contaminant.

189
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:23,990
By the Safe Drinking Water Act. Okay?

190
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:30,380
Yeah. Last week we took advantage of that. So what's the process?

191
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:38,610
BP regrets said the contaminants. How.

192
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:48,330
How did you two meet to make this thing? Don't they take samples or waste water treatment plants?

193
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:56,070
Yeah, that's true. That's. Yeah. But but for example, why we regulate ecology, why we don't regulate.

194
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,860
Hello? Chemical. Back to the dosage of the material can be different.

195
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:11,460
Okay, so the process for the EPA to regulate contaminants is first, you may have the outbreaks of the problem.

196
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,270
For example, lead contamination is a problem. Yes.

197
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:24,880
All. We get in on how we how we know this new jobs increase the increase of fast becomes an issue.

198
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:31,030
So we we will repeal was based on the permanent record by the most the demos available right away.

199
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:38,500
We have these condemned candidates these if that's the issue they put them on the contempt cave it needs.

200
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:48,000
And then provide the information that is exposed for of the risks in the effective dose.

201
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,690
What is safe, acceptable, acceptable risk?

202
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:57,530
And then how can we children can we truly can we detect them? Okay.

203
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:03,639
What's the big the problem is? So that's called contemporary. And then every five years they have a new niece.

204
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:11,890
And then they decide to me whether we have the platform to record it, not only to speak system, but also for the smart system.

205
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:19,630
So, for example, this is a this is a new contaminant kind of released.

206
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,480
We have to really regulate them all. Yes.

207
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:32,559
One of the surely the legitimizing regulated now Helicobacter for families orchestration and then mycobacterium also on consideration.

208
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:38,590
But we are not regulate them yet. So also even they are only contemporary can be at least when not ready yet.

209
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:51,480
The other. Now with we talk about emerging issues, emerging biological health, and also you might imagine a world diseases, especially virus.

210
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:58,380
Think about what's the major source of the new presence, human presence.

211
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:05,340
If you see recent outbreaks with the most recent outbreaks.

212
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:10,740
Well, this hasn't come from. Animals.

213
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,110
Well, like food and grocery store? No, it's animal.

214
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:22,400
Ocean from animal. Ebola or this kernel source from animals.

215
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:30,350
So the imaging because now what this is what we are doing to the to the to the to the animal habitats.

216
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:35,830
Right. We try to deforestation or we raise high concentration on food.

217
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,259
For food. All this promotes this close interaction between the humans,

218
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:48,860
study humans and also the animals who have a lot of impact, which includes much collusive action.

219
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,610
So it comes with psychological prejudice to me.

220
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,220
If you do apologize, we'll talk about it as much pageviews as you fix.

221
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:04,600
Also, the end of the effect women before only effects.

222
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:15,490
And most but now because we have more close interaction and then the of mutation they jump on to the host to whom it could host don't.

223
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,809
Okay. Hook jump. So that's the intent of the image.

224
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:24,080
But it's now we have video is really the image of peasants.

225
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:33,500
Some zoonotic disease, some of them that you take to match the host and the effect that might accrue the agents,

226
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:40,310
some of the virus that we have, the effect the corona virus or this originates from animals.

227
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:47,400
And someone else in the water with us can trust me.

228
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:51,750
So the water cycle mouse rocks.

229
00:25:54,040 --> 00:26:00,020
As the image impressive we have. So with all of these states, right.

230
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,959
So how can we detect them? How can we monitor them? How do we know the water is safe?

231
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,040
Like just showing you the the picture, what is key, really?

232
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,090
What is clean? And then how do we know what is safe?

233
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:20,970
We know for the chemicals due to my own microbial contaminants.

234
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:29,490
So what's was major source of who? Like all lives we just talk about was a major sore spot a major source of.

235
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:35,320
Atoms of fecal matter. Fecal matter, human and animal fecal matter.

236
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:41,410
So if we know the water is free of fecal contamination.

237
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:48,620
Then we can. Pretty reliable to say that what you see in the microbial communities, right,

238
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:53,120
if there's no effective contamination, we know there's no source for the figure to visit.

239
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,690
Potable water is typically okay to.

240
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:01,940
But they all say, oh, if you go to the place you want to go the hiking. Why would you go see?

241
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:09,570
There may be no magical materials, but it could be anyone over to a content or we just don't know that yet.

242
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,069
So we need to make sure there's no to ammunition so that we use some of the.

243
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,550
We use indicators. We use indicators.

244
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:27,540
To make sure that when the indicators are there and then the whoever president, president will have the indicators.

245
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:37,860
Indicate could be part of the physical examination. So we're kind of indicator we can choose to indicate the fiscal commission was the best.

246
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:47,010
So this is some ideas easier to detect, easier to grow, and and they can grow independently.

247
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:54,989
So one thing is very important is you can grow them even a reliable you can

248
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:59,700
compared with others and with their presence very likely to just tighten up.

249
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:08,730
Okay. So that's the idea indicated we are using again, we are still trying to identify the ideal indicators.

250
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,340
We don't have them yet. We do have an indicator that is a good indicator, but it's not really the idea.

251
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:19,140
Indicators is still the scientific community are still searching for this idea of indicators,

252
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:27,180
but we do have some good indicators and then this is a desirable indicator to think about again.

253
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:33,190
Very similar to what the portable presence is presumed to affect contamination.

254
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,010
Okay, so the commonly used indicators have to total conformance.

255
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:44,090
Okay. Fecal coliform. Fecal coliform. E.coli.

256
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:52,440
Enterococci. This is mostly from the fresh water and the like for the for the seawater.

257
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,350
We use some empirical and then also use philosophical take on that.

258
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,290
To go back to what's on the origin of the to go back to it, graduate in the water.

259
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,690
And then we also have the bacteriophage face to indicate the viral contaminants.

260
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:15,480
Okay. That's indications we have. Do we have idea if I missed today all these things.

261
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:23,020
So while the problem no, that's not really the case, but this is what we use commonly used and defined by the Law of Drinking Water Act, for example.

262
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:31,300
Would you find by that you have to want some of this so that's you know, that's free of fecal contamination, for example.

263
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:46,980
Okay. So that's the indicators. In the United States, for example, that you call a figure confirmed by EPA.

264
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:54,180
And in Michigan, we are also always. Now we have a little work in one vehicle for the beach,

265
00:29:54,450 --> 00:30:02,249
but the Great Lakes in them and they will always be these if they will have the live work now to monitor that.

266
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,970
And then we try to identify some other bacteria to do it.

267
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:15,180
And but this is commonly used very easy to use and worldwide who also uses indicators.

268
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:26,910
Worldwide so you can compare the data. Outbreak of cryptosporidium infection in Milwaukee.

269
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:35,250
This is in 1993 and. This is a typical epidemiology curve.

270
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:41,299
We see people get admitted to the hospital. Okay.

271
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,900
Don't go hospital and. See the number. You see some of the increased number.

272
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:49,560
This outbreak. Okay. This is outbreak.

273
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,250
And then you may wonder what's what's what's cause of the outbreak?

274
00:30:55,170 --> 00:31:01,240
It happened in the Milwaukee. People really get into get me before.

275
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:11,140
We in the United States in the after seventies excuse the seventies to the eighties,

276
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,680
the water borne diseases is not really on the hot topic of the people mind.

277
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:22,900
But then Milwaukee has outbreak and then this this come from this cooktop the exception

278
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:30,940
the identified for the hospital infection and then all together it's like 40,000,

279
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,930
4040 400 to 3000 people. Can you.

280
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,220
400 4400 people get hospitalized.

281
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:47,980
The hundred people died. So that's really the way I think people attention to the album.

282
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:58,890
I mean I mean one why is that why the the why the the the outbreak occurred to the Milwaukee.

283
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,460
Other time. Several reasons.

284
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,479
One of the reasons is because. Deteriorated.

285
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,620
Oh 140. Another time.

286
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,040
There's a storm. Rainstorm. Heavy rainstorm.

287
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:32,230
Before that, if you're lucky. Okay is heavy rainstorm in the Milwaukee before that and then wash all this into the into the surface the water.

288
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,910
So in the Jimmy Kimmel plant,

289
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:47,700
in the treatment plant that we'll talk about the Truman process then because this summer the increase of the to released into the water and the are

290
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:57,210
not be able to remove all these contaminants in combination and filtration surface field because the beyond the capacity because it would be so hot.

291
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:06,200
And then then the end. The water, the beauty, the water.

292
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,410
And they use disinfectants because height of beauty.

293
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:13,700
And the crypto is more recent to the coral reef. We are using instruments.

294
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:19,780
So they end up with high concentration of the cryptos in the water.

295
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:28,420
And then people drink. So that's what happened. So the whole point is that what happened in.

296
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:36,620
People start getting infected and then in the for very high numbers and they all together you see.

297
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:43,980
That's a big event. Waterborne diseases in the United States.

298
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:47,400
People start paying more attention, put more research into these areas.

299
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:53,430
But that's what happens in the United States before they also happen to occur in Canada, in the world.

300
00:33:54,630 --> 00:34:00,150
But then they are lucky so that people start to research on this cryptosporidium.

301
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:06,010
Okay. Coopersville becomes a top hot topic for the research in the water quality sector.

302
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:17,650
So because of the contamination and then the failure to remove it.

303
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:23,690
So so that clearly affected. So now imagine for us, right?

304
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,040
So let's say if we go to the river now, drink the water in the river.

305
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:34,509
Some people will be lucky that they'll cave, but you'll see the increase something.

306
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:45,150
We don't have the water here to drink. In our before people say, just go to the kitchen, the hills go away, and then this is this is what we see.

307
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:50,860
This is the way I see. Sooner or later.

308
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:58,280
The divisiveness. Okay.

309
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:08,590
Let's take a quick break and then we'll talk about the biofilms. What are you doing?

310
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:18,470
12. That's great.

311
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,210
Then they know that it's in mine.

312
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,040
My husband sent me a screenshot and it said,

313
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:42,600
University of Michigan gives Psychedelic Shroom Fest the green light and having atrocities associated with your work.

314
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:57,830
You know, we heard this somewhere, but I read the article and they were like, absolutely no sales of psychedelic will be permitted.

315
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:12,920
So that was it, like a hash bash? Well, it's not the topic of the day.

316
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:21,620
My personal opinions will not be popular or.

317
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:27,260
It's part of the rhythm. So. Yeah.

318
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:44,000
That's kind of fascinating. To think about human life.

319
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:49,950
We are getting older. We have different perception. Yeah.

320
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:54,180
That's the process. It's just process. Okay.

321
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,860
There's still the market. For what?

322
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:24,410
For the drug start. The psychedelics. Yeah. Psychedelics.

323
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:27,610
Yeah. psy1. I can't.

324
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:31,420
P s y. C h e d.

325
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:46,410
E. L i. C. And they choose to decriminalize it.

326
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:52,730
I know. I feel like that's why they're doing it, right? I think so.

327
00:38:52,820 --> 00:39:01,040
And last I heard, they were talking about it. I did not. I've seen around the city there's like these stickers that have a picture of oppression.

328
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,270
And then it's like. And then just has a phone number and, like, absolutely.

329
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,150
For no symptoms. Nothing.

330
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:17,930
So, I mean, he say Mr. Trip. And then from there I'm like, okay, because it is their trip.

331
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:26,600
Gotcha. That is amazing. Unanimously like it.

332
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,330
SAUNDERS Oh, man.

333
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:40,280
JONES You. Choice.

334
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,910
Freedom come always a responsibility for consequences.

335
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:56,150
These ways is different, always different ways. And by choice.

336
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:19,500
By choice. So. I think generally I think, you know, what is the most lethal microorganism?

337
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:28,850
What's most another? That's that's a good question. In the history of how many people killed it was Mubarak era.

338
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:32,390
Probably most of the people.

339
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:38,330
But again Vibrio cholerae. And that's the that's the how people die from.

340
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:48,170
I mean may not be the most lethal by the bacillus, for example is also I mean they know those they can probably kill you right away.

341
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:52,900
But it's how many people get killed as people, Kyra.

342
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:58,790
Probably. That's it's I mean, historically, we have all these outbreaks.

343
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:06,900
They kill a lot of people. The Web. And virus.

344
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:11,120
Free virus. That killed people in the pandemic.

345
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:19,970
In the history. But in general, in total, I think it probably vibrio cholerae kills a lot more people.

346
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:39,480
I mean, just physically. Okay.

347
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:45,450
Biofuels. What are the biofuels? And we'll hear about the term biofuels.

348
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:53,780
So what if we can't buy? So.

349
00:41:55,550 --> 00:42:05,170
All films. What do you think about the micro-loans? Probably your your high school biological class or the coins.

350
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:10,040
You think all of these the individual cells in the flask. We call them, we check them.

351
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:13,820
And that's how they microloans the life of girls in the environment.

352
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:18,320
We take a water and grab a water.

353
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:25,070
Probably just the microbes in the floating the in the in the water.

354
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:31,400
Okay. Yes, that's that's one of the form of the bacterial, the survival of my home.

355
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:41,390
It's distributed evenly the water environment that the majority of these microbes are not really living in the free floating environment.

356
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,790
They are bound together. The textual surface.

357
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:52,929
So let's think about I use it all over. Use this as a, as a companion.

358
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:57,140
So if you. Sue anymore.

359
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,880
Animal. Sorry, it's probably too cruel to tell you that example.

360
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:05,710
But let's say you drop into the water in the river. 35 and high flow rate.

361
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:13,520
So what's your first reaction? Scream and scream to ask for help.

362
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:20,990
Yes. Drop with the others. This was a first reaction.

363
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:24,649
I mean, if you if you fall into a river to grab on something,

364
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:29,920
to try to grab something to get out, try to attach for something to grab something, right?

365
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:39,290
So think about them calling them right? When they get into the small and even like small, tiny little flow to them is like very high fluid.

366
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:45,620
So that's what they if fiction is grabs, obviously attracted to the surface.

367
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:51,830
That's basically most of solving the problem is doing is that they want to attach to surface.

368
00:43:53,480 --> 00:44:04,520
Okay. Reform agreements. So would algal blooms be considered biofilms or is that a mark of the harmful algal blooms?

369
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:09,979
You can't because there's one form of the biofilm just aggregates the cells of your.

370
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:16,600
They use different mechanism for that. Okay. So biofilms again, it's every well.

371
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:26,000
Okay. This is called biofilms. This includes microbial applications that adhere to the biological, biological surfaces.

372
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:31,580
So basically, this tends to surface the aggregated for my community.

373
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:39,320
In the late year, 90, more than 90% of these OB-GYNs are living in these files.

374
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:45,510
They are not really free frooti that is attached to something.

375
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:50,760
For example, if you have this pipe. But we'll talk about the microplastics.

376
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:53,550
So all these plastic materials into the water,

377
00:44:53,850 --> 00:45:00,210
and that's a great place for the microwave to survive because they need the surface to attach so they can help them.

378
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:08,700
Because if it's like free floating, in fact, you know, if we just slow a sink, we think of, it's obvious to them it's so fast.

379
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:15,360
So that means that plastics, even if it's going to be a small intestinal microplastic, they can survive.

380
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:19,620
Yeah. That's helping them to survive. They have them to survive.

381
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:28,890
So that's really everywhere. Most of these communities that affect the microbes, we look ahead to the to the to the to the to the environments.

382
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:41,970
Extracellular polysaccharides that the produce so that produces the extracellular materials to encode them so that particular.

383
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:49,970
Good people here, right? Think about the biofilm of the house or the floors in the building.

384
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:57,020
So we nivi inside the building to protect you from the harsh environments outside.

385
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:02,150
To keep it more comfortable. Keep the temperature.

386
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:06,790
And they keep from the storm of this. That's how they microcosms.

387
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,340
They are using this these biofilms to protect them.

388
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:15,259
Okay. To protect them. Okay. So so now another question.

389
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:22,900
We have very good environments. For example, here, very once we what do we need from this pandemic?

390
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:32,160
It's very I. It's not really it's the most dangerous place for the transmission of this is for some of the effects the disease have.

391
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:35,440
But but the formaldehyde. Yes. Is good.

392
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:43,440
It really help us to protect us. So any places you find there's moisture.

393
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:49,590
You probably find the biofilms there and biofilms there, especially in the flow system.

394
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:53,370
We have the nutrients, some of the nutrients there, the flow through that gives the biofilms.

395
00:46:53,790 --> 00:47:00,090
So think about the pipes. These pipes we have, in fact, all these pipes we have the biofilms on.

396
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:07,540
Okay. BioFilm is everywhere.

397
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:12,210
It's everywhere. And it was stable on the stone in the Crystal River.

398
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:15,580
And then you fall into the river and you have that experience.

399
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:21,460
Very slippery, right? Very slippery on a stone, for example, rocks.

400
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:25,390
You have this biofilm, which you have the bacteria as microbes in this.

401
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:30,250
Then the secret is put in medical materials. That's really dilute.

402
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,050
So we step on it. Yes, we get into water. Is literally.

403
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:42,060
But then this is one of the. And what was these pipes for?

404
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:47,440
Yes. Some of these beautiful cuts like this.

405
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:52,299
Have you tried? I mean, I don't know whether you like stuff.

406
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:59,800
If you go go home now. Try to go for steps, throw your finger into the faucet, and then to cover the fields.

407
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:07,180
We tried that. Yeah, you tried it. You have the slimy feet.

408
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:11,410
Oh, there's the showerhead. Everyone open the showerhead.

409
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:19,090
So I have it. Then I'm thinking about it because I. I've noticed, like, the first two showers I took, my water smelled off.

410
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:22,810
Or like, I like to clean my bathroom, and I was, like, expecting it to smell that.

411
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:30,969
It's like, smell old. And I was so concerned, like, I had bleached everything, but the smell was still there.

412
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:34,090
Is that happens? You just have to look at it. Yeah. So.

413
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:37,360
So the showerhead, it could be one thing. I mean, look at the showerhead.

414
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:41,709
If you open the showerhead, most people don't see their showerhead.

415
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:46,330
Right? So we'll open the showerhead and then you'll see what you can find.

416
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:54,430
Take it to me next time. Okay? Do it is sort of your business.

417
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:02,500
Bathroom is helpful. Okay. And the other thing is really our human body.

418
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:08,770
Okay. Think about the body. Everyone say, Oh, I do, I do very well.

419
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:18,950
I can do my teeth like three times a day. But unfortunately, yes, you still have to keep all your okay during the typically frequent cleaning.

420
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:25,030
How far by camera we can measure the how the control of our camera is what I'm saying.

421
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,540
Okay. There's a balance.

422
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:38,050
So why people give up the oral hygiene to screening deep community or this would be able to help you to make the biofilm on control.

423
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:42,730
I mean, they'll be able to continually completely remove them, but it can begin to control.

424
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:48,179
Okay. First rule surfaces for another show you the worst of it all.

425
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:51,620
The victim of this form, this biofilms. I mean, you are body fat.

426
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:55,330
Okay. Everyone, we have the bathroom. Okay. Um.

427
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:01,380
I'm a soldier servicing quite a soft tissue of New Orleans.

428
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:05,070
Everything. The medical interface, basically.

429
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:13,880
Basically most large majority of the biomass of microorganisms that live in the bathroom.

430
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:19,200
They form aggregate attach to the surfaces. Look, I'll tell you something.

431
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:24,040
So, again, I will show you the these the pipes. And this is where they'll find these.

432
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:28,560
This is like all these places you can find. You'll find both of them.

433
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:40,260
We talk about the water quality to help you to think about drinking water pipes, medical implants, everything that the surface of the ships for them,

434
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:48,410
what they call the biofilms, develop their cooling towers and how the cooling towers do that in the home and in the food processing sugar.

435
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,850
What this means, I just mentioned the the showerheads.

436
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:57,420
I mean, just look out of a shell it and then you can also open the faucet other types of other the home of the sink.

437
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:02,570
And then you'll see what happens in the event in the in the pipe.

438
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:07,850
Okay. Since all these are formed, these biofilms will get in matters together.

439
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:11,750
Touch specifically where the bacteria or the microbes.

440
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:18,380
Okay. So how can we control them? How can we remove them?

441
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:26,600
How can we control them? Those are the the help with the deactivation.

442
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,820
This could be some courses it could do.

443
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:38,600
For example, when you do the wastewater or they use aggregate, they can get to these materials or contaminants.

444
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:47,960
So this is how bacteria form this form these biofilms the that attach to the surface start to attach surface.

445
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:52,220
They drop something into the river and then they attach to attach.

446
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:54,440
And then the bacteria they use, they use it.

447
00:51:54,950 --> 00:52:06,200
They're secretly I'm putting of separate substances to that kind of slimy attach so they have them attached to a surface and also include them.

448
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:12,320
And then they start to reproduce and in the form of the biofilms and it can detach is not always there.

449
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:16,670
They could detach and then they could form its lifecycle over the life.

450
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:21,770
So if we start with a fresh pipes demo, very clean, fresh pipes.

451
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:27,930
Everything is drinking water. You'll probably see the bacteria attach to that right away.

452
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:33,850
Okay, I got it right away. But you know, the form is biofilms, especially with our.

453
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:37,349
Do you want to take about two years to form?

454
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:45,450
Is biofilm a stable biofilm. Become this a problem by the the the in the medical devices.

455
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:51,230
If you have this implant device and they just take a big. To form these biceps.

456
00:52:52,410 --> 00:53:00,389
Okay. One of these. So that's how how how this is if you look at these buffers, most of the time,

457
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:06,660
this little slimy layer of muscle, that's the feel slimy layer of the cells on surfaces.

458
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:16,500
And that's your feeling as well. But in fact, they have a lot of structure in the three dimensional structure of the biofilms.

459
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:25,499
So some of these bottom looks like but inside you have different environments and you have also the human costumers because biofilm,

460
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:33,059
they can attach to the cells, but they have the flow. So you have all the different kind of structures they have and then you also have the dispersed

461
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:38,190
to the cells can meet these biofilms and can repair to our surfaces this kind of cycle.

462
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:44,580
But um, and then you'll say why my pipes is not blocked by the pipes.

463
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:50,930
I just the detachment. So we have the flow.

464
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:58,330
You can get rid of some of them sloppy dispersant, but they can't continue.

465
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:03,970
So eventually what happens is within the pipes, if that's put out of control,

466
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:10,990
they will reach the equipment so that you have the continuous layer of the CO2 on the surface.

467
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:17,260
But this is you have the flow so that you will be able to control all of the growth.

468
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:22,030
I mean that the set up tapes of these biofilms thick of the bottom of the surface.

469
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:31,570
Okay. But with the love of Hamill's use, we are finding this that this flow becomes flow on us through, especially for the shower head, for example.

470
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:36,910
And you will see they will get blocked. By the years.

471
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:43,990
The reason the form of the Bible, the way I say the 24 movement films.

472
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:53,959
Think about it, it's a microcosm, an operating environment of what is happening. For example, it's not affirmative action for them.

473
00:54:53,960 --> 00:55:00,240
There's so many. He's trying to kill them. Without chemicals as UV light.

474
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:04,980
So predators. They tried to kill him.

475
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:11,190
Okay. So what they do, they use this different mechanism to protect it.

476
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:16,290
They form this X percent of the material was negative to the whole structure to

477
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:21,120
protect them from the so that it becomes more resistant to the chemicals disinfected.

478
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:27,480
So one way we are trying to do as humans, for example, we try to cure them, right?

479
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:32,540
So we say a kind of human presence. Always appendages. We use disinfectant, all use the children.

480
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:38,040
Reckon. You know, drinking water, for example.

481
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:43,170
You know, everywhere a whistle. We also use Korea. We use a lot of coverage trying to tell these folks.

482
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:58,370
But this is how he's making it and take them as a battle vector so that when they form this biofilms, try to protect the.

483
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:03,200
So now what you can see here is you can watch this system.

484
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:08,130
You see these pipes. So they would be able to survive to continue.

485
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:17,340
Okay. So that's the reason why the bacteria biofilms are more resistance to the to the to survive the system.

486
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:21,710
So what you can see here, we just use a drinking water sewage system as an example.

487
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:30,160
We get one or two attributes or these ten filters. You see that all the surfaces will be under the and on top of it.

488
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:40,310
Okay. All these types. All these types. All these pipes we have on the ground under your home in this building.

489
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:46,430
Of all the surfaces. They have the boffins get up out.

490
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:57,680
Okay. I'll save it for the bathroom. Good on. And then when you're home, when you use.

491
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:03,120
When you use. You have the bathroom grounds.

492
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:15,080
So what are the best chemicals or ways of cleaning out the biofilm within the pipe since it's all within the structure?

493
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,960
Like, obviously you don't want to completely dig it out and just remove it like the same way and flush it out properly.

494
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:27,230
So that's a really good question. So if we can find something to do that, you've probably will win the Nobel Prize.

495
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:34,010
Okay. Unfortunately, will have to deal with it.

496
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:39,640
So what do we do with how to make it on the control? So that doesn't cause the problem.

497
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,680
Okay. Oh, we can. That's. That's. I mean, come on, really.

498
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:49,650
Remove all of them. Can only read Rebecca all of them on this.

499
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:55,520
So there's no good chemicals. I mean, you say, well, dump all these chemicals to it and then we can take.

500
00:57:56,030 --> 00:57:59,330
Yes. For under certain circumstances.

501
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:03,320
For example, if you say I will carry my you take all along.

502
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:09,530
I will use brush.

503
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:16,120
I use detergents. All this. Okay. You can remove all of them from the small area.

504
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:23,410
Right. You and. And some of the food processing places like implants.

505
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,060
I tried to clean them. All of these different. Yes, you can use the most.

506
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:36,980
You can. But with this not just give. So he tried to kill them, killing them, and then all these chemicals left in the water can kill you as well.

507
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:47,320
So we need to think about. But when you think about it, this chemical we are using strontium to oxidants.

508
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:51,220
But you. Do pigeons bleed?

509
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:55,850
High concentration. This may take it, but they think about it and kill you.

510
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:10,700
Okay. So that's your travel point, right? And very acidic solutions to standards like faucet water filters and like showerhead water filters.

511
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:14,540
Do those filter this out or is that mostly heavy metals and chemicals?

512
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:21,110
You mean like a for example, like a britta like filter?

513
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:28,910
Does that get like biofilm, like microbes that like filter that out or is it more so for like metal?

514
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:34,730
So this friend this or most of those chemicals when they're heavy metals, all these have been put in for that.

515
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:43,970
But then what happens is we can build this pretty good ground for bacteria to go going to go for these filters.

516
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:51,049
So that's really the last thing you have to it like three months and one month due to depend on the use that if

517
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:56,710
you don't do that and then this this this pretty critical environment for my colleagues to give the biofilms,

518
00:59:56,980 --> 01:00:03,320
in fact, because you attribute as a nutrient or dairy matters on the surface of a vacuum for them to grow.

519
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:09,180
And then they form these biofilms on this and then this on the opposite, but it's not good for your health.

520
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:13,189
And so okay, so how can we make it a control?

521
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:16,270
We have to make it control that we can lower the risk.

522
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:20,000
We can accept the risk associated with it. But now what do we do here?

523
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:23,840
Everything. We do not try to deal with water.

524
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:27,210
We are not ready to pump out the biofilms. Okay.

525
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:38,570
So again, we have a good is it that chemical industry or this the value for management we're not really managing the and I managed to just to control

526
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:48,560
the pack Tony sales in the war as it were we had all the regulations or the laws we have standing we have all regarding what's in your water.

527
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:56,860
But we know now is not everything. Even water. But most of the stuff I use of is bath in the bathroom.

528
01:00:57,410 --> 01:01:00,910
But our regulation will touch upon it. Okay.

529
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:05,530
So that's the reason I was invited to the FDA.

530
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:13,840
The FDA tried to this company. They said we develop the methods like we assess whether using greater measures to control

531
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:19,510
this biofilms in the in the defense for medical use for the industrial use as well.

532
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:24,180
But the FDA says we don't know how to regulate. Whether your claim is right.

533
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:31,650
So I was invited to the FDA to stay there for six months as a scholar in residence at FDA,

534
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:38,550
trying to help them to develop these methods of criteria to regulate the food system.

535
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:53,760
So we have tried to work on this for already quite a bit by this my lab research and now recently we do the most a lot of career work by people still.

536
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:58,379
And work through how can we control our films in a different environment.

537
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:05,490
Speaking what is one of the the places we are trying to develop the methods and also some medical devices to look at the

538
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:11,040
bathrooms and then we'll look at why we still see a lot of patients right in the in the biofilm in the do the work.

539
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:17,100
We use chemical disinfectants to control them. But while we still see the biofilms, what's the mechanism that.

540
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:22,630
Okay. How can we with this arms, then we can improve the choices.

541
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:29,390
Okay. So now it's very clear the bacteria in the biofilms.

542
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:35,590
In the distribution system. This in the decimal system.

543
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:41,140
Sure it is one of the mechanisms. My problem is used to survive.

544
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:45,530
So you are the control? We have control that. The biceps.

545
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:50,429
So what do you think of oh, by the way, somebody it is a violin opera.

546
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:53,460
The the fleece during the world prices.

547
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:59,690
Because when they disturbed the system was affected by the event.

548
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:07,070
In the bathroom where we are now difficult because the high concentration of these bacteria.

549
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:11,240
Getting to work. It's okay to do water.

550
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:15,760
So that's the problem. Okay again.

551
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:22,120
Chemicals. Micrograms. There are also countries.

552
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:31,260
In terms of risk disease, but it's always concentration and the ecology and also the concentration and how much you exposed to them.

553
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:37,320
So this is a one of the most study we have done for quite a few years.

554
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:44,310
And to look at these five fields in a discipline system and then use a mechanism to see why we find.

555
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:52,320
So what are we finding is that when the bacteria, half of them are exposed to the to the chemicals and then they could develop the resistance.

556
01:03:54,630 --> 01:04:00,420
So there's a saying that something cannot kill you, make you stronger. And that's also applied to my focus.

557
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:03,780
When you use this little concentration or what do we use?

558
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:09,840
And the best is to kill them and to make them stronger so they can become more resistance, they can survive.

559
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:17,100
So that's one of the reason in the drinking water, for example, okay, we are not be able to kill all of them.

560
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:20,910
And you cannot say it's my fault, you free.

561
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:27,570
But basically you cannot if you use that high concentration, have a of these youth come out with with health risks.

562
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:34,230
Okay. So what are we used to effect? You have the management system to try to make sure that we have the microgram under the control.

563
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:38,430
Does that pose acceptable risk to that in the health?

564
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:44,600
Okay. So always acceptable, acceptable risk to live in the house.

565
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,890
And then what was the acceptable risk?

566
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:56,780
And we'll see what's acceptable risk. So there's a one out of 100,000.

567
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:02,480
To you as one of the preschoolers. What we can. Totally.

568
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:13,500
It's not like zero zero. So we tried to change the culture and effects.

569
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:20,820
It's very difficult. We become have a battle with the industry about the biofilms and know some of them.

570
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:26,430
They try to make tribes start to understand we work on this, but we are not there yet.

571
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:29,890
Having that to show, for example, of how to regulate them.

572
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:35,050
EPA tried to find a guideline to regulate them and they still haven't caught this yet.

573
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:45,720
So that's another thing we needed to work with together, try to really try to solve this problem, try to address this right problem.

574
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:49,130
We have to deal with what is the one country area?

575
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:58,010
Okay. Which so let's when they were coming when they were talking about how we and we monitor the microwave.

576
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:05,230
Um. Well, keep up the discussion. Go.
