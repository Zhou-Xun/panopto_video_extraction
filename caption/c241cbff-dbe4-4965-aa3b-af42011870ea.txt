1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,300
Okey dokey. Are we getting a Sam today?

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:15,550
Yes. Here, here, here, here, here and here.

3
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,200
Did any of you drive through the dense fog this morning? Okay.

4
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:34,170
Just me. I thought about changing my class, my morning class online, but I was like, that's kind of a rude move if other people drove.

5
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,740
But yeah. Turned out everybody took the bus this morning, so.

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:51,600
Yes. So on Monday, we talked about primary interventions in and in the work space, particularly targeting psychosocial factors.

7
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,860
And then today we'll be talking about secondary and tertiary.

8
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:07,470
Like I said, you have a quiz. Do you on Sunday should be able to take that even though I had to flip flop this week in next week's content.

9
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,670
So just as a reminder, Tuesday, we will not be meeting here.

10
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,690
We will be meeting online only. And then Thursday there's no class at a time.

11
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,910
Oh, great. So just showing us again.

12
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:32,160
Here we go. So what is exactly a secondary intervention then, if we are not just doing screening?

13
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:42,060
So as we were called at this point, we're trying to essentially eliminate risk or reduce the burden of the disease or the condition.

14
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:50,910
And the goal is to try to get people to return to original health and their original function to prevent any long term issues.

15
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,520
Now, again, this might be reducing its impact or stopping it from recurring.

16
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:08,850
So in the regular health world, this might be like blood pressure tests, blood panels, cholesterol tests, fitness assessments, for example.

17
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:15,839
You know, if one year on your physical exam you have high cholesterol, that is not permanent by any means.

18
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,620
It doesn't take you're not going to fix it overnight, but it's pretty realistic.

19
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,800
By the next year, you can decrease your cholesterol.

20
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,350
I've gone up and down in that and then or in the context of work,

21
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:38,850
modifying the work to prevent injury or illness or getting a daily dose of medication or some kind of exercise program or rehabilitative therapy.

22
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:51,300
So going back to the very beginning when we talked about the job demands resources model and if we're thinking about stress management in particular,

23
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,470
if we're trying to target stress management at an intervention,

24
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:02,670
the job itself, you may be looking at demands that require that are looking at workload,

25
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:09,600
the pace, pressures, ambiguity and conflicts and potential discrimination from the personal.

26
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,940
And you might have family demands, financial issues and relationship conflicts.

27
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:22,410
And then in terms of the resources support, self evaluations, physical health and so on.

28
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,650
So that all essentially balances each other, doesn't balance each other for employee well-being.

29
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,990
This isn't a real image from an intervention. These are a good show.

30
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:46,740
That's a good shirt. So common secondary prevention interventions in the workplace are targeted at stress reduction, mindfulness and mental health,

31
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:57,660
or reduction of musculoskeletal disorders, pain and injury, and then targeted at weight loss, overall health, cardiovascular health and diabetes.

32
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,700
So I should have pulled this up and I was running around.

33
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,910
I will pull it up. But according to SHA,

34
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:14,670
one of three possible secondary intervention strategies are to either promote the early detection of treatment for mild to moderate symptoms.

35
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,370
Workplace health clinics are becoming fewer and far between these days, much less common.

36
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:27,749
The most common thing you'll see is potentially like a mobile unit or like a portable unit.

37
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,660
Like, you know, when you have those classrooms as a kid where it's essentially like a classroom on wheels.

38
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:41,760
So they might do a clinic on site at like construction or manufacturing, but that's not necessarily to deal with any long term issues.

39
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,540
It's to triage immediate injury and provide first aid.

40
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:54,060
And then ideally, we target those with risk factors for chronic pain or prolonged disability and then accommodate those with limited functioning.

41
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,810
So let me pull this up. I can see if I can find it right away.

42
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:29,460
They took the Honda one down. But let's watch this one from few Japanese companies in Malaysia.

43
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,950
Ooh. Okay. Do we want to try our hand with this one or this one?

44
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,319
The warehouse. Okay.

45
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,070
This one looks fine here. Okay, let's. Let's see them in their closed space.

46
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,520
Okay. Huh?

47
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:58,220
I mean, you know what it is like that you're like specific and light and welcome about your personality.

48
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,710
You know, like, I mean, young, you know.

49
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,400
Hee hee hee.

50
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:16,020
Hondo. Yes. Yes.

51
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:21,490
If. Oh, look, each.

52
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,490
Each. Oh.

53
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,630
Little mossy. My size is. Yes. Little appears to be.

54
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,470
I am running. It's.

55
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:46,600
And I know you're going to need volume in your.

56
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,570
She. Let's face it.

57
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:03,120
Did you? Oh.

58
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,090
It's. Oh, no.

59
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,880
I understand. You might get us young New York in this evening.

60
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:21,290
Almost three. Six.

61
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:34,770
Correct. He also means it's the high street.

62
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:42,060
And this is. Each.

63
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,470
Oh, it's. It's. It's. It's.

64
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:58,560
He. They see the Gene Autry show, you know?

65
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,350
Six. It's. He.

66
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:20,310
I you're. So what do we think about that?

67
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,450
I think depending on the workplace culture, it could be really hard to implement here in the United States.

68
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,850
Why does it look silly? Yeah, I think a lot.

69
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:40,899
I mean, I think if you closed it, maybe more like I can try to imagine like a group of like electrical linemen trying to get them to do that.

70
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,430
And I think maybe culturally it probably would be. It takes some encouraging.

71
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:52,750
Yeah. So that was done over the radio and that at the Honda one, which I couldn't find any more.

72
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:59,709
They do it over the loudspeaker, but it's essentially a recording and they do it with not only the people who work on the manufacturing side,

73
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:05,860
but people who work on the office side. Everybody does the same stretches and I know it looks really silly,

74
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:12,519
but even like warming up the body a little bit like that can greatly reduce the incidence of musculoskeletal disorders.

75
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,329
And for people who are sedentary, people who are sedentary as well.

76
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:24,309
So it seems really silly. But once you get over the hump, I mean, it's like in high school, if you went to public school, right?

77
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,310
We had to do like, uh, physical exam.

78
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,719
Physical exams. Remember when you had to like stretch, feel free to stretch.

79
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,720
And they measured on that box to, like, how far you could push the thing.

80
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,469
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, not to put you on the spot. Yeah. But like in in parts of China.

81
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,670
Don't they do this in school? Yeah, all parts of China.

82
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:53,020
All parts of China. So you had to do this ever since elementary school until you go to college?

83
00:09:53,290 --> 00:10:04,240
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we would do that, uh, typically in the morning at ten and yeah, like after the first day of classes.

84
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,670
Yeah. Did you feel silly or everyone was doing something.

85
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:18,879
You liked it. I. Well, like we, we said for like two straight hours, straight hours, 2 hours in the morning.

86
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,920
And then I got a chance to stretch to stretch myself.

87
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:31,000
I feel comfortable. Do they still do recess? They're recess like here in the United States.

88
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,420
You go on the playground and you get to play basketball or go on.

89
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:38,800
Yeah. Recesses in the afternoon. Mm. Morning we did that.

90
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,930
Okay. Interesting. Yeah.

91
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,860
I'm not sure why that's not a more widespread implementation here.

92
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:56,140
Like even, I mean really should be, I mean, you know, in K through 12, I mean kindergarten through sixth grade, you have recess and that's it.

93
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:02,860
And then middle school and high school, you start to get into P.E. but that's like how fast can you run the mile?

94
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,549
Basically, like every couple days too.

95
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:13,960
It's not like an everyday thing. Yeah. Yeah. So we really don't I wouldn't say we, we don't have a comparable practice, but.

96
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:21,879
Okay. This line. So in this Qaa study, they looked at the risk factor domain.

97
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:33,010
So if somebody, for example, has ergonomic or bio mechanical risks like physical load or they're doing frequent bending and twisting or keyboard use,

98
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:38,170
for example, I mentioned I now have carpal tunnel and I have to wear a sleeve at night.

99
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:44,409
Right. So even someone with an office job like myself, what are your work organization and psychosocial factors?

100
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:51,220
So stress and monotonous work and then individual factors like fitness, pain avoidance, beliefs.

101
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:59,020
So if we're targeting the ergonomic and biomechanical, you want to reduce ergonomic exposures among symptomatic workers.

102
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:06,190
And then if it's the organization, we're going to try to address the organizational barriers and get accommodations.

103
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,960
And then if it is the individual problems, we're going to work on coping strategies.

104
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:18,160
So workplace strategies is engineering controls, administrative controls, modified duty, physical conditioning.

105
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:26,680
So like in the L.L.Bean case study had during total worker health, they did the cardiovascular hardening, right?

106
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:33,370
But they also got mechanical presses to help with the using of materials.

107
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,399
So they didn't have to do that on manually pallet lifts.

108
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:44,170
For example, in a few weeks, when Cheryl Uihlein comes to do the ergonomics lecture, she's actually a certified ergonomic.

109
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:49,450
So she has a like a lot of cool pictures and video clips that will go through to see

110
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:58,210
different examples of Have any of you ever been placed on modified duty before?

111
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:11,549
I my mom was a nurse at isn't was still is a nurse in a nursing home and she did hurt her hip at one facility and had to be placed on modified duty.

112
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:18,660
So she wasn't allowed to lift patients for a certain period of time while she was going through her physical therapy.

113
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:24,030
So they had her do like more easy tasks, like feeding the patients, for example.

114
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:29,220
She didn't have to bathe them or change them or clean them or anything like that.

115
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,990
Just because she was injured and they didn't want to aggravate that again or even modify duty for myself.

116
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:42,059
For example, when I had neurosurgery back in 2013, at that time,

117
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:48,000
I was working at a math learning center and I was coming back to work finally after two months.

118
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,430
And I was just like, so tired, so tired.

119
00:13:52,440 --> 00:14:00,509
So my boss was super nice. And so for the first few weeks, I didn't have to work my full normal like five or six hour shift.

120
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,960
I just come in 1 to 2 hours at a time to ease into it.

121
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:11,010
I didn't teach any of the students. I just worked in the back, like organizing their binders and stuff like that.

122
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:19,980
And I was tired already, but we slowly reintroduced me back into that, which was really nice and I didn't lose my job.

123
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,140
You're not supposed to fire someone when they have a health condition, but it totally happens.

124
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:35,940
Now, stress management for employees. As University of Michigan as an example, we have something called the Healthy Thrive program.

125
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,790
So this is mental and emotional wellness courses and then stress management training for individuals.

126
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:49,290
They also from Michigan Medicine offered headspace for free for every employee during 2020, but they took it away.

127
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:59,790
And then we have resources on stress reduction meditation and of course there is massive online open courses which are called MOOCs that you can take.

128
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:05,250
We have ERP, confidential online screening for diagnosis of anxiety and depression.

129
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:11,069
Commitment to reasonable workload depends on what unit you work in.

130
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,299
But I didn't realize until recently not only do we have EAP,

131
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:23,910
but we have a faculty affairs counseling office where you can talk to a licensed clinical

132
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:30,630
social worker therapist that has another licensure for free for as many sessions as you want,

133
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:37,860
which is pretty cool. I didn't know about that until I talked to a professor and AP who was like, Did you know we have this?

134
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,790
And I was like, I did it now. And so she recommended me talk to somebody.

135
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:50,040
I have my own therapist, but my therapist doesn't. She's wonderful but doesn't necessarily understand what it's like to work in academia.

136
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,469
So I needed to talk to somebody who is an act, who is embedded within academia.

137
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,690
And she was very she was very nice.

138
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:06,150
So but I will say not all workplaces or not even all universities have these cushy resources and people use them to various extents.

139
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:15,569
Like I've tried some of the like videos on stress reduction or like how to manage your time better or whatever.

140
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:24,750
And I found it minimally useful now for us as a group.

141
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:31,740
So what is a secondary prevention method for stress that you think could be implemented that wasn't listed?

142
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,730
Any thoughts? It can be from any of the domains.

143
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,150
Or it doesn't have to be anything new. I just saw an example.

144
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:08,590
Something like. Like couples counseling.

145
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,920
Does that count? Yeah, that counts.

146
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:18,010
I'm thinking, like. And like the third category like.

147
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:27,580
Improving or like coaching, I guess maybe for like couples, couples coaching or couples therapy.

148
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:32,020
So you're thinking more like in the work family conflict domain? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

149
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,139
That is a great one. I wish they offered that.

150
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:44,800
More interestingly, the way things are structured here in the United States, couples counseling is generally not covered by insurance.

151
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,280
Would you say? Is that [INAUDIBLE]? Individual counseling is. Well, you would know, Joe, because he used to be in that world.

152
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:58,600
Yeah. I mean, a couple of couples, therapists stressed. Code it incorrectly and how to connect insurance products.

153
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:07,450
Yeah. So the way they call it, the way they commit insurance fraud is that you bill it to a primary individual client

154
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:13,030
and that the second person in the couple is invited as a guest to that session.

155
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:22,360
Otherwise, most couples explicit couples counseling sessions are like 120, 150 bucks, $200 a session.

156
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:29,200
So you can see why people might not seek it out. Another thing that generally isn't covered.

157
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,040
Covered. You mentioned coaching. A lot of people do professional coaching.

158
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,560
I myself have not done professional coaching,

159
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:42,620
but I've met many of academia folks who do professional coaching on how to like present themselves better.

160
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:49,510
They're generally tend to be in like leadership roles. So like how to present themselves better, how to market themselves better, better.

161
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:53,890
Elevator speech better. Like talking with donors and like.

162
00:18:54,610 --> 00:19:03,900
Achieving like. Work life balance or something to that extent that's generally not covered by insurance either.

163
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:13,530
Something within the realm of engineering controls that Sheryl will talk about, and I think I briefly mentioned, is the use of exoskeletons,

164
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:21,570
which are essentially like mechanical skeletons that you put on yourself that either entirely do the task for

165
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:29,790
you or it increases your bodily strength so you don't have to exert as much effort doing it like a robotic arm,

166
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:38,130
for example. So this one is from William and Wolf over and over and over.

167
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:45,389
So if they're looking at the secondary intervention model, what they're trying to target here is the external stressor,

168
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:53,670
which is impacted by internal beliefs, perceptions, appraisals and expectations, and that can either lead to stress or distress.

169
00:19:54,630 --> 00:20:01,410
Stress being in the positive connotation here and then distress being the negative connotation.

170
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:07,800
So you can either avoid the stress or change or influence the stress or change the response to the stressor.

171
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:15,400
So if we look at another study, this is the office work and stretch training overview.

172
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:27,640
So the goal of this study in particular was to do two scratching exercises for workers with musculoskeletal disorder, focusing on trunk extension.

173
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,880
So the trunk is is this this part of your back here?

174
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:40,960
And what they used was something called the five business device, or which you'll see in a second with the five business devices.

175
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:51,370
But this trial here was 250 office workers, generally pretty sedentary, using this device for two times a week for three months.

176
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:57,460
And the control group was 100 office workers who didn't have the five business training device.

177
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:02,350
And they evaluated this over four months.

178
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,299
So what they used for evaluation was the short form 36.

179
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:16,120
So this is a questionnaire on general health status as well as quality of life that takes into physical and psychosocial factors.

180
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,649
And then they used the Nordic questionnaire to evaluate complaints of musculoskeletal

181
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:26,770
systems and then range of motion measures using an in kilometer and a tape measure.

182
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,550
How many of you in here have taken the ergonomics course?

183
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,950
Okay. So an incline amateur, basically, and a tape measure.

184
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,710
It's very similar to another device that we have called the Goldie ometer.

185
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,799
So they'll remember, like in geometry,

186
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:56,530
you had your little semicircle and then it was like zero degrees to 180 degrees going out here essentially as that for a person.

187
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:05,200
So I've done that before where I was doing a study to assess ergonomics at the school gym,

188
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,590
not this school gym, but the university gym employees and when they push laundry cart.

189
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:23,649
So essentially I had to take this ruler and ask them to like perform their normal range of motion and then put on their head like the measurement.

190
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:27,400
And it would say, like their head is bent like 15 degrees or 20 degrees.

191
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,250
And then there's scales that you fill out to determine how much ergonomic, excess,

192
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,480
ergonomic force they're exerting on themselves and what they necessarily need to correct.

193
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:44,500
So what that study in particular, essentially these laundry carts were positioned too low.

194
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,070
So they were doing too much neck bending and trunk extension.

195
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:58,270
So the recommendation was either to get handles that lifted so they didn't have to bend down or then put a cart on the platform.

196
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:07,420
Simple, very simple stuff. So this is the five business device that they gave to 250 office workers.

197
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:18,040
And the black rolls were there and they were adjustable to fit in terms of individual size and flexibility and the skill of the user.

198
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,940
And what does this look like? So it's German.

199
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:32,680
And of course, this is a stretching program modeled after a German concept that is static, passive stretching devices on this wooden device here.

200
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:39,640
And what it does is it targets your chest is ISO hip and then lateral movements.

201
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:44,170
So these these are much smaller before that.

202
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,310
Oh, oh, you thought it was much smaller? I was thinking something that you could hold in your hands at first.

203
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,660
Really? So what about it?

204
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:56,900
Oh, wow. I mean, what would we do if we're just holding your hand?

205
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:01,720
You know, sort of stretching? Yeah, I still get a sense of scale.

206
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:09,180
Okay. Okay. All right. So, yeah, these are the five business exercises.

207
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:16,960
So essentially, yeah, this is huge. Imagine being given one of these in a clinical trial and they're like, You could hit that home.

208
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:21,760
You would leave it in the office. But imagine getting this in after the study.

209
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,830
They're like, You can keep it. I probably use it to like dry laundry on or something like that.

210
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:32,170
But so, you know, first you're doing your you know, you're doing your lower back stretches.

211
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:40,540
The second one is aimed at stretching out your trunk. And then here you put your feet on the platform and then forward.

212
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:48,640
And then you're they're targeting skill, lateral hip flexors and then your lateral movements in the last one.

213
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:57,820
So just to recall, to know. So just to recall, they're doing this two times a week for three months.

214
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:03,110
How many of you be willing to try this? Oh, yeah. Yeah.

215
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:07,720
Okay. For free. You want to get in a.

216
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:12,870
It's free and it's not free. I'd have to look to try that.

217
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,640
I was in a side.

218
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:28,670
I got this email today and I saw Doctor Lopez and he got it to you because he tweeted about and I replied back to this tweet, very interesting.

219
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:33,000
I got this study survey solicitation from Michigan State.

220
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:41,670
And how his email was phrased was they wanted to determine the level of envy and

221
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:46,540
jealousy that assisted professors feel for one another towards one another.

222
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:52,710
And mine just said it was a study on work stressors for assistant professors.

223
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:57,930
So I don't know which of us is in the control group.

224
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:02,670
And the other one is not right because we got very different email solicitations.

225
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:07,500
I filled it out because I believe I was one of them getting I believe in good survey karma.

226
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:13,800
I fill out your survey now scratch my back, scratch my back later write somebody in the future will do my survey.

227
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,450
And it was, it wasn't a poorly written survey, but it was quite lengthy.

228
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:31,740
Qualtrics where it was strongly disagree to strongly agree, which I did not like the way that scale was put because it was left to right.

229
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:39,330
Strongly disagree, to strongly agree where most people read the other way, strongly agree to strongly disagree.

230
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:51,270
And then they put everything vertically on three giant consecutive tables and the statements were like groups.

231
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:55,469
There were questions about the stress I feel at work.

232
00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:03,060
There were a lot of questions about my perceptions of how my department chair treats me and then how my department treats me.

233
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,799
Anonymous on how the doctor looked not MSU.

234
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,040
So I'm like, they're not going to do they're not going to like send them back here.

235
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,339
I was actually referring to the email. Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

236
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:20,999
It's a recruitment. Well that's good. And well I had what it said an opportunity to get a $60 gift card.

237
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,090
So I did so.

238
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,950
And then they specifically asked at the end before the demographic information in the last 12 months,

239
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:36,780
how many publications have you had, how many presentations have you had?

240
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:46,319
How many students have you mentored? I'd like these general metrics that were graded on and then they and then they did ask about like to what extent

241
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,899
does your back like does your university place your value as a person on how much external funding you get,

242
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:58,070
which they totally do you here. So I will be interested to see what the outcome is of this study.

243
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:04,440
Probably won't be published for this cross-sectional, but they probably won't be published for another year or so.

244
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,549
But it's interesting,

245
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:14,640
they're targeting assistant professors and I don't know how maybe they just like Google's a repository of every assistant professor.

246
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:20,620
I don't know if it's Michigan only rate or it's only like assistant professors of color.

247
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:28,030
Dr. Lopez and I got one. I don't know we'll see how the curious you know the school or department and in see

248
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:33,569
it was let me look it up just curious if it was more medical or because I mean,

249
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:38,390
we have a there is a public health department, but it's not like an accredited school.

250
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,940
So I'm curious. Yeah, there's a AP department.

251
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:47,220
Oh, sorry. Doctor Lopez's said pride and envy of her colleagues.

252
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,010
And then his reply was, But anyway,

253
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:56,400
we got to find the person who thinks we're jealous of them and not perfectly happy in our own little teaching and writing world.

254
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:04,920
Because I'm fine, y'all. Thank you. He Doctor Dr. Lopez has a very fun Twitter account if you follow him.

255
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:10,260
He did. He he got national recognition actually after the Met gala where he was comparing

256
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:17,160
people's Met gala outfits to public health textbooks based on the color scheme.

257
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,120
But let me look really fast audited. What department is that?

258
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,520
No, I was too. Did you?

259
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:29,900
That's not a Hollywood cluster, but you know.

260
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:38,470
That's not it. I get so many e-mails. Oh.

261
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:49,030
Uh huh. I didn't say charger, but who knows?

262
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:55,760
I would assume psychology or something like that. Yeah. So back to this five business machine.

263
00:29:56,270 --> 00:30:06,290
This combined elements of yoga, Mackenzie Fundamentals, Myers Myofascial pathways for highly torso oriented, standardized stretching.

264
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:11,180
And the nice thing about the five business machine is it can be used in heterogeneous groups.

265
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:14,270
So in terms of physical proportions and capability.

266
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:19,970
So hypothetically, a six foot person and a five foot person can adjust the machine to use the same machine.

267
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:32,190
So what this did result in is a reduction in pain in the trained areas, greater mobility and less perceived exertion.

268
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:41,670
The intervention group also received instructions and ergonomics sitting in conjunction to these stretches.

269
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,560
How many of you have been consulted before an ergonomic sitting?

270
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:53,070
Okay. None of these chairs are adjustable, so they are not ergonomic sitting for you.

271
00:30:53,700 --> 00:31:04,320
But generally when you're sitting, you should be able to you have your the top of your thighs parallel to the ground and your feet flat on the floor.

272
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:08,220
So, like Sam, for example, you're too tall for this chair.

273
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:12,660
Yes. And then your elbow should be resting gently on this.

274
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:20,370
And then generally, your keyboard is actually anywhere between 5 to 15 degrees lower than your eye level.

275
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:24,809
So you're. I pad, for example, Bridget is way lower than that.

276
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:29,680
So you're doing some unnecessary neck bending as well.

277
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:35,940
And then I actually had an ergonomics come and assess my office and it was like way off.

278
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:44,729
Desks are generally positioned too high, so they're generally only supposed to be 26 inches off of the ground.

279
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:50,880
So she lowered my desk, actually fixed my chair, put my monitors.

280
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,990
She was like, Do you want to wait and buy razors? Like monitor razors?

281
00:31:54,990 --> 00:32:01,200
It's always like, no. So she just plucked two textbooks off of my shelves to even it out.

282
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:08,639
So one, two textbooks I don't use, which is occupational lore and then interactive bias statistics are the other one.

283
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:14,330
But for my keyboard, I actually have the split keyboard, which I know some people don't like.

284
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,580
It's it's a curved keyboard, it's more ergonomically friendly.

285
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:22,170
Only took a day to adjust to, I swear. But this one I'm.

286
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,220
This one in particular is not ergonomically friendly and neither is this mouse.

287
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:34,010
I use a vertical mouse, which you click like this rather than like this, like a cloth.

288
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:41,300
And I would say most of my carpal tunnel issues have come from actually just holding my phone too much.

289
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,599
But I try the pops, I have the popsocket.

290
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:50,420
I did the ring thing for a while that actually made things worse so that by now I've actually purposefully tried like,

291
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,820
I mean, I'm a scary reason, but like the phone computer connection thing is that you can type.

292
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:59,510
Oh, no. Cause, I mean, I know Microsoft effects Apple.

293
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:03,229
Does that feel similar by text? Oh, yeah, I know.

294
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:09,050
If you have a mac to Matt, if you have an iPhone in a MacBook Microsoft, don't know that they do.

295
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:12,950
Yeah. Yeah, it's called the way back.

296
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:16,820
It's like an official line. But you have to have an android, right? I mean, you can.

297
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:23,120
I think they should focus now. Yeah. Or just like you're connecting to the iPhone, I think.

298
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:27,440
Yeah. Through I never I don't have an apple but I mean,

299
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:34,490
they might be just connected to our family text on my iPod and on my laptop and then if it's really cool, do you have a MacBook?

300
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:38,910
Yeah, if I have my like computer in my iPod next to each other, I can take them out.

301
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,320
My computer and my phone.

302
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,180
It's called Microsoft Phone. Like worth a shot and stuff.

303
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,790
Yeah, but do you have an iPhone or do you have an iPhone?

304
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:58,360
But I have a PC. Yeah. I mean, you must like also you should be okay for Microsoft, at least for terms of like checking notifications.

305
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:07,969
They're like when text will pop up and stuff. This will be so useful for me during departmental meetings because Dr. Neitzel has a mac and an iPhone,

306
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:15,530
so he's able to text me from his laptop because we're usually like talking this during the faculty meeting.

307
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,090
But people could tell I'm texting because I have to be my phone number students during class.

308
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:24,180
I know, I know that sound. We have been working hard.

309
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,430
We feel like many people would say that. I don't care.

310
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:37,370
I have mainly one main friend and she is seemingly always on her phone, always and still managing to get her PhD.

311
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:44,540
I have my phone. I do not disturb mode all the time. Even no one, no one can call me.

312
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:50,450
And they were like, What if someone's in emergency? And I was like, They'll leave a voicemail, but my mom is allowed to call three times in.

313
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:54,560
Oh, yeah, it'll go through. Yeah, yeah, exactly.

314
00:34:55,370 --> 00:35:05,659
But I will say now I'm starting to do voice dictation to ease the musculoskeletal pain in my hand.

315
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:11,030
I recently got a waste leash for the dog that I watch.

316
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:16,040
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Because there's always that new.

317
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:21,680
Yeah, yeah. So it wraps around my waist and then she's connected to me and my hands are

318
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,520
free because she likes that you can text and walk the dog at the same time.

319
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:31,700
I could. It's mostly, well, now I have to hold a lantern when it's dark so I can see where her pupils are.

320
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,630
You have to get her an allergy leash and lead harness.

321
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:41,540
Okay. Okay. This is where it's at. I dog sit her, so I'm like, how much money do I want to drop on this cat?

322
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:45,560
That's not mine, but it'd be super nice. What's that? Headlines are super nice.

323
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,800
Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. It can't be about, like, your head.

324
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:55,460
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because I, because she, she pulls when she sees something she really wants to smell.

325
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,830
It's hurting my hand. Um, it's really easy to give an MSP.

326
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:09,620
That's what I will say. Very easy. The whole first year that I worked here, nobody told me I could bring a university issue device home.

327
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:16,969
So this entire. The entire first year of my tenure track, I made nine credit hours worth of curriculum submitted for grants and,

328
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:24,680
like, worked out a bunch of papers all on my laptop. And I finally only got a docking station this last year and I was like,

329
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:31,129
I am an idiot because I could have spent $120 last year and not done this to my body.

330
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:34,490
But here we are living there now.

331
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:43,850
And so those who had the five business did stretch, at least those who stretch more than two times a week.

332
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:47,780
Those who stretch at least three times a week did notice a greater improvement.

333
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:54,170
But they haven't assessed really the long term motivation of the employees, and they need to look at it in a larger sample.

334
00:36:54,860 --> 00:37:02,540
Now, Sullivan did a Canadian study looking at whether secondary intervention targeting

335
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:07,880
psychosocial risk factors could reduce work related musculoskeletal disorders.

336
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:24,610
So. They targeted four areas of modifiable psychosocial variables, fear of movement and re injury, catastrophizing, perceived disability, depression.

337
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:27,220
And they used the McGill pain questionnaire.

338
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:37,240
So in terms of psychosocial variables, when you're thinking about musculoskeletal disorders, depending on how traumatic it is for the individual,

339
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:44,770
people literally may psych themselves out and be too scared to redo that same task or

340
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:51,190
that same movement again in fear of injuring themselves or aggravating the issue.

341
00:37:52,480 --> 00:38:01,540
One thing that the studies have shown in particular musculoskeletal is orders are not only just debilitating in terms of like the physical pain,

342
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:10,260
but also the economic implications. But people can become horribly depressed from it just because, A,

343
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:16,390
whether or not you have short term or long term disability or you're trying to file a worker's compensation claim,

344
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:27,940
or you're going through P.T. being able to have full movement to limited or restricted movement alters your day to day life significantly.

345
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:35,570
So folks do get severely depressed if they do encourage some kind of disability.

346
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:39,220
Not to say that everybody does, but that is very tender, right? Yes.

347
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:43,240
Yeah. Just just like. Yeah, all of those things.

348
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:51,020
All of those things. Like half of my issue with like they maybe not have certain.

349
00:38:51,340 --> 00:39:01,060
My issue with walking right now is me being so anxious about falling because that way like with.

350
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:10,530
Not proper assistive devices. And I felt like my entire legs were scratched up and I got two concussions and there's a hot mess and.

351
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:18,690
Now, are you only doing it now within the context of, like, supervised O.T.?

352
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:25,410
Yeah. Yeah, well, I can. I walk short distances with a walker.

353
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:31,260
Okay. But I. When I say short distances, I mean, like, from that door to there.

354
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,720
That's where it's from. Me. That's my bathroom. Yeah.

355
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:38,820
Yeah. Yeah. Catastrophizing as well.

356
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:43,220
Like worst case scenario, right? I definitely tent on the catastrophizing set.

357
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:47,070
So like I mentioned, I had neurosurgery back in 2013, hind brain.

358
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:52,980
They did a crazy activity, which means they took out a piece of my skull somewhere.

359
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:58,170
It didn't tell me where that would have been. Really useful information. Feel it.

360
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:02,370
Do not have like I have a scar. Ah, like a pretty chunky scar back there.

361
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:10,110
So it's kind of like that keloids over it. Thank goodness I have hair because I also know now my head is not symmetrical,

362
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:18,120
so I could never do like a Steve Harvey look if I wanted to because it's lumpy.

363
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:23,490
But I have this fear and have had this fear and still have this fear to this day.

364
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:35,720
Number one, I am fine going up stairs, but walking down stairs I go very slowly and I have to hold the rail.

365
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:39,810
So like if I'm hiking or something like that and we have to go down,

366
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:49,230
I have I go very slow or I get on my butt and I will like crawled out because my greatest fear is falling and then hitting the back of my head.

367
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,899
And also here in the winter time, like ice or something,

368
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:02,130
black ice or just like falling and eating it and then like hitting my head on the cement, telling me to wear a helmet on your way to work.

369
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:07,560
So you biked. There you go. So what if people could see me, like, visibly walking?

370
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,910
Like, that's their problem? Okay, yeah, that's okay.

371
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:16,860
I mean, people ski and the class doctor is only speed in its class.

372
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,990
It's my moneymaker. Right. Also have those inflatable toddler helmets.

373
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,879
So they wrap in bubble wrap? Yeah, they're they're literally like net propellers.

374
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,780
And so they can tell like your acceleration or or some of the changes that pop up.

375
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:35,489
They're really cool. I don't want I don't want to be known as that weird professor.

376
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:40,060
That's like, why is she wearing arm, arm floaties and, like, a hard Brexit?

377
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:46,700
No one pads. She's missing a piece of her skull, that's why.

378
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,790
Shut up. That's true. If anyone else will understand, there's probably no.

379
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:56,999
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know that model for us. Yeah, I don't know what the optics are of, but yes, I definitely catastrophize in that sense.

380
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,350
So think about somebody who I don't know works in construction and they had a fall greater than six feet.

381
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:12,300
Right. The post-traumatic stress disorder also from having to go back and there again potentially.

382
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:23,430
So this study targeted 115 workers who had worker's compensation claims and they had been out of work for more than two years.

383
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,969
So the mean age for this group was only 42.

384
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:34,740
So predict still pretty young I would say. And then the mean duration that they had off of work before they filed their

385
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:40,260
worker's comp claim and they fell out of work entirely was almost half a year.

386
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:45,540
So the main primary goal of this outcome was return to work.

387
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:51,089
So what they did was they had a caseworker referral program to get into an intervention.

388
00:42:51,090 --> 00:43:00,890
So the it consisted of them watching an informational video, they had a client workbook and they met weekly for ten weeks as a group,

389
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:10,500
kind of like if you think like a Alcoholics Anonymous situation or even group diabetes prevention programs, they hold it, you know, like the YMCA.

390
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,240
And they also had psychologists as part of the intervention.

391
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:24,240
So the findings of this did indeed validate that musculoskeletal disorders go beyond physical health measures.

392
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:32,849
And anybody who had a fear of movement and a fear of re injury had elevated risk factors for

393
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:40,919
poor treatment outcomes because they were less willing to engage with the intervention,

394
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:47,010
which is understandable. So I think that one of the strengths of this study is they actually had psychologists as part of the

395
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:53,610
intervention because seldom do they have psychologists as part of the intervention and reduced pain.

396
00:43:53,610 --> 00:44:01,019
Catastrophizing is a predictor of return to work, so the less and less someone catastrophize the extent of their pain,

397
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,110
the more likely they were to return to the work place.

398
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:10,080
Yeah, and I was going to.

399
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,100
That's all I had for. Slide, but we can move on.

400
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:20,909
I'll say the fear of injury is really interesting because I worked with some carpenters in high school and like all of them were like 50,

401
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:24,090
40 year old dudes who like work their body really hard. For most of our lives,

402
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:30,540
we've had a lot of public disorders and like I knew a couple who had either been injured or gone back to work several times, stuff like that.

403
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:34,949
And like I told that they would injure themselves trying to get back to work just

404
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:38,470
because like that kind of puts their bodies their whole life and kind of like that

405
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:42,690
kind of like white dude mentality of like guys got to work harder kind of thing and

406
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:46,979
like this just really interesting the dynamic of like they've always been healthy.

407
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:53,100
There was no pushing harder and then like, reaching that brick wall of their injury is interesting.

408
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:58,110
Mm hmm. So I just want to take this time.

409
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:08,700
I talked too fast today, but I'm not going to dismiss you yet, so I want to take this time just to revisit, like, where we're going to finish going.

410
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:15,600
So like I said, next week we're doing cardiovascular exposure is no class that day that we're moving into ergonomics.

411
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:23,129
And then we'll talk about training the trainer, Thanksgiving break, talk about public health evaluation,

412
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:29,280
and then within the context of psychosocial factors, you have your research project, poster and presentation.

413
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:33,930
And then that basically that's like the end of class. Isn't that wild?

414
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:41,220
So I think what I would like to take this time to do, based on your feedback from Tuesday,

415
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:48,540
is that a lot of you downloaded that my feedback, but haven't had a chance to look at it yet for my serve on the survey.

416
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,430
How many of you have looked at at this point? Oh, okay. You looked at it as that's okay.

417
00:45:55,080 --> 00:46:06,659
What I would like to do, what I would like you to do is give your peers a chance to give you feedback on your survey because you've had your three,

418
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:12,270
3 to 4 cognitive interviews. Now, those are those are laypersons, right?

419
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,220
With no lens on survey methodology.

420
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:25,349
Then you've had my eyes on it now, which I critique various things and provided you constructive feedback think can be helpful exercise

421
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:32,190
to have your peers U.S. peers swap and look at each others instrument to get additional feedback.

422
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:40,260
So I'll actually come over and talk to you, Joe. But do you have your laptop to you right now?

423
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:50,550
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Sorry, I have your assignment on this computer, so let me pause the recording.
