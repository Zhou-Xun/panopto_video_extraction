Building on our discussion of bias, we'll
introduce the concepts of correlation and

3
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:11,840
causation.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,570
Correlation is the degree to which two
variables or quantities are related.

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,130
An illustration of correlation and
causation is shown by a 2012

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:26,490
New England Journal of Medicine paper
which said that chocolate consumption

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,430
was associated or correlated with
the number of Nobel laureates.

8
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,170
So should I go grab that vase of M&Ms and
eat them all hoping that that chocolate

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,710
consumption will lead me
to be a Nobel laureate?

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,940
Probably not, as shown on this graph of
chocolate consumption on the X axis and

11
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,800
the number of Nobel laureates on the Y
axis, there's a positive correlation.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,060
But it's just a correlation
not something of a causation.

13
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:57,330
There are many other factors like
socioeconomic status, number of

14
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,940
years of education, affluence, etc., which
are likely to associated with both how

15
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,820
much chocolate you consume and how many
Nobel Prizes would be in that country.

16
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,250
There are many websites dedicated to
these funny things about correlation and

17
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,260
causation where there's a correlation,

18
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,320
and it would be absolutely
ridiculous to think about causation.

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,490
So correlation is an association
between variables.

20
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,190
And an association does not necessarily
mean that one causes the other.

21
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,140
So when you're critically
evaluating a public health study,

22
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,960
think about, are these things associated?

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,180
Does one actually cause the other?

24
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,681
Is causation really
something that's valid here?
