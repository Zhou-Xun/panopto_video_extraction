1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:10,130
Well, okay.

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:19,030
So we're making our way through the middle part of the course.

3
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,320
Today, we'll be talking about some genetic associations with these.

4
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:34,550
We'll we'll go over, like the end of the road. Lots of prerecorded lectures to go over, so we'll go over them.

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,860
Any questions? Go for the quiz, and then you should have time to work on some of that.

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:47,140
More than should be the last problems that we will have ulcers.

7
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:53,050
They probably for you to work on it. And then I think we're done with the quizzes.

8
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,400
Obviously, today should have been your last quiz.

9
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,260
Oh, okay. And then.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,709
So today will be genetic association studies. And then next week we will have Wendy, who is a genetic counselor, come talk to us.

11
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,600
She will be here Tuesday of next week and then the following Tuesday.

12
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,239
And then Thursday we'll have Stephen, who's done a lot of work on new genes and ethics.

13
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:29,120
So I think it'll be interesting for you to hear them talk if you can make it in class.

14
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,409
We attend in person so you can ask questions and then I did post the exam.

15
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:47,630
And so when this lecture will be on Tuesday, our second lecture and then exam exam two will be accessible on Thursday of next week.

16
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:59,450
The following week I did post the study guide for exam to update it as like depending of the guest lectures,

17
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,250
change the material like what they present. I'll update the study guide.

18
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:14,140
Kind of keep you on track of what you need to know. Yeah, that's kind of like our plan for the next couple of weeks or so.

19
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:23,920
Any questions? Is his name to you, just like based off the screening stuff or is it going to be unit one as well?

20
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:31,899
No, it's not comprehensive. So it's going to be things that we talked about after Exam one except this part today.

21
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,870
The Genetic Association study is just that. It's not it kind of fits better here, but we had to move it up.

22
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,170
So so it has to fit like the guest lecture schedule.

23
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,989
So. So the genetic associations is not covered in part in this exam, too.

24
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:55,870
It's actually part of exam three. Okay. But yeah, the exam, the guide, like, really outlines what you need to know each week.

25
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,350
Okay. And then for the problem set that we will start today, I believe you do have time.

26
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,470
Like after exam two to submit it so that yeah.

27
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,970
It's not due till November 17 so we can kind of touch upon it if you forgot or it's been a while, so long,

28
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:24,620
so whatever you do and get it over with or you want to kind of keep coming back to it as we get closer to exams, that's fine.

29
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:33,470
Any other questions and exam to as I am, I mentioned them.

30
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:40,430
But just so you guys are still aware, it's multiple choice.

31
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:48,530
It's on campus. There's some open ended questions to 86, open ended questions its time.

32
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,919
So it's 2 hours once you start the exam.

33
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,720
It's it's not it's not a word document that you work on it's actually on canvas and.

34
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,140
The questions. Okay.

35
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,220
So. So today we'll start with.

36
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:23,680
We go over to association studies. I think this is interesting because it kind of like out of all the topics we talked about,

37
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,110
it's it's this is kind of the closest to what we actually do.

38
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:40,540
Like in our research lab, I work with Jen Smith and this is kind of what we do in real life kind of genetics data, study analysis.

39
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,270
So we, we, we're,

40
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:56,649
we're kind of setting up a study that we're looking at genetic markers and that's kind of our exposure to think about that typical spans.

41
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,070
And then the phenotype is like the outcome or the trait that we're interested in.

42
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:13,750
And then as we will touch upon like other, other omics later towards the end of the semester, like epigenome and Transcriptome.

43
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:23,650
But today we will mostly focus on the association between the genes or the snips or the labels and traits of interest.

44
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,140
So it's kind of like the the lingo if you want.

45
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:34,170
Like when I say exposure or marker or genetic marker or genotype.

46
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:42,600
So this is like our predictor. We choose it so that it varies between individuals and groups.

47
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:48,590
It can be simply a single nucleotide polymorphisms can be a copy number, variant haplotype.

48
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:57,250
It could be a number of different thing as long as it varies. And then the phenotype is the measurable trait that we're interested in.

49
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:07,180
So and we think of those as either quantitative and qualitative, so quantitative as in kind of like high blood pressure.

50
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:14,380
So it's like a continuous measures. It's you have a, like a full range of values that you're looking at.

51
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,959
Qualitative is more of like a dichotomous or yes.

52
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,070
No question. Like heart disease. Yes. No. Cancer?

53
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:30,740
Yes. No. So. So this is kind of like the grouping of the phenotypes that we that we will find.

54
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,950
Well, it's it's just some historical context.

55
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:45,160
And it's it's kind of important to know that with these with these traits, we're thinking that they are influenced by multiple genes.

56
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,660
So I think this is a kind of good example from the recording,

57
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:58,240
like the more locus or loci you have involved and the more phenotypes you kind of observe.

58
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:03,370
So if you have like one locus affecting what you observe, you would just kind of have three options.

59
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:09,400
And the more loci are number of the kind of the full distribution that you observe here.

60
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:20,350
So, so for these for these traits that we look like height, for example, it's not influenced by one gene or one is influenced by many.

61
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,750
So if you look, I think this one shows like if you look across the genome,

62
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:35,080
there's actually an associated site at all, all chromosomes that has been found to be associated with height.

63
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:44,320
So it's highly polygenic trait. And as add to that, like having a polygenic trait, you also have the environmental effects.

64
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:54,970
So, so looking at like the distribution of or the means of height for a number of people,

65
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,330
we're in a situation where you have adequate nutrition, you would have a higher mean height.

66
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:07,390
And then if you have like a famine kind of situation or lack of adequate nutrition,

67
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:14,710
you have kind of a shift towards shorter people or less or lower height.

68
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,830
So these are kind of things to keep in mind as you think about those trades.

69
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:33,240
So this kind of sets the the background of what will be the next the following, the following slides, any questions on that or any comments?

70
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:52,430
Okay. So.

71
00:08:53,070 --> 00:09:00,230
So as we kind of think about association studies, this QM framework is really helpful.

72
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:08,060
Like it's it's helpful as we design studies, as we write like research grants or as we even write papers.

73
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:17,870
It's kind of important to think about as you read papers. So problems that for you will have an option of divorce papers to look at.

74
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:25,130
So it's kind of important to have that framework as you review those studies.

75
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:34,060
So even though it sounds simple, but it's often kind of hard to align those those kind of five points.

76
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:43,549
So having your research question clear and kind of specific and have it and have a measure that is appropriate

77
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:50,450
to research question have a sampling technique that is also fits with the overall goal of your proposal,

78
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:55,490
applying the right statistics and then making the right inferences so multiple steps.

79
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:06,469
It can be hard to really stay on track as you're kind of working through your study or even from reading a study you can get lost of.

80
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,840
What's the main goal of your analysis is?

81
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:23,570
So a good research question should be specific in terms of identifying the population that you're looking at,

82
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:30,860
the phenotypes that you're interested in. And then what exactly are you looking at in the genome?

83
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:39,019
Are you looking at a specific region or are you looking across the genome or you want just the exons or exam chips?

84
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,080
So these are important things to specify.

85
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:49,730
And we have an example here that kind of a vague, open question and a good research question,

86
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:57,830
and it's really helpful to get the research question right because it helps you kind of develop the other parts of the of the of your research.

87
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:13,140
So for measures that could apply to the genetic polymorphisms or the exposure or the or predictors and the outcome for the phenotype.

88
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,640
Ideally, we want to have a measurement that is both reliable and valid.

89
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:32,230
So reliable in the sense that. If you repeat it over multiple times, you're still kind of getting the same measurements.

90
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:41,710
You don't have a systematic bias in that and validate this kind of a if you want a sense of how close you are to that truth.

91
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:48,280
So is you actually is is what you're measuring actually reflective of what you you actually want to measure?

92
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,729
I can't think of an example, but I think these are helpful.

93
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,010
So valid is like really hitting the the bullseye.

94
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:07,030
Like you're actually measuring what you think you're measuring, I guess is the kind of a good example like diet.

95
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,270
You can measure it by multiple, multiple ways, multiple surveys.

96
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:16,660
So about instrument is actually one that would actually capture a person's diet.

97
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:24,110
Any questions? Okay.

98
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,880
So so as we think about phenotypes or outcomes that we're interested in,

99
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:38,709
we we usually think of whether we want to model them as qualitative and quantitative,

100
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:47,350
some for some outcomes, like let's say whether an individual has had heart disease or heart event, then that's like straightforward.

101
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:52,690
It's a quantitative. You cannot model it. It's a qualitative, it's a yes or no kind of question.

102
00:12:52,690 --> 00:13:00,489
But for some for some traits like blood pressure, you can look at it as a continuous variation.

103
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,630
So you're actually looking at the full spectrum of of the measurements.

104
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:13,720
There's no threshold. We're not going to do a cutoff point of who is who has hypertension, who doesn't.

105
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:24,460
And each each approach has its own pros and cons, so mildly as hypertension, yes or no.

106
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:29,530
And we kind of we do lose information since we're two people.

107
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:40,410
We're not looking at the full but the full, full scale of the measurements, but might be kind of easier to interpret.

108
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:46,030
Like you kind of you're able to describe results as associated with hypertension

109
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:53,050
versus associated with when you're going to increase your mercury of like pressure.

110
00:13:54,010 --> 00:14:00,819
So each approach has its pros and cons, something to be thinking about as you're designing your study,

111
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,660
as you're looking at that you are speakers for problems that for.

112
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:14,479
So this is kind of what we talked about. And then the other part for measurements is the genetic polymorphisms.

113
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:21,770
So so how are we measuring the, the the genetic information of the genotypes?

114
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:30,049
So so genotypes typically are like before now the availability of sequencing,

115
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:35,720
which is the, the, the full rate of genetic information at each and every single base.

116
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:48,220
We typically use gwas array. So specific snips or attack snips as we talked about in the lecture or exam, everything.

117
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,740
So these are snips that are in the exons. So we're not looking at any snips in the end trunk regions of the genes.

118
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:03,020
Or we could be looking at a specific disease array like let's say I don't want to look at the whole genome,

119
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:13,219
I'm just going to use an array that's that has only snips that have been found associated with, let's say, blood pressure.

120
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,580
And I'm going to look at cardiovascular disease.

121
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,410
So I'm not going to look at the whole genome.

122
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:28,190
I'm just going to look at those candidate genes or snips that we already know are associated with something relevant to what I'm interested in.

123
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:35,600
And then now we're kind of moving into sequencing approaches that cover the whole genome.

124
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,229
So this is kind of the tech step.

125
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:50,110
So specific steps that kind of capture the variation in haplotype blogs.

126
00:15:52,210 --> 00:16:03,280
So if you remember, like from the hub from the link, just equilibrium lectures we do have like for each haplotype,

127
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:10,120
we do have a snippet that is kind of associated, might be associated with other steps in that region.

128
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,800
And so instead of looking at this all the steps in the haplotype block,

129
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:22,750
we're just going to use a text them that we know is associated with oh with then with a nearby snips.

130
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,870
So we're not going to kind of waste time looking at all the snips.

131
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:31,330
We're just going to look at one snip and make information based on that.

132
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,410
So this is kind of like the technology that we use.

133
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,900
And then after we get the genotype data.

134
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:55,389
You might think that that's it. You can just start doing your analysis straight away,

135
00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:05,080
but you do still have to do a bunch of QC steps and quality control steps to make sure that we do have good genetic data coming in.

136
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:10,900
So we typically exclude scripts that have low call rate.

137
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:20,680
So if you remember from an example here, it's it might be hard to really call what this what the genotype of the people of some people is.

138
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:27,970
So they end up being excluded. We exclude snips that are out of hardy one.

139
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,930
I we do use a stringent P values.

140
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:39,850
So this is like has to be really, really significant before we chop it out just because we think it might be.

141
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:49,950
Like if you have a lot of snips out of party one bird, then you might have a problem related to admixture or population stratification.

142
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:57,540
Or if you have one snake or a few snips, then it might be just the genotyping error.

143
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:11,100
So that's why we would apply kind of a stringent p value to weed those out snips that are kind of very rare.

144
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,750
You might not have enough power to look at the associations to these.

145
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,080
We kind of just flag them, so let's just keep an eye on them.

146
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,419
And then we exclude individuals who have a lot of their gene.

147
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,630
It's not a lot like 5% of their genotypes are missing.

148
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:34,080
So maybe there's some problem with the sample or something got kind of mixed up.

149
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:44,980
We do exclude individuals that are related so or related kind of in a way that we don't know about.

150
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:55,140
Sex check. Make sure that your genotypes, your genetic information matches what the reported sex.

151
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:04,710
And then this is for example chip like singles and outliers to any questions or.

152
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:20,040
Oh, and this one we kind of talked about, and we could just clearly like lecture.

153
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:30,750
We do use what we know about how snips or alleles are correlated on the haplotype to kind of fill in the blanks of the genetic data.

154
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:37,209
Like. Like, for example, in our lab we have data for for the general study.

155
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:45,310
It's like it collected genetic information, individuals, I think, from Jackson, Mississippi, in Rochester.

156
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:51,809
And that was done back in the. 1996 2000.

157
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:59,550
So the type of generic generic chips available did not cover a lot of the genome.

158
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,280
But now, as we try to use it for more, more stands or more recent studies,

159
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,510
instead of going back and do like samples again and getting genetic data again,

160
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,600
or do you I don't know if you have stored samples, do you run the analysis again?

161
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:24,720
No, that's not what we do. We just we actually take the genetic data we have collected and then put it against a reference genome.

162
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:30,660
So a reference genome that has many of the snips available and then we kind of fill in.

163
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:38,040
So let's say I didn't collect information on this network that I'm going to look at on the compare what

164
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:43,949
I have to the reference genome and try to fill in those blanks so that my dataset is now complete.

165
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:48,790
It matches whatever kind of the state of the field nowadays.

166
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:54,100
So that kind of clear. So yeah.

167
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,410
So we fill in those information based on reference panels.

168
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:05,630
So this is this is kind of a complicated process, kind of an oversimplification of it, but that's kind of the basic gist of it.

169
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:16,430
Any questions on this part? Okay.

170
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:26,780
So. So we're making through working on race with the Q and SS, so we talk about questions about measures.

171
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:33,020
So let's talk about sampling. Like, who are the people I'm going to have in my study?

172
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,930
It can be family based.

173
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:48,089
So we're kind of recruiting families, siblings or maybe parents and child trio or things like that, or it can be population based.

174
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:52,940
So sample from the population that we assumed to be unrelated.

175
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,520
Most users now are population based.

176
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:02,540
They do have more power to detect associations.

177
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:14,190
And then sometimes if you have a kind of a quantitative qualitative measure, we can use a case control study.

178
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,910
So so if you remember the example we talked about last time,

179
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:27,840
we can have affected people and unaffected people and compare the distribution of the exposure in the cases and controls and get measurements of risk.

180
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:39,570
Okay. So that type of sampling and my type of outcome will affect what statistical test I can apply.

181
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,240
And then if I have a family based studies,

182
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:52,299
then I do have to use a separate set of methods that account for we we call it kind of correlation between individuals.

183
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:59,140
So they're more similar than what you would expect by random because they come from a family.

184
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:04,240
So we do have to apply specific analysis techniques to account for that.

185
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:15,310
So if we're in the statistics, we're not going to be calculating anything at this point in this class.

186
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:21,490
We're just going to just want you to be aware of what kind of statistical tests are being applied.

187
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:30,240
So so this is an example for a dichotomous outcome.

188
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:39,480
So if you have a cases versus controls, we can look at the genotype frequency and compare it between cases and controls.

189
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:43,979
So we expect a certain genotype to be associated with the disease.

190
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,310
Then cases, we have more of it compared to the controls.

191
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:56,010
And if you look here, they're kind of similar. So this is an example where there's no association.

192
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:04,679
This is just looking at a proportion. And then we can also look at the test for significance.

193
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,690
So it could be like a simple chi square test to evaluate the significance.

194
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:19,440
And then if you have quantitative measures, then you cannot really call people cases or controls.

195
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:26,849
You just have their height. We can compare the means across the different genotypes and see how that kind

196
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:33,870
of correlates or if it's associated with difference in them in the outcomes.

197
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:40,380
And we can test for that with a T test or like a linear regression model.

198
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:49,079
And then for modeling genetics data,

199
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:56,159
it's kind of important just to think about the different ways we can model the data so we can

200
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:03,720
just look at the labels and compare them between cases and controls or compare the distribution.

201
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:12,510
And that way, we're not assuming any mode of inheritance. We're just looking like I'll say A versus T and compare them.

202
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:18,900
And then the genotype based is looking at how the aliens come together.

203
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:22,430
So we're looking at a c CC.

204
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:28,679
So we're looking at actual genotypes. And for those, we can model them in three different ways.

205
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,890
So we can either treat them as separate entities.

206
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:39,170
So we're just going to look at the, let's say the number or the like, kind of like this example.

207
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:42,240
We're going to just look at a C and CC.

208
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:48,180
We're not going to make any assumptions of what or who, what is recessive, what is dominant.

209
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:54,959
We're not going to assume, like any of those aliens is associated with higher risk.

210
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,080
We're just going to kind of treat them as three separate entities.

211
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:09,060
And then a dominant recessive would be we want assume a more of a genetic mode of inheritance.

212
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:16,610
We would just kind of group this one with group them as, oh, sorry.

213
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:23,999
And so, so if you are applying a dominant recessive we do of course as a model we can then

214
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,110
we're going to look at those people with a big a so any big a little asymmetry.

215
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:38,639
So we're kind of creating two groups or we're going to assume we're going to group people who have a small A together and compare them to big.

216
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,080
A big.

217
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:49,320
Of course, this is kind of I mean, if you know what the mode of inheritance, remember, you're going to do that for every single step of the genome.

218
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:55,800
It's not like when we're looking at a marker or yeah.

219
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:04,950
Mark early on in that class in like in linkage, disequilibrium or things like that, we're looking at across the whole genome.

220
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,220
So it's kind of hard to to know exactly how to model those genotypes.

221
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:19,530
So what typically is this is the most commonly applied model is the additive model.

222
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:25,300
So we assume kind of a dose response for each of those and.

223
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:31,530
Leo So, so if you look at CC CG, these are new genotypes.

224
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:39,989
Then we're going to look at the association for each G that is gains.

225
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:48,090
So kind of this is like your, you know, your reference and then this is kind of having this the,

226
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:53,620
the risk associated with having one G And then the risk associated with having to each of the ends.

227
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,020
So. And then we code them as zero one and two like.

228
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:03,270
Like similar to any kind of exploded or like if you've ever modeled, I don't know,

229
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:11,940
smoking like kind of smoking maybe not the best example, but any like a three level kind of category of increased exposure.

230
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:18,000
So we would model as zero one and two and then look at this whole situation with the outcome that we're interested in.

231
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:37,970
Any questions? So.

232
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:49,410
Let's move on and talk about the inferences and some special consideration for genetic studies.

233
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:59,460
So it's important, like in all those studies that look at association,

234
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:07,320
it's we kind of have to always keep in mind that this is a measure of association.

235
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,610
It's not a causation.

236
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:19,739
It's you cannot really say for sure that this is what what is causing let's say that the disease that you if you found this was European,

237
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,870
it's not a disease. You can't really say that this is causal.

238
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:34,910
And. That is I mean, it could be just a false positive result.

239
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,270
It kind of needs more validation, more studies. Bigger studies.

240
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:50,930
And then another reason why we're kind of hesitant to call it kind of causal is, well,

241
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:57,739
the good we like, we talk about kind of good kind of causal is that I really detected an association.

242
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:01,280
This snap is associated, but it's not really the causal snap.

243
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:09,740
So remember when we're looking at genetic data, in most cases we do not have information in every single snap.

244
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:16,160
It might be just the tag snap that we kind of chose from this haplotype block.

245
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:20,270
So this is kind of the snip that is representative of nearby snips.

246
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:30,020
So we did find an association that's that it but, but it might be maybe outside of the gene that is actually causing the association.

247
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:38,750
So so this is this is this is kind of something we all we're always mindful about as we try to interpret our findings.

248
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:45,559
What does it mean if I found an association between this snip and and the outcome and then the that's kind

249
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:55,100
of confounding is when we have maybe hidden structure in the data that we didn't appropriately account for.

250
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:01,040
So this is just a typical confounding if you've taken any and with cause.

251
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:12,050
So you kind of have a mixed mixing of effects resulting from an underlying association between surgery and loss.

252
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:20,450
And in genetic studies, this kind of variable is typically either population stratification or admixture.

253
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:28,280
So do you guys remember we kind of briefly talked about that and one of this we want to up with previous lectures.

254
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:34,190
So population segregation is when we have two populations analyzed together.

255
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:41,989
So let's say your sample has individuals of African ancestry and European ancestry and you kind

256
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:49,340
of just put them together and analyze the association without properly adjusting for that.

257
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:55,280
And that kind of that might lead to false positive results.

258
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:00,709
So you might find this snippet is associated with the outcome and it's not true association.

259
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:05,990
It's basically you have a little frequencies difference being different between the US,

260
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:13,009
which is of African ancestry and whites and that kind of biased your results

261
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:18,860
and you ended up detecting an association an admixture is kind of similar,

262
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:28,639
but it's more of an at an individual level where you have individuals who are not kind of homogeneous.

263
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,370
So this is kind of an example for one person looking at their chromosomes.

264
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:41,909
You can see that. Their their genetic information does not come from one ancestry.

265
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:46,950
They're actually a mix of African, European and some native ancestry.

266
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:55,590
So so that can also lead to differences, too, to kind of spurious results.

267
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:07,100
So. So how do we adjust for that? Like having multiple ancestries in your study or having admixture.

268
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:14,720
I mean, of course, most individuals are not going to come from a homogeneous ancestry and not give you any problems.

269
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:21,440
So typically in the fields, we do analyze race and ethnicity.

270
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,380
We do analyze groups by race and ethnicity.

271
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:36,710
So we typically analyze Europeans separately, African separately, maybe Hispanics separately for able to kind of create a homogeneous sample.

272
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,670
So that's one thing we do to avoid problems related to population structure.

273
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:54,610
Now, the other thing that we do is driving principal components.

274
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:59,500
So many of you are familiar with PCA or know what it is.

275
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:13,480
Okay. So it's kind of creating a summary measure or a vector that represents the greatest variation in the data.

276
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,740
So so if we look at this example here.

277
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:23,530
So we derive 2 to 2 components.

278
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:26,680
There are two vectors. We call them PC one and PC two.

279
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:31,300
And these are meant to capture the most variation in the data.

280
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:35,560
So just by. So this is kind of.

281
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,450
These are individuals.

282
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:47,500
And then just by using this information, we're able to kind of classify them in a way that really maps the variation geographically.

283
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:54,760
So PC one captures kind of the variation from south to north.

284
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:01,030
And then PC two kind of captures that variation from east to west.

285
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:06,330
Okay. It's kind of clear.

286
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:09,880
Any questions on that? Yes.

287
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:15,070
So is that usually two continuous things that are compared?

288
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:23,410
So, so actually like, like an actual statistical analysis, we do end up putting maybe up to ten pieces.

289
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:33,370
So the statistical programs that kind of create those pieces or calculate them, they would output more than more than two.

290
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:42,190
But those first two kind of capture the most variation, at least if you're trying to visualize the results,

291
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:47,980
then these kind of do a really good well of separating the individuals by ancestry.

292
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,100
But just so that we're kind of really, really sure,

293
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:59,049
we have a population stratification under control in genetic studies, like we can put up to ten pieces.

294
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:03,070
Some people with five, some people with ten. But they're, they're.

295
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,050
They're actually a continuous measure. Yeah. Like a score, kind of.

296
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:16,540
Any other questions? Yeah. What exactly do the points on here represent?

297
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:23,290
Is that like a height measurement? So I guess like in the, I guess the previous slide, the x axis is height.

298
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:27,960
So say someone's five foot and we say there are £100.

299
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:32,710
Is that what the point is measuring or is that some output of calculating these lines?

300
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:45,460
Yeah, it's just the output of those lines, kind of an empirical kind of measure just based on it's kind of based on looking across the genome.

301
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:55,840
You can be you can drag it in different ways, but looking at across specific steps and see how they vary between individuals.

302
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:07,330
So we're going to look at the variance or like how they vary and then try to create a measure that kind of explains the most variation.

303
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,510
So those parts just represent individuals.

304
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:16,560
So it's not like a real there's no height or no outcome kind of per say.

305
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,830
It's just a measure of variation in the data and how we can capture it.

306
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:25,510
Thank you. Any other questions?

307
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,349
This is kind of like a first step.

308
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:41,890
Whenever we have genetic data, we kind of look at who the people are like and how and how we can kind of represent them best.

309
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,650
So this is I think this plot is from the Health and Retirement Studies.

310
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:59,709
So it's like a long ongoing epidemiological study or panel study you on that because individuals from a nationally

311
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:09,790
representative sample and and we we I mean these these plots have kind of colored by self-reported ethnicity.

312
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:16,480
So remember all like what the what the genes tell you are like what you genotypes with tell you

313
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:23,710
might be different from what people report as their self as their race or their ethnicity.

314
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:31,990
And then something to note is like the kind of the continue with the continuous spread of the data.

315
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:38,200
Like the greens here are individuals of black, black or African American ancestry.

316
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:48,640
And as you can see, or they self-reported as blacks, they're kind of a they're kind of spread across across the plots here.

317
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:59,760
So it's not like one homogeneous group that is not kind of being as mixed or or it might be close.

318
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:03,040
Some people might be closer to another ancestry than others.

319
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:13,890
So clear. I know she is a. So so this is this is from this health and retirement study.

320
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:21,210
And so the first one or the first factor kind of separates.

321
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:27,400
Separates the biggest groups, which are the whites.

322
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:34,690
So the reds here and the the the green, which are the African-Americans.

323
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:39,790
So these are like the biggest groups and and the first principal component which

324
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:44,079
would capture kind of the most variation kind of separates those two groups.

325
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,140
That would vary the most, if you want.

326
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:05,190
Then like here we have individuals who report as being American-Indian, Alaska natives.

327
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:11,640
We do have a lot of unknowns that were difficult to classify.

328
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:28,130
So any questions? Okay.

329
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:36,470
Well, if you think of something, you know, so this is a consideration we take into account in genetic studies.

330
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:45,320
If you're reading through your divorce papers for the problems that think about what a good example were,

331
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:53,000
they appropriately account for different ancestries that they would see as in their models.

332
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:01,099
Now, another thing to be mindful of is the issue of multiple testing.

333
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:09,200
Like if you're testing a few genes or a few steps, then you're kind of okay, sure, testing, I don't know, ten steps say.

334
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:18,589
But the more tests you're running, the more likely you are that, the more likely you are to find associations just by chance.

335
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:24,050
So you might find a significant association, and it's not really true.

336
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:27,980
And that's kind of more relevant.

337
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:35,540
Of course, if you're testing, the more the more evidence you're testing, the more likely you are to suffer from that.

338
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:40,130
And you might hear that as a multiple testing burden.

339
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:49,879
And in that scenario, we do not apply the typical 0.05 P-value cutoff point.

340
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,690
We we kind of adjust for the number of tests that we're running.

341
00:41:55,430 --> 00:42:06,110
So we kind of assume 1,000,000 million tests and then we divide that point five by a million and it's use to really call something significant.

342
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:16,820
The does P value has to be less than 5 to 10 minus eight and that's in ag1 study.

343
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:22,850
And then for sequencing studies which have even more snips, we're doing more tests.

344
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:34,610
We kind of kind of lower the threshold even more to avoid calling something associated when it's not so kind of avoid the false positive results.

345
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:46,480
Any questions on that? Okay.

346
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:59,290
So another thing we do in genetic studies is and as you know, the more tests you are running,

347
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:06,399
the more the more sample you need to have enough power to detect associations,

348
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,160
especially if you're looking at rare variants or things that are not so common.

349
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:17,560
So we really do require huge sample sizes and.

350
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:21,139
And in this world,

351
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:31,190
most most studies end up kind of pooling their data together or running the analysis so each cohort or each study stack would run the association,

352
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:42,469
and then they could combine the results to kind of create one, one effect estimate when P value or if it's possible.

353
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:49,670
All those individuals are kind of analyzed together. So these are kind of ways that we typically.

354
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:56,740
Use to create a big sample size or create big studies.

355
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:06,400
And as you can imagine, that requires that all those different studies measured the phenotypes the same way.

356
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,890
I think that it can be kind of maybe okay too.

357
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:19,480
Like with the with the reference panels, you can impute to it all to the same reference panels to create the same genetic data,

358
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:27,700
but you would need to have the phenotype kind of measured in the same way so that you're kind of homogeneous in what you're looking at.

359
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:37,470
Any questions in this part? Okay.

360
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,440
So let's go over the quiz.

361
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:49,730
Then we do have a lecture on the visualizing the results.

362
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:57,730
So which of the following statements is?

363
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:02,110
Well, I suppose so.

364
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,270
Well, Jake, I never influenced by environmental factors, so that's.

365
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,860
That's not true. Think about the example of height.

366
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:25,140
Most of these. Most of, like, once a. Most of the cheats are really a factor of genes and environments.

367
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:30,120
I think it's rare to think of something just totally influenced by your genes.

368
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:40,310
So which of the following methods or platforms permission genetics provides the ability to examine snips across the entire genome.

369
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:48,710
So I think the key word here, these two answers have exome sequencing.

370
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:53,059
So these have variants just from that exon.

371
00:45:53,060 --> 00:46:01,160
And so looking across the genes and looking at snips that actually fall in the zones of the genes,

372
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:05,200
not so ruling out in drones, everything else we're not looking at.

373
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:09,050
So these snips only would represent about 10% of the genome.

374
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:14,630
And this one is kind of a clinical array, so it's just very specialized or specific array.

375
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:25,240
So this is the correct answer. Which of the following statements about genotype imputation is false?

376
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:35,110
Genotype imputation works best when all of the systems in the study sample have a local rate, so that that doesn't really make sense.

377
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:38,290
So local rate would mean like it's thought it's a kind of a.

378
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:48,350
But the algorithm wasn't able to call the genotyped as well as we expect as well as it should.

379
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,180
So this one is. Yeah. The ancestry.

380
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:08,720
So this is kind of true. You typically have to match the ancestry with the with the reference sample.

381
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:14,910
Which of the following does not incorporate a specific genetic mode of inheritance?

382
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:22,440
So that would be the three genotype model that would treat them as separate entities.

383
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:28,440
We're not assuming any mode of inheritance. This is just an abstract.

384
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:35,520
It's not really a mode of inheritance. Which of the following is not a major challenge for Genetic Association study?

385
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:41,600
Yeah. Confounding by age. Can anyone tell me why?

386
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:59,030
Was not it was not a major concern. I mean I assume it went to Eugene and changed that much as you like rule like it should stay pretty much the same.

387
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:04,730
Yeah, that's that's kind of true if you think about confounding having the effect to your exposure.

388
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:11,330
It's true in that sense. But we actually still do adjust for age and sex in our models.

389
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:19,760
So we're able to I don't know exactly like the argument, but it does kind of maybe for.

390
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:26,510
Kind of improves the precision of the results. But yeah, that's true.

391
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:29,570
It's not it's not a true confounder in that sense.

392
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:37,420
Yeah. Any questions on the queries or other questions?

393
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:50,470
Okay. So so you went through the like the Q missed steps, you did your analysis.

394
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:55,390
Now, how do you what do you do with your results?

395
00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:01,270
How do you how can you visualize them? I think it's a big thing in genetic studies to try to visualize the results.

396
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:11,280
So many of you are familiar with the Q Q plot. Can someone try to explain in grave enough?

397
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:25,520
So this one this this here this one shows the.

398
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:37,210
An example of a cute plot for study that looked at genetic information, snips and white matter hyper intensity.

399
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:44,120
So this is like a measurement of I think it's an MRI measure.

400
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:51,870
Of the brain where we look at the brain and see where we have kind of those white spots that we think

401
00:49:51,870 --> 00:50:00,360
are associated with vascular dementia or kind of early damage to the brain as a result of hypertension.

402
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:07,860
So so once we get our results, so let's say I read an association, a G us and a million snips.

403
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,940
So that means I do have a million P values to look at.

404
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:16,739
So the first thing we do is kind of plot the P values.

405
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:22,500
So, so each plot here and this and this figure is, is an actual P value.

406
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:28,350
So this is the observed p value. We do kind of like chance for them, transform them.

407
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:39,110
And we we're going to work under the assumption that out of those million snaps, most of them are not going to be associated with my outcome.

408
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:51,170
So so the no distribution or the this blue line is is represents kind of no p value.

409
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,880
So it's I'm assuming that most of my P values are not associated.

410
00:50:56,390 --> 00:51:01,490
Then I would expect most of the my p values are going to fall on this line here,

411
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:07,579
except maybe a few snips that kind of diverge and have a significant association.

412
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:11,090
So. So this kind of upward trend is.

413
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:17,490
Because it means that those P values were significant.

414
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:21,590
So so they it kind of moves away from.

415
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:27,700
From then on our assumption of no association.

416
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:37,540
Is that clear? Any questions?

417
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:44,690
So so this is helpful to think about, to look at the results.

418
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:54,220
So visually so it looks like here there were multiple snips that were associated or significant or were associated with my outcome of interest.

419
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:59,250
So it's kind of it's kind of a way to look at the results.

420
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:08,370
And as I said, we have we were working under the assumption that most of the snips are not associated.

421
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:12,910
So so what do you think is going on here?

422
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:20,520
Just this kind of does that look good that you kind of have a lot of significant results or does it look suspicious?

423
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:35,170
Suspicious. Good. So this is what you don't want to see.

424
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:42,530
Like this kind of plot, this kind of deviation from the from what you would expect is not is not what you want to see.

425
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:51,890
And it's if you have this early diversion from then also the line is not like on the expected line early on,

426
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:56,690
it really means that there's a systemic inflation of the test statistics.

427
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:59,820
So. So that so.

428
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:08,000
So you can think about the slam dunk or the 2.5 as a measure of how much your test statistics are inflated.

429
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:16,150
So like, let's say that you expect like the true beat out of that to effect estimate is the one.

430
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,580
But just because you did something wrong in your study,

431
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:25,700
you have population stratification admixture, something that you did not appropriately account for.

432
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:32,390
Then you do have an inflation, like you actually observe higher test statistics.

433
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,600
So they are, we call it inflation or inflated.

434
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:44,460
And sometimes this is what you this is what you actually want to see.

435
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:49,020
So most of these things are not associated and then just a few are associated.

436
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:56,400
This is a measure of the inflation. A lambda of one means no inflation.

437
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:08,760
And we do have a cutoff of a limit of 1.1 to kind of consider, to kind of decide what is acceptable, what is not.

438
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:16,229
If you do have a small, small inflation, then sometimes people applied genomic controls.

439
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:20,190
So they would correct the statistics by dividing them by the lambda.

440
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:27,600
So the associations that you got, you kind of like divide them or scale them back so that you do not have this inflation.

441
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,389
And that's okay to do if you have small inflation,

442
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:36,720
not if you have like population stratification that you forgot to adjust for, that you're just going to apply genomic control.

443
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:48,920
Any questions? Okay.

444
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:57,050
So what about this plot? This is kind of maybe an easier one to understand or maybe explain what?

445
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,160
Does anyone know? But this plot shows or.

446
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:11,240
Have you seen this plot before? So this is the Manhattan plot.

447
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:24,920
So it's another way to visualize the results. So we do have the snips here or there by their by their location on the chromosomes each.

448
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:31,840
That represents a snip. And this is the p value and it's just like transforms that it's easier.

449
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:36,080
Remember those are like really small or in some cases really small p values.

450
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:44,960
So each that is the p value and then the x axis comes on the location and where is the observed p values.

451
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:54,560
And then there's this line here that that is drawn at the significance level that is applied for this study.

452
00:55:54,890 --> 00:56:00,350
So remember for a G lot, that's like at five times ten to the power of minus eight.

453
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:06,650
So any step that made it, made it above the line is significant.

454
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:14,420
So it's kind of a way to easily visualize what snips you had or what hits you have.

455
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,980
Where are they located on the genome?

456
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:32,520
You can tell maybe how many kind of it's a good thing to see a trio of snips associated remembered because snips are correlated.

457
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:38,630
So it's good that you kind of have corroborating evidence.

458
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,100
It's not like one snip that you find associated,

459
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:50,870
but all the nearby snips that we know were associated with that or are kind of an oldie with it that we also looked at.

460
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,680
They also found an association. We also found an association there.

461
00:56:56,910 --> 00:57:00,660
So it's kind of a good thing to see that that trail.

462
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:19,480
So this is a manhattan plot. Now, another type of plot that we use is called the regional plot or maybe maybe it's called the locust plot.

463
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:24,490
So this is just really zooming in on one of the Manhattan plots.

464
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:32,830
So so let's say when I really look at this region here in, zoom in to see what's going on.

465
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:45,580
So again, we're looking at a plot where each dots represents the P value through a single snips association.

466
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:53,230
And this plot kind of gives you a lot of a lot of things to look at.

467
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:57,130
So the x axis is still the chromosomal location.

468
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:02,620
This one here is the y axis is observe the p value.

469
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:08,110
And the higher you are like the more significant the the snip is.

470
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:15,430
And this is like we call it like the index snip or the sentinel snip.

471
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:27,610
It's like in a purple diamond shape. This is the most significant snip that you found in that region.

472
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:41,050
Okay. Now, other things that you can get from from original thought.

473
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:53,229
This part here called the rug, which visualizes how much snips were actually kind of measured in that region.

474
00:58:53,230 --> 00:59:06,580
So each line represents a snip and we sometimes add the genes that that those snips are where they match.

475
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:11,820
So if you look at this index here, you kind of follow down.

476
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:16,900
You can tell that it is located in the st0 gene body region.

477
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:25,010
So this is the gene. Those lines are the songs that you see here.

478
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:29,210
I don't know how you do this to see, but I think so.

479
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:36,980
So this this significant step here is actually located in the photo gene region.

480
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:51,200
This is like the base fair location. Then other things that we can.

481
00:59:54,170 --> 01:00:04,579
Kind of get from from this regional plot is how correlated the nearby snips are with the significant snips.

482
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:10,190
So. So this color scheme here is a measure of R squared.

483
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:13,730
So remember, R squared is a measure of linkage disequilibrium.

484
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:19,040
So those in red have an R squared of 0.8 or more.

485
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:24,050
So those are snips that are highly correlated with this index.

486
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:28,590
Now remember those, those measures are all in relation to that index.

487
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:40,520
Okay. And you can see the further you are from the index snip, then those are kind of colored in the navy blue or the dark blue.

488
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:54,720
So they are not really correlated. But you have a region of correlated snips and those are all kind of well not as significant as this index them,

489
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:59,569
but somehow definitely higher than those that have a p value around zero.

490
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:12,050
So not really significant. Now, the last thing that you can look at in this figure is this one here on the right axis, which is a recombination rate.

491
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:20,600
So remember we talked about recombination and these are just the spikes that you see here.

492
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,260
There usually we get them usually from the reference panel.

493
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:32,330
So it's not like based on your data and whenever you see a spike, then that means that this is a recombination hotspot.

494
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:37,140
So this is where you have recombination happening quite often.

495
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:43,410
Guess. Any questions on these?

496
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:48,030
Do you still see an outline or any significances, or are all these snippets significant?

497
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:51,390
Because it's not. Sometimes people edit.

498
01:01:52,590 --> 01:02:05,790
I think, see, this one's for the PM. I think these are showing from different, but I think the line should be around from here.

499
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:16,220
I think so. Maybe this one made the cut of point of the line at ten to the minus eight and these did not.

500
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:20,820
But it's still good evidence that they are kind of trailing towards significance.

501
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:27,810
There could be other reasons, meaning you could be just not.

502
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:32,010
You could if you don't have enough power to detect the association like you would need for

503
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:38,620
samples to actually kind of show significance or it could be something else going on.

504
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:52,569
It's hard to tell what. Do you think we can make the association that this is associated with BMI or is causally associated

505
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:59,799
with BMI or this is in this is kind of a this FTO gene has been shown to be associated with BMI.

506
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:08,890
It's kind of well documented. But can we say for sure that this is the snip, that that is kind of leading the association and causing it?

507
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:33,850
So we we can't really say for sure because it could be any of those snips, but or it could be a snip that we didn't really collect information on.

508
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:43,299
This is just like this text snip or this clip that that kind of represents the block or the haplotype block.

509
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:57,760
But, but we really do sometimes we do more investigative work to, to, to know for sure that sometimes we don't really end up knowing for sure,

510
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:09,700
but we do kind of know that it is at least this snippet we might not be able to tell for sure if it's maybe a nearby snip or or or not.

511
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:16,830
Okay. And then in G was we end up putting together all the all this evidence or all

512
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:23,860
those plots from Manhattan to those old figures that we looked at before,

513
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:28,870
locus plots with regional plots to really visualize the results.

514
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:36,550
So this is some of the language you probably like as we were we just used it now so

515
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:43,330
there's snip we call it we named six by this by this naming like R s and then a number.

516
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:52,990
So this is how we kind of are name snips if you go on DV snips like if you want if you're interested in a specific snip,

517
01:04:53,410 --> 01:05:01,870
you would just either put a location like put like what chromosome number, what location or it's like a unique identifier for snips.

518
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:06,430
You can put this snip here and and find information on it.

519
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:09,729
It's kind of good so that it's consistent between studies.

520
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:16,810
So someone reports an association between a specific snip and other studies they're able to compare to.

521
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:21,280
Right. So we talked about index snip.

522
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,979
This is the most significant one proximal.

523
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:32,590
It's like nearby and then a signal or locus or heads is like that kind of trail or that kind of significance.

524
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:44,560
And if you see a trail, we kind of just refer to it as one head or one one, one locus or one region of interest.

525
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:57,109
Something else that is reported in results tables or in results are just tables of associations.

526
01:05:57,110 --> 01:06:06,080
So you would have this. Then we would list what chromosome position function imputation.

527
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:12,310
And then this is kind of important. Which one was the coded earlier?

528
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:21,130
Which one was the non-coding? Ilya. So coded emails are what the effect estimate is for.

529
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:31,390
So. So if you think about modeling, that's what like the code, the code in here is the Alia.

530
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:40,840
So this is what the effect estimate is for. So having the alias is associated with -2.6.

531
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:45,790
Mm mm. Mercury of decrease of systolic blood pressure.

532
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:55,100
So that's how you would interpret those results. And it's important for studies to tell you which one is the coded, which one is the non coded value.

533
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:06,900
Yeah. Are you able to say that the G is associated with a plus 2.6 or you can.

534
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:18,410
You can kind of reverse it, but I don't believe it's like plus, maybe it's one or -2.6.

535
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:28,400
Yeah. Yeah, you can. And we would use that if we like try to compare the results.

536
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:34,370
My study to other studies, we would kind of make sure that we have done it in the same way.

537
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:44,970
She questions other questions. So these are the Beatles P values.

538
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:55,770
Then the effect estimates would be, as we interpreted here, decreased by 2.6 if it's surveyed.

539
01:07:55,980 --> 01:08:01,170
So this is if we have less pressure modeled as a continuous measure.

540
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:09,360
So we use kind of a linear regression model. If we had model hypertension, yes or no, then we would end up with an odds ratio.

541
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:15,270
And we would typically kind of say the odds of hypertension is.

542
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:27,970
X is associated with X increase in the odds of hypertension or having a maybe having a certain LDL is

543
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:37,110
associated with 1.5 times the odds of hypertension compared to an individual with no copy of that.

544
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:42,010
Any of them interested in that cleared?

545
01:08:45,570 --> 01:08:56,010
So we'll come back to this towards the end of the course, just more investigative work of of your findings.

546
01:08:56,020 --> 01:09:03,329
So you did find an associated snap or hit. Sometimes we do look at gene expression data.

547
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:09,720
If you have that collected, we're going to see if where those genes are expressed.

548
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:13,560
See if this snip is associated with changes in gene expression.

549
01:09:15,330 --> 01:09:28,260
We can look at related traits like if you're looking at weight or BMI, we can look at eye measurements of glucose or things like that or diabetes.

550
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:33,330
And then the last thing I want to talk about is genetic risk scores.

551
01:09:35,190 --> 01:09:41,819
So this is a way where we kind of create a summary measures of the risk alleles.

552
01:09:41,820 --> 01:09:45,810
So we're not going to look just at the risk of having remember those.

553
01:09:46,230 --> 01:09:48,690
We talk about how those traits are polygenic.

554
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:59,970
So to really capture the effect of the genotype on height, your whole genome and height like looking at once would tell you only a very small.

555
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,310
Percentage of that information or that's over.

556
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:11,120
It will explain a very small percentage of the variance and highlights or explains why y you have variation in height.

557
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:19,250
So what we tend to do is kind of create a summary measure where we kind of say this person has,

558
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:23,830
I don't know, 13 risk elements and this person is 14 risk else.

559
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:31,830
So kind of kind of create a summary measure that is based on the some of the risk labels and then use that as a single measure to,

560
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:37,280
to and test its association with, with, with your phenotype or your trait of interest.

561
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:40,230
We I think we will talk about this later on.

562
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:47,840
Jen, I think in the lecture just meant she'll be a guest lecture, like she'll give a guest lecture here in class.

563
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:52,700
She will kind of break this more for you.

564
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:57,220
But do you have any questions on it or any other parts of this, actually?

565
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:14,290
I mean, the world of G was has really exploded and there's like a device for for any trade.

566
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:23,000
Now, like a lot of trades have been kind of investigated for their association with generics.

567
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:35,250
Um, okay, so we don't have a lot of time, but if you want to maybe spend a minute to look at problems set forth,

568
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:38,790
let me know if you have any questions, please.

569
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:53,590
And so. You can do this to people or I can go over it just to make sure that you know what to do.

570
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:58,450
You give me a minute. These people are looking up to people they can choose.

571
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:04,420
And you should look at that. This is a need. And people.

572
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:20,470
Okay. So some problems that for you do have to download it does it does list kind of gives you instructions and the questions you want to answer.

573
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:27,190
There's a list of nine papers that you can choose one.

574
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:31,830
So this is the list of nine papers, nine g was papers.

575
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:35,740
And here for each group select one.

576
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:43,240
We're doing this in groups and we want to break it down using that comes this I framework.

577
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:48,730
So so scroll through see which one makes sense to you.

578
01:12:49,150 --> 01:12:57,190
I do have an example of, of the paper and how I answered the questions for it here.

579
01:12:57,310 --> 01:13:01,030
So if it helps to refer back to it, do so.

580
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:06,910
You and we should have all class tomorrow to work on it, you know.

581
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:10,629
So the whole group is working on one one. Yeah.

582
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:17,710
Yeah, it's one group when we prefer one and we have all class next Thursday to work on it.

583
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:29,100
Okay. Any other questions that should be.
