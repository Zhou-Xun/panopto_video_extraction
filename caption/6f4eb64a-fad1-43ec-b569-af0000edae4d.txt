1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:08,700
Yeah. I thought that was a bit like somebody's gotta ask you to do something for a while.

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:19,470
Yeah, maybe. Just say, like. Yeah. So assuming I got it right.

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,909
Yeah. You probably don't need. I just don't like living here.

4
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:36,500
And I'm not a person like, you know, and that's not an investment in my life.

5
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:52,800
So I, we used to inspired me to work like that, you know, that there's like I did a couple of times I was there,

6
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:23,400
but I was always the same amount of friends most of the time.

7
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay. So I'm I have I have a few announcements before we get started today,

8
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:37,560
so we have to post tomorrow and it will be two on Sunday and it'll be three or four.

9
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,510
One of more questions on what's been covered in the past three lectures.

10
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:54,420
Um, so look for that to come out and resolve the issues.

11
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,680
Um, for now, um,

12
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:07,890
I've got one day is reading the PDF on the canvas site and I'll be putting that into perusal after class today and hopefully that will go smoothly.

13
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,650
Thank you, Kimmy. And then, um, that's the only announcements that I have right now.

14
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:23,190
So they, we're going to talk about what's changed in the food environment since 1960 and how that is

15
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:29,640
associated with trends and body weight gain here in the U.S. and in some other countries.

16
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:39,660
So for the learning objectives today, you should be able to, after you've seen everything, describe the overall ten trends,

17
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:47,340
trends sorry, trends in body weight, waist circumference and BMI that has occurred in the United States since 1960.

18
00:02:48,660 --> 00:03:02,190
Now, total calorie and macronutrient intake has changed during this time and how the cost of energy dense foods compared to micronutrient rich foods.

19
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:11,549
And then finally, I have some slides showing you how energy expenditure as a function of our our work life,

20
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,290
our occupational life has changed dramatically during this time as well.

21
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:25,440
And then for the very last part of this morning's lecture, we're going to go over the Kevin Hall paper.

22
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:35,730
And you read this last year, we're just going to review this and go over how the consumption of highly processed food affects your eating behavior.

23
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,410
And weight gain over a short period of time. Okay.

24
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:49,100
So what's normal? What is the average weight of the men and women in the United States?

25
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:54,260
And I have data for you from vital statistics for 2021.

26
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:00,380
And then some of this may surprise you, and it's actually changed quite a bit since 1960.

27
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:08,300
So the graph here shows you the change over time from 1960 to 2010.

28
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:18,080
And then over in the column over here, I've added data, the most recent data that I can find from vital statistics published in January 2021.

29
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,300
So, so here we are, 1960.

30
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,590
The average man five £866.9.

31
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,299
BMI of 25. They didn't record waist circumference 1960.

32
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:40,630
So I don't know what that was. And the average woman, five £340, 24.9 wait for conference.

33
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:46,190
I don't. And then time goes on between 1960.

34
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:53,990
And then we see these points here. This represents the NHANES collection of data used in this analysis.

35
00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:03,630
And as you can see, for both men shown here in the maroon line and women shown here in this clean up operation,

36
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:13,820
I believe you would call that line increase. So the very last data point that was collected here in 2010,

37
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:23,960
so we see for men that they got a little bit taller BMI, I'm sorry, their weight increased to £195.

38
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,639
Their BMI increased to 28.8. And they measured waist circumference.

39
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,020
And this particular collection of data, 39.7 inches.

40
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:50,800
So that's the men women average height. They got taller, 5.4 inches the weight, £276, BMI, 28.5, and waist circumference 37.5.

41
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:59,180
Now, this is adults 20 years and older. And when we look at the most recent data collection, it's gone up a little bit.

42
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:05,300
It's kind of plateaued. But we see that the average man is still five nine.

43
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,550
A little bit more weight here, £199.8.

44
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:19,160
A little bit of a change in that BMI, 29.5 waist circumference, 40 and a half inches for women.

45
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:25,040
The latest vital statistics says that the average height for women is five feet,

46
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:34,400
three and a half inches £170.8, BMI 29.8, and a waist circumference of 38.7.

47
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:42,800
And when you look at the cutoffs for, you know, the cutoff for BMI, cut off for waist circumference and you had to memorize these values.

48
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:47,210
We're now over the cutoff for men and women for waist circumference.

49
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,830
So this is what's happened since 1960.

50
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:57,170
In terms of the average man or woman in regard to these assessments.

51
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,140
During this time, has energy expenditure changed?

52
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:17,619
Well, I picked up this graph from this particular journal and it shows you a very long

53
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,770
period of time looking at theoretical energy expenditure and energy intake.

54
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,370
And this goes all the way back to 1910.

55
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:38,569
And in this paper, they came up with some calculations to develop this data showing what happened to individual energy

56
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:48,560
intake and individual energy as a as a function of the total energy intake in energy output.

57
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:59,210
So the red line represents individual energy intake and the blue line represents individual energy expenditure.

58
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:07,390
So between 1910 and 1960, there was this was a period of mechanization.

59
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,660
So there was less need for manual labor.

60
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,460
And as a consequence, energy expenditure declined during this time.

61
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:22,270
Okay. The red line looks at or as a representative of individual energy intake.

62
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:30,190
I'm not exactly sure how they calculated, but this was this was their summation of the data that they had seen.

63
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:40,950
So there was that proportional decline in energy intake with less energy expenditure between 1910, in 1964 on a theoretical frame point.

64
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:47,770
Okay, people, it wasn't a whole lot of a lot of changes in terms of overall body weight during this particular time period.

65
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,410
But there wasn't a whole lot of data collected during this time period.

66
00:08:51,620 --> 00:09:02,590
Yeah. So it's it's not certain exactly what happened during this time period in terms of the average size of the American man or woman.

67
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,960
Okay. Now, after 1960, we have a lot more data.

68
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:16,510
And during this time, this is the postulated energy flipping point where we started to see an increase

69
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:23,110
in the intake of macronutrients and a decline in individual energy expenditure.

70
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:31,120
And this difference is explained by perhaps the availability of energy in the form

71
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:38,080
of food and a decline in energy expenditure from further need for manual labor.

72
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:50,249
So this is a very big picture. We have a lot of data that that gold goes along with this and supports this 1910 to 1960.

73
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:55,170
I'm not really sure what happened during that time period. But anyway, you get to the big picture.

74
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:05,040
We're increasing our energy intake and our energy expenditure with regard to our occupations has declined during this time.

75
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:12,860
So what's happened in terms of occupations changed quite a bit.

76
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,370
So here service jobs have increased.

77
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:26,960
This is a this is the prevalence or percentage of types of services, goods producing agricultural jobs in the U.S. between 1960 and 2008.

78
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,160
And this is an older paper, but the trends would probably be the same now.

79
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:38,010
So more service jobs, less good producing jobs, and certainly less agricultural jobs.

80
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,200
Agriculture has undergone a tremendous amount of mechanization during that time period.

81
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:47,520
So less demand for labor, less energy expenditure.

82
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,580
So here's another category of goods producing jobs.

83
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,040
The number of people employed in manufacturing has gone down in manufacturing.

84
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:05,250
You're on your feet the whole time or you're expending energy during that eight hour shift at your point.

85
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,809
Construction jobs have gone up a little bit,

86
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:17,310
but it's kind of flat in comparison to a factory and then other jobs where there's a heavy degree of energy expenditure,

87
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,520
mining, logging, 10% of people are.

88
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,180
The prevalence of people involved in those occupations has gone down quite a bit.

89
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:35,219
So it doesn't employed very many people to begin with. And then other service jobs and you see the types of occupations that don't require

90
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:42,350
a tremendous amount of energy expenditure in comparison to other jobs that do that.

91
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,390
We look at this in terms of energy expenditure.

92
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:55,950
It is very clear what's going on. So this is occupational metabolic equivalence and energy expenditure since 1960.

93
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:02,540
So one metabolic equivalent is equivalent to the energy that you would expend addressed.

94
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:12,120
And this is oxygen consumed, oxygen consumed, which is about 3.5 milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute.

95
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:22,920
So that's what one measure is. Now, when you become more physically active, you can increase that energy expenditure to three and six.

96
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,850
Three would be. I mean, occupational related.

97
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:40,220
Matt So this is a quite three, two and a half. So this is the energy expenditure in 1960 related to the occupation and it's declined dramatically

98
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:47,840
during this time period and occupational related daily expenditure in terms of calories.

99
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,150
We see a similar trend for men.

100
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,530
Declines for women has declined as well.

101
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:06,860
So based on this type of information, it's clear that the amount of energy that we're spending for occupations has declined during this time period,

102
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:10,080
which we've seen increases in body weight.

103
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:22,620
So this graph is from in Heinz data sets between 1971, 74 through 2000, by 2006.

104
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:34,620
And it's just I have more recent data, but this particular graph highlights this inflection point here where we see,

105
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,859
you know, it's pretty flat 1971 to 1976.

106
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,830
In terms of the percentage, there's a there seems to be a little bit of an increase here.

107
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:51,480
But it's after this time period, 1976 to 1980, that things seem to change a lot faster.

108
00:13:52,770 --> 00:14:01,110
And at that particular time, there was this public health message to reduce the amount of fat that you are consuming.

109
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,480
And there was great concern over cholesterol in the diet.

110
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:14,580
And the thinking was that if we can reduce the amount of fat and cholesterol down, you could reduce heart disease risk.

111
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,480
And so everybody followed this recommendation.

112
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:26,460
And as a consequence, there was this change in the prevalence of obesity in all of these different age groups.

113
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,620
Now, nowadays,

114
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:42,860
it's the restriction on dietary cholesterol content that is not mentioned in terms of it being a significant contributor to heart disease.

115
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:48,510
So the recommendation has been lifted so you can eat your eggs and not worry about that.

116
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:56,730
Okay. So what in terms of macronutrients has changed during this time?

117
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:01,650
Well, remember I told you at that time point around that around the early seventies,

118
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:07,650
there was this change and fat consumption are behind that consumption.

119
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,600
Here's the recommendation right around here if you listen.

120
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:17,760
So you are amount less fat in the diet during this time.

121
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:28,260
So there's this decline in fat and and during that same time, okay, this is grams per day of carbohydrate.

122
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,580
Now, this is these two lines are right up.

123
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:40,260
One another is grams per day of protein and fat, and they're right on top of one another.

124
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:49,400
But in terms of the percentage of calories now from these different macronutrients, we see that a big change here.

125
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,710
So this is carbohydrates as a percentage of total calories.

126
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,870
And then this is fat in terms of percentage of constant declined a little bit.

127
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,430
So yeah, there's been a shift in macronutrient intake during this particular time.

128
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:16,549
So if you remember, some of you may be too, too young to remember this as your age, as your kids weren't born in the nineties.

129
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,330
Right. You don't remember the green boxes of.

130
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,780
Oh, I can't remember the name of the brand. Now the was. Smart choice or something like that.

131
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,069
So there was this company that marketed this food product,

132
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:37,020
all kinds of different food products, desserts, frozen foods, all kinds of different things.

133
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:43,560
And their marketing ploy was to reduce the amount of fat in their schools, to reduce the amount of calories.

134
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:51,870
And while these changes were going on, the FDA was trying to regulate these claims.

135
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:58,980
And if you're going to say something was low fat, it had to have a certain threshold of the percent of fat in it.

136
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:04,380
So if it was reduced calories, it had to have 25% less calories.

137
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,010
So all of this all of these different marketing schemes were going on.

138
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,900
People were buying this stuff thinking, oh, I reduced that Oreo cookie.

139
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:17,370
I can eat more who grew up with it? And so that's kind of what happened.

140
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:25,139
So if you reduced the fat, you had to change the characters of foods such that you didn't notice,

141
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:34,530
which meant that you had to doctored up a little bit to make it still somewhat as powerful as the food with the higher fat content.

142
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:39,090
Well, that's really hard to do. Even I.

143
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:46,530
I worked for a company and one of my projects was working on spaghetti sauce and taking just a little bit of the 1%,

144
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:53,309
1% olive oil out of a spaghetti sauce.

145
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:57,780
You'll notice the difference and it's not quite the same. Doesn't have quite the same flavor.

146
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:05,160
Adjustments to the diet had a significant impact on the overall carbohydrate intake.

147
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:14,470
So what we were consuming and still seeing more carbohydrates than we did before these recommendations were put in place.

148
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:22,590
And so nowadays you'll hear a lot of more public health messages saying, okay, it's the type of fat that you can consume.

149
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:29,220
That's important. That saturated fats weren't polyunsaturated fat, monounsaturated fats.

150
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:33,220
Those are the good fats you want to consume that saturated fat.

151
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:46,620
But still, the current data show that we're still consuming a higher level of carbohydrate than we did before this early time period up in 1974.

152
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:55,690
So. The same graph, just highlighting that inflection point.

153
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:05,440
So what about now? So this is this is the recent times in terms of macronutrient intake.

154
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:10,820
And there's been a little bit of a change, but not much.

155
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:16,040
So that was the previous data that I showed you went up to 2010.

156
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,570
What about now? So these are the trends that I could find.

157
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:31,020
This is published in 19. Total fat, total carbohydrates gone down a little to about 50% of energy intake.

158
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:38,340
Down a little bit. Climate very much in my eye because my eyes total fat got up a little bit maybe.

159
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:45,990
And remember, the recommendation would be fat intake, 30% or less.

160
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:53,520
Well, that's pretty close to that's about 33, 34% back in 2015, 2016.

161
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,790
Total protein intake is pretty flat as well. It's gone up a little bit, but not very much.

162
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:11,050
And then people are encouraged to eat complex carbohydrates with lots of fiber.

163
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,550
That way you get the recommended servings of whole grains.

164
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:23,530
Dietary fiber plays an important role in many aspects of health, including feeding your microbiome and your gut.

165
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,389
So we're starting to pay attention to these types of recommendations.

166
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,660
And low quality carbohydrates are going down a little bit.

167
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:41,110
Since 22,000, high quality carbohydrate intake has gone up a little bit, but not very much, maybe 1% during this time period.

168
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:47,410
So these overall trends now change have changed very slightly.

169
00:20:48,910 --> 00:21:00,700
And again, in comparison to what what type of nutrient breakdown that we had consumed back before the seventies,

170
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,310
we're still consuming more carbohydrates. Okay.

171
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:14,010
Then there's this public health recommendation to increase the diversity of your protein sources.

172
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,800
Try to get some of your more of your protein from plant sources as opposed to animal sources.

173
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,320
How is that message going over?

174
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:30,160
Well, there's been a little there's hasn't really been much of a change in terms of plant protein intake between this time period.

175
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:39,630
The line is pretty flat. You increase your protein intake perhaps to provide some more satiety in your diet.

176
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:46,440
And during this time period, we see a little change in animal protein intake, but not very much at all.

177
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,590
That was a worrisome change, wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah.

178
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:56,960
So the recommendation from the dietary guidelines to switch to plant protein is a very recent recommendation.

179
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:09,120
Yes. Yeah. And then we've heard all along since the early seventies to change the types of bats that we consumed.

180
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:21,690
So food was even industrial food, homemade food was prepared using you're going to have that.

181
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:26,880
It would have butter or margarine, something that's solid at room temperature,

182
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:34,560
something that has saturated fat, saturated fats take that better together.

183
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:40,200
They form salads at room temperature and they also promote atherosclerosis.

184
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:47,760
The recommendation was to increase the amount of collagen saturated and exaggerated fatty acids.

185
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,620
And so when we look at this.

186
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:02,030
When you look at this particular type classes of basses,

187
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:11,990
you really don't see very much of a change during this time period of about 20,000 to 20 to 2015, 2016.

188
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:17,580
It's gone up a little bit, but saturated fat intake has gone up a little bit too.

189
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:20,649
So real fat intake has gone up a little bit.

190
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:37,060
And it looks like all of the classes of these sources of fat isn't so what about total calorie intake?

191
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:46,299
I have two graphs for this. So one was published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2009,

192
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:56,440
and I have a more recent one which came from the reading that you have looked at that was published in 2020, 2019.

193
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,130
Certainly what's happened in terms of cohort.

194
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:08,440
So this graph shows you the prevalence of obesity in individuals and adults in the United States, age 20 to 74.

195
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:22,750
And the blue lines, those who have a BMI of 30, at least 30, the red line, those who have a BMI of over 40.

196
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:30,510
And then back in 2009, I don't believe they used the terminology Class one obesity or Class three obesity.

197
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:36,880
So you'll see obese and they're very obese. So it's kind of a dated, gnomic way of describing this BMI.

198
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,630
And in the green line you have calorie intake.

199
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:51,810
So the Green Line shows you the increase in caloric intake kind of matches this increase in demand that we've seen during this time period.

200
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:02,400
So and this has been adjusted for a loss adjusted per capita for calories per day.

201
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:10,590
And then this is the figure taking from the reading that I showed you.

202
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:15,040
And they show you many different ways to look at this data are difference.

203
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:26,610
That is the increase in the food supply. Food intake and calories per capita per day between 1970 and 2005 looks like.

204
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:38,130
So you have the USDA values. You have the Food and Agricultural and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations data here.

205
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,270
And then you have the USDA data adjusted for loss.

206
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:49,680
So not all food produce is consumed. And then finally, you have the estimated intake here.

207
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:55,560
Yeah. Q You had a comment just like given that this is epidemiological data.

208
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:06,299
So I'm assuming that these calorie intakes are coming from with frequency questionnaires and or some recalls or whatever.

209
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:14,670
So I'm wondering how much of the impact of the impact and increase in calorie intake might actually be?

210
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:22,649
Like people just being more aware of how many calories are in things or also like changes in the validity of the frequency.

211
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:27,660
Question Because like in 1960 you didn't have calories posted on everything but now

212
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:33,240
so in the data got better at in the seventies and that has improved afterwards.

213
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:44,850
So there's a lot of problems with dietary assessment and lately there have been great attempts made to validate the intakes.

214
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:54,660
So you have a food frequency questionnaire and then you have another person interview the individual and ask them,

215
00:26:55,050 --> 00:27:02,040
okay, how much did you eat in this time? So there's that there are validation steps that can be done to improve the qualitative data.

216
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,850
Yeah, but there's still going to be some inaccuracies there. So that's true.

217
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:19,770
But if you just look at. That the strong data that supports this notion, you'll find that it's still consistent with this in this increase.

218
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:24,280
It's not. It's going to give you data that looks like this instead of this.

219
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:32,910
In other words. Okay. It's it's it's it's a from a population view, it's has increased.

220
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:37,430
But exactly how much? That's that's where the.

221
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,200
The data can be messy in that regard.

222
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,750
It's still gone up, though. Yes.

223
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:55,400
In terms of increased food supply, are they taking out what percentage of their products that they're making in various corrections for things like,

224
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:05,660
yeah, what's shipped what is exported waste? What percent of that production is actually never consumed as eventually things go bad.

225
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:15,440
So if you're making excess and we're not eating it, it's probably just involving like plants or not used for various reasons.

226
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:22,700
Yeah. So that's why there's this. That's why there's a corrected value and that's why the intake doesn't match the

227
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:27,030
estimate for the intake doesn't match the estimates for the food production.

228
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:30,890
So in general, there's an increase.

229
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,010
Exactly how much? That's not certain.

230
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:40,280
Okay. These are estimates. So.

231
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:45,770
To summarize what we've shown you so far, the average weight, BMI,

232
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:53,450
waist circumference have increased for men and women since 1966 and a net positive energy balance.

233
00:28:54,410 --> 00:29:03,110
Total energy intake, especially carbohydrate intake, has increased and contributing to this net positive energy balance.

234
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:07,730
We see a decrease in occupational energy expenditure.

235
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:14,240
Okay, so why has energy consumption increased?

236
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:24,350
So as the reading today described, we're not exactly sure, but um,

237
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:33,050
it seems that it has and there have been a lot of theories about why energy consumption has increased.

238
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:44,950
We're going to go through this. So let's look at the first of all, the cost of food, the overall cost so long time ago,

239
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:56,080
and this is from 1900 based on data that was collected then in terms of the percent of income, household income spent on food, it was much higher.

240
00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:08,740
This is before the era of agricultural mechanization use Massachusetts fertilizers, um, the affordability of high calorie food.

241
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:16,180
So on the value, the amount of money you would spend on food was much higher, about 15%.

242
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:23,200
And so I've got this old timey autograph here,

243
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:32,830
people sitting around with the funny mustaches and several layers of clothes and this very elaborate setup here.

244
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:44,480
So. But it was very expensive and they didn't have refrigerators like it had.

245
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:52,160
Later on, we had a nice box to get a block of ice and you'd put it in a cabinet, and that would keep your food cool for a little while.

246
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:57,590
So if you were going to consume meat, you'd have to go to the butcher shop every day.

247
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:04,580
If you're going to consume vegetables, you have to either consume canned vegetables,

248
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:09,560
dried vegetables or fresh vegetables that you got that were in season.

249
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:17,030
So that was to do that. And everything was pretty much manual labor in 1900.

250
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:29,860
It was very expensive. Now, 2021, the latest data that I can find on this was about 10.3% of our household income is spent on food.

251
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,040
And this is 2021.

252
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:40,170
This is before the inflation that we've seen lately for food as a consequence of supply chain issues that have arisen from the pandemic.

253
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:47,360
It's probably going to be a little bit more than that now, but I know we don't have the data for 2022 yet.

254
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:54,950
So there's a huge difference between the amount of money we're spending on food this time period.

255
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:58,340
So it is less expensive. It's easier to get.

256
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:05,450
Here's another way of looking at this information.

257
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:10,010
And again, these are estimates.

258
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:15,890
The exact number, the exact number in terms of percent is it's within this range.

259
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,830
This would be the best guess.

260
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:30,560
So this is the on the on the Y axis here we have the share of personal income spent on food in the United States, 1961 and 2021.

261
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:41,900
This is the percentage this is the total food here and for food consumed at home and then food away from home during this time period.

262
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:53,150
So food consumed at home has gone down. In terms of the I'm sorry, the share of your disposable income on food has gone down since 1961.

263
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:57,800
The share your disposable income spent on food prepared at home has gone down,

264
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:05,270
and the share of disposable personal income spent away from home has gone up a little bit,

265
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:12,140
but not nearly to the same change that you see in total food or food consumed at home.

266
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:22,760
So it's less expensive and less expensive for us to go out and consume food outside the home in relation to our disposable income.

267
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:40,770
So here's another graph. Um, looking at dollars now, total amount of money spent on food away from and sent away from home during this time period.

268
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:46,170
And it's gone up considerably. And this is food consumed at home.

269
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:53,040
So we're eating a lot of pre-prepared foods or foods prepared at restaurants and fast food restaurants

270
00:33:53,540 --> 00:34:01,080
and stores that are prepackaged or pre-prepared now than we ever were going back to 1961.

271
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:10,770
So what do we know about the differences between food consumed away from home as opposed to food at home?

272
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:14,210
What are the differences? Yeah.

273
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,560
Usually more salt in the food at restaurants.

274
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:21,840
Yeah. Saltier. What else? Yeah.

275
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:26,940
Definitely more salt, more added sugar.

276
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:31,020
Yeah. To accomplish flavor for preservation.

277
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,900
Well, yes. There's more. There's more.

278
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:40,550
More salt. There's more fat. There's more sugar.

279
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:44,350
Things that make food taste good. So that's. So you buy.

280
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:49,010
That's why you buy it, right? Portion sizing that comes later.

281
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:58,250
Yes. The fortunes are bigger as well. Yeah. So when you order something from a restaurant or you buy something in a grocery store,

282
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:05,710
what is the price in comparison shop between brands when you select food?

283
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:11,630
Most everybody does a value conscious and we want to get the biggest bang for our buck.

284
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:18,230
And so if we get a bigger portion size at a restaurant, that's that's good, right?

285
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,700
Because we'll have extra to bring home and consume later.

286
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:27,950
So this value consciousness is like more is better.

287
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,010
We get more for less money. That's that's good, right?

288
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:46,820
So this affects when you look at this type of information in regard to different income levels, you see an interesting picture.

289
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:53,930
So this is food spending, its share of income spent on food across U.S. households in 2020.

290
00:35:55,070 --> 00:36:01,280
And on the left y axis, you have average annual food spent in dollars.

291
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:07,380
Okay. And on the other y axis, you have percent of income, Spanish food.

292
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:12,140
So that would be yellow. And the left axis here would be green.

293
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:22,790
Total spending. So when you look at income quintiles, they've taken people's incomes and they've broken people down into five groups.

294
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:29,570
There are big differences and there's this trend in overall spending.

295
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:36,620
So when we look at the amount of money spent by people in the highest income groups,

296
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:43,100
and I'm not sure where the cutoff here are in terms of how much income that would be considered the highest group.

297
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:50,600
There's this linear increase in the amount of money spent on food.

298
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:54,260
When we look at the share, the percent of income spent on food,

299
00:36:54,570 --> 00:37:03,280
that decreases as we go down the income quintiles to the lowest one where the

300
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:08,060
share of their income is much higher compared to those in the highest income.

301
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:19,090
So if you're spending a larger share of your income on food, what is that going to do to your selection of food choices?

302
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,080
Remember, everybody is pretty much value conscious in terms of what they get.

303
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:29,020
How much will they get for that?

304
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:39,730
And yeah, obviously good things that are shelf stable and they know what they like so they don't waste money on things.

305
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:43,050
More shelf stable food. Good points. Right. What?

306
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:54,910
What what do you need to put into shelf stable food that distinguish it from fresh fruits and vegetables and fruits?

307
00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:01,450
So how about the types of fat cans in the store?

308
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:05,760
Is that right? Well, that is that is that is put into that.

309
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:09,700
And less and less is more stable.

310
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:18,060
It's going to be less prone to oxidation that the saturated fats, the trans fats, a lot of trans fats have been taken out of our food supply.

311
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:25,270
And you'll find it in places like. So how many of you use the pre-prepared casings?

312
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,490
Yeah. There's trans fats in there. There's a lot of trans fat in those cake.

313
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,230
Better to make it yourself with real butter. Okay.

314
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:44,820
It's better than the trans fats because of the saturated fat in both, but no trans fat in the butter.

315
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:54,540
The other place that you'll find it is in. Partially hydrogenated vegetable oil.

316
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,290
So there's room in your diet for four cider mill donuts.

317
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:08,070
I'm not saying you should never eat Cider Hill Donuts, but in donuts and things that are fried, you'll see more trans fats.

318
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:15,310
So that's another place where you might see trans fat. But it's been taken out of many, many different food prices.

319
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,770
You don't see it very much anymore.

320
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:27,150
And in fact, the FDA is required manufacturers to put that amount of trans fat on a food label so you can see which foods have more, which have less.

321
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:38,129
So people who are in that lowest economic group are going to have to buy perhaps more shelf stable foods for the sense that they get more calories,

322
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:44,370
perhaps for per dollar. And that can lead to food choices that aren't the best.

323
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:53,160
And purchasing fruits and vegetables that have less shelf stability may become out of reach for for many households.

324
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:04,970
So that's the United States. How do we compare how to let's compare our data with data from other countries.

325
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:16,700
Okay. So in this particular graph, we're looking at calorie availability and household spending on food at home as a share of consumption expenditure.

326
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:23,450
So the blue bars are calories and this is daily calories per capita in 2013.

327
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,920
And this came from a publication published in 20 2021.

328
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:33,050
So this is the data that they could get during this particular time period.

329
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:41,240
So calories in 2013, calories per capita per day in the United States,

330
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:53,750
very high as we go from high income to middle income to lower income nations, net per capita daily calories per capita declines.

331
00:40:55,070 --> 00:41:03,770
And then when we look at the percent of household spending share in and these bronze colored bars,

332
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:12,080
it starts to go up as we go through high income, middle income and then lower income nations.

333
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:19,220
Food is more expensive as a percent of their total household income.

334
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:31,310
What does that look like? Yeah, I just felt like I do agree with this concept, but I also like the fact that we as Americans.

335
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:39,710
Cats have that ability to spend less money or just a lower class so that they can afford to.

336
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:49,340
So, yes, yes. There's also like if you were to put like incidence of or prevalence of malnutrition, then you'd also probably see a trend.

337
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,920
Yes. I guess in terms of undernutrition. Yes. Yeah.

338
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:00,260
And you would find probably more undernutrition in the lower income nations and

339
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,590
that in the middle income nations then than you do in that in the United States.

340
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:10,609
Yeah, you would see a similar relationship.

341
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:20,660
But instead of we're going to talk about prevalence of overweight, you'd also see a greater prevalence of undernutrition.

342
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:24,260
Right. So that's this next one.

343
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:34,910
So in this particular publication, they show you differences in the prevalence of having a BMI of greater than or equal to 2025.

344
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:43,010
And then they break it down further into underweight, which addresses your point.

345
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,530
Normal weight in orange, overweight and gray and obese and yellow.

346
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:56,600
And they just show women they had data for men. And I don't understand why they didn't show the data for men, but I'll show you here inside.

347
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,400
And so, um, the prevalence of BMI of greater.

348
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,830
So there's some interesting things about Kenya I'm going to mention here in a second, but this is, this is women.

349
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:13,460
This is the total here totals. And then you can see this better than this faint red dot.

350
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:20,930
This is total. This is people living in rural regions and this is people living in urban regions.

351
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:30,830
And there's some interesting differences here. So, um, more so if we look at urban compared to rural, there's more weight,

352
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:38,630
more upward the prevalence of obesity in the urban rather than the rural and in Kenya and Kenyan women.

353
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:48,709
And then when we look at the prevalence of BMI greater than or equal to 25, we find an interesting relationship here in Kenya.

354
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,660
That's not what we see in the United States.

355
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:59,960
So the prevalence of having a BMI of 25 is great, is increased within education, and it's increased within in Kenya.

356
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:14,570
So I don't know why they didn't show the data for man, but the prevalence of having a BMI of of greater than or equal to 25 for men is 17%.

357
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:22,250
I couldn't find a graph like this associated with this paper, but it's a bit higher for women at 38%.

358
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:31,040
So the time at which this data was collected was in around 2014.

359
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:45,320
So although the data was published in 2018, the prevalence of having a BMI in adults in the United States of 25 or greater was 73% and 64% from.

360
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,800
So in other countries, this relationship is a bit different.

361
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,089
And that could be it could be due to a lot of different things.

362
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:05,190
So there are different drivers to changes in weight related to the availability of food.

363
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:11,520
Whether or not you live in an urban or rural environment, there are cultural differences and so on.

364
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:18,200
Okay. Portion size. Somebody mentioned portion sizes.

365
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:26,000
So portion sizes have gotten bigger. And this is largely driven by consumer preferences for value conscious.

366
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:33,410
Always thinking more is better, even though we might not want more because we want to get the biggest bang for our buck.

367
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:39,050
We're more likely to consume something because we don't want to waste it.

368
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:45,760
So bagels back in 1983 were three inches in diameter.

369
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:50,420
You can still get three inch bagels over at the Cardiovascular Center Cafe.

370
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:54,980
They have appropriate portion sizes of food there.

371
00:45:56,510 --> 00:46:07,220
So you could call this the heirloom bagel size, you know, where it's only three inches across and then it's doubled in size and calories.

372
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:16,640
When you look at muffins have gotten huge. And if you want an airline size muffin again at the cardiovascular center, they're smaller.

373
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:23,180
So it's increased by three and a half, 3.3%. French fries.

374
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:28,130
I don't even know if had ordered French fries from a restaurant in years.

375
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:32,630
So I don't know what the small and the large sizes are anymore.

376
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:44,140
So we went from 2.4 ounces to 6.9 ounces, and then a chocolate chip cookies that you would get has increased in size as well.

377
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:54,490
So this is this is data from going back a few years, but we're starting to see more shrinkflation these days.

378
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:56,890
Are you familiar with the concept of Shrinkflation?

379
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:06,220
So I used to work for food companies, so they do this all the time instead of raising prices for a given unit of food.

380
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,950
They would shrink the size to a level that you might not notice.

381
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:16,360
And so how do you do that? Well,

382
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:21,940
you have your purchasing and your sales and your marketing people get together

383
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:28,210
and they decide what's the standard for the market and what people notice.

384
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:34,000
So how do you tell? So they find the standard for the market and they see what other companies are doing.

385
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:39,069
And you have some panels.

386
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:45,940
You get people who buy a particular type of product and you sit them down and you show them the different sizes.

387
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:53,290
And you ask them, are you going to show them three different packages or something like that with no size indication on them?

388
00:47:53,470 --> 00:48:01,270
And you ask them which one is different. And the one that has that shows the least difference is the one that's chosen.

389
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:07,930
And there are other ways to change the appearance of a package to make it look like it has some change.

390
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:11,770
You can change the style. If it's a jar, you can change the style of the jar.

391
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:21,130
If it's a paper or a foil type package, you can have the same package size but less food.

392
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:28,570
So that's that's another way the food industry can get you to think you're buying the same thing at the same price.

393
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:37,340
But you're actually getting less of this this increase in portion sizes may change as a consequence of the pandemic.

394
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:45,230
We'll see. So the next thing.

395
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:52,380
So portion sizes have gone up. The next thing is the cost of healthy food.

396
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:57,660
And when I talk about healthy food, I'm talking about fruits and vegetables, things that have less things.

397
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:11,400
Added some whole foods. I call them Whole Foods. And I had data from 2004 to 2008 showing increases in prices of foods in neighborhoods in Seattle.

398
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:16,320
I've taken that out and I put this particular figure, and this is taken from the United Kingdom.

399
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:26,640
It basically shows the same kind of trend where foods that are this is the price per cow of food.

400
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:33,680
This is in pounds. Now. So the price of what's this green line here?

401
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:43,269
So this is mean price foods by eco group and these are the different equal groups red rice, potatoes, food, drink high and fat and sugar.

402
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:49,749
So this would be the highly palatable food shown here in the magenta line, fruits and vegetables,

403
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:57,460
again in green meat, fish, eggs, beans and brown, and then the milk and dairy in blue.

404
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:03,700
So the cost of fruits and vegetables are much higher than everything else.

405
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:12,880
Okay. And as time goes on, there's a greater increase in the cost of fruits and vegetables compared to all of the other foods.

406
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:20,470
And you'll see some increases with the other food groups, but you're already starting at a higher, higher price.

407
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:26,980
The same would be true for food produced in price in the United States.

408
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,100
This is a more recent figure, so that's why I chose it.

409
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:42,220
So the cost of high, micronutrient, high nutrients and food has is higher and it's going up faster.

410
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:56,500
And the cost of foods high in fat and sugar are less expensive and they're increasing in price, but to a less lesser extent.

411
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:01,669
Okay. Variety of food available today.

412
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:08,540
It's increased. Now, I worked in the food industry and we did this all the time.

413
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:16,280
So if you had one particular food item and you wanted people to keep buying it, you had to change things a little.

414
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:23,540
And if you didn't, you might lose some market share with other companies competitors who did?

415
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:36,230
So this appeals to our wanting to consume our curiosity with other other types of things.

416
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:42,170
So short term and this has been done, studied in rats as well.

417
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:47,060
So short term exposure to sensory variety promotes overconsumption of energy.

418
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:52,730
So this can promote weight gain. It's been shown in laboratory animals.

419
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:57,440
And essentially all you do is give them the same amount of calories,

420
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:03,590
the same amount of calories available, and you just rotate those calories, different types of foods.

421
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:08,030
So there's more variety, there's more curiosity, they're more likely to eat pork.

422
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:17,120
And as a consequence, there's a greater weight gain. So this is this has been shown in humans.

423
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:22,160
So we provide the same amount of calories, different varieties.

424
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,210
You'll consume more.

425
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:36,410
And the food industry does this by offering you a lot more varieties of a particular food, and it's a strong determinant of sales.

426
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:38,730
Kitty had a comment about this. Yeah,

427
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:47,209
I just think it's important to make a distinction that it's a it's like an artificial variety of food because essentially like a bag of potato chips,

428
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:55,670
they're has the exact same preservatives and ingredients because like the amount of like species of plant,

429
00:52:55,910 --> 00:53:01,219
like foods that we're eating has decreased from hundreds and thousands to we

430
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:08,060
get like 90% of our calories from three different foods like soy and corn.

431
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,770
And so essentially in truth, in truth,

432
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:23,000
we are a variety of food and nutrients has decreased dramatically while the artificial variety like 18 flavors at the exact same thing.

433
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:28,760
Yes. Yes. And in that regard, more and more, if you work in a food plant, you know,

434
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:32,810
they don't want to bring it to stuff because it takes up room in their inventory.

435
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:41,930
So bringing in a new flavors like Super Easy because it doesn't take up a lot of space to have a spice bag and bring in like Swiss chard,

436
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:45,070
for example, to pasta. So that can get like very complicated.

437
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,630
Yes. Oh, yeah. So yes.

438
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:50,690
So there's there's there's that as well.

439
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:59,179
So so when I worked in Reason and Development, Research and development and then we would have to scale up what we made in a plant.

440
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:04,820
And that's a handful of people who work in manufacturing facilities change.

441
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:06,049
They don't want to change.

442
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:16,220
They want to do the same thing every day because the people who are the managers are very, very focused on production efficiency.

443
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:20,870
So if production efficiency declines, that's bad.

444
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:27,620
If that means that their bonuses at the end of the year will be lower, it could mean that their raises are lower as well.

445
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:36,499
So anything that disrupts production facilities is a problem in regard to a production manager, in regard to somebody who in product development,

446
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:44,420
hey, we want to continue our business so that we all have jobs, so we're introducing something that will continue the life of the company.

447
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:50,130
So don't you know this idea that we can keep doing the same thing over and over and over again,

448
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:52,969
having a sustainable business model that's not going to work after a while.

449
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:58,340
So there's this there's this pressure between development and manufacturing.

450
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:10,250
And an easy way to get around that is to just say, okay, you have potatoes that are sliced and fried in vegetable oil,

451
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:15,829
partially hydrogenated vegetable, so it's more shelf stable. And instead of just sprinkling salt on them,

452
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:20,030
you could put all different kinds of flavors on them and the tumbler that coats

453
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:25,460
them with these things and use the same production lines and everybody's happy,

454
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:35,659
right? So and so I want to also make this point because I saw some comments about this in the perusal reading.

455
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:40,850
So what's the problem with these these highly palatable, shelf stable foods?

456
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:56,450
Is it the food or is it the way they're preserved? Yeah, well, I know from working in the food industry, we work very hard to make sure,

457
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:02,840
but we're trying to cater the product so that the customer loves to eat too much of it.

458
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,110
Pretty much. And then they come back and they buy more.

459
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:12,410
So sustainable business. Yeah, they're trying to create a business model that's like you're going to buy more.

460
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:13,670
Everyone's happy.

461
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:22,550
And that's kind of the attitude in the food industry is if somebody is buying it, it's not our fault and we're just trying to make a living.

462
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:32,660
Yes, pretty much so. Like it's hard to say they're doing something than say they're just trying to be fine.

463
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:37,190
Yes, exactly. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's the money. It's that's what more is better.

464
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:40,850
More is always better. And that's just a far from my question.

465
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:51,379
Had to do more with them so you can put reiterated has to tally tiny BHP and I can't remember what the fuel is

466
00:56:51,380 --> 00:57:01,010
hydroxy and they are additives that you can put in these kinds of foods to prevent oxidation of the lipids.

467
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:11,460
You know, the level, the threshold of these preservatives that they're putting in here is way below that biological effect.

468
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:16,780
And other words, if you were to dose the biological effect of some of these additives and either a.

469
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:27,670
Old online or in an animal, you'd find that the levels that they're using here are a hundred fold, a thousand fold below those levels.

470
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:35,100
And if people become sensitive, they look at all of the labels and say, I'm avoiding the Tab J.

471
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:39,660
They'll put something else in there that has the same antioxidant effect.

472
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,020
But what it's going to do the same thing.

473
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:48,759
It's going to preserve the lipids and prevent them from being oxidized if you don't put

474
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:55,370
them in the food has a shorter shelf life and oxidized lipids can actually be harmful.

475
00:57:55,390 --> 00:58:02,530
So there's this tradeoff. So think of that. It's the food that's the problem, not the preservatives.

476
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:07,360
So much you would have to consume an awful lot of that food for that to be a problem.

477
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:17,890
Now, in terms of there's this, we'll talk about food addiction next week, but they intentionally tried to addicted to the food.

478
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:22,450
Well, people in the food industry aren't that smart. They wouldn't know how to do that.

479
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:28,720
Well, you know, how to do is to assess your preference for food.

480
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:36,130
They know what you like and what you don't like. All the way down to the size of the chip.

481
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:42,310
So they can have a producer in Idaho grow a certain variety of potatoes.

482
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:46,110
That gets to be a certain size when they harvest it.

483
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:52,300
And after you fry them, a certain turn, a certain color not too dark, but not too light,

484
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:59,020
or they can be nice and flat or they can be all crinkled up, like in the kettle version of the potato chips.

485
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:04,340
They have to figure that out and they know what certain people make.

486
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:08,739
And there are different sectors of that business that people have that the food

487
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:11,740
industry has figured out where they can make money in those kinds of products.

488
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:21,070
So their strategy is so they've probably owned a bunch of different brands that cater to the entire market.

489
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:30,580
Okay. Potato chips. And then they'll use another brand name for an organic, pretty good, more sustainably produced potato chip.

490
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:36,900
Now you appeal to a broader audience. The money goes to the same place stuff.

491
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:44,890
All right. So these little mom and pop old timey labels, they're probably owned by Frito-Lay.

492
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:51,070
And I think it's PepsiCo. Frito-Lay. I'm not really sure these companies are shrinking and expand all the time.

493
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:54,220
I'm not sure what what the corporate structure is now.

494
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:01,660
So keep that in mind. They want a sustainable business model and they will profit that product so that they

495
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:06,250
can maintain that business and will change varieties over time for that purpose.

496
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:11,179
Okay. All right.

497
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:21,800
So in summary, there's been an increase in total energy consumption with more cost of food for as a percentage of household income.

498
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:32,450
Portion sizes have increased. More food is eaten outside the home and has a greater impact on low income households.

499
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:41,330
Energy dense, nutrient poor food is less expensive, and there's greater variety in manufactured or I should say, processed foods.

500
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:52,390
All right. So when you're trying to make a healthy food choice here, this is a gantlet you have to run through.

501
01:00:52,600 --> 01:01:01,809
So if you're traveling and this is at a gas station where you have all these different choices and it's shelf stable,

502
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:10,900
highly palatable food with low flow protein, higher lower fiber and less complex carbohydrates, it's less satisfying.

503
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:20,860
So you're more likely to go back and eat some more. And it's challenging to find nutritious food in these types of situations.

504
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:28,650
So what impact does ultra processed food have on our eating behavior?

505
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:36,130
So this was a question that was addressed in this publication by Kevin Hall.

506
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:39,670
Cell metabolism, COVID 19, you read it last year.

507
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:44,380
We're going to review this because it's important in regard to our eating behavior.

508
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:50,980
So the title of the paper was ultra processed diets, causing excess calorie intake and weight gain,

509
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:54,760
an inpatient randomized controlled trial and limit food intake.

510
01:01:56,850 --> 01:02:00,959
So they provide an introduction about obesity.

511
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:05,400
Type two diabetes are paralleled with an increase in industrialized food production

512
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:11,430
relating to ultra processed foods associated with overeating and weight gain.

513
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:19,200
However, until this paper was published, there was no so no causal relationship between ultra processed foods,

514
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:22,140
food consumption and weight gain had been established.

515
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:37,710
So they collected 20 individuals for this study and they randomly assigned them to do two different in education or in subjects study groups.

516
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,800
So they had two different diets.

517
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:47,570
They were put for two weeks on the ultra processed diet.

518
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:51,230
They're calling them in patients here. So they were in a facility they couldn't get out.

519
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:56,930
All right. So two weeks, two weeks on one diet and then two weeks on the other diet.

520
01:02:57,710 --> 01:03:03,860
So you had ultra processed and unprocessed diet and then they were switched over after two weeks.

521
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:13,820
And at this time, they were they were giving them water so that they could measure energy,

522
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:17,120
that they were they were looking at energy expenditure and energy intake.

523
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:25,730
They were collecting blood samples. They were doing body composition measurements on these individuals.

524
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:31,520
And they were looking for also changes in liver fat with the right measurements.

525
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:42,530
And they had metabolic change takers where they can measure energy, energy expenditure and an oral glucose tolerance test.

526
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:49,940
So this is a very thorough evaluation of changes that might occur in response to.

527
01:03:51,980 --> 01:04:00,860
In response to these changes in diet. So Kevan Hall works at NIH in Bethesda, Maryland.

528
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:05,930
This was an extremely expensive study, and let's see what happened.

529
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:16,310
What are some of these differences? So in this paper there is lots of extra supplemental figures, and this is one of them.

530
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:26,360
And it shows you the difference between unprocessed and ultra processed foods, what it looks like in front of you for breakfast.

531
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:34,140
What's the first thing that you notice right away? If it's a larger portion for the fresh foods.

532
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:39,830
It looks like more food to me. Yeah. Works on process, you know.

533
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:45,540
And then the ultra processed foods, there's less. Now, to me, I would have put a different place next year.

534
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:49,040
The big thing is it's distracting, right? Like are the grapes there?

535
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:53,129
What is that one of the periods. So there's more food.

536
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:59,760
That's the first thing you see. But in terms of calories presented, they presented them with the same amount of calories.

537
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:06,960
And that's the difference. There's a whole lot less in terms of volume in the ultra processed foods.

538
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:18,240
So you have here Greek yogurt with strawberries, bananas and walnuts and salt and olive oil.

539
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:27,120
And then you have apple slices and fresh squeezed lemon and the ultra processed diet you have Honey Nut Cheerios.

540
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:37,530
Little Bowl. You have whole milk with fiber added so that they can match the amount of fiber in each of the different diets.

541
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:43,710
And then you had a blueberry muffin, and with that, they provided some larger.

542
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,990
So margarine is a highly processed food.

543
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:59,280
It's essentially in a motion of oil and water and not solids.

544
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:08,129
And it is, um, with, with the hydrogenation process that goes on in margarine,

545
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:16,560
you can form a lot of these saturated fatty acids in the form of trans fatty acids.

546
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:23,760
So it's a highly processed food. So here's here's a difference in the lunch menu.

547
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:29,340
Here's a spinach salad with lots of fruits, vegetables, grapes for dessert.

548
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:35,309
And then here's the highly processed food you have ravioli, Chef Boyardee,

549
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:42,690
fresh out of the can, and, uh, parmesan cheese, some margarine, some crackers.

550
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:48,870
And over here, you have lemonade and a raisin oatmeal raisin cookie over here.

551
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:52,410
And then the added fiber into the liquid.

552
01:06:53,040 --> 01:07:04,350
And then finally, for dinner, they had this feast here on the left of the unprocessed food roast beef tenderloin.

553
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:11,520
They had lots of steamed broccoli. The salad consisted of lots of fresh vegetables.

554
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:17,430
You had rice pilaf compared to the Tyson steak.

555
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:22,570
The McCormick Gravy fresh out of the jar.

556
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:34,380
Mashed potatoes, which were probably reconstituted in dehydrated margarine, can corn and some more crystallized added fiber.

557
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:38,370
All right. So what happened? Well, here are the snacks, by the way.

558
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:48,120
So you have fruits and raisins and nuts compared with these prepackaged bag chips.

559
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:55,709
Goldfish and some peanuts mixed with with chocolate and whatever else they're putting in here.

560
01:07:55,710 --> 01:08:03,860
And then these peanut butter crackers. And applesauce process is a process Apple is examining.

561
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:05,330
Okay. What happened?

562
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:17,090
So when the subjects were on the ultra processed diet, their energy intake was greater than when they were on the unprocessed diet.

563
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:20,440
Now they were offered the same amount of calories.

564
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:25,550
They weren't told to eat all the food. They were told to eat as much as they wanted to.

565
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:33,410
So when you are presented with less processed food.

566
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:37,220
According to this, over a two week period of time, you'll eat less.

567
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:42,710
What in particular was consumed in a lower concentration?

568
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:46,910
So you saw that they were offered all kinds of different food choices.

569
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:59,720
And the next figure portion of the figure Figure B looked at the energy intake counts per day and in terms of carbohydrate, fat and protein.

570
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:07,820
And there was pretty much the same amount of protein in each of the diets that they consumed.

571
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:17,750
But when you look at the amount of fat and the amount of carbohydrate, they consumed, a bit less in the unprocessed science.

572
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:24,290
And again, they just gave them the food and told them to eat as much as they wanted to.

573
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:31,970
And so what what was consumed in terms of during what meals, was there a difference?

574
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:35,960
It was breakfast and lunch where they saw a difference in energy intake.

575
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,520
When they looked at the visual appeal of the foods.

576
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:46,040
In order to answer the question, well, maybe they didn't like the unprocessed food.

577
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:50,090
Maybe that unprocessed food was more appealing.

578
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:52,990
And there didn't seem to be very much of a difference here.

579
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:59,660
This was not statistically different in terms of the pleasantness or the familiarity of the differences.

580
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:07,920
And then they created some subjective feelings about that.

581
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:16,220
So did they feel was there a differences in hunger between male fullness or satisfaction or eating capacity?

582
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:19,590
And there were no differences in these values that were measured.

583
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:28,260
And then finally and importantly, they looked at how many calories they consumed over a given period of time.

584
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:43,170
And you see here that the meal eating rate was lower for the unprocessed food as compared to the ultra processed foods.

585
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:48,419
So the meal eating rate was higher when you're eating the ultra processed food.

586
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:54,630
So you're eating more grams of food and you're eating them more calories per minute.

587
01:10:55,860 --> 01:11:03,840
You're consuming ultra processed food, a higher rate, and as a consequence, they're consuming more calories.

588
01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:09,600
And then here's some more data looking at how this affected their body weight over time.

589
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:18,570
So more ultra processed food or weight gain. And then when you're on the unprocessed diet, there was less.

590
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,880
There was a change by the weight in a negative direction.

591
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:28,260
When you looked at the relationship between the change in body weight with the change in energy intake.

592
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:38,860
The body weight went up with an increase in energy intake. When they looked at what it in particular in their body had changed and it was fat mass

593
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:44,650
changed with the ultra processed diet that corresponded with this increase in weight.

594
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:52,030
And then over here, they broke it down in terms of change in body weight, change in fat mass, which went up.

595
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:56,950
And then the three fat mass appeared to be different fat free mass.

596
01:11:56,950 --> 01:12:01,520
But there was not statistical discrepancies in these large error bars.

597
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:10,580
Okay. Now, they looked at glucose tolerance and continuous glucose and glucose monitoring,

598
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:21,620
and there really was no difference here in terms of glucose or insulin or differences in the amount of glucose they had on the different diets.

599
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:30,160
So here's the summary with ultra processed diets,

600
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:36,070
one that presented in random order and match to provide calories, sugar, fat, fiber and macronutrients.

601
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:41,590
The add limit of intake is greater during this two week period of time than the unprocessed,

602
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:46,990
and that this corresponded to an increase in body weight over time.

603
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:54,940
So in regard to trends in food intake and this very last portion,

604
01:12:55,360 --> 01:13:02,530
the type of food that people consume, not only are they appearing to consume more calories,

605
01:13:02,530 --> 01:13:10,510
but the type of food that's being consumed, it's ultra processed can lead to an increase in caloric intake.

606
01:13:14,650 --> 01:13:18,280
So you encourage people to eat unprocessed foods.

607
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:27,230
And later on, we'll talk about whether or not consuming diets higher in unprocessed foods does anything to your overall body composition.

608
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,420
Wait, so you had a comment.

609
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:36,080
I just want to point out the limitations of this study, because we looked at it last year as well,

610
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:40,390
like there were only 20 people and they only followed them for a month.

611
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:48,130
So it's definitely not giving and I don't think it's been replicated at a larger scale at all.

612
01:13:48,520 --> 01:14:03,580
And so these findings, it's one single study, only 20 people is very there's a lot of slides making a lot of claims about a very small study.

613
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:08,740
Yeah. So why do you think that?

614
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:14,079
Okay, when we get into interventions, we'll talk about putting this into practice.

615
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:25,479
But what are the limitations of your limitations for the highly controlled study and what would the limitations be for a larger study?

616
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:32,320
Looking at this, where you gave people that came in, you gave them ultra processed, you gave them processed food and you didn't confine them.

617
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:39,280
And they looked for changes over time so we could see what's that?

618
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:49,150
Oh, go ahead. And the appliances. So do this just if you can, because it's very hard to control, as you said, a large number of people.

619
01:14:49,450 --> 01:14:54,360
Okay. We don't want them to eat something different than the food that they are assigned to eat.

620
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:59,049
Yes, that's a great report that might have reporting bias.

621
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:04,930
So, yes, they are reporting that, for example, they eat fruits and veggies, but yeah, 9%.

622
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:08,829
Yeah. So in theory, yeah, you're right, those limitations are significant.

623
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:15,340
But to scale up to something, you introduce a whole nother level of error that might wash everything out.

624
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:20,709
So that's that was that was that would be a limitation of scaling up this to a larger yeah.

625
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:27,880
But this is like a very unrealistic environment. So it's it's difficult to draw any conclusions about the generalizability of these

626
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:33,360
findings given that like no one's like this doesn't this doesn't occur in real life,

627
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:39,070
you know, but you're testing the hypothesis.

628
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:42,200
You're testing hypotheses about the rate of consumption. Yeah.

629
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:45,430
For unprocessed. Yeah.

630
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:50,710
You would need to do more studies to do this at a larger scale would be very challenging.

631
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:57,670
Right now I have a question of the previous slide with the glucose tolerance and monitoring.

632
01:15:58,030 --> 01:16:06,430
Since they've supplemented the ultra processed diet with fiber, do you think the results would have been different had they not?

633
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:19,860
Yeah, that's a good question. What impact do you think that would have had on Monterey if there was no fire?

634
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:27,180
Look, I would sue. I would think that it would be maybe like a sharper spike in blood glucose,

635
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:34,170
considering fiber has sort the ability to slow the release of the bloodstream.

636
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:40,020
That's just what I was thinking about. Possibly. Possibly. That's an interesting point.

637
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:46,800
Yeah. Yeah. But the thing about looking at this is a larger scale kit.

638
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:52,860
It's like if you were to take out the dietary fiber component,

639
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:58,440
how would that change the response that we're seeing and that might be significant show a significant difference as well.

640
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:04,070
Okay. Back to the back to just clarification question. I like it.

641
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:15,970
Did they like match the macronutrient and calorie content of each of the macronutrients or in terms of the amount of food

642
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:22,520
and total calories that were offered to them was to say they consume different levels based on their own preferences.

643
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:30,870
All right. So I've uploaded the PDF for the reading for necks for Monday.

644
01:17:30,870 --> 01:17:39,240
I will put it into perusal this later today and then I will get to the other one up so that you'll have more time to look at these things.

645
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:53,000
All right. Hopefully there are no changes to how my perusal is programed for this class and not be able to keep it off.

646
01:17:54,510 --> 01:18:11,860
But I'm happy to see that we have to discuss.

647
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:17,100
You don't have to go. Oh, we don't have to go back. We don't know.

648
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:21,750
I'd say. I know, I know.

649
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:25,920
There's something I went through. I don't know.

650
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:34,660
I just walk away. But every time you go to my advisor, so I'll get that.

651
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:44,840
I know. I forgot that I need to have the other person that season.

652
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:51,270
Oh, that's nice. That's cool. That's the I can honestly like.

653
01:18:53,590 --> 01:19:16,800
Yeah. Not really doing I, I honestly was running late and I didn't really drop by here but I'm just glad to see that excitement and so yeah.

654
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:23,650
So I'm making it up like that.

655
01:19:25,150 --> 01:19:30,540
Just. It's just.

656
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:55,980
I think you are pretty likely to.
