1
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:07,320
All right. Sorry, that. Okay.

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:16,290
Now we are going to move to the second part of your clinical evaluation of your.

3
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:31,020
Innovative approach. We and what I would like to do in this small set of this slide is to cover to discuss the following segment.

4
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,200
I think we can all do together why we need an innovative approach.

5
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,550
What's the limitation of current approach then?

6
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,840
What are the features of innovative approach?

7
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:52,980
In other words, and what's the purpose of using innovative approach?

8
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:05,730
And also other considerations for vaccine clinical development besides the traditional protective and efficacy,

9
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:16,080
analyzes then challenges in the implementation of ethical responsibility in less developed countries.

10
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:27,620
And we have repeated talking about the need to test the vaccine in representative populations and

11
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:39,110
representative populations for many vaccines that have developed to date a resource limited population.

12
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,120
So what have the ethical concerns and how we can address that?

13
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:52,430
I feel I had some. I heard the suitor update.

14
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,470
I don't know if I confused.

15
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:12,920
Once set to anyway. They can't be too. Um, so this article has covered a lot of innovative approach.

16
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:23,029
I had to try to extract too many of them, except for some involved heavy,

17
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:34,870
complex statistical modeling or the innovative approach, of course, and require complex statistical analyzes and more.

18
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:44,570
But as I mentioned earlier, this is the most to provide you some knowledge.

19
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,470
About what's been exported. You.

20
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,510
In order for you to use all the innovative approach.

21
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:05,480
You have to first have a good understanding how the typical clinical trials use this design design.

22
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:13,180
Then this. You can think about the needs for innovative approach.

23
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:19,180
When you are running this type of course through face of trial.

24
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:27,610
So why we need innovative approach? Because of all the limitations of traditional vaccine clinical development.

25
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:36,010
Long And of course it will require enrolling a huge number of subjects in a fixed design.

26
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,750
As I mentioned earlier in the traditional study, design is very fixed.

27
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:52,090
And then you also we have we increasingly needs to vaccinate the world population

28
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:58,389
to primarily control the epidemics of important new emerging infectious disease,

29
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:03,550
like what we have experience of from COVID 19.

30
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,710
So what are the common features of innovative approach?

31
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:14,590
Or in other words, what's the goal for innovative approach?

32
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:30,190
And it has the hope to reduce developments of time and it requires fewer resources and improve for estimates of and the

33
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:40,749
points of interest and basically be more efficient and can bring effective person to target population in a much faster,

34
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:50,110
less costly way. How this can be done, I would use, I would say a few examples.

35
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:59,590
Yeah, this is the goals for using innovative approach was actually innovative approach in what ways.

36
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:14,590
And so to answer these questions, I thought I would just show a few examples, perhaps of innovative methodology that can seek innovative approach.

37
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:21,310
So one is here at Apple taking four.

38
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,040
Come on, come see. Innovative approach.

39
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:31,560
Why is culture attractive with designs this attractive designs and.

40
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:40,550
You know, modify several aspects of the traditional.

41
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:47,390
Study design to adapt to what's happening during the trial.

42
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:53,580
This is why we've called adaptive design one another's master protocols.

43
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:02,879
Basically, you're like I mentioned earlier, you could have won the the comparison group,

44
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,860
but then you had Matterport testing, using the testing groups,

45
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:19,720
using the same platforms and the correlates of protection basically, instead of waiting for this to happen to measure a traditional protective.

46
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,920
If I see you, can you protect me?

47
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,790
But if you don't understand what protective immunity.

48
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:36,120
This would not be possible. This is why there are some second recourse you can be after as the try.

49
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,430
Then using real world data to.

50
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:50,360
Absolute facts and. So what's the tactical design in boxing?

51
00:06:51,980 --> 00:07:06,210
The definition is. Such a clinical trial design that allows for prospectively planned modifications to one or more aspects of the design based on.

52
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,650
Human eye data from subjects in the trial.

53
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,500
So this is a pre planned.

54
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:21,940
You know you you define severe situation when that happens.

55
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:31,000
You could modify you. The goal is to more efficient to select the right treatment and the population.

56
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:37,820
In other words, you may have a multiple person that's doing the trial.

57
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,520
If you see one, this is very promising.

58
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,140
Could be done. You can use.

59
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:51,470
We're focused on. And then also it can you know.

60
00:07:53,140 --> 00:08:00,030
Select the population, say sample when you're earlier term to the tribe.

61
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:07,780
This is because there was no obvious protection for some population you don't want to continue.

62
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:16,240
But with this innovative adaptive design, you define the situation.

63
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:26,680
During your initial study design, say when we say these, we have the possibility to do a,

64
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:36,850
Y, A, B, C, then it can reduce sample size to a promising vaccine to tackle the population.

65
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,690
Or B, so let's take a close look at this.

66
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:48,730
A different path. Why is the treatment selection adaptive sameness design?

67
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,479
What does this a good example for this study?

68
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:05,110
Design is used the fourth of nine variants HPV vaccine efficacy based on extensive knowledge of four variants HPV.

69
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:14,980
So for more information, you could look at these some of the characteristics of.

70
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:28,030
This. Maybe some of you work reduces the study, but basically in this study, roughly,

71
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:44,170
I think this is the 1250 subjects who were equally randomized into four arms, low dose, the medium dose, the high dose and the forbearance HPV.

72
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:48,460
But this is a trial for nine year and HPV.

73
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:58,640
So they they use a. It's well known vaccine and reference.

74
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,770
This is a phase two trial and then also has the pilot study.

75
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:11,180
So the primary endpoint was the process of those two immunogenicity,

76
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:22,670
the original for valence HPV panels they used and the points based on the immunogenicity and the safety data.

77
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:29,180
The medium dose was selected for the phase three confirmatory.

78
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,900
That was you can read this after the course.

79
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:42,970
The features are for treatment selection, adaptive synthesis design.

80
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:52,610
It's a great read using this resource and time by avoiding the gap between phase two and phase three.

81
00:10:52,910 --> 00:11:07,780
Like I say, when they did the phase two, they observed when dose showed very good protection that directed to the expanded much larger population.

82
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:13,670
So phase three, there was no gap between two weeks of reports approval.

83
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:22,400
They immediately moved to phase three, then the incorporation of the related the phase two data in the final analyzes.

84
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:29,629
So it's not like a complete wrap up phase to then move to phase three instead of doing

85
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:37,520
the phase two when they observed in the fourth year and the medium they have low,

86
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,870
medium, high dose.

87
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:52,010
The medium dose showed the idea of protection and the safety data they simply use that as the incorporates that those into phase three.

88
00:11:52,380 --> 00:12:00,950
Just expanded this study sample to over 10,000 something is.

89
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:08,690
So all the phase two data collected the proxy extended the data or included in the final analyzes.

90
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:14,870
That's why it's a2/3. It was not a separate of two or three trial.

91
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:28,340
Find this paper to take a close look at the computer computing, the sensor, so this need for addressing statistical error and operational challenges.

92
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,840
And of course, this is some patient.

93
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,770
And then another type of and this is the study arm.

94
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:43,800
You basically when you start the phase two trial with multiple, you find one.

95
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,280
So one dose is very effective. Then you basically expand it.

96
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,160
And that's that's a supportive treatment with the adaptive study.

97
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:00,320
But that is another type of attack. The study is related to the population.

98
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:15,260
You're a population enrichment adaptive design strategy for an event of driving back some facts proposed by some so and the context in 928.

99
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:23,960
So this from this type of design basically is to select the promise of population

100
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:30,610
at an interim analyze to maximize the probability of clinical trial success.

101
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:37,040
For a complete a detailed proposal of this strategy.

102
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,110
You can read this reference I gave here.

103
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,780
Basically,

104
00:13:44,780 --> 00:14:03,229
they have a two population start rates and the total sample of faces three was around 6000 with patients with both subpopulations A and sub population

105
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:16,820
B and you can see here and then for each sample to ratio subject where you query randomized into active or treatment of vaccine and the placebo.

106
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:30,700
So that's the then when the study was conducted while the lower bands of 95% confidence interval.

107
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:51,520
Defined as 25%. Then during the study, they found one of the population was, you know, could not pass the futility study.

108
00:14:51,540 --> 00:15:01,860
Basically, if you it is an interim analyze to see if there's the potential to pass the this.

109
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:18,400
You know trial then they basically dropped the one that's not so has said she wanted to study and expand it's the one that's promising.

110
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:28,320
So that's a you only focus on the population where there's potential to.

111
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:35,560
And you can see here. Some.

112
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:51,490
It's very hard to try and get favors once in a while, but periodically your thought is simply passed and then only have to pass through the.

113
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,960
He's going to be used for the final analysis.

114
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,530
Then another way to do adaptive food.

115
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,870
So the study is called the sample size race dimension.

116
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:17,840
And as I just showed you early, the a lot of time when you do this phase three trial,

117
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:24,530
you represented the city, the surveillance state disease was very poor.

118
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:36,950
The researchers were have to establish if the more accurate disease incidence data prior to running into the trial

119
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:46,460
you basically you do epidemiological studies before you decide to have the trial and this in this population.

120
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,470
So these are to full sample designs.

121
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:58,370
It's basically allowing you to determine if you change your sample size.

122
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:10,760
Doing the interim analyzes the essential idea is to use the interim analyze data to modify the final sample size.

123
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:23,420
This work doesn't address the ancestry trial design assumptions about the occurrence of the disease as when the disease occurrence is unpredictable.

124
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:32,660
You were helpful to, you know, to the adjustments, but you know, the time, the fix, the design, you don't have these.

125
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:38,390
So these were definitely back, you know, more.

126
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,940
How many are just the study design in sample size?

127
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:54,190
And this probably happens quite often when you add to trial in the population where the.

128
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,260
Disease surveillance data is lacking or not adequate.

129
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,400
And the master protocol for vaccine development.

130
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:16,560
This is another type of adaptive. We see adaptive in terms of population, in terms of sample size, in terms of treatment.

131
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:22,290
And then you another type is called among the protocols.

132
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:35,260
Basically, you you establish a platform protocol that you use it for, for multiple candidates to determine the benefits and the risk of things.

133
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:44,550
I include an example for all of these. This is a particular tool in the development of COVID 19 vaccines.

134
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:52,320
And then there's this adaptive master protocol.

135
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,330
Most of the water has been used in the COVID 19 vaccine.

136
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:08,900
If you look at the and actually treatment, you can see they have done a lot for treatment.

137
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,710
This is a reference for you to. Look at.

138
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:25,740
So generally speaking, this the master protocol design includes these two types one basket trials,

139
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,720
you revaluate a single treatment across different populations.

140
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:37,590
So you have only one candidate, but you evaluate across different populations.

141
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,920
You have a similar design and a similar protocol.

142
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:49,680
And that's why the Cold Master Protocol and another condom is called an umbrella house or platform.

143
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:57,410
Tris, this is a focus on scrutiny, multiple treatments of someone with one disease type.

144
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:10,110
But this design also allow to focus on disease in person rather than having the specific goal of evaluation or treatment.

145
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,720
Single treatment so individually.

146
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:20,580
So it could be a combination of four different potential treatment.

147
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:38,380
This is useful in drug development quite often, but what's really relevant for vaccine development and other correlates of protection traditional.

148
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:46,450
Clinical trials actually consider immunogenicity data as a secondary.

149
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:57,010
Although today became like the especially when you have to do this or emergency use authorization,

150
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:05,500
you don't necessarily have the time to observe the disease occurrence or collect the data for that.

151
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:13,950
But if you know of protective immunity, for example, for COVID 19, the neutralizing antibody for spike protein,

152
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:21,010
then you could use this as a surrogate marker for the protective effects.

153
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:29,780
So this is very important. So high frequency intensive punching in vaccine development, uh, you know,

154
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:40,420
since the pandemic and if you establish successful as the immuno marker could be used as a surrogate endpoint to predict the vaccine fix.

155
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:49,419
This of course would be less costly because it's like almost like shortly following the vaccine if you know this neutralizing

156
00:21:49,420 --> 00:22:01,600
antibody is the correlates to protection and then you just make sure that that's the challenges for managing the vaccine.

157
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:07,990
We don't really know particular one of the reason to be vaccinated today.

158
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:18,360
I mentioned earlier, 100 years later, we still haven't gotten to second license the vaccine after BCT.

159
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:22,000
That was the pioneer a century ago.

160
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:31,390
So one of the major reasons we know a lot of the immune response following BCG vaccine or tbia vaccine,

161
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:39,190
but we don't know the specific subset represents the protection only you know,

162
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:48,760
the specific protective immunity you would be able to do correlation study.

163
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:58,330
That's that's supposed to be much more cost effective that's why understand the what's the

164
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:06,370
protective immunity could be the you know and important to the scientific course that doesn't

165
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:15,190
necessarily have to be for the licensure purpose if you have but you want to learn you want to

166
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:24,610
learn or different immune response induced by vaccine which subset is correlated with protection.

167
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:39,830
So this importance of question to first of. And to study the correlation of immune response to protection.

168
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:46,000
But there are trials named vaccine immunogenicity trials.

169
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:56,350
Sorry, Ben. Ben, focus of these kind of trials is to understand the, you know, immune response.

170
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:10,630
And the endpoint is based on immune response. That's based on disease occurrence is based can response use for vaccine dose funding and after mosquito

171
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:19,210
selection do early phases and immunogenicity outcomes remain primary endpoint for vaccine breeding trials,

172
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,670
combination trials and a large to large consistency of trial.

173
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,660
This, of course, is more after licensure,

174
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:44,200
but the immunogen study or trial it's where you that those for effect studies you can design play critical roles throughout the vaccine people.

175
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:54,399
Yeah you can do this small and then real words data basically is the use of real world data or the data

176
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:03,790
collection trial design and and I you can use the maybe the setting data to lend the protective immunity.

177
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:14,650
For example, protective immunity is critical for vaccine development, but you don't necessarily just run that in a vaccine trial.

178
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:22,120
You can then through our regular epidemiology study, case control studies, for example,

179
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:29,950
you can see for those who develop TB compared to those who do not develop,

180
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:35,800
what are the differences in their immune response, you know, following infection.

181
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:43,060
So these are real words, the data that can inform vaccine research, but they are not really clinical trials.

182
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:57,370
They are clinical studies and epidemiological studies to understand the relevance that collect relevant data, have relevance to vaccine.

183
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:08,620
And of course, since it does access some clear, there are many different innovative approach just to save time, save resource.

184
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:14,530
And then we have this a larger group for that called the Adaptive Study.

185
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:24,700
And adaptive basically means that you make change to your design during the process of trial and you

186
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:34,780
could to change your treatment those selection and you can change your study population sample size.

187
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:42,460
Does that affect or is based on the interim analyzes of the vaccine trial?

188
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:52,360
Then we talk about this master protocol. It's also for the same purpose reduce resource and time needed for vaccine.

189
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:57,280
And you could do one treatment across different population.

190
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:03,640
You could do, you know, multiple treatments for achieving disease.

191
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:10,000
So if can be collected, it don't have to be a separate project,

192
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:19,209
then this real world data is really to do epidemiological clinical epidemiological studies.

193
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:26,350
The first studies to understand the pathogenesis, the immune immunity,

194
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:42,490
really to reduce the susceptibility to disease redo relates to increase the resistance to disease between case and control or cross sectional studies.

195
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:59,770
You try to describe, characterize the immune profile of the individuals and then you try to find out what's the unique immune response in the

196
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:06,760
individuals who are protected compared to those who are not protected from this natural infection I'm talking about.

197
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:13,420
So you can find the what's the potential correlates of protection?

198
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:22,149
Then you can use that knowledge to design your vaccine trial and then you for something for the vaccine or your fruit,

199
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,870
for a given disease pathogen, which we know very well.

200
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:39,760
We must have like this particular. Antibodies, and then you can just make sure that you're doing that as a sort of a marker for protection.

201
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:49,420
So this a difference. And then another some I want to emphasize actually re-emphasize I mentioned early.

202
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:54,340
Traditionally, we measure reduction of disease.

203
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:01,340
In the population. Study population of vaccine trials.

204
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:06,260
But today with you have learned for the.

205
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:19,230
SAP the COVID vaccine, and it's given dozens of companies to protect the vaccinated people from getting infection.

206
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:27,660
But if you are vaccinated and you may have a much lower risk for severe disease to die.

207
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:34,710
So this is very important to what we call the burden of the disease.

208
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:42,780
Basically, severity of the disease is the interest of not necessarily just having disease or not.

209
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:51,150
Another important since asymptomatic events, this is, of course, very challenging.

210
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:58,830
This means that basically it's to protect against the infection, no infection.

211
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:03,899
It's not just noticing that this will require measure.

212
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:14,770
One would need to require repeatedly measure the vaccine of the infection like you were to COVID testing.

213
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:23,400
If you are going to study a vaccine, previous vaccine against asymptomatic infection, that means you need to have a study sample.

214
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:33,450
You need to regularly measure that because these were where you had to labor and not sure how effective.

215
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:43,950
So study asymptomatic even is interesting from the control of infection perspective

216
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:52,350
because of some asymptomatic people could also spread some respiratory infection,

217
00:30:52,350 --> 00:31:04,440
including TB. But another hand study the protection against infection and asymptomatic events can be quite a challenge.

218
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,380
Another important issue is related to vaccine.

219
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:16,800
Safety is a possibility. What we call the multiplicity issue.

220
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:28,160
It's a possibility of an excess of false positive findings, not clinical meaningful due to cancer, the large enrollment of vaccine trials.

221
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:37,879
Sometimes you may have actually a higher than and what the problem may not be clinically really meaningful.

222
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:48,470
But you may see more than I already talked about and post the license, your vaccine, the surface hands.

223
00:31:48,980 --> 00:32:03,830
This is really important. I'm doing vaccines with the see as you saw with the COVID 19 after being introduced to larger population,

224
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:15,950
there have been some reports of some side effects which was not necessarily observed or this is not to the extent of concern.

225
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:21,140
So continued surveillance is important.

226
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:36,070
Now this part mostly is for information or for when and then challenges in the implementation of ESC response in less developed countries.

227
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:44,560
Here. Yeah, we've talked about all these different priorities.

228
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:51,780
Science, traditional innovation. I think one of the um, one.

229
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:04,730
Characteristics or requirements is has the largest number of cases in the prison system, which is a resource.

230
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,340
So then when you do trials in this population.

231
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:21,380
You have a unique look. Thanks so much for from the researchers and you need to take the basic responsibility.

232
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:27,870
First that your research protocols are reviewed and approved by an independent.

233
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,240
Local. You have to decide for local.

234
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:41,630
What are the need for local expertize in research and use them to date?

235
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:48,530
I said This is much better than many years ago and I thought this would be a trend.

236
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:57,690
And then we also, as a researcher, we want to minimize the risk of participation and provide a reasonable risk.

237
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:08,860
Rachel But then the challenge is the assessment of the risk benefit can be affected by the high risk health.

238
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:24,430
For example, for health bill, which is a completely different population, may suffer from the effects of modern nutrition and other co-morbidity.

239
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,050
That's always a challenge. It's a risk benefit.

240
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:35,260
Assessment. Regional assessment. So it has to be very individual population based.

241
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:45,610
So that was the case. And then we need to provide some reasonable benefits from research without causing this.

242
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:50,560
So what we do, I argue that people will always want to watch for this, but.

243
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:56,420
Even minor is some people, for example, male and.

244
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:02,960
Meal or transport from one. A small to.

245
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,400
For soldiers, the reasons might not be applicable.

246
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:19,180
And then also individual informed consent as census forms are required.

247
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:26,610
That's a lot of time in those countries. People.

248
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:30,660
I mean, you people don't read this.

249
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,680
The four different states have proven to be.

250
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:49,130
First of all, many of those people come to the. Well, you used to be converted, and you could sometimes see.

251
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,050
People's information was. Name something.

252
00:35:55,130 --> 00:36:00,390
Something is very confidential according to our standards.

253
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,070
Those. Can you just.

254
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:16,210
Very. Since then, Stephanie has appeared for dangerous diversion.

255
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,440
The research. This is a requirement.

256
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:34,020
I don't think if we don't anticipate what's at the press conference in possible and provide that treatment to the public,

257
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:45,720
and this would have to be addressed the fact that in reality this can be explored.

258
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:58,649
So potential ways to address this, the challenge is to use the delay effects ratio as a comparative, which is usually a face of lower power that.

259
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:09,390
Oh, and I actually should mention one more one more thing is that doing vaccine trials, if we introduce a very successful,

260
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:16,860
a good virus, you will see the overwhelming protection among the vaccinated, the population.

261
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:26,340
And then after the of the the doing the vaccine trial, you may see that good.

262
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:33,720
There might be some early version of vaccine which is not as good as the new one, but still working.

263
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:42,280
But when you do a trial, you want to compare when you typically compare with a plus, which is not.

264
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,300
So that means that you have to wish to.

265
00:37:45,780 --> 00:38:00,030
And the vaccine that's in use in the population that could BCG and the has been thwarted is use if future if we are using vaccine for

266
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:14,140
a new vaccine in a clinical trial that means that we have if you have to wish to a BCG that were not is because it is already used.

267
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:25,139
So in that case you could delay vaccination as a comparator and of course it will not be so effective.

268
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:36,240
Word design. What this means is you can show them how to vaccinate versus a delayed vaccination anyway.

269
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,750
So this is just mostly information.

270
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:50,130
So to summarize, traditional vaccine clinic can be time consuming and the high course reasons of need for use an innovative approach.

271
00:38:50,670 --> 00:39:03,060
The innovative approach discussed above has demonstrated the benefits are reduce the bias at an accelerated timeline and efficiency of trial features.

272
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:15,540
Of course all these. Approach required very sophisticated statistical analyzes of tools modeling.

273
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:27,150
Some of them can be quite complex, but we already see a good number of, for example,

274
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:35,520
how the innovative approach could really accelerate vaccine development, particularly for that conflict.

275
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:48,110
Yeah, I finished 30 years, so we can discuss a little bit and new questions first.

276
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:59,670
Yes. The director.

277
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:13,290
He. So that's the nice thing about the country.

278
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:30,140
That's a. To the side of the.

279
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:47,110
Yeah. Have be. You know.

280
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:54,810
Before a vaccine has been. You already said, even when you.

281
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:01,440
Want to go. You spent lot research for.

282
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:09,150
I think you may face it differently, Spencer.

283
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,560
Risk prosecution, for example, national HIV defense.

284
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,270
You know, is serious. It has to be.

285
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:28,930
HIV infected. But in the population at the same time.

286
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:38,360
Five. Which means what it means.

287
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,360
I'm. Then.

288
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,310
Generally, I think you have to.

289
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:09,080
The person is given. If you want to.

290
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:16,570
Well, we still have to. Kind of seeped into the population probably.

291
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:22,950
And. That's a holding back.

292
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:27,550
That's it. Doing back to.

293
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,580
Back to. Not the spending that used to be.

294
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:51,500
I just. Now we talk about the nuclear axis.

295
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:55,190
That's right. Because today we have many facts.

296
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:58,820
And that's a very useful way to.

297
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:02,480
Because I'm not giving to paper.

298
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:11,750
So let me turn off. This is some friendly.

299
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,110
And I.
