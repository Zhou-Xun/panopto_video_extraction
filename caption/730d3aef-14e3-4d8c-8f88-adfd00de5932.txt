1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,724
So, today we're gonna give you an opportunity to practice your

2
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:14,540
reflection skills.

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,785
We're gonna do so generally by giving you some patient prompts asking you

4
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,436
to construct a reflection.

5
00:00:20,436 --> 00:00:24,916
And then we'll share with you one or two that we might have come up with for

6
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:28,140
that same patient scenario.

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,540
So, let's begin by letting you practice constructing reflect their statements.

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,801
Let's remind you about a few of the basic rules about reflective listening.

9
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:39,841
So, first of all,

10
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:43,941
there's sort of the long form in the short form on the left is the long form.

11
00:00:43,941 --> 00:00:46,180
It has things like it sounds like.

12
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,611
So, you're saying that I think you may be saying correct me if I'm wrong.

13
00:00:49,611 --> 00:00:52,251
Those are fine, but they're not needed really.

14
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:54,740
What is heard by the patient is the word you.

15
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,507
So, if you want to use the short form start with you or it.

16
00:00:57,507 --> 00:00:59,652
But if you wanna use the long form, because for

17
00:00:59,652 --> 00:01:03,227
many people it's very comforting internally for them to say it sounds like,

18
00:01:03,227 --> 00:01:06,041
because that's a prompt for them to generate a reflection.

19
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:10,943
So, use either the long form of the short form today here nine words that you'll

20
00:01:10,943 --> 00:01:12,856
probably be able to use today.

21
00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:17,568
And throughout your career, they really are words that capture the struggle of

22
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:24,140
behavior change and the ambivalence about motivation.

23
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,966
And as we've mentioned, let's try and use mostly you followed by it and

24
00:01:28,966 --> 00:01:30,484
not too often I and we.

25
00:01:30,484 --> 00:01:33,502
Here's an example of how the same patient or

26
00:01:33,502 --> 00:01:38,651
client statement could generate a simple content reflection on the left.

27
00:01:38,651 --> 00:01:42,573
Or more complex reflections in this case of feeling and

28
00:01:42,573 --> 00:01:46,260
meaning reflection in the middle and on the right.

29
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:46,931
They're all good.

30
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:47,631
They're all useful.

31
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:50,381
But just want you to see how on the left it's simple.

32
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:51,161
You don't add much.

33
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:53,660
You just sort of reflect the basic facts of the story.

34
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,728
And as you move towards the right,

35
00:01:55,728 --> 00:02:02,640
we're starting to infer we're starting to use some insight to connect the dots.

36
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,639
One final rule to remember before we start with the practice cases is where possible.

37
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,411
Affirm effort even if there's been no success.

38
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:15,740
So, they may have died it many times gained it all back.

39
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,051
But the effort they put into that should be affirmed with reflections.

40
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:20,601
You've put a lot of effort into this.

41
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:21,611
You're invested in this.

42
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:23,240
This is important to you.

43
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,457
These are important,

44
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:28,640
because often the patient has made efforts that have not come to fruition.

45
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,640
We wanna be able to get something positive out of that.

46
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,930
So, for the rest of our session today, I'm gonna give you some prompts that

47
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,540
are around obesity, physical activity and nutrition.

48
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,165
And then you're gonna come up with a reflection.

49
00:02:43,165 --> 00:02:50,540
Take a look at the first client statement.

50
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,832
What feeling can you infer from this statement and might you be able to

51
00:02:54,832 --> 00:03:00,140
affirm some effort here, go ahead, construct your first reflection.

52
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:14,240
It can be written down or it can just be in your head.

53
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,740
So what did you come up with?

54
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,326
Here's when you could have used,

55
00:03:18,326 --> 00:03:21,940
you're disappointed that your daughter isn't losing more weight?

56
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,511
Because you've been trying so hard?

57
00:03:23,511 --> 00:03:26,240
You've been trying your best to follow the program.

58
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,350
So, we have a feeling here disappointed.

59
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,041
And we have affirmation.

60
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,840
You've been trying your best.

61
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,540
Did you capture both the feeling and the affirmation?

62
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,040
Let's go on to another case.

63
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,540
Let's take a look at another client's statement again.

64
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,840
What feeling were could you infer from this?

65
00:03:47,840 --> 00:04:02,640
And is there an opportunity here to affirm effort?

66
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,640
What did you come up with?

67
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,871
Here's some things you could have said.

68
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:06,910
You've put a lot of effort.

69
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,581
Affirmation, losing weight.

70
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,531
It's important to you remember they said with send.

71
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:13,161
We don't want to miss something that intense.

72
00:04:13,161 --> 00:04:17,541
So, you're starting to feel desperate, things don't seem to be working for you.

73
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,640
You're looking for another way.

74
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,250
Okay, another client statement.

75
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:33,369
Take a look.

76
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:35,940
What did you come up with?

77
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,140
Here's a couple of reflections that could have worked.

78
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:47,940
Take a look.

79
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,730
I hope you can see here rolling with resistance.

80
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,191
You don't really like exercise and you hate the gym.

81
00:04:53,191 --> 00:04:54,840
It's a chore for you.

82
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,361
But then we also are introducing this idea through a double sided reflection.

83
00:04:59,361 --> 00:05:03,640
Part of you would like to work out more, part of you wants to work on your health.

84
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,398
You see how we're starting to pick on the change,

85
00:05:06,398 --> 00:05:11,740
talk even though it's embedded within a double sided reflection?

86
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:19,866
Take a look.

87
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:24,736
Again, can you see some feelings here and can you see an opportunity

88
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:30,140
to affirm effort despite the absence of recent success?

89
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:35,631
Go ahead, construct your reflection.

90
00:05:35,631 --> 00:05:41,726
So, you're upset that your lack of weight loss and

91
00:05:41,726 --> 00:05:45,980
you've been trying really hard and

92
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,391
you're not seeing any results now.

93
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,571
These are not fantastic reflections there.

94
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:54,540
Okay, there's sort of a B plus.

95
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,850
You could come up with a more creative word other than upset.

96
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,281
Okay, what could you use?

97
00:06:00,281 --> 00:06:03,940
Perhaps frustrated, disappointed?

98
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,494
Maybe even devastated if that's what you think they're feeling and

99
00:06:07,494 --> 00:06:11,061
you've been trying very hard to eat better, that's affirmation.

100
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:12,851
But you also can use some of the other ones.

101
00:06:12,851 --> 00:06:18,240
This is really important to you, you're putting in all the effort, etc.

102
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,625
So, we've given you a chance today to start creating

103
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,940
reflections with real promise.

104
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,342
These were all in the context of diet and physical activity, and

105
00:06:29,342 --> 00:06:32,051
weight loss as we progress throughout the course,

106
00:06:32,051 --> 00:06:38,999
will give you opportunities to practice reflections and other health domains.
