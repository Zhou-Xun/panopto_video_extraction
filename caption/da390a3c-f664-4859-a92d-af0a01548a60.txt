1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,350
You drive over here? It's alphabetical.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:13,600
Oh, yeah. This one. Who to call you?

3
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,600
Okay. Okay. Okay.

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,280
I'm not complaining. I say take your time to sleep all the time.

5
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:43,890
But we do something like this as a picture like this.

6
00:00:48,520 --> 00:01:03,710
I have to deal with this because I will try to enjoy it.

7
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:19,710
Yeah, like, I was actually like, you know, maybe you drive your car, something drive out with me, right front of me.

8
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,560
Right. So I don't know what I'm supposed to be.

9
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:33,090
Well, you see, it's like this for me.

10
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:45,629
That is a sign of respect that we're like, Oh, that's all right, we'll get started.

11
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:54,209
If you haven't already, you can come get your test. I want to just talk, give you a summary, let you know what the distribution was across the class,

12
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,580
and then go over some of the most commonly incorrect answers.

13
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,060
The answer key is online or it should be.

14
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,620
Or if it's not, I will make sure that it is. After today's class, it's under answers.

15
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:13,950
Answer Can you test one so you can look if we don't discuss that question?

16
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,510
So I was a little bit surprised, to be honest, maybe it was a fire drill, but like here's the distribution of scores.

17
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,620
So there were perfect scores, but there are a lot of not so perfect scores.

18
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,969
And the mean was a 78% and the median was 81%.

19
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:35,430
So if you were upset about your grade, you can look at probably lots of other people.

20
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,780
Then similarly, I just want to let you know that don't freak out.

21
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,520
This is the first test. You have another test? Possibly I will.

22
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:52,260
You wait. The tests such that this was like your warning, you know, now you know what the next test would be.

23
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,550
And then the next test can be more than worth more than this test.

24
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,100
If you have other ideas, let me know. But I'm not going to have extra credit because I don't have time to create it.

25
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:10,920
And so I'm happy to figure out how to make your grades that are based on your grades, but not more stuff.

26
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,340
And you don't you don't want to do it right. Like, you don't you don't have time either.

27
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,200
So we'll just figure out how we can make sure that, you know,

28
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:29,940
the grades are representative of the overall distribution that is positive at the end of the class.

29
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,819
Okay. So let's go over some common errors. So this was one of the most common errors.

30
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:41,040
The second question and it was asking about an HIV trial.

31
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:48,780
And I think maybe because I use the example of HIV often for chromosomes, a lot of people chose a serum design.

32
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,459
But what I really wanted you to think about was not just the setting of the disease,

33
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,540
but the fact that there are only two dose levels here and 12 people.

34
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,240
And so when there are only two dose levels,

35
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:08,850
it doesn't make a lot of sense to have this CRM adaptive design when you could very easily do this three plus three.

36
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:16,620
And you're not actually going to get much more necessarily precision out of the CRM because you just have only 12 people.

37
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:26,670
So the the answer here was a three plus three design, mostly because of the super low amount of doses and also the low sample size.

38
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,790
Yeah. Any questions on this one? Yeah.

39
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,860
So for a three plus three design, if we already choose like the second dose and second dose is safe,

40
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,870
but there is still other patients hasn't been recruited.

41
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,739
Should we continue to recruit those people or so.

42
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:55,440
That's so right. If you have a three plus three design and say you have already chosen that, you've already figured out that the second dose is safe.

43
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,700
Right. And you're on like six patients or nine patients, if you could recruit up to.

44
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,360
Well, do you still recruit? So maybe. Maybe not. So she says she could recruit us.

45
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,040
Right up to 12 are only 12 not beyond that.

46
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,020
And so at some point you could just stop at nine or stop at six.

47
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:19,420
Alternatively, you can do what's called an expansion cohort and add on extra patients at that MTG just to get more data.

48
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:27,100
Now there are some varying beliefs about whether we should do expansion cohorts or not.

49
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,939
But you could. Okay.

50
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:40,430
So then this one, number seven, in the conduct of clinical trials, collective ethics play a more important role compared to individual ethics.

51
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:49,010
So maybe this was a misunderstanding of what I was asking and or misunderstanding understanding of the concept.

52
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,819
But right. So clinical trials are definitely for public health. We are trying to make changes in treatment to a larger, broader group.

53
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,190
So collective ethics in that sense is very important.

54
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:06,500
However, individual ethics are very, very important in clinical trials, such that we don't want to harm the people involved in the trial.

55
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,450
Right. So there is some BS data safety monitoring boards, there's institutional review boards.

56
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:17,300
There is a lot that goes on in terms of the ethics of the actual trial and those involved in it.

57
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:29,990
So this is false, right? We must upheld and we must uphold individual ethics as well as thinking about the collective ethics and the questions.

58
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:39,170
Yes. So you said like individual. Does that individual mean like your personal ethics or the individual ethics of like one single trial?

59
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,330
So individual ethics means the ethics of an individual.

60
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,549
So like the treating of one person. Right.

61
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,740
So treating of one individual versus collective means across lots of individuals.

62
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,870
If the wording is not clear in the future, right for the next test, come up and ask a question.

63
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:05,270
Right. So like if you had that question and you answered one or you thought of something else, just come up and ask me and I'm happy to clarify.

64
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,450
Okay. And then this is just one,

65
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:18,160
one really good example of how individual ethics are very important and how they came before or they should have come before.

66
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,200
Collective ethics is the Tuskegee Syphilis Study.

67
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,389
So if you remember that example,

68
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:31,400
they were studying primarily black men with to see the natural history of syphilis so that they could help everyone else who had syphilis.

69
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,580
However, they were really harming the people in that study.

70
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:44,450
And so this is a very unfortunate, good example of terrible ethics, right, where they let individual ethics go to the wayside,

71
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:50,900
trying to get trying to have a better idea of what to do for other individuals.

72
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,950
Okay. This one is also related. So this was number eight.

73
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:02,390
An investigator agrees to be part of a randomized phase two trial, but the investigator doesn't actually feel equally about the two drugs.

74
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,070
What is it called when you're supposed to be equal about the two drugs?

75
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,880
Do you remember that word? That's equipoise, right?

76
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,940
Yeah. So that's one we're supposed to have equipoise.

77
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:21,460
The physicians, the clinicians, the clinicians or physicians study investigators, they're supposed to feel equal about the drugs in the trial.

78
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,399
Now, this person shouldn't be on this trial. Right. Let's say that they pretended like they did.

79
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:33,970
And then they have this patient and the investigator ignores the randomized treatment assignment and decides which drug to administer,

80
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,410
what violate, what principle the Belmont Report is violated.

81
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:43,960
So autonomy or respect for persons, beneficence or justice or informed consent.

82
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:49,860
So technically informed consent by itself is not a principle of the Belmont Report.

83
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:55,600
It's the first three that are and the informed consent is within respect for persons.

84
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:05,680
So this should be justice. And if we go back here, right, justice is a fairer distribution of costs and benefits to all potential participants.

85
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:11,020
And so that clinician is taking it into their hands of what they think is appropriate.

86
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:17,530
It's not really fair to everyone for that one person to decide what's right for that person and for somebody else to say,

87
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:23,589
I don't know and let randomization occur. Yes. So in order for this question to have been beneficence instead of justice,

88
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:29,229
would that be such a situation where rather than the investigator not feeling equally about drugs,

89
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:35,890
where there is a clear, clearly better drug that makes sense, like I guess I was a little unclear on how.

90
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:41,130
Yeah, so beneficence is really right trying to maximize the benefits and minimizing the risks.

91
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:49,300
So yeah, I guess you could potentially I guess you could have said that you think that the doctor.

92
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:55,900
Right. Is is trying to maximize the benefits of that participant.

93
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,290
But that's not actually that's like their idea of maximizing benefits, right?

94
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:09,700
It's not actually when we talk about beneficence, it's really saying like we're trying not to like kill the people involved or do really bad harm.

95
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:16,170
We want to actually hope that they do. Well, it's not that there are specific treatments that are better or not, right?

96
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:22,600
Yeah. So but then if the doctor is trying to do something that they would find individually ethical,

97
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,080
like how does that work with the previous question that we talked about?

98
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:34,709
So the every so generally in clinical trials so that clinicians shouldn't have been involved in a clinical trial.

99
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,940
Right. It's not ethical for someone who doesn't have equipoise to be in a trial.

100
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,620
So the individual ethics, again, is for yes, for an individual, but it's for thinking about those involved in the trial.

101
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,180
We're trying not to harm them.

102
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:55,889
It's not fair for someone to come in and say, I already have an idea about what's better when we don't actually have the evidence for that.

103
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,370
Right? Like that person might think it's better, but we don't have the evidence for that.

104
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,939
And so it's not actually. It's possibly not actually better.

105
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,030
And so it's not acting in the best interests of everybody because they should be.

106
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,430
They shouldn't. We don't know. Right. So they should act like we don't know for everybody, not just for one individual.

107
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:22,830
Yeah. So there is this there's a whole area of medical ethics that I think is very, very interesting.

108
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:29,790
Right. In which the first few first lecture especially talked about and that we still have to consider as statisticians.

109
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,799
But there are actually experts who work on this. Okay.

110
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,130
So then this one, number 11 begins design.

111
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:44,160
The first stage always includes 14 individuals and only proceeds if at least one has a response.

112
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:50,940
The number was determined based on less than 5% probability of having zero responses if the true response rate is greater than 20%.

113
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:59,249
Often 11 individuals are enrolled in the second stage to provide estimates of response with no more than 10% standard error.

114
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:04,680
Which of the following is true so the correct answer should have been given.

115
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,210
Designed does not help the aim of early termination when drug has a low response rate.

116
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:16,770
I don't remember now what I think the answers were just all across the board, but.

117
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:28,320
I just want to go back to some of the lectures you were here.

118
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:36,100
So the size of the first stage is fixed and may not be optimal for underlying aim of early termination if drug has no or low anti-tumor activity.

119
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,550
So this was directly a slide from lecture seven.

120
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,770
So that's where that that answer comes from.

121
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:50,920
It actually wasn't ending early, doesn't end early that often if there is low response rate and so that's why

122
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,730
write like Simon to stage or admissible other types of designs were created.

123
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,570
So that's where that came from. Okay.

124
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:04,870
Then this one, number 14, the FDA requires specific diversity quotas in any clinical trials seeking drug approval.

125
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,530
A lot of people said true. So we had a discussion about this.

126
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:18,970
There is an office for minority health and health equity and their goal is to promote and protect health of diverse populations.

127
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,700
However, we followed it up with this slide where there's actually not maybe you got confused

128
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,220
that you didn't come to class or didn't think about the discussion we had.

129
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,980
There's not actually a mandate on the FDA does not have a mandate.

130
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:38,410
Some people think there should be a mandate, but there is not a mandate on clinical trial diversity.

131
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,670
And so there has been a lot of people like, for instance,

132
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,780
the National Black Church Initiative said you should make this a mandate or else no one's going to do it.

133
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:54,720
If there's no incentive, it's not going to happen. And so this was a slide to say, hey, FDA, you don't have these.

134
00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:01,900
Maybe you should. And so I think maybe that was misunderstood and or lost in remembering.

135
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:08,120
So the answer is false. Okay.

136
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:13,050
And then I think this. Oh, no, there's two more. Okay. So this is the last one is the multiple choice.

137
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,479
It's a little too long to read, but I don't again,

138
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:28,290
I don't remember what a lot of people were were choosing, but the correct answer should have been C.

139
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,040
This is for Simon to stage design.

140
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:43,100
If we change the response from being a complete or partial response to also including stable response, which means that there would be a lot more,

141
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:51,650
it would be a lot easier to find this the stable response and partial complete response, then just complete and partial response.

142
00:14:52,070 --> 00:15:00,830
And so if we all of a sudden try to change the endpoint and we allow for a lot more people, we allow it to be a lot easier to reach that endpoint.

143
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,750
We're going to increase the type one error. So that's this this one.

144
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:14,450
Okay. Okay. And then the last short answer was about safety constraints.

145
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:23,390
These are a few of them. I would say that at least a third of people wrote down the things that I wasn't sure where they came from.

146
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,440
A lot of people wrote down, You are, which is a type of safety constraint.

147
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,060
However, it's a totally different design.

148
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:37,700
So there has been some work on combining Airwalk and CRM into a hybrid design, but generally CRM differs from Airwalk.

149
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:45,109
There are two separate phase one designs. So if you wrote you up or escalating with some overdose control, you were how to write ideas,

150
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:50,300
but like you can't just the idea was what safety constraints can they impose on this CRM design?

151
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,770
Not like how could they completely redesign something?

152
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,840
So I think that's what happened there. And then some people wrote down like, why put those things?

153
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:05,780
So you can check out the answers again. There were some of which are here.

154
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:14,950
That was what I wanted to go over. Are there any other questions? I also I recommend sitting down to answer to you, going over that,

155
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:25,040
coming to office hours with myself or fun to go over things and just taking time to like figure out what went wrong.

156
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,760
And the whole goal is not to get an A, the whole goal is to actually retain this information, to learn it and to retain it.

157
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,450
Right. And so often you actually do a lot better with that when you get things wrong.

158
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,229
So I don't want you to, you know, get lots of things wrong necessarily.

159
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,540
But going back and reviewing what happened,

160
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:48,290
what what went wrong and what the right answer would be might stick with you even longer than had you gotten it all correct.

161
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:55,430
So this is a good learning opportunity to make sure that you have this information moving forward.

162
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,930
So the next test is not cumulative, it's just on phase three.

163
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:03,950
So this is the end of testing you on phase one and phase two material.

164
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,440
So again, I just asked you to review it, make sure that you talk about it.

165
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,000
Any questions that you have with myself or if. All right.

166
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:24,450
Anything else about the test. Okay.

167
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:32,580
So today we are moving in phase three and we're going to talk about aims and hypotheses.

168
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:39,390
The first part is not super statistical because we're talking about specific aims or objectives of trials.

169
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:46,380
And then the next part gets more statistical how we how we map those aims into statistical hypotheses.

170
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:53,730
And the reason why we talk about this is because quite often when I meet with investigators who are interested in doing a trial,

171
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,120
they come to me and say, like, oh, here's my question or here's my objective.

172
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:05,250
And I have to do a lot of questioning them and prompting them to figure out how to put that into a hypothesis.

173
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:14,580
And so it's really important that you start to get your ideas of you're not just somebody that's crunching numbers or giving sample size, right?

174
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,150
You also have to be a critical thinker, a scientist as well.

175
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:23,850
And you have to work with other individual to make sure that they're going to get what they want at the end of the day.

176
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,340
And you're going to get the data that you need to analyze.

177
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:38,940
So study aims are are where the clinician or the investigator is going to list out the work that they want to be done.

178
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,370
This includes the primary outcomes.

179
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:48,419
They're really supposed to be specific when a protocol is written or grants proposals written to fund one of these, right.

180
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,350
We think about what are these specific aims or study aims of the design.

181
00:18:53,250 --> 00:19:02,200
Now usually these include study hypotheses and then they can be quantified in statistical hypotheses.

182
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,820
So the study hypotheses are going to be really non-technical.

183
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:13,259
They're going to, you know, be written in a language that basically anyone could pick up and understand.

184
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,650
Right. They don't have like a H not attached to it.

185
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:22,580
And they're just really helping motivate the direction and saying like, this is what I think would happen.

186
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:28,410
Then the statistical hypotheses are going to be linked to the aims and the study hypotheses,

187
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,460
and these are the mathematical hypotheses that you all have learned.

188
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:39,720
Right. They depend on the outcome of interest, which we're going to specify in terms of the parameter of interest.

189
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:47,940
And. We we want this to be the primary analysis that we're doing.

190
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:54,720
The primary objective, the primary sources, school hypothesis is going to lead to our primary analysis at the end of the trial.

191
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:02,850
And we might have secondary hypotheses as well, but the main statistical hypothesis is going to be links those primary aim.

192
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:14,100
Okay. So we're going to use this as an example. I think the protocol and this paper are given on canvas and if not there, then he slides.

193
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:20,430
So this was called the optimal trial and this is a randomized phase three design of

194
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:25,290
two different types of surgery and then having pelvic floor muscle training or not.

195
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:33,930
It's from 12 years ago and this is a two by two factorial trial.

196
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:40,110
So some of you, eight of you at least signed up to do one of the final projects that is a factorial design.

197
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:47,310
So this is a preview of what a factorial trial is. And then we might talk a little bit more about factorial designs later.

198
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:53,849
This was in JAMA. So usually when we see things in JAMA, we think this is like a big deal, right?

199
00:20:53,850 --> 00:21:02,430
JAMA is one of the premier medical journals and so we think this is likely a well done trial and something that makes a big difference in the field.

200
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:08,100
Now, it doesn't always mean that. So make sure that your critical reader, but that's usually sort of the first thought.

201
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:16,170
Okay, so a two by two trial, a two by two factorial trial means that you have two factors.

202
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:21,420
You have whether they have this one type of surgery self versus you else.

203
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:27,840
And then we have this other factor, which is whether they have this training, this pelvic muscle training or not.

204
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:35,069
And so essentially what happens is you have two factors, right, with two options and you can cross them.

205
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,680
And then so this like instead of having a two hour trial,

206
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:44,909
you have essentially a four arm trial and people are randomized equally between each of these cells, right?

207
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:52,200
The cross of these two factors, such that about a quarter of the participants get a self and pelvic training,

208
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:59,489
a quarter get this useless and pelvic training and then another quarter get self and no public standing.

209
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,060
And then the last quarter get the useless and no public training.

210
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:11,190
Now what's really great about the factorial designs is that we can assess the main effects of each individual factor.

211
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:18,629
Right. So you can see that we could assess how self comparison to us by combining these two groups.

212
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:26,040
So now we're kind of back to the to to arm trial design where we're just averaging over whether they had this pelvic therapy or not.

213
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:32,750
Right. And alternatively, we could average over the type of surgery and compare the PMT to an opiate.

214
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:39,570
And so we can ask a lot of questions in a two by two factorial by combining groups.

215
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:48,540
And we can also potentially look into the interaction of these two treatments by seeing if they had a self and PMT.

216
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:56,549
How does that compare to if they did it? And so we can again just ask a lot of questions and get a little bit more for

217
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:02,760
our for the resources that we have if we can use a two by two factorial design.

218
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:11,910
Okay. So their primary aims were stated as such.

219
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,600
They wanted to compare two year post-surgery anatomic outcomes of the types of surgery,

220
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:27,520
and then they wanted to assess short term urinary sexual and quality of life outcomes in those who got P.A. versus not.

221
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:35,930
So they have essentially, right. They're interested in those main effects of surgery versus not and the PMT versus not, those are their primary names.

222
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,729
And so the study design must be tied to these aims and the statistical power or the size of

223
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:49,030
the study must be tied to these aims or the primary outcome assessing the primary outcome.

224
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:56,230
So here the hypothesis, the study hypotheses, which are again written broadly in English, right?

225
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:04,270
There's no mathematics here. The first hypothesis is that there will be no difference in anatomic outcomes between the two surgery types.

226
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:14,050
And specifically, they said that a difference in success, less than 15% will not change clinical practice.

227
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:20,770
So if there's a difference if there's a difference between these two surgery types greater than 15%,

228
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,790
then one, they would choose one or the other types of surgery.

229
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:31,390
Right. But if there's not a big difference between the outcomes between these two surgeries, then they're essentially equivalent.

230
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,790
So this hypothesis is actually a hypothesis of equivalence.

231
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,200
And we're going to talk about these different hypotheses later.

232
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:47,049
There's three types of hypotheses. And this is a type of hypothesis that you don't usually learn or talk about in your like 601602 class.

233
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:54,130
You primarily focus on superiority hypothesis, but we'll talk about how studies are trials might be interested in other questions.

234
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:05,410
Okay. And then their next one is that they actually thought that this would improve short term outcomes in terms of these of various outcomes.

235
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,070
And so here they actually do have a superiority outcome, right?

236
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:12,460
They think that the PM t is better than no b, no PMT.

237
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:17,740
So they think the surgeries are are similar and PMT is better than not.

238
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,750
And then they have a bunch of secondary aims. So this is looking at more of the patient reported outcomes.

239
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,970
They're looking at long term effects and then also cost effectiveness.

240
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:35,460
So these are very if you're ever involved in clinical trials,

241
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:42,960
these are things that would be written out in a protocol, which is the Bible document of the trial.

242
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:48,650
It's also these would be written out if you applying for funding from like the NIH or somewhere.

243
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,819
All of these would be specified prior to this trial starting.

244
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:57,850
And this helps us design the trial and size the trial and then figure out the analytic plan for the trial.

245
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:08,570
So every trial has to have a primary aim. And usually we want one primary aim, one primary hypothesis, one primary outcome.

246
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:16,460
Sometimes you might have two primary aims and or two primary outcomes.

247
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,059
In that case, often we have to think about the multiple comparison problem.

248
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:26,720
Right, and maybe split the alpha. So usually we want one primary aim, one primary outcome.

249
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:33,410
And this primary aim primary hypothesis is going to end up sizing our study or provide the power for the study.

250
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:42,920
And then all the secondary questions or exploratory questions we want to list so that people know that when we analyze the data,

251
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,820
we already had these in mind. We're not just mining the data to find significant things,

252
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:54,380
but we don't necessarily have to power the study or have enough sample size to justify specific differences between these groups.

253
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:06,120
So again, it might seem silly that I'm telling you about how to write specific aims, but in so many of my collaborations,

254
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,259
the investigator lacks these skills and you end up helping them because you can

255
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:15,059
take what they're saying and make it into you can form it into a sentence.

256
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:19,230
And our hypothesis that is quantitative and is going to help you get to the end of the study.

257
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:29,820
So the specific aims you keep of Simple, Simple is an acronym for specific, immediate, measurable, practical, logical and invaluable.

258
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:44,940
These are also really important, if any of you end up either working in pharmaceutical companies and or anywhere and and or go on to your

259
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:51,930
Ph.D. and go into academia any time you have to write like a memo or a paper and or a proposal for anything.

260
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:57,900
These are things you want to keep in mind for how you want to write your introduction, your aims,

261
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:04,920
your specific objectives, which are important across any of those, any kind of project that you'd be involved in.

262
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,200
Okay.

263
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:14,750
So in clinical trials, specifically, what you want to think about in terms of formulating these aims are so what's the expected size of the effect?

264
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:20,330
This is going to be really important when we talk next week about sample size.

265
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:28,520
So if we're setting up this clinical trial and we have two arms or we have four arms, well, what difference are we expecting to see in them?

266
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,850
We actually have to have an idea before we start the trial.

267
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,860
It doesn't mean that it's the right difference that will definitely be seen.

268
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,299
It's the difference that you'd have to see to change practice, right?

269
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:45,230
That you'd have to see to implement this new treatment in the world.

270
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,720
And so you just want to make sure that the intervention is strong enough,

271
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,600
that it's clinically meaningful, and that it would make a difference moving forward.

272
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,319
So you also need to think about when you're measuring it.

273
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:09,140
So like for example, this was a in this coronary drug project they studied whether a lipid lowering drug could reduce the risk of heart attack,

274
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:16,790
who had and men who had already had at least one heart attack. And in treatment group they saw cholesterol went really low.

275
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:23,410
When they were like in the in the midst of the treatment or in this trial or in the study.

276
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,800
However, if you followed them up long term, there's actually no difference.

277
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:30,970
Right. So you want to think about what's the size of the effects that's necessary?

278
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:40,080
When is that effects necessary? And how is that related to all like the ultimate outcome of interest?

279
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:47,660
Right. That's all going to come into play here. And then, of course, you need to think about what's your actual intent.

280
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,960
So are you trying to say that one treatment is better than another?

281
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,249
Or are you trying to say that these treatments are essentially the same?

282
00:29:55,250 --> 00:30:03,440
Or the other option is, are you trying to say that there's a treatment that's not much worse than this other treatment?

283
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,950
So those are the three main types of hypotheses that we could have.

284
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:12,280
They're called superiority equivalence or noninferiority, where you're trying to compare.

285
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:18,260
We'll stick to just two treatments for now. You're trying to compare two treatments, and you either want to say one is definitely better.

286
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:21,709
These are about the same, or this one might be a little bit worse,

287
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:27,860
but it's it's maybe a little bit worse, but like similar or even better, that's non-inferiority.

288
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,910
Okay. So a reminder of all these things that you all have known forever.

289
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:42,280
So we're just going to go very quickly through these, right? You know, these and you can you probably talk about this in your sleep, right?

290
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:46,450
So there's type one error is alpha. This is claiming it.

291
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:50,870
So in terms of clinical trials, this would be claiming a treatment improvement or detriment.

292
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:57,920
That's only an artifact of random error. So it'd be saying that like we find this treatment is better when in fact it's not really.

293
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,330
Typically this is set at 5%, right? We think about P values, less than 5%.

294
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,550
We think about type one error. So at 5%.

295
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:13,130
But we do need to be really thoughtful about this in trials because type one errors are actually very, very expensive in the phase three setting.

296
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,620
Right? Type one errors in the phase three setting say that we find this treatment difference when there really isn't one.

297
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:23,269
And now we're giving you all this treatment and it can be treatment that's super expensive.

298
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:29,450
So like for example, there's a treatment or there was a treatment for cystic fibrosis that was approved.

299
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:34,729
That's over $272,000 a year. The type one error of that treatment.

300
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:41,900
Right, is incredibly expensive. We could say that we find this I'm not saying that this is not actually an effective treatment.

301
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:49,910
I'm just saying. Right. That if it's not, we're having people pay an exorbitant amount to get this treatment that might not actually be useful.

302
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:55,130
And so sometimes type one error should be much smaller than 5% in clinical trials.

303
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:05,030
Okay. Type two error is in terms of clinical trials, is failing to detect an interesting treatment.

304
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:10,190
So not finding a difference in treatments when there really is one.

305
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:16,489
And this is affected by lots of clinical trial design characteristics.

306
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:21,500
And one major way to decrease type two error is to increase the sample size.

307
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:27,740
Alternatively, what we usually think is one way to increase power is to increase the sample size.

308
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:35,899
So often when we talk about clinical trials, we talk about the power of the trial or the power to find that effect of interest, right?

309
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:40,040
And the power is that we're correctly identifying an effective treatment.

310
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,499
And so we usually want that to be quite high.

311
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:50,780
Again, this is usually thought about as 80%, but in some clinical trials we might want to change this to 90%, 95% or higher.

312
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:59,960
There's this whole world of pragmatic clinical trials that's been a big interest in the last decade or more,

313
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:04,309
which pragmatic clinical trials means clinical trials that are supposed to emulate

314
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:09,110
real world settings better than like the gold standard of clinical trials.

315
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,280
Those are often comparative effectiveness trials,

316
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:19,370
so they're looking at multiple active treatments compared to each other as opposed to like a treatment compared to placebo.

317
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:25,220
And in those often power is expected to be at least 90%.

318
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:36,270
So we want to make sure that we're correctly identifying these treatments or that we're not missing effective treatments right there,

319
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,990
correctly identify and very often. Okay.

320
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:54,909
So in a table, right? We have on the off diagonals, the errors and on the regular diagonals that are or whatever, right?

321
00:33:54,910 --> 00:34:01,630
We have good things happening where we actually make good decisions. If the if there really is no difference that we we don't find that difference.

322
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:05,800
Right. Or the power, which is that there is a difference and we find that difference.

323
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:15,620
Okay. So usually right where we worked a little bit in phase one of phase two in the Bayesian framework for all of phase three,

324
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:20,840
we're going to mostly talk about I think we're only going to talk about the frequentist framework again.

325
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:30,860
And so here our study hypothesis or our statistical hypothesis, we're going to set up really interested in one statistical test.

326
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,880
And from that statistical test we can get a estimate right and a confidence interval and also a p value.

327
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:43,010
And so the P value is the probability that the treatment effect estimates would look as good

328
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:49,310
as what we found and or even better when the treatment isn't actually truly beneficial.

329
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,280
And so the p values are determined from our data set.

330
00:34:52,280 --> 00:35:00,140
Remember, P values are highly tied to sample size, and because of that we often are much more interested in the effect,

331
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:10,970
the estimate of the effect and the confidence interval around it. Now also remember that the clinical trials we have to pre specify all of this.

332
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,130
So none of this is happening as we're accruing people. Right.

333
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:22,170
We have pre-specified what significance level is pre-specified, which power we want and or the type two error that is acceptable.

334
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:29,340
And then we're going to look, you know, figure out what is our outcome of interest.

335
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:33,840
Pre-specified our primary analysis. And that's the way we're going to get our sample size.

336
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,389
So we can get a p value,

337
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:46,110
but we're much more interested in the confidence interval because it tells us about the precision and the actual estimate of our effect.

338
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:50,250
And so, again, right, a confidence interval is a proportion.

339
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:57,720
A confidence level is the proportion of confidence intervals that would cover the true treatment effect if the experiment was repeated over and over.

340
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:04,670
So suppose that we've completed a trial.

341
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:11,090
Right. We we powered the study. We ended up not finding a difference between treatment.

342
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:18,800
So, for example, we compared A versus B. We powered the study to find that it was better than B by some treatment effect, and we didn't.

343
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:24,340
That would also mean that would mean that our P value is greater than 0.05.

344
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:27,860
It would also mean that our confidence interval spans zero.

345
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:31,430
Right. The difference between the treatments of that confidence interval span zero.

346
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:43,240
The there are some exceptions where I think you probably learn this to confidence intervals right

347
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:48,050
covenants are well with the P values are tied together such that if you have a non-significant p value,

348
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,570
your confidence interval of a difference would always have zero in it.

349
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:55,570
There are some exceptions where that's not the case, but we're going to live in a world where that is the case.

350
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:01,760
So if your confidence interval of a difference between treatments has zero in it, right, your p value is greater than point five.

351
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,660
And that means that you don't find significant differences between these treatments.

352
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:13,250
Okay. So let's move on to the types of hypotheses and all of that error talk p value confidence interval.

353
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:19,700
You're going to see why we quickly review that as we go through this and as we go forward into next week with sample size.

354
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:29,190
So the three main types of hypotheses specifically that we're going to use in phase three trials, you can use them in phase two trials too,

355
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:36,330
but we don't because you'll see that noninferiority and equivalence hypotheses require a high sample size.

356
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:41,300
And so they're only really used in phase three trials. So superiority is the most common.

357
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:46,230
That's the one you're most familiar with. That's one you usually learn hypothesis tests thinking about.

358
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:55,200
But then there's also noninferiority and equivalence. So the superiority test is where our primary objective or superiority hypothesis is,

359
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:03,180
where our primary objective is to determine the magnitude of increased benefit of some new treatment over standard of care or placebo.

360
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:16,020
Non-inferiority is to establish that this new treatment, it's efficacy is not substantially less than some existing standard of.

361
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:20,510
And even could be better. So it's not much less.

362
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,000
It could be the same. It could be better.

363
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:32,050
Equivalence is saying that this new treatment is about the same, so it's neither better nor worse than some standard treatment.

364
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:38,249
If we think about this in a figure sometimes.

365
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:45,740
So I, I often feel like I learn better when I actually see this not just in words, but in a figure or whatever.

366
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:52,950
So if we think about this, right, our statistical significance in terms of superiority is if we're comparing the treatments

367
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:57,569
and you can think about the zero as like the difference between treatment and control,

368
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:05,610
right? That being zero, there's no difference. Then we would only say that there is superiority if we actually find that the treatment is better.

369
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:13,290
Equivalence means that the difference between the two treatments lives within this plus or minus delta region,

370
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:17,480
that we define this plus or minus delta as being about the same right.

371
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,420
You can imagine this is going to have to be somewhat small and we'll talk about that in a little bit.

372
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:26,670
And then the non-inferiority is maybe sort of like the interesting one where it says, well,

373
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:32,219
you can be a little bit minus delta worse than the treatment or anywhere else, right?

374
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:37,170
You can be a little bit worse. You could be the same or you can even be better. And that would be an non-inferior treatment.

375
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:43,690
So we talk about that as not notably worse than. Okay.

376
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:46,450
So let's first start with superiority because that's the most familiar.

377
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:53,990
So here our goal again is to compare A versus B and we want to say that say that B is either placebo or standard of care.

378
00:39:54,010 --> 00:40:01,959
We want to prove that A is better. So even though it's superiority, we want to prove that something is better.

379
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:10,210
We always use a two sided statistical test. So our alternative hypothesis is not one of greater than or equal to, it's not equal to.

380
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:16,720
And that's basically just because we're we don't actually know that it's definitely going to be better.

381
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:24,610
Right. In the clinical trial, it could be a little worse. And so we just want to make sure that we're leaving room for all the error that could occur.

382
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:32,499
And while we're interested in superiority, we're going to ensure that we have Head Start bets and allowed for it even to be a little bit worse.

383
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,740
So so we're going to set this up as a two sided test.

384
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:42,069
So our null hypothesis is that a treatment difference is zero.

385
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:46,060
Again, we're going to we're going to look at just like two arm trials for right now.

386
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:50,680
So like A, the difference between A versus B, right?

387
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:57,340
A minus B, whatever the outcome is zero. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a non zero treatment difference.

388
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,940
This treatment difference we're going to call Delta.

389
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:08,650
So we're interested in what is the effect size or what is the difference between treatments and that's that's what we're going to call Delta here.

390
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:15,310
And this is going to be the what we define a priori to the trial happening is the smallest,

391
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:20,650
clinically meaningful difference between these treatments that would change practice.

392
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:25,600
Right. That's how we figure out, okay, well, what effect do we need to see between these treatments?

393
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:32,050
How are we going to size this trial? Well, if they're Delta amount different right, then I would use this new treatment.

394
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:36,670
It'd be worth it to use this new treatment. It could be more than Delta and I would use it.

395
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,920
Right. But if it's less than Delta, then it's not worth it. This this treatment isn't worth going forward with.

396
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:51,450
Okay. So our statistical hypotheses look at some as such right as that.

397
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:59,700
The difference if we say this is our new treatment E versus our control, right, which could be standard of care or placebo, it's e minus equals zero.

398
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,060
Or you could just say equal C, right? That they're the same. There's no difference.

399
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:12,149
And our alternative hypothesis is that this difference is not zero or that these the effects of E of E and C are different.

400
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:20,100
E is not equal to see now obviously right the way it actually right this hypothesis would be in terms of like means or proportions.

401
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:24,360
It's not just like this treatment is equal to this treatment.

402
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,690
Right. But I'm just showing it to you because I'm keeping it broad right now.

403
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:37,230
And then we'll talk about how we use these hypotheses and sample size and we'll put views or X bars in there or P hats or whatever.

404
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:42,900
Well, even talk a little bit at all if if the data survival time to events data.

405
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:52,170
Okay. So again, in terms of the figure, right, if I here again I have the difference is zero.

406
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:57,060
So there's no difference. And on the right, the new treatment is better or on the left, the control is better.

407
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:03,660
If I find a point, estimate where the treatment is better and my 95% confidence interval doesn't include zero, then obviously, right.

408
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:08,459
My P values less than 25. My confidence interval doesn't spend zero.

409
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:18,450
I have superiority shown if I have a positive treatment effect and my confidence

410
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:24,450
interval maybe just barely touches zero or doesn't actually touch zero.

411
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:33,569
Right, then I can still say that there's superiority, but once my p value is greater than 0.05, my confidence interval actually includes zero.

412
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:37,510
I no longer can claim superiority. So right.

413
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:41,790
These first two, let's pretend this has like .149 right.

414
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:45,330
6.05. Is this sticky, sticky situation where.

415
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:50,200
Everybody involved in the trial would probably say it's it's effective,

416
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,379
but everybody else would say, I don't know about that, so let's pretend this is point.

417
00:43:53,380 --> 00:44:02,320
We're like, okay. So in these cases, right, the trial is is successful in terms of we find an effective treatment and things change.

418
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:10,180
In this last case, the trial is not successful in terms of the treatment is not found to be efficacious.

419
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:13,330
So the trial is successful in terms of it ran and it got us an answer,

420
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:20,980
but we don't think of it like everybody involved is probably a little bit sad because the treatment wasn't effective.

421
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:24,370
And so we're back to the beginning of like, how do we get a new treatment for this group?

422
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:28,210
Yeah. So I'm still confused why we're using a two sided test.

423
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:37,420
So even if you show significance, like if you show significant differences like lower, lower than zero, it's like, wouldn't that be a feeling?

424
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:47,590
It would still be a failure. Yes. Yeah. So mainly it's like if we had a one sided test,

425
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:56,860
we would allow for a smaller sample size and we wouldn't have the same precision on the outcome or the findings.

426
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,030
In allowing for a two sided test, we have a larger sample size,

427
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:07,329
we get smaller errors and we feel more confident and it is basically what it comes down to.

428
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:14,140
And because we approach this with equipoise, even though we want to see superiority, we don't know that that's the case.

429
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,190
So we're just like extra conservative in this hypothesis.

430
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:28,060
But it's a good question. And basically any time we try to the scientific community has decided that if you want to show superiority ever,

431
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:31,690
you basically always do a two sided hypothesis.

432
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:35,499
It's only in maybe a phase two setting.

433
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,140
Could you get away with a one sided hypothesis.

434
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:44,350
But if in phase three for something confirmatory where you would change practice, you got to use the two sided hypothesis.

435
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:50,590
I mean, it's it's silly. I mean, you're not assuming that it's greater, as you said, sort of the alternative.

436
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:56,649
Yeah, I don't know. It's like I don't really have a better answer for you.

437
00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:09,580
Besides, it's like scientific tradition, and it allows us to be somewhat conservative in in what we're doing and what we're showing is more precise.

438
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,630
Yes. Okay.

439
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:22,440
So we're not going to spend too much time on superiority in terms of the description besides that, because you're all very familiar with it.

440
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:26,920
Does the maybe hard part is even though it's superiority is this two sided test.

441
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:36,670
So non-inferiority is once to show that this new intervention is not notably worse than what's already being used.

442
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:46,480
And mainly this is this is a new treatment that we've got that we're interested in that is maybe less toxic,

443
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:54,250
less burdensome, easier to take for people, easier to adhere to, maybe less expensive than what people are already using.

444
00:46:54,520 --> 00:47:01,120
And so we want it to be about the same, but actually could be a little bit worse because it's so much better in these other aspects.

445
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:08,380
And so if it's, you know, not quite as effective but similar and it has all of these other great advantages to it,

446
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:16,629
then we, we think it'd be worthwhile to get out to people. The problem is in defining this like what's not notably worse, right?

447
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:25,180
Like how do we figure out what that delta is to say that like, you know, I take this think about, like, headaches, right?

448
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:29,829
All right. Well, I really want to take aspirin or something because I know it's going to make me so much better.

449
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:34,840
But I guess I take Tylenol because not going to hurt my stomach or something.

450
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,770
Right. It's like that.

451
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:44,290
But how like what is the difference in the headache being better that's acceptable to me to allow it such that I don't get like.

452
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:49,750
Of of ulcer from taking aspirin too much or something?

453
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:54,160
I don't know. I'm making this up. Right. What is it? The NSAIDs and maybe some aspirin.

454
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,830
But something can hurt your hand or something, right?

455
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:04,900
So you have to think about like, how do we define that delta that actually has that tradeoff that's appropriate but is still going to be effective.

456
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:16,450
We're going to talk more about the concerns with non-inferiority, hypotheses and studies, one of which is what we call bio creep.

457
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:24,040
And it's the fact that if we keep defining, if we have Delta, we've defined it too large and or we keep doing non-inferiority trials,

458
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,860
we eventually could get back to being just having the effectiveness of placebo or no,

459
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:37,450
it's no drug like, you know, nothing and or even worse, because we kept defining this difference and it got lower and lower every time.

460
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:49,060
So in this setting, right, if we're trying to say that this new drug is basically as effective,

461
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:53,260
maybe a little bit worse than the other drug, maybe even better.

462
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,920
Right. We have to define this delta. And like I said, it's hard to decide.

463
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,440
Regardless, placebo does not make sense here, right?

464
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:06,220
We can never have a noninferiority trial that has placebo as one of the treatments because we never want to be worse than placebo.

465
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:12,340
Right. That doesn't make any sense. We would only use a non-inferiority trial if we have two active treatments,

466
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:19,510
and we believe that this new active treatment has some better advantage than the old active treatment or standard of care.

467
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:27,500
And so that's why we allow this a little bit worse. Typically these treatments are thought to have very similar effects.

468
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:34,430
So they're somewhat in terms of equivalence. However, we are going to allow this a little bit worse and our even better.

469
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:43,489
And this delta, right. If we compare this delta or treatment effect difference between like a superiority study and a non-inferiority study,

470
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:46,430
it has to be smaller in the non-inferiority study. Right.

471
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:52,610
We want to make sure that these treatment differences are small because they're active treatments,

472
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:56,480
and we want them to make sure that they're doing better than no treatment.

473
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:05,570
So because this treatment effect is small, we're actually going to require a large sample size in non-inferiority studies.

474
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:12,620
So non-inferiority studies, equivalent studies generally require more people than superiority studies.

475
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:16,160
Most often because of this delta or effect size is smaller.

476
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:24,180
So the way to specify this delta, there are kind of two main approaches.

477
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:31,200
The first approach is based on some minimally important clinical effect, and this can be quite subjective.

478
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:39,300
And the problem here is that if we think about the minimally clinical difference, the minimal,

479
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:44,280
minimally significant clinically clinical difference that we had to find and superiority study, right?

480
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:49,830
We could take that and apply it here, but then we might actually go back to the effectiveness of the placebo.

481
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:57,209
So it actually needs to be smaller than that. And so usually this approach to write is to think about, well,

482
00:50:57,210 --> 00:51:04,020
what was that difference that we had to see in the standard in the initial treatment versus placebo trial?

483
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,990
Let's take that and have it or even less.

484
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:14,070
And we'll use that as our delta to ensure that actually we're not going to go back to being like no treatment effects.

485
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:20,469
We're just going to be slightly less than the treatment effect that we found. Okay.

486
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:23,680
So this is this is a one sided hypothesis test.

487
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:30,610
So generally in superiority, we're going to require to a two sided hypothesis test.

488
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:36,969
But at non-inferiority is a time where we allow a one sided because like that line showed,

489
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:43,510
right, we have to be better than the negative delta or this little delta difference.

490
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:45,670
We have to be better than that.

491
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:52,960
And if we actually stop, right, if we made it two sided and we said, oh, it can be with a negative delta and delta, that becomes an equivalence test.

492
00:51:54,370 --> 00:52:02,650
So our hypothesis here will assume that the larger that outcome, assume we have like a positive or a continuous outcome and the larger the better.

493
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:11,920
So if I take the experimental minus the control, right, I can have a little bit worse, the slightly negative treatment effect in this difference.

494
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,070
But it has to be it can't be any any greater than that.

495
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:21,010
Okay. So right. I just think about going back to this picture.

496
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:24,850
Right. And and thinking about the hypothesis as such.

497
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:35,390
Okay. So, again, here's the here's like potential results.

498
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:40,219
Right. This new agent versus the control. Remember, control here is an active control.

499
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:46,690
This is not a placebo and they're likely going to span zero.

500
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:51,769
Right. The differences in non in non-inferiority designs will likely span zero because

501
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:57,169
you want them to be similar and they can be a little the confidence interval,

502
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:04,970
the lower end of the confidence interval can span up to negative delta and then anywhere where it shows the treatment is better.

503
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:11,839
But it as the confidence interval, that lower band that lower bound goes beyond that negative delta, you no longer have non-inferiority.

504
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:17,240
It might actually just be inferior, right? So even though the point estimate says it's similar,

505
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:24,860
if the lower end of the confidence interval shows that it could be inferior, then you can't claim non-inferiority.

506
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:35,219
Okay. So then the next one is equivalence, which is to show that this new therapy is more or less the same.

507
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:38,310
So we cannot ever show that they're exactly the same.

508
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,750
Right. That would require zero variance, which we can't have.

509
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,319
It would require infinite sample size, which we could never have.

510
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:52,950
And so therefore, we just have to say that these look similar in terms of negative delta or Delta, right?

511
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:59,910
We can have this error or on either side of the difference, but they can never be shown to be exactly the same.

512
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:13,710
So here we again have this small delta amount that says that these treatments are about the same and we call this delta.

513
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:18,600
So in Noninferiority, I don't maybe I didn't say this. That Delta is called a noninferiority margin.

514
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,340
And the equivalence trial, this delta is called the equivalence margin or tolerance.

515
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,120
Again, equivalence trial, placebo does not make sense, right?

516
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:29,460
It doesn't make any sense to say this is as good as placebo.

517
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:35,190
So we're only ever talking about active treatments in a non-inferiority and in equivalence hypotheses.

518
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:42,540
The equivalence hypotheses are framed as to a two sided hypothesis.

519
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:51,690
Hypothesis, actually, we'll talk more about how we look at this, how we look at specifically this hypothesis.

520
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:52,800
It's a little bit interesting.

521
00:54:55,620 --> 00:55:02,040
Again, this delta has to be smaller than the superiority setting because we want it to be about the same and we don't want it to be not effective.

522
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:09,790
So obviously, if we're going to have to find very small differences between these treatments, it's going to require a very large sample size.

523
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:17,380
So our equivalence hypothesis, if we again, I think it's easier to look at this.

524
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:32,480
This right. The null hypothesis is that either the treatment is better or that the new treatment is better, or the old treatment is better.

525
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:39,530
Right. The control so that the null hypothesis is that either we're on this side and the difference or we're on the side of the difference.

526
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:44,630
And the alternative is like, no, we're in the middle, right? We're within this negative delta and delta.

527
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:56,300
And so we have this kind of like joint null hypothesis that either this is happening or this is happening, but we're going to test both.

528
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:05,360
We have to test both of these hypotheses. So it's either that the new treatment is better or the old treatment is better.

529
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:10,340
And I can write that in the terms of this H not one and H not two.

530
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:15,380
And the alternative is that the treatment difference is actually in between this negative delta and delta.

531
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:21,660
So again, here is I set up my negative delta and my positive delta.

532
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:26,740
If I find a point estimate, that's a little off of zero.

533
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:30,350
However, my confidence interval is within this negative delta delta.

534
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:36,889
Then I've shown equivalence. If I have a point estimate that's within that negative delta delta.

535
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:42,650
But but my confidence interval stands outside of Delta to delta that I have no longer have equivalence.

536
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:52,160
Right? In this case, it looks like I almost have superiority, but I don't have superiority either because my lower bound goes beyond here.

537
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,710
Okay. So how do we actually test this?

538
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:09,780
So the most commonly used way to test the equivalence hypothesis are what's called the two one sided test or post test.

539
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:18,639
So it's like a two sided test. However, it's two separate, one sided tests, right?

540
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:26,470
Because we had those two separate joint null hypothesis that said either one is better or the other is better.

541
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:35,730
And so we test those at the same time and they're each tested separately at and they're each tested separately at the alpha level.

542
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:39,819
So we don't actually split the alpha. And I'll explain in a minute why that's the case.

543
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:46,480
Right. You might think, oh, I have these two tests. If I'm doing two tests over multiple comparison problem, I could inflate the type one error.

544
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:48,430
So we'll see why that's not the case in a minute.

545
00:57:55,340 --> 00:58:02,810
And then usually so this also corresponds to constructing a one minus to alpha times 100% confidence interval,

546
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:08,960
although some often report the one minus alpha a confidence interval just to be a little bit more conservative.

547
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:15,770
So. Again, we're trying to show this like equivalence, right.

548
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:22,430
And how these two null hypothesis, null hypothesis that say no, either one is better or the other is better.

549
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:29,930
And so the two composite right or these joint joint null hypothesis are a such that this.

550
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:41,530
This difference between the new treatment and the control right is less than some lower bound or greater than some upper bound.

551
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:47,050
And we can test both of these. These are one sided tests.

552
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:51,820
We can test them both at the alpha level. And the way that we do that is actually.

553
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:57,850
Because of I'll go back to that slide, but it's because of the intersection union test.

554
00:58:57,870 --> 00:59:03,660
So did you guys learn about these when you talked about hypothesis tests in like, I don't know, 6 to 1 or six or two?

555
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:06,870
No. Some point, somebody learned them.

556
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,480
I think you'll learn that if you go on to an 801 or 802.

557
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:18,459
So what what this is this is a theorem that says that if you have this hypothesis

558
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:22,540
testing problem where you have these like joint hypotheses so that either right.

559
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:26,830
Even though I wrote an and in the hypothesis a hypothesis, it's because we're testing both.

560
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:32,170
But the hypothesis is set up that either the differences this way or the differences this way.

561
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:36,340
Right? It's a union. It's that it's this way or this way. It's a union of hypotheses.

562
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:42,540
And what we're looking for, the alternative hypotheses, is that intersection right is no, it's in the middle.

563
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:45,280
That's where we find equivalence that says it's actually in the middle.

564
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:54,910
And so this intersection union test said that if I have this union of hypotheses as the null and this intersection in the as the alternative,

565
00:59:55,390 --> 01:00:04,270
I actually am able to reject the null. If each of the individual hypotheses can be rejected at that type one, that alpha type one level.

566
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:09,460
So this is just the theorem that says I can use Alpha.

567
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:18,340
You don't have to split Alpha. I can use it at both these one side of tests and I maintain an overall type one error of alpha.

568
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:23,200
So however. Right. I can only.

569
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:30,560
I can only claim equivalence if I reject both of my null hypothesis.

570
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:33,720
Right. It's not this way or it's not this way.

571
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:42,400
It has to be in the middle. Okay, so this two one sided test is naturally thought of as this intersection union test.

572
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:50,290
This is also if you if you've heard if you know, a little bit more about pharmaceutical companies,

573
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:57,700
there is this whole area of pharmaceutical companies called bio. So in that error area of bioequivalence,

574
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:04,870
they're using equivalence hypotheses to show that their drug is similar to another company's drug or that their

575
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:14,230
new drug is similar to or like their generic drug is similar to their drug or some somebody else's drug.

576
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:24,040
Okay. And so in any of these bioequivalence equivalence studies, we're testing these two hypotheses and we get to do them both at the alpha level.

577
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,880
And to explain that we have the equivalence.

578
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:35,799
So if we go back, right, we have for example, if these are like means, we'll talk more about these later.

579
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,980
But these are like their T tests for the means, right?

580
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:44,950
That we compare the two means between the groups and we compare that to our critical Z level.

581
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:54,910
And if it's if the Z statistic that we find is not much larger or much smaller, then we can declare that we have this equivalence.

582
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:04,290
Okay. So example outcomes from an equivalence test, right?

583
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:12,190
We find that if we have like what's shown in a here that we have this point estimate that's maybe a little bit better of this difference.

584
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:16,390
This new treatment is different. This B treatment is better than A for example.

585
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:22,329
Right. But the confidence balance or the negative delta two delta, then we have a equivalent.

586
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:27,160
We have found the equivalence. And there is not a statistical difference between these treatments and B.

587
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:34,950
If we get a result that looks like this and B right, we're outside of our equivalent balance,

588
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:37,910
our lower confidence interval goes outside negative delta.

589
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,940
And so we don't have equivalence, but we've actually shown statistical difference, right, because we don't hit zero.

590
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:50,850
And so we've actually shown that this treatment over here is statistically better than this treatment over there.

591
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:54,290
I'll get to you in a second. Let me finish this one. Okay.

592
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:55,080
And see. Right.

593
01:02:55,080 --> 01:03:06,470
We have up we have the opposite, such that we actually show statistical equivalence where within these values and we're not hitting zero.

594
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,660
So we have statistical equivalence and statistical significance.

595
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:14,640
So these are equivalent, but actually this one's a little bit better, right?

596
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:19,170
But it's not so much better. We would only declare a superiority, right.

597
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,340
If it was Delta better.

598
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:28,560
So it's not actually it's statistically significantly different, but it's not superior because it's not outside of that delta better.

599
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:36,630
So remember, there's statistically different that is different from practically meaningfully clinically different.

600
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:43,110
Okay. And then down here we don't have equivalence and we don't have different because we span zero and we go outside of Delta.

601
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,660
Yeah, you might just kind of answer this,

602
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:52,649
but why would a pharmaceutical company or someone want to use an equivalence test instead of a noninferiority test?

603
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:59,070
Like why not show that it's not worse and better as have just showing that it's not good?

604
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,330
That is equivalent, I guess I did not answer that. That's a good question.

605
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:11,620
So. So usually we think about.

606
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:20,610
We? It's possible that the delta for non-inferiority could be slightly larger than the Delta for equivalence,

607
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:30,810
so that you would be allowing for even slightly worse outcomes that are not defined as about the same.

608
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:32,580
So that might be one reason.

609
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:39,239
Often pharmaceutical companies want to show we want to be able to show, especially, for example, with like generic drugs, right?

610
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:47,910
We have this generic drug and it works just as good as like the original drug that was out there that was by this person.

611
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:54,300
It's it's the same, right? We use equivalence instead of non-inferiority because we don't want to say it's not notably worse.

612
01:04:54,720 --> 01:05:05,650
So it's a little bit in terms of the. Communicating the results and also the fact that the Delta could be somewhat larger and not inferiority.

613
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:10,240
But you do have to be careful about it. That's a really good question. Yes, sir.

614
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:16,320
Would you also tend to like already have more studies on both drugs or.

615
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:24,490
But you had more studies on the drugs. Oh, if you're looking for a if you're looking at equivalence versus non-inferiority.

616
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:33,250
Possibly. Either way, you have usually at least one other study on that drug, right?

617
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:38,780
You have the original study that showed that drug was more effective than placebo or whatever else.

618
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:44,270
You may have more with equivalents, but not necessarily, I don't think.

619
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:45,019
Right.

620
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:53,060
This could be like a second a second trial, whether it's interested in non-inferiority or a second phase three trial, non-inferiority or equivalence.

621
01:05:55,320 --> 01:06:06,220
Okay. So that if we go back to that original two by two factorial, remember in the beginning their primary hypothesis was actually one of equivalence.

622
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:11,620
Were saying that the two surgery types were not significantly different.

623
01:06:13,290 --> 01:06:17,009
And so this was actually the two by two table that came out.

624
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:20,820
Their outcome was binary success or not. They called it success or not.

625
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:28,319
I don't know what I don't remember now what surgical success was, but we have this two by two table.

626
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:34,740
And so they found that the success rate was 59.2% versus 60.5%.

627
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:44,350
So very, very similar. Right. And when we look at the precision around that, we find that they had they said that equivalence was even 15%.

628
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:53,550
Kind of wide. Right. But their confidence interval doesn't expands within negative point one and point one.

629
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,730
So they're very much within these equivalence bounds.

630
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:04,190
And so they were able to, at the end of the study, say that these two types of surgery were equivalent.

631
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:09,000
Right. That they were. They're about the same that you could choose either one and you'd see similar outcomes.

632
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:16,320
Yeah. So when you're choosing that type of like noninferior, non noninferiority versus equivalence and so on,

633
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:19,830
is that more based on the context, like what you were talking about for the drug?

634
01:07:19,830 --> 01:07:23,560
Or is it more often based on how phase one and phase two went?

635
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:28,620
Because it does depend on what trial design you used in phase one of two, if that would even play a role.

636
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:33,100
But generally speaking, it more depends on that. It should depend more on the context.

637
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:39,680
Right. Like it should depend more on what is this disease, what is use stand in standard of care.

638
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:46,919
If you're using non-inferiority, what is it that is better about this new thing than the other thing?

639
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,830
Like what advancements are they bringing from the old one?

640
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:57,930
If it's equivalence, it's kind of similar in terms of like, why is it that you need well, you would have two that are the same.

641
01:07:58,830 --> 01:08:01,680
So there's usually other aspects that you that would differ.

642
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:08,040
It's a little bit I think it's harder to differentiate between why you would choose Noninferiority versus equivalence, right?

643
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:22,580
Then, why you would choose one of those versus superiority. Some things to think about in terms of non-inferiority or equivalence.

644
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:29,810
If the treatment's effect is weak, so if it was shown that there was an effective treatment.

645
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:34,430
However, it wasn't like a very big difference from placebo, right?

646
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:40,370
It's going to be hard to show non-inferiority or equivalence, so that at that point does matter with what was found before.

647
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:51,170
And you wouldn't want to do either noninferiority or equivalence in that sense to you.

648
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:57,019
So in order to do non equivalence or non-inferiority or equivalence trial, right,

649
01:08:57,020 --> 01:09:01,760
you need to have had a substantial magnitude of that treatment effect that you're going to compare to.

650
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:07,820
It should have been precisely estimated and you want to have estimates that are relevant,

651
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:13,120
relevant to the setting in which you're going to do this new trial. So you do not want to like do it in a whole new population, right?

652
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:19,190
If you did the old trial and say like breast cancer patients and you found the superiority of that treatment.

653
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:22,550
You wouldn't want to test non-inferiority. Now, unlike prostate cancer.

654
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,580
Right. You could have totally different effects.

655
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:31,340
And so you need to make sure that if you're going to take this into non-inferiority or equivalence, right?

656
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:37,020
So I said it depends for the context, but obviously it depends on what happened before to and to what was involved.

657
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,280
All of those things come into play in these types of designs.

658
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:58,630
So if you have a superiority. If you have a superiority trial and then you don't find that the treatments are different, you cannot claim equivalence.

659
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:07,010
Right. Okay. So if you have a superiority trial and you say P-value is greater than 0.2, you cannot say these, these are equivalent.

660
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:11,580
Remember how we interpret our hypothesis. We do not reject the null hypothesis, right?

661
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:19,030
We don't have evidence for a difference. But because we didn't set this up to be an equivalence trial which would require a different delta,

662
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:23,560
we were not appropriately powered or sized for that hypothesis.

663
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:28,600
And so we cannot claim equivalence in a. Superiority setting.

664
01:10:29,170 --> 01:10:37,440
Okay, that's really important that whatever. Right. The hypothesis has to be set before the trial and that's the claim that we can make at the end.

665
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:40,900
We can't we can't make the change.

666
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:49,010
As Ari Fleischer said. Right. The null hypothesis is never proved or established.

667
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:55,849
It's just possibly disproved. So there could be any number of reasons for why we don't find this difference.

668
01:10:55,850 --> 01:11:02,770
Right. That. If we didn't specifically say that we were looking for equivalence, we now can't claim it.

669
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:08,229
Okay, so there are a lot of issues in noninferiority and equivalence,

670
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:16,480
and this is probably why you don't focus on these hypotheses and or necessarily see a lot of trials that are non-inferiority or equivalence,

671
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,400
at least in like the big medical journals.

672
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:27,910
So there is a lot that we can poke at these trials in terms of like potential bias or lack of internal validity.

673
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:34,299
So any feature of the trial that biases the favor in terms of no treatment difference, right,

674
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:40,540
actually is then leading toward it could lead more toward that equivalent or non-inferiority hypothesis.

675
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:45,969
So for example, right in a superiority trial, all of a sudden people stop adhering, right?

676
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:49,390
You, in fact, that you expect that that biases the results toward the null.

677
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:54,330
You're not going to find a difference if this is an equivalence trial or a noninferiority trial.

678
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:59,770
People stop taking the treatment. You're biasing the results actually toward your alternative.

679
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:07,420
Right. Which is not good. You don't want to show that these treatments are the same because people didn't do them correctly.

680
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:13,480
Right. You want to show that these are about the same or not much worse because people took the treatments and they actually have the same effect.

681
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:23,500
So poor compliance or poor diagnostic criteria or lots of variability in measurements or biased endpoint assessment in any superiority trial,

682
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:27,040
you'd say, well, hopefully that's like balanced across the arms.

683
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:29,590
And if anything, it's biasing it towards the null.

684
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:34,299
So if we find a difference, there's clearly a difference in this non-inferiority or equivalent setting.

685
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:40,030
We're like, Oh, maybe we just found these results because of these issues, not because they're actually similar.

686
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:47,260
And so we have to be very careful when concluding non-inferiority or equivalence.

687
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:58,030
So some ever eager beavers. I've never seen anyone come in this classroom after hours and all of a sudden there's a class.

688
01:12:58,390 --> 01:13:02,890
So we got a few more minutes. Don't leave yet. So this brings us back to the intensive treat.

689
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:12,129
If you remember last time I talked about there is this intention to treat analysis and that's that we're actually usually analyzing the data in

690
01:13:12,130 --> 01:13:19,180
terms of we're looking at the difference that we expect because we intended to treat the individual for the treatment that they were randomized to.

691
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:30,160
And this is usually the way that we analyze the data or the framework that we use for analyzing the data because it's generally conservative.

692
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:35,260
If they had some different right, if they did something different while it's just biasing it toward null.

693
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:42,490
And so we use this intensive to treat right now. If that's not actually conservative and not non-inferiority and equivalence studies,

694
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:47,709
this framework or approach to analyzing data isn't necessarily the best way to do that,

695
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:51,070
because we're not, you know, we're essentially disguising it toward the null.

696
01:13:51,910 --> 01:14:00,760
And so usually in equivalence or noninferiority designs, we would do an intent to treat analysis and also what's called a per protocol analysis.

697
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:09,070
And the per protocol analysis is actually figuring out who actually took the treatment as it was supposed to be taken.

698
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:13,630
Right. And then looking at the people who did that and comparing their outcomes.

699
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:19,060
So remember the tend to treat was comparing people.

700
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:27,160
If we assign them a or we assign them B, then we we use their outcomes as if they got A and B and took it as they should.

701
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:35,650
And so we're actually really comparing the effect of the randomization, right, of the treatment that they were intended to get.

702
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:45,650
Per protocol. Think maybe we have time for this. And the end is where we look at the people who actually got the treatment like we wanted them to.

703
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:51,580
Mark. Volume.

704
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:07,070
Organs on your. Okay.

705
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:15,740
So watch this at home. This is about a protocol that basically we take that this is a really good video, too.

706
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:20,420
So I highly recommend this YouTube video. Go watch it.

707
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:25,339
It explains intent to treat versus per protocol and actually also as treated and it

708
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:30,229
does this really to little right like writing comparison of it so because I don't

709
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:34,670
know what's happening watch this at home to figure out the difference and basically

710
01:15:34,670 --> 01:15:38,090
what it is is that like if we just focus on the people who took the treatment,

711
01:15:38,090 --> 01:15:41,870
right, we're going to get a better idea of the differences between the treatment.

712
01:15:42,290 --> 01:15:49,819
However, if we it in at least in non-inferiority and in equivalence trials,

713
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:56,389
but in the superiority trials we usually want to allow for rate, we want to be conservative for those biases.

714
01:15:56,390 --> 01:16:01,070
And so we use the intent to treat. Okay, I'm not stopping there.

715
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:05,360
Then I'm going to keep going for a few more slides. So this bio crepe, remember,

716
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:11,389
is an issue with the non-inferiority where if we keep having if we keep comparing new

717
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:17,570
treatments to the next best treatment and defining that delta if we keep going back.

718
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:22,640
Right. So here was like the original comparison.

719
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:32,870
If we if we go back to the original comparison, then all of a sudden we're back to like not effective.

720
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:37,530
And so just think about drug A is clearly shown to be better than placebo.

721
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:43,400
Now, drug B is NONINFERIOR to a drug C as compared to B with some margin.

722
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:49,370
Now we got drug D on the market, right? If we keep getting this delta and it keeps going back, we're going to we're going to be in trouble.

723
01:16:53,710 --> 01:17:02,250
And then the other issue with non-inferiority, right? Another way that we try to get get away from bias is by blinding, right?

724
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:07,479
And superiority is like, well, you don't know you're a RB so you're not, you know,

725
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:12,070
we're, we're taking out this potential bias from what you think you're getting,

726
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:17,140
but in a non-inferiority or equivalence trial, everybody, you know,

727
01:17:17,290 --> 01:17:20,949
if somebody doesn't matter, they're like, well, I don't think there's a difference.

728
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:27,579
Or if there is an assessor, right? It's like, well, I'm just going to give everybody the same score because I think these things are equivalent.

729
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:32,139
They're not the same, right? So as if, you know, the equivalence or noninferiority hypothesis,

730
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:38,350
now all of a sudden these tricks that we use to try to keep the trial from being that biased are no longer useful.

731
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:44,290
And so these noninferiority and equivalence trials are very susceptible to bias,

732
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:54,549
and it's very difficult to do these in terms of not saying we actually found equivalence or noninferiority because there truly is no difference,

733
01:17:54,550 --> 01:18:00,430
then like all of these things went wrong. And so there was just everybody just went back to the null.

734
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:04,540
Right. And so, again, you have to go through.

735
01:18:05,860 --> 01:18:12,390
A little bit more whoops and or really explaining how these issues weren't, you know,

736
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:20,800
these biases didn't come into play to conclude equivalence or noninferiority that it really does seem like these things are are equal.

737
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:27,399
Okay. So we talked about these three types of hypotheses moving forward.

738
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:32,200
Next week, we're going to focus on superiority hypothesis. But I want you to be very aware.

739
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:38,100
We'll come back a little bit to the non-inferiority hypothesis, maybe equivalence to, but mostly superiority.

740
01:18:38,110 --> 01:18:45,520
I want you to be aware of these different types, why they're used and what the issues are across the three types.

741
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:53,410
We'll do this next week, all the rest of your weekend.

742
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:12,050
And you didn't get your test. There appears to be, you know, over the past three months.

743
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:16,650
I don't think anybody can do very well for sure.

744
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:28,920
So the answer is revealing later, starting to kind of go inside and outside your house.

745
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:41,960
We got out and it's like, oh, we got to go.

746
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:59,780
That's all I know is even that was probably exactly what happened.

747
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:11,550
And I don't know how you're going to eventually like it.

748
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:18,140
Did you know you don't go backwards and start talking?

749
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:27,270
Yeah. You know, so I played soccer all of our lives down.

750
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:32,960
Helmets, T-shirts. Yeah, I know.

751
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:50,240
So far. But shutting it down, I guess that's what you see.

752
01:20:50,670 --> 01:20:54,630
Officer roles. Yeah, yeah.

753
01:20:54,750 --> 01:21:22,800
I've got a lot of my own personal with that is because on one that I just kept seeing everything just like 95% of the people who are going up.

754
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:30,210
I wish I think I feel pretty stupid.

755
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:35,730
Like New York City.

756
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,810
Yeah. Oh, really? Oh, my God.

757
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:42,760
I have to tell you so much. Yeah. Okay.

758
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,200
I'm like, okay.

759
01:21:45,790 --> 01:22:12,030
So the question about looking at an answer is so open access to anyone in the street and cause, like I said, I'm taking something like, Oh yeah, yeah.

760
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:15,450
Not if you want to look into it. I could use.

761
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:26,420
Yeah. I think of like right now is probably let's just say or maybe like it's just like, oh, I think I'll take both of them.

762
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:31,060
So it's hard to quantify. Yeah. Um.

763
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:37,890
Yeah, but you should keep up with all true as.

764
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,150
Think of the null. True as the same. Yeah.

765
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,800
I'm not sure I agree with you. If you think about it.

766
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:53,890
Think about it. If it was set like under the under the design, it's all there, right?

767
01:22:54,640 --> 01:23:01,680
And such that now it's going to be actually a lot easier to find that those responses.

768
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:07,610
You mean the probability of rejecting this? Oh yes.

769
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:13,370
Because we have like more useful. Yeah, right, right, right.

770
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:18,080
Oh, I think. Yeah, I agree with you. If you. If you.

771
01:23:19,190 --> 01:23:26,930
If you designed a different trial? I mean, yes, if you if you do that and then you use the right.

772
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:31,070
No, it is different. But consider the null under the original intent.

773
01:23:31,370 --> 01:23:34,760
Yeah. I guess your. Yeah. I've already started the trial.

774
01:23:35,330 --> 01:23:39,870
Another version as well. This one?

775
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:45,270
Yeah. So he's lied wise to his subcommittee.

776
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:51,990
So my answer is, I thought that the Chu time tax increase setting is not so.

777
01:23:53,550 --> 01:23:56,700
Oh, so. So the truth is the truth.

778
01:23:56,910 --> 01:24:00,370
Right. So, like, you can't say that the truth is inappropriate.

779
01:24:00,390 --> 01:24:04,110
I see. Because I was like. That was actually what happened.

780
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:09,350
Yeah. So my question is, can we can we said that to toxicity rates?

781
01:24:11,230 --> 01:24:17,290
Because, I mean, in the real experience, we will set the starting tax code.

782
01:24:18,630 --> 01:24:23,570
The toxic iteration of the starting point as a starting dose is like is right

783
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:30,390
like you say you can say something about like why this tree is not working,

784
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:33,870
but you can't say that the tree because of the trees. Right.

785
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:48,020
Yeah. Yeah. Check out the island because before this one is where we said the first one, which is closer to like the last expected.

786
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:55,020
Right. Okay. Right. And I think you have to write a deal, but you can see that the different things to do actually.

787
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:59,590
Yeah. So you need to do links to. Yeah. I don't know.

788
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:10,799
Like I think like, you know, so things are, you know, we will have the extra cry out, you know.

789
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,330
So maybe you missed it in the beginning.

790
01:25:12,330 --> 01:25:19,560
I said there is always a possibility that like it's just like, you know, the second test could be waited for the first time.

791
01:25:19,890 --> 01:25:44,250
Looks kind of like outdated. So I don't know because if you make the about that, you see what I'm talking about.

792
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:54,870
One thing that I think it makes good, huh?

793
01:25:55,170 --> 01:26:02,460
But I'm. I'm yeah, I'm. I said that I had to have written.

794
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:06,210
I got to thank you so much.

795
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:12,890
It's like, that's weird for you.

796
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:24,690
I don't think it's like saying no.

797
01:26:26,130 --> 01:26:31,680
Peter Also, ah, you know, I have over again, let us be nice.

798
01:26:31,690 --> 01:26:47,330
So we can just be much more strongly advised by not like Mother Nature, you know, you see something different.

799
01:26:48,840 --> 01:27:00,980
Yeah. Maybe the red light for this week.

800
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:10,400
What? Many people think she's 30, so it should be good.

801
01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:28,250
It's a decent number. You know, you know, you start doing things like, you know, how are you doing?

802
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:32,030
But I guess that's true.

803
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:42,740
So some people are injured in certain circumstances.

804
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:51,860
It seems to me like, you know, I don't mind talking to you about getting this information back.

805
01:27:53,370 --> 01:28:02,200
Yeah, but I mean, if I turn this guy going right, that's fine.

806
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:07,280
You know, for for this event.

807
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:17,480
No. Which is like, why I think, like, a couple of times.

808
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:44,020
Yeah. Basically, sometimes if you look at one of these, I have like slides from three years ago which I used to like, so I was like,

809
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:59,810
oh, you know, it's just like I think because I feel like the industry just going to be what you want to continue on this week.

810
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:21,650
So I was like, okay, yeah.

811
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:40,000
So I think it's close, but I think it's so stupid.

812
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:45,970
Yeah, of course you do. I mean, I'm not sure how far along, you know.

813
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:49,390
Okay. That's okay. Yeah, I wish I could. Yeah.

814
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:57,310
Yeah. I don't want to get out. Yeah, we'll get there. Yeah, we'll get this to get out of here.

815
01:29:57,730 --> 01:29:59,490
You know what kind of position we're looking for?
