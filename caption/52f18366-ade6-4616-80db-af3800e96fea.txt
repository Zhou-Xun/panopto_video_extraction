1
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:09,750
You know what I mean?

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,310
Yeah. Oh, you.

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,890
Good morning, everybody. So today's going to be a fun class.

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,409
It's on people making your life difficult and the strategic reasons you make people's lives

5
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:35,360
difficult and commercial and public policy benefits is making people's life difficult.

6
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,530
So just to get you into the mood, have you ever tried to get rid of a cable subscription?

7
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,660
Don't just stay with them forever. Right.

8
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:51,200
Basically, we're going to be talking about administrative burden, which is the deliberate creation of obstacles to using a service.

9
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,440
And because this is a policy class, we're going to be focused on policy,

10
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,680
but we're going to be this is something that is regularly and often more frequently done in the private sector.

11
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,149
So. Let's get into the started.

12
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,830
But basically what we think about frustration today today is going to be about the strategic creation use and deployment of frustration.

13
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,360
Specifically understanding the concept of administrative burden.

14
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,310
And then the ways that the creation of administrative burden isn't just down to people being stupid or something,

15
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,410
but is often a deliberate political decision.

16
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:30,000
So here, Moynihan, this isn't from the text that you had in the readings, but they said in a number of places it's the learning,

17
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,120
psychological and compliance costs that citizens experience in their interaction with government learning,

18
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,690
figuring out how to do something, like figuring out what documents you need to take, figuring out when you can get appointments,

19
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:50,820
psychological, feeling disrespected, feeling hassled, having your data messed up, being in an environment that you don't like.

20
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,570
Being treated like a criminal. And compliance.

21
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,110
Adhering to. And documenting your adherence to rules.

22
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:04,230
For example, to do a verification of income if you need to prove that you're receiving benefits from a program that.

23
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,690
Requires a poor safety to keep verifying your income over and over again.

24
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,270
All sorts of drugs tests, for example. So these are three separate kinds of costs.

25
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,920
Right. And a really mean program level three, where we kind of figure out how to get it.

26
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:27,840
It will be disrespectful to you and you will have to keep on doing various things you wouldn't otherwise do in order to not just comply,

27
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,469
but also show your compliance. Now.

28
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,680
There's plenty of things like that. A lot of the time they're deliberately created, right?

29
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:43,560
Verizon hires McKinsey to make sure that it's so much hassle to get rid of the Verizon subscription that you just don't pay.

30
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,349
Every newspaper will give you a $1 a month subscription for an introductory six month offer,

31
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,729
but good luck trying to figure out what the thing actually costs, right? In politics,

32
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,900
what you typically are doing is you're trying to undermine in some ways the basic structure of the

33
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:04,050
program by making it disrespectful and hard to access and easy to get kicked off of the program.

34
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:12,480
In other words, if, for example, you're running Medicaid and you think Medicaid is basically welfare, people should get a job,

35
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,809
then you're going to run Medicaid in a way that's focused on ensuring that they really, really have to want it.

36
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,070
And you're going to be doing a lot of hoops to jump through to make sure that nobody's getting into problems.

37
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:32,130
Now administrative burden affects populations differently, right? So, for example, a lot of poor people are also time poor.

38
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:39,420
Right. The most common way to be poor in the United States is to have some kind of an irregular hours service sector job that's absolutely exhausting,

39
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:48,180
which might make it difficult to, for example, book an appointment at some kind of a bureaucratic office if you actually might get someone into work.

40
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,160
And that's that has have to go to work, period. Obviously language is a big one.

41
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,340
We all immediately go that we are. The thing is not available to you in a language that you speak that you're less likely to access it.

42
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,910
If you've got a kid who's fluent in the language that can translate,

43
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,600
you might feel bad about asking the kid to be doing all your work for you, etc., etc.

44
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,490
So this is a political decision. That's the key thing, right?

45
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:22,680
It's a political decision about how much politicians, as they set up and run these processes, value the people and the benefits they're given.

46
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:30,310
So you can increase political burden through because simply you don't want the program to work as well deliberately.

47
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:37,090
You're trying to make the program to at least some people humiliating or costly to access.

48
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,350
On the other hand, you can decrease it to make it easier to make it something that's easy to get into,

49
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:50,650
to make it something that immediately shows the benefits without taking a lot of hassle, being disrespectful or requiring all sorts of verification.

50
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,830
Any questions on that one? Because most of today is an exercise and it's a fun one.

51
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,729
So two things to take away from this slide. The readings.

52
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:06,260
One is that there's three different flavors of this bourbon learning psychological compliance.

53
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,280
So they're not the same. And you see all three of them created for the reasons.

54
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,970
And the other is that this is a form of hidden politics.

55
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,930
This is what you do if you're trying to undermine the stated goals of a program, for example,

56
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:26,280
or if the program serves several populations and you don't like one of those populations and you want benefits like.

57
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:35,350
Okay. Now we get to the cockpit. I need 14 groups doing the math.

58
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,600
That's most of you. A group of two or three.

59
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,290
Okay, so you do make eye contact thing.

60
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,980
If you're sitting completely isolated like. Go sit somewhere near somebody.

61
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:54,350
These. Or at least make eye contact and show intent to go send somebody.

62
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:14,580
I think at this point, I think, like, I love you guys.

63
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:26,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

64
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:36,390
Okay, now, starting over here, we're going to count off one, two, 14.

65
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,810
Let's see if we can get this on the first try one. Right.

66
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,960
But. Okay.

67
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,470
One six, seven three.

68
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:07,330
And I'm. 12, 13 or 14.

69
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:13,030
All right. The group seem to be a bit smaller on this side of the room if you be able to head over there.

70
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:18,400
All right. The other 13 things you're going to figure out how to apply for something.

71
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,960
So by the left, that's what you're doing.

72
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:33,940
On the right are the questions you answer. So step one is figure out how to do what you're doing and think about it in terms of three things.

73
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:42,580
One is, is it learning? Is it part of figure out is it compliant, is successful, and especially here in Vienna, one of the compliance parts.

74
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:51,720
And then look at it and think, why was this designed this way? Is it just stupidity or are they deliberately targeting this benefit of certain

75
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,610
specific populations to make sure that they're not going to get something that is law?

76
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,640
They haven't been. All right.

77
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:39,850
You have about 20 minutes and then we'll see how we're going. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

78
00:08:52,020 --> 00:09:12,570
It's always worth your time yeah.

79
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:27,180
So yeah, I mean, that's what I think.

80
00:09:27,180 --> 00:10:36,820
You all have expressed concern about people who have died and that's why you see there is an element of these things.

81
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:47,240
So it's like, Yeah, yeah, yeah.

82
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:08,710
It's hard to see how you can do that.

83
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,450
So yeah, yeah.

84
00:11:30,150 --> 00:13:01,660
I mean, you know, the yeah, I was like, oh yeah, you know, I don't think, you know, I just felt like that was like, yeah.

85
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:30,970
So it's like. Down here somewhere.

86
00:13:40,900 --> 00:14:22,530
But yes, this is why I want to go after all this stuff.

87
00:14:33,890 --> 00:15:47,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right, yeah.

88
00:15:51,160 --> 00:17:18,380
Well, you know, I think what is going to happen is whether or not I guess I guess it's okay, you know what I mean?

89
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:48,690
I got out on the last three of it.

90
00:17:50,150 --> 00:18:01,380
And to have your house.

91
00:18:01,520 --> 00:19:35,000
Yeah. Yeah. Right now, I would say that we have to start to just like a lot of things, but I think a lot of things happen.

92
00:19:39,810 --> 00:20:33,550
But it's not something that we just like a lot of young people want to do.

93
00:20:43,090 --> 00:22:04,370
I just want to talk about this right now because I do not know who I am.

94
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:34,730
What is this?

95
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:43,450
Yes. Yes, yes.

96
00:22:49,480 --> 00:23:03,310
Yes. Is something that I think is.

97
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:36,060
Without you? Well, I mean, that's interesting.

98
00:23:37,360 --> 00:24:18,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

99
00:24:21,940 --> 00:25:08,100
Well, I met my husband, and I was just like, Oh, yeah, well, I know what it is.

100
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:36,600
You know, I was just like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

101
00:25:38,160 --> 00:26:29,060
I mean, like I said, okay, so just a minute or two and make sure you know who's going to be asking the question will be part of this process,

102
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:48,230
such as this one in the report are very generous.

103
00:26:55,250 --> 00:27:30,240
Yeah, I was just it was so easy.

104
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:38,100
So what was the wonderful role of administrative burden? Like I was just saying, this looks like we get some help.

105
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:46,680
So let's try and, you know, it's it's of work, you know, let's just because it's not gonna let us begin with our talk.

106
00:27:51,950 --> 00:28:00,880
So to register in DC you just need to provide proof of vaccination.

107
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:09,650
And if you choose to do, you can either take this free license or if you do like process that.

108
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,940
If we choose to do that, that's great news for vaccines as well.

109
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:21,320
The only things that we've identified as problems with vaccines are expensive.

110
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:26,380
So the rabies vaccination might be like a pass through of.

111
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:33,990
We talk about it and try to prevent this by having other familiarization for the dogs.

112
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:40,680
How about I believe I am just replied that you get a one year license or a three year license.

113
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,890
And if you believe people will probably forget me, apply for.

114
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:51,830
So there might be some lapses that there might still. What you saw.

115
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:57,620
So I hear we have obviously the cost of the battle, though you can argue the rabies shots are very good public health intervention.

116
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:05,470
We have multiple different tiers of dog licensing based on the dog and the number of years, one of the mechanics of actually doing it.

117
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:13,850
You just really have to survive. The dogs like you can apply online and you just have to provide the dog's name.

118
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:24,250
Green color, sex and rabies with your pet and with the features of what they are.

119
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:27,680
And it's it's, you know, it's great and they're a pretty on offer.

120
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:32,719
So this isn't totally without service, right? Because we're saying you need to be online.

121
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,050
If you have some form of online payment, you obviously need to vet.

122
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,819
And they seem to have made it complicated based on, I guess, an incentive to neuter your dog.

123
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:48,860
See, save on the on the fees is that our cream is more expensive spread it is more expensive.

124
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:53,060
That's good. I guess it's like having stray cats in Ann Arbor.

125
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:58,930
Okay, so this is a baseline for something where they're trying to get people to do it right.

126
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,450
They never wants you to license your dog. By the way, how many have you?

127
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:08,330
Well, actually, how many of you have a dog in Ann Arbor? Did you know that already?

128
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:15,080
Listen, I know what I was trying to do this.

129
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,130
I didn't want to set up an Ann Arbor city of Ann Arbor accounts because I don't have a dog.

130
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:24,709
And I ended up finding kalamazoo's pdf ward before discovering Ann Arbor is like a long

131
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:28,840
educational thing about how to have a dog and it a copy of the forms at the end of it.

132
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:33,319
So that's if you happen to read at the end of it, not totally well related form,

133
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:38,780
you can find the paper copy and be able to mail the check if you don't have good internet access like credit cards.

134
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:43,400
This one might be a stupidity of a bureaucracy.

135
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,830
I think we're about to head into a much more dangerous search the second because you toss it over towards the driver's license.

136
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:58,800
Hi. So we found registering for a driver's license, particularly a first time drivers license.

137
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:06,270
It's very hard in Michigan to the problems that we identified is that first requires an office visit.

138
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:11,009
So obviously this becomes a barrier for the people that don't have the time to go

139
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:16,649
into the office or a car necessarily to get to the office and they can't drive.

140
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:22,530
So it's such a difficult document that no photocopies were allowed.

141
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:29,220
So you need original documents which again oftentimes get lost in the shuffle of move, etc.

142
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:36,360
So that's one huge area. And you say that these policies likely exist to prevent younger reckless drivers

143
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:41,280
from obtaining a license and protect particularly the youth population,

144
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,360
because there are even more steps required for them to get a license.

145
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:51,450
You're thinking that this might be to reduce the number of drivers again off road and

146
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:56,100
to reduce the overall number of fatal motor vehicle incidents is rising in Michigan.

147
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,930
And we're saying that to reduce the burden, they should allow photocopies,

148
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:07,440
documents in other languages because that was another area and they should reduce the number of required documents.

149
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,499
So you're saying that mom's against truck driving?

150
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:16,680
It looks like the process someone is bringing an original copy of your birth certificate to make the road safer.

151
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:27,180
I have to be completely honest. So who is really, really being targeted when you won't get an idea about the success of the government's.

152
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:33,450
Immigrants are undocumented. And immigrants in general.

153
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,250
This is a citizenship policy pretending to be a driver's ed policy.

154
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:43,190
Ed said, very anti-poor. Because guess what?

155
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:48,560
If you're healthy and secure, the odds are you have an original copy of the birth certificate sitting around there, relatively limited.

156
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:57,630
But one of the biggest companies here looking to proof of address, you have to read utility bills or even pay some utility bills, a house, you know?

157
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:05,240
But it's interesting that obviously original copy and original documentation, these are all things that are really,

158
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:11,180
really quite easy to do if you're in stable measure for an American citizen or even naturalized.

159
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:18,490
And there really are otherwise. So that's why, for example, Ann Arbor City has an I.D. card.

160
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,080
It's really easy to get has no legal standing for this kind of. Okay.

161
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,260
So our driver's licenses and immigration policy,

162
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:32,590
let's see what where the obvious manifesto policy is to make sure that women, infants and children have adequate nutrition.

163
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,400
So who's work process is complicated?

164
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:46,580
You have to at first call your local services to get an application,

165
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:54,870
and then you have to either mail the application in or go to it to the people at the Department of the Services.

166
00:33:55,230 --> 00:34:05,550
And then you actually kind of like in the process they can see, use your ID, make sure that you actually are eligible.

167
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:12,950
And then a lot of times people online like people have security barriers.

168
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:24,300
You've got to start with this. And then after you establish out all your stuff, you can get a certification process, you receive nutrition, education,

169
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:36,360
which is very long, repetitive, and a lot of the people who have like this commission and then once you do have with this,

170
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:45,569
you have to go back to these I use of child like I don't know how often but you have to bring your child in and trying

171
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:52,140
to get bloodwork because they like to take priority to kids who have health conditions that are kids like that.

172
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:56,580
And so that's a process for a lot of areas.

173
00:34:56,910 --> 00:35:04,110
But if I can use both physically to place order patients and people who are usually active,

174
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:11,960
which are working a lot of time to take off from where to go with their child, to present their child to study.

175
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:22,500
And then there's also a lot of documents that you need to provide, and there's also a waiting list.

176
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:28,020
So sometimes there's not even enough money with the agency to support everyone.

177
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:33,280
So that's why they look budget priorities like blood issues.

178
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,319
It's like that because they get to decide where to prioritize their money.

179
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,750
So that's good, right? So this sounds like it's got everything.

180
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:50,489
It's got learning costs because this sounds like your technique and what our professional it's got psychological costs.

181
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:54,360
Is this some place clearing out? Present your child for analysis.

182
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,230
That's what it sounds like.

183
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:00,820
And there's compliance costs because it sounds like you need to keep behaving in the way that this program is going to be profitable.

184
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,870
So this sounds like a really desirable way to achieve the goal of women, infants and children having better nutrition.

185
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:12,960
I'm sure the classes are compliance classes, psychological learning and compliance costs.

186
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,100
Excellent. Why? Who wants that?

187
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:21,450
These are the people that are accessing the program.

188
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:31,800
Who does it? But it is too far to quick for people who actually universal access to it because it's so difficult to access.

189
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:36,600
So we're have a program that is targeted basically at poor women and children.

190
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:45,370
And guess what? We're punishing them. Or increasing administrative burdens associated with the program, which is a way of keeping our program costs.

191
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,200
It also destroys basically humiliating and bothering people more than.

192
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:01,020
So, by the way, one of the editors was in the class and actually one of the authors, and they all had this like every third Thursday.

193
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:09,650
Now we're going to Thursday every third Thursday. So if you don't know when the series began, I guess you just have to try every Thursday.

194
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:16,320
And so you get the Writers Day and other offices open the first and last Wednesday on.

195
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:23,989
It's so getting the office isn't going out to the public and so getting through to this office already.

196
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:28,490
Like if you discovered on the second Thursday that once you had two or three weeks before you

197
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:34,220
started putting up for three weeks before you got get into an office to begin the process.

198
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:42,170
So this is a very, very high administrative work program, and it's because it's targeted at women with children who are poor.

199
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:46,070
And frankly, the politics is also probably racialized.

200
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:50,630
So let's do something else. Let's have a virtual knock down.

201
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:56,310
What becomes of us. You need some emergency manager here?

202
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:10,980
Okay. So we had the finger for 13 years.

203
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:18,250
And two problems that we found were that you need a Social Security number and.

204
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:26,630
A lot of people don't know their Social Security number and see who's could been doing bad things.

205
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,560
That's a long process. It's really hard.

206
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:38,030
And then another problem that we identified was that because they're working,

207
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:46,070
a lot of people might not have access to the Internet or other resources that could help them hide for.

208
00:38:47,260 --> 00:39:00,190
Support. Online application in the aftermath of hurricane want to go on the air pretty much and then also another

209
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:09,210
thing that we saw was that someone has to come in and set their own property before they can get there.

210
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:15,880
And so people might not have gone back to their properties if they don't know what's going on.

211
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:23,170
So it's hard to apply for people who have to come back so they don't get approved and discussions

212
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,810
with these groups that exist because they don't just want you to do that for everyone.

213
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:40,780
So they're really struggling to get me to who I think that we should actually be able to require a different form of.

214
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:46,440
Are there any other businesses security that we're not sure about?

215
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:52,620
And also, there's a huge logjam there in the I'm in a hotel in Georgia.

216
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:57,670
I don't know what happened to my residence. The hotel in Georgia has Internet, which is good.

217
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:01,389
But on the other hand, I can't see what's the state of my residences until I go back.

218
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,890
And then where am I supposed to stay?

219
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:07,719
And then I need to get through this backup system to have somebody come out and say, what's happened to my house?

220
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:14,140
And I personally have my view about what my uninsured emergency losses are, which might not coincide with anybody else's.

221
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,659
And you've got these people, adjudicators,

222
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:21,430
whose job is to decide what actually happened to you and how much money that needs and whether or not you should have been insured for it.

223
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,790
So what's supposed to be a helpful thing? You can see how this is turning into a very considerable administrative burden.

224
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:38,780
Who do you think needs FEMA help? A lot of lower income people without insurance.

225
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:46,140
In other words, lower income citizens. So here we have once again something that looks like a giveaway,

226
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:51,560
and it's a giveaway disproportionately to poorer people who see both of you with your beach house.

227
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,840
If you actually have a passion outside Syracuse, you just love to go fish.

228
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,800
It's insured is insured, by the way. It's not the federal government's problem.

229
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:05,240
So we have here a very, very high bureaucracy program aimed at poor people.

230
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:09,800
Right now, they've just lost a lot of what's most important to them in their lives, including in this case,

231
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:15,650
all the paperwork followed by the family arguments about whether or not your passport was actually destroyed.

232
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:23,850
So once again, high level administrative burden on a program aimed at poor people and its administrative burden.

233
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:27,830
Right. Well, I've got to sort of thinking about.

234
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,820
Okay. Toss it over and we're going to try and get unemployment insurance.

235
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,870
And remember, unemployment actually will be 10% about the other thing that matters.

236
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:46,340
Democrats like helping people in that sense. Right. So they'd like to support people who have uninsured losses.

237
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:52,760
That's part of the reason the politics of passion of the Republicans have kind of caught in the middle of their coalition,

238
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:56,320
because the Republican logic is that you should prepare for disaster.

239
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,690
Try if you're going to live on an island, the a captive hurricane, you should get insurance.

240
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:03,800
And if you don't want to insure your house, then maybe you should be living in a hurricane.

241
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:10,010
If your local government doesn't have the ability to rebuild infrastructure after the hurricane, that it should make coverage at a time.

242
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:16,550
So the Republicans are much more into the logic of sort of preparation and self-reliance, that understanding risk taking,

243
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:20,710
which means that Republican administrations have the problems that they would like

244
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,399
to hit because they want to encourage preparedness is reliance on your yourself,

245
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,930
your family, your community. But at the same time, there's also a lot of people in the Gulf states both.

246
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,080
So that's why you tend to get a very, very awkward pattern.

247
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:38,740
And the Democrats build it up and then Republicans take it down because they like to do is

248
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:44,820
get rid of the federal insurance policy so people take adequate preparations in celebration.

249
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,420
Okay. How was it? The unemployment insurance, which I will remind you, is insurance, right?

250
00:42:52,840 --> 00:43:00,220
And effectively an insurance policy paid by your employer against the likelihood that you can come find board.

251
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:04,540
So this is this money. Hello?

252
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:16,430
Yes, we had a fight over insurance. And like a lot of the programs you talk about, a lot of information.

253
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:21,700
Proof of citizenship, any state I.D. and Social Security number.

254
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:25,960
And you just talk to all of the data to obtain in the first place.

255
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:31,839
On this one case, it also says you need to report your quarterly income.

256
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:38,469
So they going to be taking their quarterly income and number that especially when they get away.

257
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:42,520
All of you also have to certify recertify.

258
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:48,820
You are likely to take steps to prove that you're still unemployed.

259
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:53,500
You also have to get your report that you're actively looking for work.

260
00:43:53,650 --> 00:44:03,040
So you have to also access this other website, which is likely created a house and license that you're working somehow early looking for work.

261
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,120
So yeah, it's just a lot of like a lot of stuff to keep up with and kind of like awkward.

262
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,090
Like I feel like I'm afraid to like, try to remember,

263
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:21,610
especially when you're like in a stressful situation of just being unemployed and yet and also doesn't like.

264
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:30,230
Really explain what you would do in the unfortunately employment situation if you're still unemployed.

265
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:34,510
Like how are you going to work for your employer if like you are?

266
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,120
Like there's a lot of unanswered questions from that period.

267
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:45,580
And then that was great because look at some of the things, apart from just a litany of humiliation.

268
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:52,210
First of all, I guess who knows how much money you make? The IRS, the state tax agency.

269
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:59,140
So we're starting with information on the part of the government already has. Then let's say I go out and smash my car.

270
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:03,460
I don't have the insurance company coming around every week demanding to know whether I bought a new car with the money.

271
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,260
Right. My house burns down and I get fire insurance on that,

272
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:12,999
that they don't come around and inspect my improvements to the house and say like the rest you put on.

273
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,580
Right. So what kind of insurance policy is it in which they come around and treat you like a welfare recipient?

274
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:21,760
Right. I was just waiting for you to tell me to have some nutrition class.

275
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:28,299
So we're deliberately creating these barriers to the unemployment insurance system.

276
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:35,320
This is like completely collapsed with COVID 19. And some states continue to maintain very, very tough policies like this.

277
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,830
And the result was a lot of people didn't get the unemployment insurance that they paid into.

278
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:42,280
And other states, disproportionately, ones by Democrats,

279
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:48,020
just basically quit trying to process the applications properly, stop doing the verification that's in Michigan.

280
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:51,190
No longer take it for about a billion with a B dollars with fraud.

281
00:45:53,190 --> 00:46:00,450
So when you build a system on the goal that minimizing unemployment insurance expenditures because remember those are paid by business ultimately.

282
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:06,330
So you cut the UI bill by making it harder to get UI by building a bureaucracy that doesn't work.

283
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:12,150
And then 2020 hits and you have a choice of mass fraud or mass hardship.

284
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:16,360
And that was the choice governors had. Michigan went for mass fraud.

285
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,800
Texas went for mass hardship. Okay.

286
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:28,590
House health care. Actually.

287
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:32,820
So it is quickly. My absolute favorite, the UAE. With me is the District of Columbia.

288
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:38,800
Not only was it physically still running in the city. It was pretty quick.

289
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:45,180
Look at the gray screens and everything. It also said you have to have an Internet account to sign up for it like.

290
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:53,440
And we recommend if you need a free Internet account, Hotmail account, AOL account like this, you know anybody with an AOL?

291
00:46:55,450 --> 00:47:01,390
Good heavens. But can you imagine how it feels in 20 years?

292
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:06,490
It's 2020. And they're like, Would you like to have an AOL account in order to access the service?

293
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,750
Sorry. Pulled out, Director. What is AOL?

294
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,550
Okay, you know what else? Yes. Okay.

295
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:21,130
Just checking. Okay. Right. So let's get some health care with our email account.

296
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:26,200
We try to apply the service services we couldn't do at the enrollment period.

297
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,840
That's the first administrative burden.

298
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:41,110
So let me tell you that there's actually a lot of websites for applying for insurance is a little bit unclear which one I actually try to

299
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:52,150
apply for health insurance because a lot of them redirected to the different open enrollment period for both the marketplace and military.

300
00:47:52,870 --> 00:48:02,530
So I understand why that is, but it's just using for people who don't know when to apply for what they qualify for.

301
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:15,190
Yes. And then we also know that there is something which various company also with a lot of information and this is just a lot of people,

302
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:27,560
but in other words, is not clear through all those other languages and to this website that does have a lot of other registered,

303
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:34,240
mostly just like translate brochures that then redirects you back to the website, which is the translator.

304
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:46,660
You can also call the number which I think the ones that I was able to help here, which is good, but it's a lot of the ones that we need to track on.

305
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:59,400
There's nothing that we see on. And yeah, I mean, it was pretty good.

306
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:05,910
It was speaking about other things. So within the realm of insurance purchasing, it's pretty good, right?

307
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:12,390
Remember, this isn't just an undifferentiated horror, right? We don't torture everybody in the locker room, torture victims, relatives, etc.

308
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:19,680
It's a bit of a pain in the butt. This is health insurance. It's automatically but right.

309
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:28,400
That certificate that. So the notice nonetheless that, for example, there are things that are being done for the convenience of the industry.

310
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:33,380
But put the marker out there trying to make health care not so easy.

311
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:39,300
Unlike pretty much everything on the subject except the dog. A vessel.

312
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,010
Okay. See, we had a lot of pasta.

313
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:59,120
And one big problem with the application process is that you have to know this in real life, understand that perhaps it can help you.

314
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,360
And so you have to know how to do it. Why you should do it.

315
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:13,290
Time to fill it out. A laptop Internet connection and your parents, which is another problem, is that you need your parents tax information,

316
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:19,440
which can be uncomfortable even when your parents are with you and get divorced.

317
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:26,430
Parents are separated. Parents that can cause issues of the absent parent being their information can be difficult.

318
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:34,110
And so why these problems exist, so financial aid programs preceding the FAFSA,

319
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:43,710
we're also kind of confusing and disparate and very bureaucratic and historically only dated white men.

320
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:47,520
And so the FAFSA was created to standardize this process.

321
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,160
But it's likely that history contributes to the problems, as you say.

322
00:50:55,020 --> 00:51:00,599
And a big thing is they're giving financial aid based on need or that's what they claim.

323
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:05,430
So that is why the questions are often very detailed,

324
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:15,540
sometimes confusing is a complicated and why a few things we talked about around the administrative

325
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:25,290
burden could be reduced is that high schools can have more time and resources dedicated to the FAFSA,

326
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:35,760
like maybe having evening workshops that are parents could also be with you and also just generally more outreach and it exists and apply for it,

327
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:43,270
but that costs money and time. So you don't want to increase spending on education, oppose it.

328
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,500
Here's a quick one. Some other words I need to go to both my parents or how many parents,

329
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:54,899
citizens they claim is advocacy and get them to divulge personal financial information.

330
00:51:54,900 --> 00:52:04,530
What they want to do college. So here we have a policy that gives parents very, very strong financial control over their own adults.

331
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:15,030
Some people might regard that as a feature of a policy rather than a club. There was actually an experiment which just made it all out.

332
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:20,650
I mean, in this version, it's pretty cool. That's like literally give you your absolutely help because guess what?

333
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:30,180
Your parents has every word at all that you. So we're asking people basically go to a circuit and give their parents tax information,

334
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:35,460
which the IRS already has to report back to the federal government that checks it with the IRS.

335
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:43,020
So. Okay, this was an improvement under George H.W. Bush for his ratings for.

336
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:48,910
We can literally click on the form or even 1994.

337
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:53,160
In a sense, the federal government, the IRS doesn't need to audit itself.

338
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:59,090
So I would. Who's going to be who is suffering here?

339
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:10,510
Most of you. A lot of people think it's just the facts in the news,

340
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:16,830
that their parents are not supportive of them to college or don't have proper financial literacy.

341
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:22,160
I just can't get past that one.

342
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:30,570
And so another thing is that fast that doesn't make you a racist enough to parents and counseling if you're on your college.

343
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:38,720
So, in other words, operating against people who are estranged from their parents or grandparents.

344
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:44,490
It sounds to me like cheating two perfectly widely acknowledged public policy

345
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:47,610
goals increasing the power of parents over children and punishing poor people.

346
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:53,440
And making very, very sure that, you know, the federal government is doing you a favor.

347
00:53:54,780 --> 00:54:03,830
That's a big burden. I think in the Albion business person, I regard the pasta as a problem.

348
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:09,710
Tell us about that experience. Yeah, so are some experience.

349
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:21,950
But the truth is the website is really difficult and that's another aspect of difficult to navigate.

350
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:26,340
You get to the site where you're actually trying to speak to the U.S.,

351
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:33,260
not us trying to go somewhere else and then go to complete your application online.

352
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:47,420
And the idea that I guess Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer only, and you have to fill it out in English except for the username.

353
00:54:48,620 --> 00:55:00,020
And then so once you finish it, you have to have a detailed email you would if you have to download the app, you can only do this if you have that.

354
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:07,160
So yeah. And then you have to get that and bring it with you to the office.

355
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:12,160
So that's about it. So what do you do in the office?

356
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:16,309
Well, you have to pay if you live.

357
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:23,630
Right now in Zambia, it's 50 U.S. dollars and you say either online or at the moment.

358
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:32,060
But for the weekend and 150 days in Kenya and the offices are closed because of landmines.

359
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:36,680
So you have to go to like three offices are open right now.

360
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:41,450
So you have to travel far and see when you go to your appointment,

361
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:47,570
you have an interview which at your interview they ask the question and they

362
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:54,500
decide that you're excited and need further and straight is like my for you.

363
00:55:55,610 --> 00:56:01,700
And there is no information on the way about what because it's like or things like that.

364
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:08,570
So you just might be randomly chosen or have no idea why you've chosen that early process.

365
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:12,500
And you can go through all of this and just even at the end.

366
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:19,190
And so you pay that 160 up salaries, but you may not.

367
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:24,890
If you set it up as a fictional esthetic, where do you go?

368
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:31,489
So it's a very difficult process overall,

369
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:41,300
and we talk a lot about how the U.S. politics play into this and the opposition and how does that rhetoric of like protecting U.S. citizens,

370
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:47,230
reporters. And so that report, reality is just like.

371
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:55,120
How they feel, especially if they're not in other countries, because those countries don't have to go through this process.

372
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:59,980
So it seems selective for who we want to be assigned to us and we don't want.

373
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:05,460
Yeah. So what is the profile of a Gambian you could actually get into the.

374
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:13,520
Well, you kind of have to live in the Capitol, first of all, and be able to have it in the House.

375
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:20,830
And I wish all of these things were in English.

376
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:28,200
That. So not sharing with somebody, it's something I feel.

377
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:33,330
And another U.S. federal database isn't necessarily all that good if you want to complicate things like this.

378
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:41,000
I've got a friend named Alan French, perfectly understandable English experience.

379
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:46,300
Unfortunately, he's English and he shares to the name of somebody who wants to do something.

380
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:54,430
And that means he exited the United States to figure out how to play off the fact that out of touch with Moscow before Hillary in 1986,

381
00:57:54,940 --> 00:58:02,250
which was an interesting perspective on this episode, he was. Just imagine you are more complicated than Trump.

382
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:10,019
So the message is getting West Africa is the problem and the only ones that you can help are

383
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:16,340
really very wealthy and have a lot of time and literature and funny internet access and Wi-Fi,

384
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:24,760
which is helping country by African standards. I think in Nigeria it's like three days to get to a place where you might find it very possible.

385
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:29,680
And they also supports. So how does it compare to the easy money?

386
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:34,840
The last time I did this, I have the website is down because the Internet is down.

387
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:38,970
So there's also information right now.

388
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:45,970
One is at Columbia for the World Health Organization and everyone is Jacobi out of this a mobile with these apps.

389
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:53,050
The Colombians rejected half of the applicants and have literally closed all visa processing for two weeks.

390
00:58:54,920 --> 00:59:01,819
So basically a bunch of people from Europe and North America are going to go to Bogota to give a lecture, and it's headed for Africa.

391
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:08,330
It's to a bunch of Latin Americans, so they kind of stick together. Highest level.

392
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:11,330
Columbia is now processing visas for the next two weeks. I would like.

393
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:19,780
And I assure you, I take it from Africa to politics that you have to go through Paris, Amsterdam and London.

394
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:24,850
Okay. So we did a little bit of immigration. We'll come back around to that.

395
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:31,360
But let's get rid of our student debt. And that's going to be a hard one, right? Got all your tax returns since 1982.

396
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:43,330
Oh, that's what we thought. But it was actually a lot easier to do this, like go online in search of the student loan business.

397
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:48,910
And it takes you straight to the application, such as on five questions, your name,

398
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:57,700
Social Security number, and that's it, you know, and it's the beginning of the application.

399
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:02,710
We got that like there are some administrative burdens of this online.

400
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:06,670
You can only apply until December 31st.

401
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:11,740
We also thought that the reasons for this,

402
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:20,500
like especially with the elections and this was a big kind of like for instance, kind of like a referendum on voting.

403
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:26,710
And they said that they would roll this out in such an easy as a way to control the elections.

404
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:39,210
And also if it was going to, because I think that you know just it helps us to promote education march much 30 open or

405
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:45,910
just kind of like back in history different actually so that people are really upset.

406
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:53,080
On the bright side, it's after your W-2s coming in. So in a sense, it's like you get the thing issued in January.

407
01:00:53,080 --> 01:01:01,540
It's pretty easy to set the copy. So we have here an easy process was a few million and it wasn't hard.

408
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:07,060
And you seem to have one compliance requirement, which is to copy the government to this virus.

409
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:15,400
But the law of. So here we have two things but expenses, health insurance, health care of is easy.

410
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:18,320
And now the student loan forgiveness is easier.

411
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:25,550
By the way, it's $10,000 that's basically moved about 50% of black households from that negative net positive of.

412
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:29,240
I think also that there is a lot to a lot of people.

413
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:35,600
And the other thing about student loans, by the way, is that a huge proportion of that debt is held by people who never recovered.

414
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:41,110
So please don't make loss, because having gone to college is about as useful as the real.

415
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,660
And a lot of that's the predatory for profit companies.

416
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:51,620
So, you know, in many ways this is expunging, but it it's a federally subsidized scheme, the private college education.

417
01:01:52,430 --> 01:02:03,070
Anyway, people want to have an easy process. Tell anybody who's got student debt or lawsuit it which is way.

418
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:11,340
Barbara. We're going to show why people in Michigan are just so beautiful.

419
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:18,780
Yes. So we look at becoming a licensed barber, the upper peninsula.

420
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:26,309
And a couple of the challenges that we saw in that decision process is that you must verify your work experience,

421
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:30,240
that every worker accredited experience has 1800 hours.

422
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:38,730
Or you could do like send your official school transcripts if you are getting like education from an accredited university.

423
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:47,250
But the problem is that there are no accredited schools in the U.S. for because I would like to become a licensed pharmacist,

424
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:50,280
definitely a barrier that we recognize.

425
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:55,100
Also, there's an exam that you must pay at fees associated with the exam if required,

426
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:00,629
for as long as the whole application fee has or l'opposition has fees.

427
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:08,760
And you must relicensed, you must reapply every two years or prove that you are continuing to be a

428
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:14,760
barber as long as the license has 100 other fees on top of the $80 initial 80,

429
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:20,309
that this is not a fee that you're supposed to set all these serials to different places.

430
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:30,719
It's not all one system, Sage said. You know, per capita education is one place compared to other places for other materials.

431
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:35,820
So those are definitely the burdens that we notice. And then our schools are big,

432
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:45,299
like what the tuition and are going to benefit from these steps as most like what we found interesting is that they actually want

433
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:53,520
there to be less workers in the law so that they are in higher demand and then they take charge like barbers charge higher prices,

434
01:03:54,030 --> 01:04:01,260
which I had no idea about. But that makes sense in terms of supply and demand that they can charge more for this service.

435
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,830
And that is is just one of the main reasons why this problem exists in the first place,

436
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:14,610
in addition to the administrative burden already by whoever is society's licensure rules for barbers,

437
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:21,479
but introduces think that you could reduce the fees as well as the renewal

438
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:27,150
frequency that's required to stay a licensed carbon state from every two years,

439
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:31,080
potentially every five years. That would be like less paperwork, less money.

440
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:36,209
That's the costs that you have to pay for this, as well as apprenticeship hours,

441
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:43,950
1800 hours of a lot of hours on top of like other responsibilities that you may not be able to be paid or paid well.

442
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,219
So I think decreasing these hours potentially could be important.

443
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:51,690
And we saw that or we read that the apprenticeship hours becomes harder.

444
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:57,890
Is the times having less or starting the process to become a barber?

445
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:04,130
Sometimes more than that. That's pretty shocking.

446
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:11,970
And so other things are about all of this is to cut hair versus, you know, provide her hair.

447
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:20,500
So that that was definitely something that we should do to reduce this administrative further training costs.

448
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:23,820
So there we have administrative work working a little bit differently.

449
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:29,129
There is it is creating a select class of barbers who have built a whole lot of fortifications to keep everybody else.

450
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:35,430
Barber I mean, you do fully recognize that the result is a very beautiful male population in Michigan.

451
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:46,340
You. The funny thing is actually the there was a barber in Ann Arbor who led the Barbering Advisory Council,

452
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:49,790
which is an elected body of Barbers Barber policy.

453
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:54,059
And he made it his mission of showing respect for the Upper Peninsula to get that

454
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:59,200
apprenticeship 800 hours because he regarded as entirely untested at university,

455
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,660
he wanted to cut hair. You had all the classic artists.

456
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:09,950
So be very proud of Little Irish. And you're looking at this guy as he's awful hard to go to barber shop on the corner of Liberty.

457
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:16,219
It made me want to tell you that's liberalization to improve the quality of hair in the Upper Peninsula right there.

458
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:19,580
You should not be the apprenticeship at all. So that was I mean,

459
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:28,249
it's better that you have an option to just work and get that work experience rather than having to go to an accredited institution.

460
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:37,880
So we think that that was progress. So 18 hours is a lot of hours to get a degree here, like actual profit after work.

461
01:06:37,890 --> 01:06:43,220
That's horrible. I don't know what else.

462
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:52,050
Okay. So that's administrative work, which they voluntarily pay because it raises their company, reduces their competition, which is a nice change.

463
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,890
Now, okay, let's go back to the social welfare program.

464
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:01,230
Yeah. So you looked at the Medicaid in Michigan.

465
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:08,720
And so basically what you have to do is you go to the government website and there are three options that apply online.

466
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:15,660
You can call the Michigan Health Care Helpline or visit the Department of Human Services Office.

467
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:20,040
So theoretically, it seems really simple.

468
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:23,190
However, you don't have high speed Internet.

469
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:28,930
How do you deal with supplies for older people?

470
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:33,989
How do you use the website or do you find your services?

471
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:43,040
Office also takes time? And then the other problem is that the address is requires supplies.

472
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:54,680
So if you're interested in housing or whatever, then that's kind of a huge hurdle going back to the Internet issue.

473
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:02,430
We found that 17% of the population that has Internet and people who don't have Internet or phone.

474
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:07,700
What else?

475
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:18,860
Another theory that we found was that if you hit a fly and you thinking that's probably because it's not a person being added to that household.

476
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:22,280
So they so but it's different.

477
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:33,640
I don't know if kind focus the information, but it did explicitly say under the qualifications that you are not president type of application.

478
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:42,260
So that was a little strange and it's really strange because a lot of the Medicaid population is precisely private people.

479
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:50,329
Right. So that was a little strange because it's really interesting.

480
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:56,450
Richard Burton, we were thinking of the committee as she was getting the information.

481
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:10,370
Okay. So maybe collecting information on public places, grocery stores or places of work or maybe even sending home information of schoolchildren.

482
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:18,020
However, the doctors who actually have children studying the information,

483
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:25,919
who is also some opposition would be this would be investment of the government.

484
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:31,590
So the kind of money that they would have to give us to distribute these materials, which there was to do.

485
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:37,840
So you sold out here before it got rid of it.

486
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:42,690
Let's jump to Indiana. So we'll get to state programs and see how it compares down.

487
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:49,600
Yeah. So we had Indiana. It was really similar.

488
01:09:49,630 --> 01:09:54,210
You could apply online in person or over the phone.

489
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:59,370
And the only thing that was required for Indiana was your address.

490
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:06,420
And that's for other things like Social Security and other attacks for those weren't required,

491
01:10:06,930 --> 01:10:14,040
but it was still unclear how they would get back to you and let you know if you're eligible, if you didn't upload those things.

492
01:10:14,430 --> 01:10:25,980
And then in the portal, the document uploads in the screen and they said the resultant stuff is the bad way to do it.

493
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:30,200
So one of the things on Medicaid is income verification, right?

494
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:34,470
Because one of the big problems we have in the health insurance market is that

495
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:38,070
you've got a medicaid population at the bottom end of the income distribution.

496
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:45,299
Then you have in the expansion states the slice of people under Medicaid expansion, then your income gets too high.

497
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:51,240
You out of that, you potentially exchange territory. And then for people that come with less rates.

498
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:58,620
And furthermore, a lot of people like a weekly or biweekly payslip as they're not necessarily calculated to quarterly income,

499
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:02,760
which you have the core of income problem. Yeah.

500
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:06,930
So, again, what's your quarterly income? Well, do you have any payslips?

501
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:13,890
You have any stack it up and figure out the quarterly income tied up to even to qualify for Medicaid or it's more likely to qualify.

502
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:19,290
How do you keep up this process? And if you get it wrong, they have penalties that they can work against you.

503
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:27,089
So in many ways, this is almost a private sector model where they get you in and then once you've sort of committed to them,

504
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:32,420
as you start out with some questions. But it is definitely election fraud.

505
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:38,180
If you lie to the government about the quarterly income, then I'm sure actually that law easily enough.

506
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:49,070
Okay. Sorry. Oh, I had been looking at that face, which is how completely.

507
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:58,070
I am very sorry for marijuana addiction. I'm waiting for a good possibility.

508
01:11:58,070 --> 01:12:08,660
Except for you. I realized quite a while ago I feel pretty comfortable about how awful it is.

509
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:34,040
Barbara. I think you are looking at it like this.
