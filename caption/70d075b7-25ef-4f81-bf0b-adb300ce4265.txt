1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:13,610
Hey, good morning. I'm celebrating the newfound warmth in this room that feels really uncomfortable, right?

2
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:19,240
But don't don't get too comfortable. Give it a week or two and we'll be, like, roasting in here.

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,960
I mean, like 80 degrees anyway. Welcome back to 86.

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:31,140
I won a couple of things, a couple of logistics. Before we get back into the lecture material, I was reminded.

5
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,460
Thank you very much. In the last class period about this little thing hanging over here in the assignment's column.

6
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:46,190
It's not actually anything for you to do right now, but it was a prompt for me to actually introduce our next assignment after we get to the exam.

7
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:56,520
It's a really brief introduction. It most of it is actually in the syllabus, but I just wanted to cover it officially as part of class.

8
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,730
It will take two minutes to introduce it.

9
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:04,570
After that, I want you to just like let it go out of your other ear and don't think about it for like another ten days or so.

10
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:11,330
OK, just focus on the exam. That's coming up next week, preparing for it, you know, doing well and so forth.

11
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:21,140
But anyway, just so you know what to expect after we get through the exam, I won't actually wait until the 12th to assign the proposal.

12
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:29,090
I'll probably post it maybe like the weekend prior. You'll have three and a half weeks to work on this.

13
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:36,470
And the goal of it is to allow you an opportunity, an individual assignment to write,

14
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:42,200
to kind of demonstrate your understanding of what we've learned in class and apply it to the exposure

15
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,470
science and the exposure assessment process to a specific kind of hypothetical circumstance.

16
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:58,220
So the framework of the assignment will be responding to a mock call for proposals from a particular government agency,

17
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:08,630
with you being the exposure science expert right there looking for people like you to give them great new ideas to propose this response to

18
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:19,970
a hypothetical scenario related to pollution or contaminants in a community environment in terms of the the size of the paper or whatever,

19
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:28,070
I'll be looking for about eight to 10 pages. So not huge, but also not not small, insignificant.

20
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:33,230
The three and a half week time frame roughly is is there for a couple of reasons.

21
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:38,390
One is that it's actually pretty common in the real world, you know, after you graduate.

22
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:42,020
So professional development type of exercise,

23
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:49,610
it's not meant to be like a term term paper that you're working for months and months and months and develop and produce that's really polished,

24
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:55,010
you know, awesome. Uh, deliverable at the end.

25
00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:00,200
It's meant to be, hey, your boss comes and says you're the expert on this.

26
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,040
We got a couple of weeks to turn something around. Give me your best write.

27
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:12,470
So I'm not looking for don't worry about looking glamorous or polished or pretty, just the nuts and bolts content, uh, the meet,

28
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:22,280
so to speak, of being able to demonstrate your understanding of the material in this applied setting or applied context.

29
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:31,220
And then they would be do scrolling down a little further on November 4th.

30
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:38,270
So that's just meant, of course, once it's assigned, you know, all the detail of the rubric for grading what's actually expected,

31
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:45,770
what you're expected to address, you know, will be in the assignment and we'll also have a chance to come back to it with that as an introduction.

32
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:58,890
Are there any any questions? OK, so cool, you kind of understand it now, just put it out of your mind and focus on the exam for the next week or so.

33
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:05,580
Speaking of which, I did post a review document here, this hyperlinked under exam review.

34
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,050
Go ahead and take a look at that. I don't know. I hesitate to call it a study guide.

35
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:15,510
You just kind of prompt right on what material we covered during the course of the semester.

36
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:22,660
And to make sure that you have a comfortable understanding of any questions about the logistics of the exam.

37
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:30,040
We kind of talked about it last time. But just in case you thought of any in the meantime.

38
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:40,480
All right, sounds good. So I'm actually going to shift because we didn't actually finish a lecture on Tuesday.

39
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:50,380
We we got through all of it maybe the last 90 seconds or so of this YouTube video that was focused on, obviously, the state of California.

40
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:56,860
And as a little bit of context that I didn't have time to really go through on Tuesday, the state of California,

41
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:05,830
not just poor air quality, but for many issues around environmental health, has been pretty progressive nationwide.

42
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,720
And if you followed some of the deeds that this documentary was kind of highlighting,

43
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,580
you would have noted that a lot of these things were ahead of federal policy.

44
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:22,240
Right. These air pollution regulations that were being put forth were ahead of anything that happened at the national level.

45
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,040
And, uh, basically during all of those decades,

46
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:35,440
the state of California has maintained this special designation where they're actually allowed just a special waiver,

47
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:42,010
where they're actually allowed to have stricter regulations than what's offered at the national level.

48
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:48,940
So I want to take a step back and just, you know, after having a chance to watch that at a very general,

49
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:58,870
broad level, what we're what were people's reactions? That was kind of by itself.

50
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:05,330
I don't know how it was like that at the time, but it seemed to have broad based support, just like everyone else.

51
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:10,690
And we get so atrocious that they really agreed to stop us.

52
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,500
Yeah, I think great observation, Josh. So it I agree.

53
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:22,900
It did seem like there was a lot of support. Right. And the documentary, I think, kind of promoted that.

54
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:32,920
Right, that it took what it industry and citizens and academia researchers all working together to help solve this.

55
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:41,100
So that's that's why aren't any other reactions after watching the video?

56
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:50,050
Yes, sir. All right, I heard the catalytic converter like so many improvements.

57
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,530
This one is absolutely yeah. And that was you know, that was the context, right.

58
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:01,800
Going back to the 1960s, certainly for automobiles, but pretty much for anything else.

59
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,080
Right. Any smokestack that you see, there weren't really regulations to speak of,

60
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,990
which is do what you need to do and, you know, send it up and out and don't worry about it.

61
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,880
You also had an observation.

62
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:23,160
So I grew up in California and it's kind of interesting that, like the whole car situation in such a big deal because like even though,

63
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,480
like I said, it's pretty prevalent, then it's still kind of prevalent now.

64
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,750
And like, if you go back, like you're just like keep expanding the roads and.

65
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:40,890
The population growth fair and everything, it just doesn't seem like it's going to go away, but I'm so surprised that they shifted the most.

66
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:48,060
Yeah, that's a thank you for sharing that, and I would also invite others from where you previously lives,

67
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:56,010
where you've grown up, you might have something in particular to share that's different than perhaps southeast Michigan.

68
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:04,290
Yeah, it's a great, great observation. And, you know, the imagery, I think, in that in that video is pretty impactful.

69
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:12,390
At least that is in my mind. Right. It shows things being pretty bad. Uh, several decades ago, there's definitely been dramatic improvement,

70
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:21,080
without question that there are also continued pressures that have evolved over that time period.

71
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:28,500
You mentioned population growth, like more cars on the roads, more vehicle miles traveled.

72
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:38,100
And this is this is certainly the case with with air quality and health effects from air pollution exposures.

73
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:44,820
It is, you know, broadly speaking, the case across environmental health exposures.

74
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:53,850
But even though we've continued to clean things up and make progress, levels are actually considerably lower than they used to be.

75
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:57,690
The research has continued to catch up and study and assess.

76
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,960
Right. We didn't really have that back in the 1960s.

77
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:08,910
There weren't widespread research studies characterizing, you know, what the impact of exposure to all this pollution was.

78
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:17,310
And so what you know, most of the literature is finding out is that for many pollutants, even though there are standards in place,

79
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:22,380
there's a pretty big body of literature out there now that shows that there's adverse health impacts,

80
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:27,510
adverse impacts on health at levels below the standards.

81
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,840
Right. So, you know, kind of quote, safe levels.

82
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:42,360
And this is you know, this is the reason why, you know, in the media or in politics or in these different forums, uh, why the discussion continues.

83
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,180
Right. California in certain areas is having trouble meeting the air quality standards.

84
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,770
And it's because the standards have gotten tighter and tighter and more more strict

85
00:09:52,770 --> 00:10:00,990
being informed by that research that's taken place over the last few decades.

86
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,570
Any other observations? Yeah, and it's all along that line,

87
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:10,260
I thought it interesting how long it took just to get some of the basic science of what

88
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:16,980
is in this knowledge and where is it coming from the very first satellite industry,

89
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:24,840
and then took a kind of a long time to realize that it was that class or the huge source.

90
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:35,100
Yeah, that's an excellent observation and and let's start tying this back to kind of the lecture that we had,

91
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:41,640
the material that we had gone through up until that point. Right. So we were kind of looking at history, going back, you know,

92
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:47,340
when when we're environmental health regulations and standards developed and put into place and legislation and so forth.

93
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:55,950
Right. A lot in the 70s and 80s, maybe into the 90s and then not a lot for the last 30 years or so.

94
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:04,680
And going back to Joshua's initial observation was that seemingly in California, everyone was on board.

95
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,970
Right. There wasn't like in-fighting about should we do this?

96
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:12,780
No, we shouldn't do this. It was we all agree this is terrible.

97
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:21,300
We need to fix it. So even though everyone was on board and there were lots of resources allocated to it, it was still a challenge.

98
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,640
Right. It took a long, long time to actually get a grasp on things,

99
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:38,520
target the right to the right options for mitigation or intervention, and then begin to see real results.

100
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:47,880
So fast forward to where we are today, more broadly speaking, across issues around environmental, health and environmental exposures.

101
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:56,070
We do know a lot of this stuff now. Right? This is kind of the frustrating part is we don't need a 30 year research program, you know,

102
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:01,770
to begin to study, you know, what are the impacts of flame retardants or whatever it is.

103
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,510
Right. We we know these things.

104
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:14,780
And yet the the challenges and the hurdles continue to be there for actually reaching making progress in reducing levels, reducing exposures.

105
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:21,260
Staying on the theme of air quality, but with that kind of comparison across time,

106
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:29,040
let's spend a few quick minutes looking at air pollution in more recent times,

107
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:37,940
but in other locations outside of the US and China is a great and actually not just China.

108
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:49,970
Many countries, primarily in Asia, have have almost in a lagged 50 year lag, basically repeated what happened here in the US.

109
00:12:49,970 --> 00:13:03,860
Right. We have widespread economic expansion, improvement, increases in manufacturing capability, consumer products, meeting demand.

110
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:09,740
So with the growing economy actually positive things, increases in income,

111
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:15,980
increases in standard of living, um, important increases in access to to better improved health care.

112
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,940
Right. So these are all good things for a growing economy.

113
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:30,170
But, you know, unfortunately and this is actually, um, an unfortunate documented aspect of economic growth,

114
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:36,620
is that the environmental health considerations are often pretty far down the priority list.

115
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,950
Right. It's let's grow our economy.

116
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:47,120
Let's improve our standard of living and we'll worry about, you know, what the baggage that comes along with it later.

117
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,020
And, you know, China has certainly experienced this.

118
00:13:51,020 --> 00:14:02,720
This is looking at coal use and the number of cars in production, you know, over a short period of time is the 15 year time period.

119
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:10,550
And it continues to grow rapidly as we talk about, you know, more cars, more people in California.

120
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:16,610
It's at a much greater Rothe growth rate that comparing to to China.

121
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:22,640
Uh, I like the imagery. This is over like a similar time frame.

122
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,760
The city of Shanghai back in nineteen eighty seven. There's the river.

123
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,850
Here is the city. Fast forward in this case. What is it.

124
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,690
Sixteen. No, twenty ninth is terrible. Twenty five.

125
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:44,390
Twenty six years. Bam. Right. It's like, you know, southern Manhattan grew up overnight so the growth is in the pressure.

126
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:49,160
The demand for energy for transportation is huge.

127
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,810
So you have all this economic growth,

128
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:59,960
but there's huge consequence that's come along with it with regards to impact on on the environment and environmental exposures.

129
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:10,910
Some of the imagery today, it looks very similar to that video from the 1950s and 60s in in Southern California.

130
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,920
Right. Just super, super thick smog, not actually being able.

131
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,500
There's there's no clouds in these pictures. These are there's like sunny days, right.

132
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:30,570
Cloudless days. But it's simply just the pollution layer that blocks out most of the sunlight.

133
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:35,520
And then, you know, not just to focus on China, we can go to India, for example,

134
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:47,820
and see very similar timeline that's transpired and impacts and adverse pollution exposures and impact on health.

135
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,330
I actually said, and that's pretty crazy,

136
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:58,410
because once in the White House that really the air quality is definitely not the worst case for

137
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:03,120
New Delhi and likely first lady popularity the even when you're the captain of the airplane.

138
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,450
But then, like for about a whole week when I was like black suit and crazy,

139
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:16,320
that that was the nice parts of trees and a parts that everyone has to get involved.

140
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:23,190
Like, that's the perfect. Yeah. That's a thank you for sharing Joshua's great observation.

141
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,990
And, uh, and it's you know, it's not uncommon actually to, um,

142
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:34,650
actually the most impactful to me is talking with colleagues or students that are from a particular location.

143
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:40,740
Right. And then they've they've come to the U.S. or wherever where the there's a huge improvement.

144
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:50,520
Right. And then they're here for a year or two or more and then go back to like visit family or whatever it is and say, wow, like, you totally hit me.

145
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,770
Right. Like I've lived my whole life there up until that. And it never really registered.

146
00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:06,560
But now after being out of that environment and then going back even for a short time, it's really felt right in terms of your physical disposition.

147
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:12,490
If anyone has looked at vitamin D levels in these populations after this smog has started to become so dense,

148
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:19,220
especially in India where people are darker skinned, it's going to be harder to get the sun.

149
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:33,210
Yeah, that's a great observation. Melissa. Yeah, absolutely no, that would be something worth checking into to see if folks have looked at that.

150
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:39,810
So staying on kind of a global context here with regards to to air pollution,

151
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:51,000
this is looking at with a very broad brush, regional PPM levels basically across the globe.

152
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,600
This is probably hard to see, but these kind of bluish colors are on the lower end.

153
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:05,040
Rates are where you see pretty much all of North America, most of northern Asia,

154
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:16,110
pretty much Russia having lower levels and then, you know, kind of moderate across most of Europe.

155
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:21,840
And then some pretty high levels are going into those oranges and reds across the

156
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:30,180
African continent and especially kind of southern Asia is that is the trend.

157
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:35,760
And again, much of it is tied with with economic growth.

158
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,600
Right.

159
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:45,180
If you went back to the 1950s and looked at this map, you know, like we saw in California, the US would be much higher, Europe would be much higher.

160
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:50,340
These areas where the economy and industrialization hadn't really taken off would be much lower.

161
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:56,220
Right. And, you know, with regard to the African continent, uh, this one hasn't yet peaked.

162
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,410
Right. That big boom of economic growth and industrialization hasn't actually happened yet.

163
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:10,690
So we can probably expect this to continue to get darker into the red category over time.

164
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:16,930
All right, so we started this lecture on Tuesday by saying that we were going to terms of our learning objectives,

165
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:20,230
we were going to learn about US agencies, right.

166
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:27,580
Who is able to regulate, who has enforcement capacity, who issued guidelines that aren't really enforceable,

167
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:34,270
but they're they're beneficial and helpful to help, um, maybe inform standards.

168
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:39,670
So on the international level, we do have the World Health Organization.

169
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:52,600
Right. It doesn't have any bite, any enforcement capability or formal regulation authority, but it does issue really important guidelines.

170
00:19:52,600 --> 00:20:04,900
So it's coordinated within the United Nations system and to to strengthen national systems, to respond to the needs of their and their citizens.

171
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:09,040
So especially in low income countries. Right.

172
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:15,910
So the US, we kind of talk about all these agencies. We've got the Environmental Protection Agency, we've got the National Institutes of Health,

173
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:25,060
and we have all these frameworks to actually research and study and collect data and actually have science and foreign policy.

174
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:30,190
What the policy actually happens or not, I guess, is another question. But there's you know, there's actually knowledge,

175
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:37,540
information being generated and shared that infrastructure isn't present in many regions of the globe.

176
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:43,750
And so this is where the World Health Organization plays a really important role in that.

177
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:52,240
So let's go ahead. From an international context, let's talk about the difference between standards and guidelines.

178
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:59,500
And there's some good definitions here. So standards are in play at the national level.

179
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:08,650
They vary according to the approach adopted for balancing health risk with the technological feasibility of incorporating them.

180
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:16,360
What are the impacts on the economy and various other political and social factors and also the level of development?

181
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:28,120
Right. So kind of where is that country on the economic development scale and their inherent capability to manage air quality?

182
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:34,420
So guidelines, in contrast, and specifically those issued by the WTO,

183
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:39,250
our values that are recommended that they not they're not just kind of like across the

184
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:45,820
board without any appreciation for the context of who the information is being received by.

185
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:51,640
So it acknowledges that there's heterogeneity right across regions, across countries,

186
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,930
and in particular recognizes that when formulating policy targets,

187
00:21:55,930 --> 00:22:02,050
the government should consider their own local circumstances carefully before adopting those guidelines,

188
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:08,110
which they might actually adopt as legally based standards.

189
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:13,120
So kind of an example of the application of these WTO guidelines.

190
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,880
This is looking at a number of specifically Asian cities.

191
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,230
You staying on that theme, emerging developing economies developing at a great rate.

192
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:32,000
And you can see, I don't know, I'm going to draw a line here with my eye, maybe about 80 micrograms per cubic meter as a ppm,

193
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:45,580
10 average concentration, annual concentration, whereas the WHL guideline is that 20, which is much, much lower.

194
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:56,410
Right. So, uh, governments in these regions where these air quality levels are so high might be tempted to say,

195
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:02,200
wow, we average 80, we have no chance to get to 20.

196
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:10,750
So what's the point? Right. So the show kind of recognizes that context and they actually issue interim targets.

197
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:16,690
There are targets here for 70, for 50, for 30.

198
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:24,310
And the purpose of setting those interim targets is not just, well, you can't hit 20, so shoot for 50.

199
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:37,210
Instead, they actually through through research and through meta data analysis, are able to document what a nation would gain.

200
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:43,360
Right. In terms of improvement in health by reducing a level from 80 down to 50.

201
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,480
OK, you might not be able to get to 20 any time soon, but if you can reduce it from 80 to 50,

202
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:59,640
here's the quantitative improvement you can expect in terms of impact on health of residents.

203
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:07,900
And I think this slide basically summarizes most of what I just said, right, to these interim targets or given for each pollutant,

204
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:15,260
and they're proposed as incremental steps and a progressive reduction over perhaps a longer period of time.

205
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,270
And the aim to promote a shift in general from high pollution areas,

206
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:25,540
which are really serious health consequences, too, if not meeting the guidelines, at least lower.

207
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:38,740
Right. And then documenting again what significant reductions in risk could be achieved by that stepwise reduction of meeting interim targets.

208
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:44,110
And again, you know, the progress towards these guideline values is really the ultimate objective,

209
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:51,430
is the air quality management and health risk reduction and all of those areas. I think of the last slide it is.

210
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:56,140
So any questions? This is finally finishing Tuesday's lecture.

211
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:06,390
Any questions before we move on to today's topic? Our comments.

212
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:14,320
All right, cool, thanks. So let's see. Let's quickly.

213
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:24,100
It's going so now we're moving on to exposure assessment, so we're going to talk about personal monitoring today.

214
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:32,020
We'll also talk about continued talking about exposure assessment on Tuesday that will focus more on questionnaires.

215
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:41,800
OK, and in terms of exam material, this is where it ends today's lecture Tuesdays lecture on exposure assessment.

216
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:53,260
And then all of the material up until next Tuesday is what what we're aiming to to be prepared for for the exam next week, on Thursday.

217
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,960
And also regards to the exam. I'm not sure I mentioned it.

218
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:04,720
I will leave time at the end of Tuesday's class period to open to respond to any questions that folks have.

219
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,180
I'll have all the slide decks ready to go.

220
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:17,020
If you want to ask a question about a specific topic, you know, back on September 10th, whatever, we discussed this slide number 12.

221
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:23,550
And if you want to reach out to me in advance with questions, I can even be better prepared to respond to them in class.

222
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:31,300
So if you start reviewing for the exam over the weekend, for example, and have some questions, just send them my way.

223
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:40,360
All right. So what are we concerned about with regards to exposure assessment and personal monitoring specifically?

224
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,170
So we want to understand the hierarchy of exposure data.

225
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:50,680
What's most valuable, what's most preferred, what's less helpful or less preferred?

226
00:26:50,680 --> 00:27:01,390
Understand the differences in exposure assessment within workplace settings versus those in more kind of community or public settings.

227
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:05,800
Understand the framework for personal exposure assessment.

228
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:17,350
So for direct methods versus indirect and and what are the the needs and and what tools are out there to provide

229
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:25,810
direct monitoring methods and then being able to apply a personal exposure framework to example scenarios.

230
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:31,400
And we'll have a couple in here that we'll discuss.

231
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:40,640
All right, so this slide is actually review, we discussed this earlier on in the semester or at least introduced it earlier on in the semester,

232
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:50,750
but this is our hierarchy of exposure data. And, you know, the Take-Home message is that personal monitoring,

233
00:27:50,750 --> 00:28:01,040
personal level exposure assessment is by far the best type of data, its most valuable, its most preferred.

234
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:12,560
This might include things like biomarkers. It might include kind of external measurements on a person or at a personal level.

235
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:18,920
Going down from that kind of a decreasing desirability would be area measurements.

236
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:28,160
So perhaps for whatever reason, we can't I can't monitor myself or somebody can't monitor me here at the podium or I'm speaking.

237
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:33,050
But if we have a room measurement this maybe in the middle of the room that's running during the class period.

238
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:41,930
Right. That would serve as kind of an area measurement, but it could still be used as data to estimate what my exposure is.

239
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:50,910
And then kind of going down the list, there are various surrogates that we can use to approximate what exposure might be things like,

240
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:54,920
uh, you know, how much water do I drink?

241
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,950
We might not know anything about the level of lead that I ingest,

242
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:04,160
but if we know how much water I drink, you know, it's one point nine liters a day or something.

243
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:13,670
On average, we may be able to estimate based on where I live or the average lead concentration is and be able to calculate exposures like that.

244
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:24,590
And again, this is a kind of decreasing usefulness or desirability the distance from a site.

245
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:33,590
So maybe where I live is, you know, two miles away from the something something plant or manufacturing facility.

246
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:37,850
And based on the emissions that we know from that maybe which way the wind blows,

247
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:48,350
typically we might need to estimate when my exposure is just having historical information on where I've lived over the last 50 years,

248
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:51,980
where I've worked over the last 50 years. Right.

249
00:29:51,980 --> 00:30:03,440
Not collecting any actual exposure data about about me, but just these other kind of demographics over time,

250
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,460
usually through a questionnaire or recall type survey,

251
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:14,390
know we might be able to piece together different qualitative aspects, but to actually come up with some sort of estimate for exposure.

252
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:23,250
And again, these are kind of the least preferred or least useful those that would have the largest amount of uncertainty associated with them.

253
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:27,420
All right, so when we take a water break here really quickly.

254
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:38,130
Perfect timing for you, like a large amount of data that can be difficult to get a personal biomarker monitoring on that.

255
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:47,020
But is that you like it if you to find the place as well?

256
00:30:47,020 --> 00:31:00,570
And what would you. Which is would say the great question, and you've almost already hit the punch line of the entire lecture, so congratulations,

257
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:07,620
we're going to step through this and maybe agonizing detail actually, to kind of come to an answer to that question.

258
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:12,840
But just to respond quickly, you're right.

259
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:18,480
That would be the goal if we could have some sort of magical biomarker for every

260
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,880
type of exposure and every person and collect daily blood draws from everyone,

261
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:31,170
we'd be all set. Right. We would have like top notch exposure assessment almost in real time for lots of reasons.

262
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:40,830
That's not generally possible or practical from a resource perspective, how invasive it is to collect that type of data.

263
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:49,710
But yes, excellent question. And what kind of over the course of the next 30 minutes or so, hopefully come up with a more filled out kind of answer.

264
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:57,000
So when we look at personal monitoring and exposure assessment in general,

265
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,250
there are different approaches, there are direct methods and there are indirect methods.

266
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,300
We will cover some examples of indirect methods in class on Tuesday.

267
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:11,760
We'll be talking specifically about questionnaires and diaries.

268
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:20,590
Over here on the left, we have direct methods. So things like biomarkers, biological monitoring, um, personal monitoring.

269
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:29,670
Right. So perhaps external to the body, but still direct measures of exposures to a person.

270
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:39,510
And then we also have the dynamic of occupational exposure monitoring or within a workplace environment versus that and more of a, you know,

271
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:53,430
a community and, you know, generally speaking or broadly speaking, the principles are pretty similar from a workplace to a more general community.

272
00:32:53,430 --> 00:33:00,600
Exposure to a hazard inside the walls of a factory fundamentally aren't really different.

273
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:07,260
And what's occurring outside of the factory, right in the in the nearby community.

274
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,770
But there are for reasons that will kind of cover here,

275
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:19,380
many differences in how you approach that exposure assessment between a workplace setting and a community setting.

276
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:28,410
And comparing and contrasting those different approaches helps us to understand exposure monitoring in both both settings.

277
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:38,610
All right. So really quickly, some review, but kind of addressing these in the contrast between workplace and community settings right here.

278
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,110
This is exam review, right?

279
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:51,870
There are four routes of entry we're concerned about ingestion, inhalation, skin contact and skin absorption within the workplace.

280
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:57,720
Inhalation is usually the most critical route of exposure.

281
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:06,660
The one that we're most concerned about, skin absorption is for the most part, next in importance.

282
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:13,240
So for things like organic solvents, for the most part, ingestion is usually a minor concern.

283
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:18,690
Right? There are kind of workplace rules and protocols kind of know eating on the job.

284
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:23,880
Right. So this helps to like separate a lot of that hand to mouth and whatever people are

285
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:31,620
ingesting from aspects of what's going on in the workplace within a community setting,

286
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:37,080
the importance of the roots really depends on specific scenarios and pathways.

287
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:43,680
Right. So, again, this is basic stuff. We've we've already kind of introduced this when we're concerned about air pollution.

288
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,790
Obviously, it's inhalation is going to be the one that we're most concerned about when we're

289
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:55,150
talking about contaminants in food and water and soil and maybe ingestion for soil.

290
00:34:55,150 --> 00:35:03,120
This is mostly looking at small children with that hand to mouth and then skin exposure.

291
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:18,020
So swimming, bathing, you know, whatever, coming into contact, dermal contact with with soil and so forth.

292
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:26,240
In terms of those exposure pathways, right, so these are two distinguished classifications, one is routes of exposure,

293
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,760
how something is actually getting into our body, another classification, our exposure pathways.

294
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:42,890
So this is how does a contaminant get from its source to us in the first place whereby we could then be exposed within a workplace?

295
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:57,290
These are usually short, simple, direct and easily identifiable just because protocols within a workplace are so defined,

296
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:08,990
typically a contaminant generated or released at a known location inside of the facility, you know, can be can be easily identified.

297
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:18,170
And the amount of exposure is usually dependent on whatever the controls that are in place at the workplace.

298
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:27,840
They could be engineering controls, administrative controls. What's the personal protective equipment being employed within a community?

299
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:37,700
It's much more complex. We've got lots of complex pathways from the source to us as a receptor.

300
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:44,210
And in many cases, there's no protocol, there's no blueprint, there's no expectation for what people are doing.

301
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:52,320
And it's usually much more difficult to figure out and many more opportunities for exposures to take place.

302
00:36:52,320 --> 00:37:02,850
Another significant difference between workplace exposures and those in a community setting are the magnitude and the range.

303
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:11,100
So within a workplace setting, that's usually where we're seeing really high exposures to people, mostly due to proximity.

304
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:19,500
If you're inside the factory, right next to these procedures where things are being produced might be high temperature,

305
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:25,320
combustion, whatever it is, a consumer product and a high concentration.

306
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:35,390
So typically there's several orders of magnitude higher exposure in a workplace environment compared to a community environment.

307
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:42,000
But then again, in contrast, in a community setting, usually these exposures are much lower.

308
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:49,070
So that's that's good, mostly due to the proximity and distance away from the source.

309
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:54,810
But these are taking place not just within like a work shift, right.

310
00:37:54,810 --> 00:38:06,090
For the most part, community exposures are taking place for in some cases all day long, in some cases every day of the week.

311
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:17,400
And then some differences in in methodologies and accuracy in terms of exposure assessment within a workplace,

312
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:23,220
we often are able to assess exposures on real people.

313
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:29,490
Right. You know, Tim works shift three at the plant from this time to this time.

314
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,800
And this these are his job tasks.

315
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:42,990
So within that kind of very constrained context, it's easily it's easy to document what types of exposures likely took place.

316
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:48,780
Uh, and there's a reasonable ability to determine if these exposures are representative.

317
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:56,880
And we'll talk a little bit later about what's where things where exposure assessments are generally more representative and where

318
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:09,660
sometimes they can be less certain and we can often make these direct measurements easier and result in more accurate exposure estimates.

319
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:13,530
And it's often, again, because we know so much more about that workplace environment,

320
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:17,580
it's easier to account for all the pathways that can be contributing to the exposure.

321
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:25,170
In contrast, within a community, it's it's harder to make those direct representative measurements.

322
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:34,920
And we'll talk about some of the reasons why and also going to be hard to account for those contributory pathways to the exposure.

323
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,260
Uh, really quickly.

324
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:51,120
So we talk about accuracy and precision, and this is a quick little exercise here that shows some kind of hypothetical results from measurements,

325
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,920
which summarizes the difference in bias and precision.

326
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:02,700
So here's these four bull's eyes that you see here with each dot representing a data point.

327
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,300
And you know the truth being inside the red circle here,

328
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:16,410
what the what the reality is of an exposure level and then the measurements representing these these small dots on the bull's eye.

329
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:33,490
So out of these four different result scenarios, what would be your most preferred as an exposure assessment scientist?

330
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:39,340
Third one, this one here. Anyone else agree with that?

331
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:43,660
OK, lots of head nods hands. So yes, absolutely.

332
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:48,230
So in this case, it's very precise, right?

333
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:54,220
All of those data point results lie very close to each other. And it's also unbiased.

334
00:40:54,220 --> 00:41:01,270
It's actually representing reality, what the exposure level is. OK, here's where it gets a little bit trickier.

335
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:08,470
What would be the next preferred exposure result from the first one?

336
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:16,030
Says the first one. Anyone agree with this? Got some head nods and waves.

337
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:30,850
Anybody have a different answer? They go to the fourth one just because it's more precise and even though it's not on the target list,

338
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:35,590
you know, you're getting like a really good audience, the kind of a good yes.

339
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:38,260
Yes. Great answers. And actually, they're both right.

340
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:47,170
I think, you know, the one on the extreme left and the one on the extreme, like they would basically tie for kind of next preferred.

341
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:51,380
Exactly how you articulated in the case on the right.

342
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:56,930
Uh, this is valuable in that we have very precise measurements.

343
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:01,450
Right. And if we can quantify the offset.

344
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:06,010
Right. How much were we're biased by missing the truth?

345
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:13,630
It makes it pretty easy to correct to have a correction factor in our results because there's so much precision there.

346
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:18,790
What we hear on the left, it's a different tradeoff, right? These are accurate, right?

347
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:24,170
On average, we're actually estimating reality.

348
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:29,050
The downside or the trade off is we have a lot more uncertainty in that data.

349
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:34,240
Right, because it's a much broader spread. It's less precise.

350
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:39,790
So, yeah, those are those would both be probably equally preferred as a second choice.

351
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:49,090
And then, of course, the one second from the left here is kind of the worst case right, where we have a clear bias, you know, from reality.

352
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:53,200
And it's also imprecise. Right. The measurements are kind of all over the place.

353
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,130
All right. Awesome. Thank you. All right.

354
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:03,190
So let's step through an example here, a little bit of an application of some of the things that we introduced.

355
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:09,020
Actually, any any questions so far about the last two slides in that last slide?

356
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:13,870
Yes. How do you know like like this?

357
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:18,030
How do you assess? Bias being a real experiment,

358
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:26,300
you don't have the target and precision you can get at because you can look at how different the plans are for each other.

359
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:35,060
Yeah, I imagine the situation be hard to know that there is a great question, so I'm going to repeat it for the recording.

360
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:40,220
So the question is, how do you know? How do you know if you are biased?

361
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:47,540
Right. You can for the most part, it's not too difficult to assess your precision, but how do you assess bias?

362
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:53,130
That's a great question with a short version answer.

363
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:57,830
These are things that one would have to do on purpose to assess.

364
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:01,700
Right? So you'd have to compare your method.

365
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:11,600
Perhaps it's the method that you're going back to the initial question kind of starting these this topic, you know,

366
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:17,180
wouldn't it be great to just biomarkers on everybody every day of their life through blood draws or,

367
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:22,100
you know, for example, we might look at that as the gold standard.

368
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:27,710
Right. So if you know that you can't do blood draws on everyone,

369
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:33,290
that your only tool for assessing exposures is to is to have a questionnaire that asks

370
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:38,420
us to get as much information about their time activity or they work where they live,

371
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,400
whatever it might be.

372
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:50,330
You can actually do maybe a smaller trial or a smaller study where you're comparing your method to what's considered to be the gold standard.

373
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:53,390
And from that you can actually assess what the bias is.

374
00:44:53,390 --> 00:45:02,090
So then as you continue using your perhaps less preferred method, maybe you can apply that correction factor as you go forward.

375
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:08,570
Does that answer your question? OK. Great question. All right.

376
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:12,770
So let's walk through kind of a hypothetical scenario, and it's pretty simplified,

377
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:21,650
but hopefully gets at some of these circumstances comparing occupational workplace settings to community settings.

378
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:31,520
Let's say we're doing a study on let's let exposures and impact on health and how can we do personal exposure monitoring on these two individuals,

379
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:37,970
person A who these people don't like to give their real name, who works on a lead smelter,

380
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:44,880
and person B, who lives in a community around that led smelter.

381
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:50,800
All right, so before we go through the answers and don't cheat and skip ahead to the slides,

382
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:59,020
um, let's take two minutes and kind of split right down this side of the room.

383
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:05,850
Can I have group one over here to come up with as many potential approaches to personal exposure,

384
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:10,470
monitoring for lead in workplaces that you can come up with?

385
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:18,390
So think about hazards, pathways, routes of exposure. And for group number two on this side, same thing.

386
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:26,640
But for communities come up with as many different approaches to personal exposure, monitoring for lead in the community that you can think of.

387
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,820
Two minutes, ready, set, go. And maybe just turn to the person next to you.

388
00:46:30,820 --> 00:47:02,200
Don't dig it up and move around. But she also told us that, like you said, that the priority for the federal government is water neighborly relations.

389
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:18,290
And you can probably guess what I mean, because even just like rivers like this.

390
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:31,560
Also. I agree with you also when the plant was manufactured, as I said,

391
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:42,030
probably in this area and as it disintegrates over time, it's very nice to get out of it.

392
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:56,070
Well, I think there's a lot to do with the free trade and the prosperity, but the rest of the city is either accident or something else.

393
00:47:56,070 --> 00:48:05,950
You think this will be able to defend their.

394
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:23,930
An interview on a very real for someone who was working in the industry,

395
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:43,380
I know this is you had your mother in law for fuel for the like that to be heard from.

396
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:54,440
But there are those factors.

397
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:59,350
That's a great question. That would help if, in fact.

398
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:22,810
Yes. There's a whole lot of energy supply involved here.

399
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:26,620
All right, let's go ahead and reconvene. I know that wasn't a whole lot of time.

400
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:30,400
Sorry, what what did folks come up with?

401
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:39,420
Let's go ahead and start over here with group number one within that workplace environment.

402
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:50,160
Direct monitoring if like blood tests of. OK, so collect blood samples to assess what exposure, what else?

403
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,010
You can also do like hair samples. Excellent.

404
00:49:54,010 --> 00:50:02,840
So you could collect like an area sample around where workers maybe spend most of their time good.

405
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:12,210
And I really think you might, depending on the industry and why you might have the supplies and we're hearing so maybe, maybe sources, right.

406
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:18,070
That are within that workplace environment or potential exposure.

407
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:34,150
Good. Any other. OK, so, again, looking at sources and even maybe some potential pathways, some pathways within that environment.

408
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:38,980
Excellent. What about on this side, folks at the community level?

409
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:46,420
What did you come up with? Yeah, DNA testing.

410
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:58,480
I mean, that's. OK, great, so mostly these are outdoor suggestions, right?

411
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:07,980
So looking at, again, sources following or presence of contaminant with different pathways, air, soil, water, dust.

412
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:19,740
Right. What else did folks come up with? Yeah, well, partially as well as.

413
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:32,720
Well, that's. So they're OK, so run the run tests on people, what kind of tests on a probe?

414
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:41,180
A little bit and not anybody can answer, but that's what's at issue.

415
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:47,760
OK, OK, so blood tests, adipose tissue, was there another one?

416
00:51:47,760 --> 00:52:02,830
OK. That's great, yeah, there's kind of like some X-ray fluorescence approaches to look at led in in bones.

417
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:10,050
These are biomarkers of the system for large exposures at large.

418
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:15,420
So we can discuss this a little bit more at a little bit later.

419
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:20,460
But to answer your question, I'm going to try to it.

420
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:29,280
Are there are there markers for different where you sample for different neurological effects specifically?

421
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:39,990
There are different types. And you've already kind of illustrated a couple measuring lead in blood versus measuring lead in bone.

422
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:44,800
Actually, the information you gain from them are interpreted differently.

423
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:50,520
So let in the bloodstream versus legates within the bone,

424
00:52:50,520 --> 00:53:02,100
tell you different pieces of information about what current past or even future exposure might be.

425
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:08,990
Any any other back to your task, your approaches to assessing lead exposure?

426
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:16,110
Yeah, this is one of the first things I thought of that obviously that option was not.

427
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:22,650
Super PACs only problem that they are going to draw blood from every person, every household,

428
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:33,900
every single candidate in the workplace now that they have to be very that is just because it's so much more than mean.

429
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:41,400
It's more practical to measure what is in the environment the state of the nation don't get.

430
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:46,460
So in the first place. Absolutely great, great point, great observation.

431
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:52,550
It kind of gets back to our punch line, right, that we that we started with is sure it would be this easy to say,

432
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:57,530
hey, we'll do biomarkers, we'll collect blood, we'll do bone scans, you know, whatever it is.

433
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:02,750
But it's highly invasive, right. To just kind of like members of the public.

434
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:10,250
It's highly resource intensive. Lots of good reasons here that will kind of continue to articulate that are much more practical.

435
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:14,220
Right. In a workplace environment, A, it's part of the person's job.

436
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:19,710
So the employer could simply just require it. Right. Even if they aren't volunteering to participate.

437
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:29,480
Question or comment, I just to know, actually, the Michigan legislature is considering a law that would require mandatory testing for all children.

438
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:34,820
And so it might not be that continuous monitoring, but like at every yearly check up,

439
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:40,110
there would be a requirement that is something that you could implement to sort of.

440
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:44,570
On a larger scale, like where absolutely, yeah, no, that's a good point.

441
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:54,230
Targeted populations like young children, for sure. For sure. Any other questions or comments on that?

442
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:58,660
I think there was a recent study that said the children had detectable.

443
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:03,330
Yeah, I don't know how that relates to the national.

444
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:08,550
Yeah, right, right, it doesn't sound good.

445
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:10,080
All right, thank you for that.

446
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:17,340
Let's go ahead and launch into and again, you've already you've already hit many of these we're going to cover in subsequent slides.

447
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:24,930
But just to highlight broadly, the potential exposure pathways for LED are many,

448
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:31,800
and especially in that community environment, they can be pretty, pretty complicated.

449
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:36,840
So, you know, we've got automobile emissions that we've talked about, industrial emissions.

450
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:47,910
You know, both of these can impact air quality, for example, weathering some soil runoff to surfaces and groundwater, things like paints.

451
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:51,300
Right. Mostly in indoor environments.

452
00:55:51,300 --> 00:56:06,180
You know, old paint in homes or maybe even within workplaces are our sources for exposure to lead solder and glazes in historical.

453
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:09,580
You know, most of you know about plumbing, right.

454
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:17,070
For water distribution and lead exposure through that pathway impact drinking water.

455
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:26,580
All right. So let's look at biological monitoring with our fictitious person A and person be.

456
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:39,470
So, yeah, within the workplace setting at person A's workplace, they test biannually as part of their occupational blood led surveillance program.

457
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:50,700
So and actually, this is important. Consent is needed to do this within the workplace and for us to access those records.

458
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:56,160
If we're trying to assess exposures, we need that consent.

459
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,940
And for our study here, good news for us. We received consent.

460
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:09,600
So we have this information on person and what their blood levels are as part of this workplace surveillance program over here to our good friend,

461
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:16,620
Person B, never had blood lead measured.

462
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:21,750
So there's no historical data that we can retrieve.

463
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:27,960
Person B is terrified of needles. And when we asked, hey, would you like to participate?

464
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:32,490
Said, No, thank you. I'm not going to agree to a blood draw.

465
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:42,660
So in this case, uh, we don't have any data available for biological monitoring, kind of like several of you already commented, for obvious reasons.

466
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:52,030
It's harder in that community setting, right. To get biomarker data in the first place for a number of reasons.

467
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:57,010
So, OK, going back to personne, we have that data,

468
00:57:57,010 --> 00:58:06,070
let's say we get a result right from that blood lead and we learned that the level is 30 micrograms per deciliter.

469
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:14,470
We can actually take that value and assess are they being exposed to levels that cause concern.

470
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:23,320
We can compare it to a standard is in place. What the recommended limits are for blood lead levels,

471
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:31,400
which happen to be anything greater than twenty five micrograms per deciliter, would be considered high.

472
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:44,960
Within a workplace setting, so because person A's values are at 30, we make this determination in this conclusion, they have high blood lead.

473
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:51,950
All right. So we know that because it's a marker within their body,

474
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:59,080
we know they've been exposed to lead and it's at a level that's high enough for us to be concerned about it.

475
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:07,270
This is a drawback of biological monitoring is that doesn't actually tell us where the exposure is taking place,

476
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:12,370
where the line is actually coming from. We just know the exposure has taken place.

477
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:19,630
Right. So we can't really identify the source just by having a value of lead in the blood.

478
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:24,820
There are some approaches that we can then take and apply what's called physiologically

479
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:34,810
based pharmacokinetic modeling to estimate perhaps like an airborne light exposure.

480
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:42,040
It's you don't need to explain Priebke modeling for the exam, just know that it's an option,

481
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:48,410
but it basically allows us to work backwards, uh, within a computational model,

482
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:53,320
considering perhaps inhalation right in the corner in the case of the leg being

483
00:59:53,320 --> 01:00:00,190
an air or ingestion in the case of leg being present in dust or soil or water,

484
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:07,840
et cetera. And kind of following this through, we measured led in blood.

485
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:15,670
Right. And looking at various physiological processes, we might be able to estimate how much came from,

486
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:20,880
say, for example, let in air versus lead that was ingested.

487
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:32,450
Does that suggest it can use yes, lead isotopes to help us from a time perspective for estimating exposures?

488
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:37,240
Absolutely.

489
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:48,700
OK, so 15 years from biological monitoring, but staying within the category of direct methods, we have some options for personal monitoring.

490
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:56,300
All right, so going back to kind of our fictitious characters here for person, a good news,

491
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:06,670
their company measures time weighted average levels of lead in the air every six months using personal air sampling pumps.

492
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:16,990
This is a great person. A has never actually worn one of these pumps, but a number of their coworkers have.

493
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:26,080
So. So this is good. So it's a little bit of a surrogate. We actually have personal monitoring data, information, just not on a person in particular,

494
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:33,130
but other people that have maybe a similar role in their job as person A allows us to

495
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:38,890
come up with some pretty pretty good estimates of what person A's exposure might be.

496
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:50,140
Uh, person B, being stubborn, as usual, says, heck, no, I'm not going to wear a personal sampling pump that's just way too invasive.

497
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:55,690
People are going to be staring at me when I'm outside walking my dog when I go to pick up my kid at school.

498
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:59,920
What the heck is up with this person? I really don't want to do that.

499
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:06,280
Um, there are some other options to actually get a handle with the measurement.

500
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:10,540
There would be a surrogate, for example,

501
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:19,930
surface testing so we can actually use these swabs maybe in their household or maybe or we suspect that exposure to light could be taking place.

502
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:30,540
That can be analyzed and give us a handle on what are the the lead levels in those different microenvironments.

503
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:39,360
So going back to Person A in our workplace environment, we can use those those time weighted average measurements,

504
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:46,470
they were made on coworkers who do similar activities and maybe assign an exposure value.

505
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:50,910
That's the average of all of those time weighted measurements that were taken across

506
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:57,630
different coworkers and use this as an exposure estimate of lead in the air to person eight.

507
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:00,660
And again, for Person B, we're not getting anywhere.

508
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:09,420
No personal measurements refused to wear an air sampling pump in their home or in their community.

509
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:17,640
So when we're looking at results per person A, we're actually in pretty good shape.

510
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:21,630
We've got the the blood sample, right.

511
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:31,080
So a direct measurement of an internal dose of lead using the PBC modeling, we can actually come up with an estimate of,

512
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:36,150
for example, what level over the line, what could have been present in the air.

513
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:42,840
We also have these personal measures that were made on person eight coworkers.

514
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:52,530
So even though they weren't made on personne, we have estimates of coworkers maybe doing similar jobs on similar shifts within the facility.

515
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:58,020
So we have an independent estimate of what that airborne lead might be from that time.

516
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:08,220
Weighted average personal sampling and then actually having both pieces information gives us the ability to compare them.

517
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:14,820
Right. So what do we come up with that Paepcke modeling from the blood lead levels?

518
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:20,980
And how does that compare with those time weighted average measurements that were made on person a coworker?

519
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:27,810
So this is a little bit of validation exercises that can help us to kind of confirm what the what the source might have been,

520
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:37,590
what the pathway might have been. And just to kind of summarize for Person B, direct methods are not really helping us in this case.

521
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:42,390
We need to try something else, for example, questionnaires.

522
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:47,970
And again, that'll be the topic of discussion in Tuesday's class. All right.

523
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:59,820
So jumping around a little bit, but all related to this exposure assessment approach and specifically for direct methods of exposure assessment.

524
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:07,860
So we need to be able to evaluate our data. Right. We talked a few moments ago about how precise is data, how accurate is it?

525
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:10,710
Are there biases present and so forth.

526
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:17,620
So there are some important questions to ask when it comes to assessing the representativeness of our exposure data.

527
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:21,180
So basic questions like who collected the data?

528
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:26,940
Is it relevant? What type of data? When was the data collected?

529
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:32,400
Where was it collected? Why was it collected?

530
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:43,210
And how is that sample or data analyzed and what kind of go through some some examples here that address each of these.

531
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:56,850
Um, before we do that, let's just go ahead and discuss what typical statistical distributions of exposure data look like.

532
01:05:56,850 --> 01:06:03,480
One, uh, potential, um, primary statistical distribution.

533
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:09,210
It's called the normal distribution where it's symmetric in shape.

534
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:15,510
And this is actually common for many natural phenomena in the environment.

535
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:21,870
Um, there can be impacts from variations in and sampling flow rate.

536
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:28,020
Right. So if we say that we're sampling at ten liters per minute for like an air sample,

537
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:34,020
but we don't actually have something that's measuring in real time how much variation there is.

538
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:40,830
Right. So sometimes the flow rate might actually the pump is having trouble. It's low, sometimes is higher than it should be and so forth.

539
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:50,820
This could contribute to this type of symmetric normal distribution and then also analytical errors, uncertainty associated on the analytical process.

540
01:06:50,820 --> 01:07:00,330
So doing a chemical assay, for example, another type of statistical distribution of data is something called a log normal distribution,

541
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:07,290
where we have a peak kind of earlier on and the concentration range is positively skewed.

542
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:18,600
This is actually pretty common for for both workplace and community environmental measures to see a single distribution looks like this,

543
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:27,600
and it can be a result of many different impacts of variation, can be variations over time,

544
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:35,690
variations within people, as well as variations within a location.

545
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:42,200
So why do we care about statistical distribution, why why is it relevant?

546
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:47,690
Well, one reason is for descriptive reasons.

547
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:57,200
So what's the best way to summarize data? So knowing how the data is distributed would help inform how we would summarize the data

548
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:03,710
for doing statistical assessments of statistical significance would be another reason.

549
01:08:03,710 --> 01:08:10,070
So if our data is normally distributed versus what normal,

550
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:14,540
it would inform what types of statistical tests we would perform in assessing

551
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:20,780
the data and be able to tell us whether our our assessments are valid or not.

552
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:29,300
And then also epidemiologic reasons. Understanding the nature of the relationship between the exposure and disease,

553
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:37,000
knowing how that data is distributed would help inform our epidemiological approach.

554
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:48,640
Uh, kind of sticking on how we're generating this data and where we would be looking out for uncertainty, assessing precision biases and so forth,

555
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:57,210
it's important to to understand what limits of detection are antagonizes within the context of direct measurements.

556
01:08:57,210 --> 01:09:06,330
So limits of detection. So a couple of things here. There are actually non detectable measurements, right?

557
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:19,260
So values that can't be measured by like an instrument or an analytical device below some threshold and they're assumed to be non-zero values.

558
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:31,230
Right. So if we have a meter and it goes up to a hundred and it's its first reading is one and let's say the detection limit is one.

559
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:37,680
Well, if it never gets to one, it would be wrong to assume that the value is zero.

560
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:46,990
The true value might be zero point five, for example, but it's below the limit of detection for that instrument.

561
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:52,140
Uh, the detection limit is, you know, kind of what it sounds like.

562
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:58,260
It's the smallest amount that an instrument can measure.

563
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:02,610
The detection limit is the same as the threshold for a direct reading instrument.

564
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:10,740
So kind of the very basic example I just gave that we have a meter in front of us and it's reading one to one hundred or zero.

565
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:19,950
But for other types of sampling devices, detection limit actually decreases with increasing duration of sample.

566
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:27,090
So let's say we have one of these personal monitoring pumps with a filter on it or collecting particles in the air.

567
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:37,140
You have it sitting here in the middle of the room. And our opportunity to assess what the levels of particles in this room are are only during

568
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:42,780
this class period because nobody else agrees to have one of these monitors in their classroom,

569
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:46,980
for example. Right. So the class is only an hour and 20 minutes long.

570
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:52,710
If we set it up here and run it, we're limited by how much air the pump can pull through.

571
01:10:52,710 --> 01:11:04,980
If the particles are really low in in truth, in the room and we only sample for an hour and 20 minutes, we might not be able to detect anything.

572
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:13,620
But if everyone agrees all throughout the day, all the subsequent classes to like, oh, sure, we can we can have this monitor running all day long.

573
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:21,060
So what's going to happen is the particles are going to continue to accumulate on that filter and we're going to collect a larger amount of mass.

574
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:29,100
Right. So it's going to when we take that back to the laboratory to then measure how much particles are on the filter,

575
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:33,960
we're going to get a larger a larger reading.

576
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:38,430
The concentration isn't any different. The true concentration in the room isn't any different.

577
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:44,190
But our ability to detect it gets better the longer the duration of sample that we collect.

578
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:53,760
Does that make does that make sense? OK. Maybe a softball question here.

579
01:11:53,760 --> 01:12:11,920
Um, do we expect to have more measurements under the limit of detection in an occupational setting or in a community setting?

580
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:20,770
Yeah, essentially, this is occupational firehoses, but you're exactly right, so we're, for the most part,

581
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:26,560
expecting higher levels in the first place, higher concentrations and workplace settings.

582
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:36,820
So we would have a higher potential for getting results that are under the limit of detection in community settings in general.

583
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:46,840
All right, so along that question of who collected the measurements and what this might inform us about our results.

584
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:55,180
So if there are compliance officers or regulators that come in and say, OK,

585
01:12:55,180 --> 01:13:01,120
surprise inspection, we're making measurements of everyone on their ship today,

586
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:07,030
you know, if there's there's no preparation, maybe people are even a little bit caught off guard.

587
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:11,800
The way they act is a little bit different during their shift.

588
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:22,810
This is perhaps a worst case sampling approach in that we might get higher exposure levels or an

589
01:13:22,810 --> 01:13:30,040
overestimate of what true typical exposures are and they might not be representative in that case.

590
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:33,370
Kind of a Converse example is if you have,

591
01:13:33,370 --> 01:13:41,470
like the company planning for exposure measurements or they hire a consultant and to schedule the month in advance on October 1st,

592
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:50,590
we're going to be doing some some personal monitoring here within the within the lab, within the plant, within the facility.

593
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:54,640
You know, this might result in kind of a best case scenario, right?

594
01:13:54,640 --> 01:14:01,750
Because, wow, October 1st, you know, we're getting things cleaned up in advance of the measurements.

595
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:08,890
We want things to be in tip top shape. And so those and those exposure residents might come out to be very low levels.

596
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:17,470
And again, not representative of the typical conditions, uh, kind of contrasting that to researchers.

597
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:23,110
Right. Who are doing exposure studies.

598
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:29,260
And these cases, there might be a maximum amount of control using the best instruments,

599
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:38,770
the the best protocols, as many people as you need to do it correctly, as much time as it takes.

600
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:47,290
So you might have really representative measurements, maximum control, but it might also come at maximum expense.

601
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:56,020
Right. So the resource that goes into that to get that representative measurement could have a high cost associated with it.

602
01:14:56,020 --> 01:15:01,910
So these are all things to consider around who's collecting the measurements.

603
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:07,120
So these would be some sampling strategy questions to ask if you have some data, right.

604
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:16,600
That was supplied to you within, say, a workplace setting, is it to ask why was the sampling performed?

605
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:27,610
Like what was the purpose of making this measurement? Was it for compliance with its regulations or simply to characterize exposure?

606
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:33,040
Who was the sampling performed on? Where was the sampling performed?

607
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:37,660
Was it random? Like somebody decided, OK, today we're going to make measurements?

608
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:45,700
Was it systematic? OK, it's every Tuesday and that might inform you like, OK, well, we know then the plant, you know,

609
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:51,180
on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, these are the activities we only have only have data from Tuesdays.

610
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:56,830
You know, was it selected for a particular reason? Uh, when was the sampling performed?

611
01:15:56,830 --> 01:15:59,930
Again, going back to this? Was it every Tuesday?

612
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:07,780
Um, there could be some auto correlations inherent in the data due to some sort of cyclical nature of exposure.

613
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:10,450
And then how many samples were collected. Right.

614
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:17,720
If someone says this is our average exposure level in the facility to workers, does that based on three measurements?

615
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:19,510
Was it based on three hundred? Right.

616
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:35,740
So knowing how representative it is from a number of samples collected perspective would help inform kind of your confidence in that value.

617
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:48,820
Along the lines of underestimating monitored exposure, this might take place when current measurements are used to estimate historical exposures.

618
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:56,650
Right. So a worker in a facility in twenty twenty one, we're trying to estimate what their exposure is today.

619
01:16:56,650 --> 01:17:04,420
Tomorrow, over the next month, for example, the only data we have is from nineteen seventy two in that facility.

620
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:16,590
We might be actually. I reversed that, uh, that would be a case of an overestimate in this case,

621
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:21,870
we're using current measurements to estimate what someone was exposed to in nineteen seventy two.

622
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:30,450
Right now, perhaps the levels are quite low because we have lots of safe workplace practices in place that weren't present in 1972.

623
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:37,260
So using current data to estimate the historic exposure resulted in underestimate, um,

624
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:44,370
we could have an employee or employer on their, their best behavior like oh my gosh,

625
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:45,490
everyone's watching,

626
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:55,740
I have to wear this monitor and you kind of avoid what those known exposures might be and what your what your typical shift work is at a facility.

627
01:17:55,740 --> 01:18:02,850
And because of that, it might result in an underestimate of your exposure. And then in general, when it's selected by the employer.

628
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:13,510
Right. Versus some external or third party body, it inherently is going to result in or could result in an underestimate.

629
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:16,090
I'll finish with this slide and then go ahead and stop.

630
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:26,440
So now shifting to the the cases of over estimation, so for worst case sampling, sampling only in places where exposure is apparent.

631
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:35,980
Right. If you say we're really concerned about, you know, the boiler located over here in this room, that it could be a source of exposure.

632
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:42,160
So I want you to go stand next to the boiler or we're going to set up our area monitor right next to the boiler for eight hours.

633
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:49,690
Well, we might get a high level, but in terms of workers and their tasks, no one actually spends eight hours next to the boiler.

634
01:18:49,690 --> 01:18:53,320
Right. So this could result in an overestimate.

635
01:18:53,320 --> 01:19:00,850
And then where I kind of caught myself there a minute ago, if we use the values from nineteen seventy two where exposures maybe were high,

636
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:06,040
but because of improved workplace safety practices, they're no longer that high.

637
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:13,060
If we only had data from nineteen seventy two that might overestimate a current exposure.

638
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:19,030
And then again self-selecting by employees. I'm worried about my exposure.

639
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:21,040
I'm really worried about the boiler.

640
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:27,400
I usually don't spend that much time, but I'm going to go hang out by the boiler more today because I'm really worried about what the levels might be.

641
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:32,950
This could result in kind of an overestimate of reality. We are at a time.

642
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:41,280
I'm going to stop right there, but pause and see if anybody has any questions before we break.

643
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:47,790
All right, so we'll pick up with this finish this material on direct measurements, personal monitoring,

644
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:58,200
and then we'll shift into questionnaires and then leave sometime at the end of class on Tuesday for any for any questions regarding exam review.

645
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:07,336
Thanks so much for your attention. Have a great weekend.
