1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:06,710
Because I just think it's.

2
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,710
Because I got. So just stay on the page.

3
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:32,550
I'm so happy to see you.

4
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:44,180
I really feel like you know how. Don't do this to me.

5
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:59,350
For the health of his months.

6
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,580
I think about it. And then I have to write.

7
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:18,490
I don't know. I don't. You know what I mean by that?

8
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:27,870
I don't know how long before.

9
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,630
You know what I mean? You have to plan.

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:43,990
Okay, guys, we could get started today and see if some more people trickle in and just, you know,

11
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:56,050
that word of encouragement to fill out classy vowels so you can get up higher than 37%, but hopefully not higher than 37 people in the class.

12
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:03,100
What happened to Dallas? Oh, okay.

13
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:11,760
So today we're going to talk about sort of gender things, things gender related and child gender development.

14
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:20,319
And I kind of this topic is so fascinating because I think recently, like in recent years,

15
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,010
there's so much more capacity to look at these things in a mature way.

16
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:29,469
And because so many young kids who are, you know, transitioning gender.

17
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:34,750
And so I just think, like purely kind of from this research perspective, which is, you know,

18
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:41,469
related to lots of different outcomes and well-being and everything, but we're just going to get so much interesting information.

19
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:50,140
So I'll talk about some studies that are trying to do that because this is a this is like a really I find that really fascinating area.

20
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:56,200
So we'll talk about just sort of gender identity development from little kids and

21
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,490
then also touch on some health issues that are facing LGBTQ youth in particular.

22
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:09,879
And I think one thing that's just really important to like start out to be grounded in is that, you know,

23
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:20,850
historically so much research on LGBTQ youth populations have focused on like risk behaviors and risk status, right?

24
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:27,900
Like so this is a group that on average experiences like a high risk because of that.

25
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,049
Some of the things we talked about last week, like getting out of their home by their parents,

26
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,640
having troublesome family relationships because of their sexual orientation.

27
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:48,370
And and I'll say this at the end, too, but like, it's not that long ago that homosexuality was a disorder in the DSM,

28
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:53,079
which I think people generally know, but like shockingly, not that long ago.

29
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:58,330
And so thinking about kind of where we are now and sort of the transitions that our

30
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:04,870
culture is going through in terms of increasing acceptance of varied gender identities,

31
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,030
I think it's just important to kind of pause on that point and be like, okay, what do we need to know now?

32
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,260
What do we want to do now?

33
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:20,680
How can we kind of maximize learning more about these populations in a way that can promote healthy development for all kids?

34
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,419
So we'll talk more about that towards the end.

35
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:32,680
But I wanted to sort of start with like these sort of classic ideas about gender identity development and concepts of gender.

36
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:44,950
And so just again, in the last, you know, ten years, there's just been more and, you know, increased attention to, of course,

37
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:49,300
terms like we're living that in our daily life, but certainly in the research space too,

38
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,920
because there's been a lot of research on gender development over time.

39
00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:02,080
And a lot of it started kind of in the seventies when people were like, Hey, what if we raise kids in more gender neutral language?

40
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,830
They'd be less gendered in their behaviors and attitudes and everything.

41
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:12,939
And so that's kind of when a lot of this research really started again, not until then,

42
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:18,520
which I know you guys seemed like a long time ago, but like in sort of cultural time, it's like that, that one.

43
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:27,399
So anyway, one of the things we know too is that remember when we were talking about infant categorization and race and everything,

44
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:35,920
like infants do sort of categorize things and gender is one of these things they track on, sort of like classic gender gendered characteristics.

45
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,490
So like a deep voice, you know,

46
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:47,020
that's something that infants well in these like little infant looking paradigms studies infants can sort of tell when.

47
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:59,329
People are of a different gender. And so that sort of one of these early emerging like categorization things that that, you know,

48
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:12,469
I think it's an interesting question in terms of whether that might shift as we maybe maybe move toward a somewhat less gendered society.

49
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:20,630
But it's a good question. We don't know. Another thing that has been found like repeatedly in the literature is this idea of gender constancy.

50
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,370
So this and this is a really salient right for sort of gender transition discussions,

51
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:31,729
like the idea of do you stay the same gender or do you you know, can you move back and forth between genders?

52
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,270
And that's something that, again, is pretty early emerging in development.

53
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,090
And that's how people have what people have studied quite a bit.

54
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:45,709
And then there's this idea that like gender preferences become more rigid throughout that for early childhood period.

55
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:53,320
And if people have again hung out with preschoolers in preschool classrooms, there's a lot of gendered behavior we may notice, like pink dresses.

56
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,760
So like all the, you know, parents who are like, oh,

57
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,890
I want to raise my child really gender neutral and I don't want to have pink and blue and all these sort of gendered colors.

58
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,950
And then the child goes to preschool and it's like, I love pink or I, you know, that's something that happens.

59
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,040
And we can think about all those like preschool factors,

60
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:17,090
peer pressure or whatever in the preschool setting that might sort of prompt some of those behaviors.

61
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:25,400
What's super interesting, and again, this is the kind of research that we can start to do now that we have sort of growing

62
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:34,549
populations of kids who are expressing transgender identities or alternate gender identities,

63
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,040
switching gender identities from early on.

64
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,980
And so we can study, like what's going on with these kids, what's happening, you know, are they tracking with,

65
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,290
you know, cis gender kids in their, you know, all of these things that we've studied for a long time.

66
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:55,850
And so there aren't that many studies of this. And there's sort of one particular research group is really prolific in this area.

67
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,450
And so some of the papers that I posted lot of like for the reading are from this group.

68
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:08,240
But they basically have found so far that kids who are identifying as transgender from young ages,

69
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:15,110
so like prepubescent they're really they're sort of showing all these things with their preferred or

70
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:24,740
expressed desired gender and they're not like less gendered overall than kind of cis gender kids.

71
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:34,670
One of the, you know, kind of caveats to this. And again, I think that this is why I like this research I find super just developmentally

72
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:39,049
fascinating is like they didn't have a big group of like non-binary children.

73
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:44,510
Right. So that may be something and I suspect it will be something that this group is able to like research in the future.

74
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,940
And so I think that will kind of just lend a lot of different, you know,

75
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:54,530
perspectives and information to this whole all these questions of gender that are kind of going on in our society.

76
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,980
So just sort of people are interested. Keep an eye on that group.

77
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,530
And this is just, again,

78
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:09,170
like just reflecting like back to our preschool times and we were talking about all those little preschool conversations kids have.

79
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:14,360
These are sort of ways that you might hear kids speak.

80
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,249
And again, this is a space where like, I wonder how much these things,

81
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:26,540
these sort of examples might shift over time, the more exposure kids get to varying gender definitions.

82
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:34,129
But these are sort of some classic examples of like how kids figure this, figure out like who's who's gendered.

83
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,730
And if you look at them or like who's what gender people are.

84
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,919
So if you look at them like this, Erin, age four, explains the drawing.

85
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,130
The ones with eyelashes are girls and boys don't have eyelashes.

86
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,800
So like, that's not accurate.

87
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:57,320
But like she's trying to kind of pass information about her world to say, Oh, what makes a boy a boy and what makes a girl a girl?

88
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:04,040
And so she's hit on this like eyelashes thing. Another four year old noticed the father and another man order pizza.

89
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:10,460
The mother ordered lasagna. And so on the way home, he announced he'd figured it out that men eat pizza and women don't.

90
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:18,560
So again, like, they're sort of like aware of gender as this, like, salient construct, but they're not really sure, like what travels with gender,

91
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:23,990
which is so fascinating because they think like, okay, like back to,

92
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:29,660
like there's this classic psychologist that in the seventies was like, I'm raising my child, like totally gender neutral.

93
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,680
Like, they're never going to be supposed to gender, which is not best.

94
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:44,390
But if things like shift in 50 years, like would we still see these kinds of, you know, salience of gender attributions?

95
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,250
And I think that's really interesting.

96
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:54,120
And again, like I just heard from a preschool basic cognitive development point that drive to like categorize things is sort of what's,

97
00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:01,260
what's happening in context also of like figuring out what you are like as a person, as a kid.

98
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:07,140
You know, gender is a very simple thing that starts a little bit even earlier than preschool.

99
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:18,330
Okay. And so this is kind of like the shape of, if you want to call it, like gender stereotyping, gender rigidity, beliefs about gender.

100
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:24,180
So this idea of gender identity and gender constancy, like you stay the same gender.

101
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,209
Like by around five kids are starting to, you know, hold the appropriate belief that,

102
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,570
like, if you change your clothes, it doesn't necessarily change your gender.

103
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:41,459
And I think that's interesting also because, you know, depending on how many kids people how many people kids might know,

104
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:46,560
maybe who are not dressing, you know, in a cisgender way.

105
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,030
Like maybe that will shift these beliefs forward, backward developmentally.

106
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:55,439
We don't really know what we do know, which is pretty consistent,

107
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:02,850
is that more sort of knowledge and endorsement and exposure to gender roles are associated with more sort of gendered play.

108
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:12,750
So again, think of those preschool classrooms, you know, trucks, dolls, pink, you know, very sort of gender, gender, gender, eyes, gendered play.

109
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:21,090
And what happens is that sort of kids get really rigid for a little while in this sort of preschool years or learning about gender.

110
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,829
Like, does everybody have eyelashes or not? Oh, this is what gender means.

111
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:31,530
Like, you know, I love pink and there's this like pink frilly dress syndrome that people write about.

112
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:38,160
And then as you kind of go a little older and get more exposure, you have more flexible ideas around gender.

113
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:45,120
And so I think that overlaying these kind of developmental observations that have been pretty consistent over many,

114
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,459
many years is interesting in this current context,

115
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:59,310
where I think gender is just becoming much more fluid in terms of thinking about it and think about the options of it.

116
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:04,740
And so I think that this question about how is this going to, you know,

117
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,620
is it going to or might that sort of shift the way little kids are sort of trying to parse out their worlds in this way?

118
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,670
You know, what what academia look like? So I think that'll be a cool space to watch.

119
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:28,139
Like I said, it is also impossible in this current moment to avoid, like, gender stereotypes.

120
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:35,360
Right? And so we see that all over the place. And so these are some of my favorites, girl Legos and boy Legos.

121
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:45,720
And, you know, this is these are still on the shelves. And when you guys look at girl Legos and boy Legos, what strikes you about those Legos?

122
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:56,020
Different choices that the marketers of these girls have made. Yet the colors are more neutral, like dark colors.

123
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,700
Mothers are more colorful, for sure.

124
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:12,030
Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the activity is that like that is characters or whatever would be doing either of those.

125
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:16,010
That's like the Bible thing to do.

126
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,630
Your friend is like peaceful, like play time over here.

127
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:28,950
The time and really, like, action oriented, sometimes even violent.

128
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,710
And I would like structure. Industry more.

129
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:45,270
Not that now, but this is like. Like I like it's not.

130
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:49,330
It's like a girl's weekend, right? I mean, like that. So that makes me think of.

131
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:57,340
And then this industry standard is something similar. It's more like job oriented, like the Gwyneth Paltrow days and like yeah.

132
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:04,120
Used to I had my girlfriend was like too good for you.

133
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:09,819
Right, right, right. Like having a little like, I don't know, hopefully they would have like a little beverage thing,

134
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,860
but that's totally what makes me think of like, girls, we can wine by the pool.

135
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:19,510
What am I going to say to Adrian to like I do like level blue and they're actually really hard.

136
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,680
So the fact that 1612 is like.

137
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:30,280
Right. And I can I can't remember and think and these are like, you know, two examples.

138
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:36,670
So I think this is 894 pieces and this is fewer, but I don't think that's universally true.

139
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,050
I could be wrong about that in terms of just like complexity.

140
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:45,370
Yeah. There has been no. Yeah. The Lego people, too.

141
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:49,540
Like the boy Lego. That's your stereotypical Lego person.

142
00:15:49,930 --> 00:16:00,610
And the girl Legos is like almost like dolls or like there's much more of an emphasis on the physical look of the Lego person, for sure.

143
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:07,810
Yeah. And they're like really prominent. Like, these are like your friends, like a friends or relationships.

144
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:17,560
And then there's a guy, you know. Yeah. I think also before, like Legos were seen and kind of marketed as just for boys.

145
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,909
So they would just have for, you know, like no sex and stuff like that.

146
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:26,680
But then when they saw, Hey Girls also like this, they had to make a whole different category for them.

147
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:35,470
Instead of just including that a number of your Legos, which I think is just crazy, you know, it's it is it is stunning.

148
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:41,130
I mean, it is like amazing and stunning. And again, like, I, I think like there's a great like, again,

149
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:47,350
from the seventies era when Legos were like primary colors and really just blocks like no fancy stuff.

150
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:53,140
And there's like a little gender neutral looking kid playing the Legos and like, yeah,

151
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:59,530
they could have gone that direction, but they were like, we could do double the marketing and double the sales.

152
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:03,999
And, you know, that is definitely driving, you know, that whole piece.

153
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,950
So yeah, great that you want to engage girls in building and Legos.

154
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:18,549
But like really, you know, I was going to say, okay, yeah, it's just like and there's, you know,

155
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:24,430
and there's a lot and of course and and, you know, and people are kind of working in this space to, like, make it better.

156
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:30,640
There's this GoldieBlox company that is a little more gender neutral, but very girl marketed at the same time.

157
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:37,510
And like as a marketer, there is that like there is that preschool pink thing.

158
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:44,620
Like they have done lots of focus groups with lots of kids and it's not research, research research but like market research.

159
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:50,740
And you know, these preschool kids are like, no, I think I want the pink Legos again.

160
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,880
Maybe that will shift over time. We don't know. But yeah, Caroline, you know,

161
00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:00,100
some things just like preying on like parents fears or like uncertainty around

162
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:05,110
gender and I think like not wanting your son to reach for the girl Legos.

163
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:13,870
And I think it's a very intentional and has just kind of like reproduced a lot of like gender, just like gendered activities amongst kids,

164
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:19,810
just parents being like nervous that they're, you know, making their child confused or something and they let them.

165
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,329
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah. So we'll definitely talk about, like,

166
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:35,660
what kinds of also this like this sort of what gender rigidity or gendered beliefs and exposures kind of associate with later?

167
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,240
Absolutely. Yeah.

168
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:45,590
I think the often the confusing like in a lot of the parents to see like what they would be interested in like if they walk up to like,

169
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,780
you know, I think it gives parents something.

170
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,900
You do. But you also fit into that confusion that. What is that?

171
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:02,830
Right. Right. And like, if a parent, you know, if a boy says, like, I really want to play with the friend's Legos and the parent goes,

172
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,520
oh, my gosh, like, what does this mean for my child?

173
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:11,799
That's a that's somebody with a child that's going to take it. Right. Like the child's going to notice this response.

174
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:21,100
And so just sort of having these kind of stimuli out there really set up a lot of dynamics that,

175
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:24,310
you know, again, like are making money hand over fist.

176
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:30,969
But, you know, what sort of the bigger, bigger picture? I also this is at Target.

177
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:37,420
It is a picture I took a few years ago. Now, I don't know if it's still there, but it says building sets, girls building sets.

178
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,080
Like, do you just do you need to do that?

179
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:47,830
And I think we've talked in here before about, you know, that's not even going into clothing.

180
00:19:49,030 --> 00:20:01,770
But, you know, anybody who's ever searched for like infant and child clothing of any kind, it's just so hyper gendered like from the very beginning.

181
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,530
And so yeah, also kind of shows how like male is kind of a standard.

182
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:11,530
They don't put boys and girls, so it's like it's kind of like applied to like boys.

183
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:15,909
Of course it's been there's an assumption specifically for girls, you know, totally.

184
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,810
10,000%. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

185
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:24,490
This is something that I thought that I had a friend and then I was looking into it, but I haven't read think before like a controversy to it.

186
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:33,030
Like the friends like like for girls being like not as complex as the ones I know for boys and then just looking into cause I saw like, yeah.

187
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:40,720
The size six. Yeah. And it seems like that's pretty consistent or both like explicit friends.

188
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:46,660
So in that, that was really interesting how like even that is like a very basic like yeah.

189
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:52,360
And, you know, and so maybe that's why I was sort of remembering the number because it is like this city,

190
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,340
those of us who haven't recently built Legos,

191
00:20:54,340 --> 00:21:03,879
which are so fun, um, that's that whole series of like, and it's all, it's like jobs, it's being external, it's out in the world.

192
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,290
It's like, how much can you do and accomplish and make and be industrious about?

193
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,670
And then, yeah, the friends ones are like much more like this is not bad,

194
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:18,219
but there are like relationship focused, internal, kind of, you know, more sort of fun.

195
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:26,620
And there's definitely like hair salon, you know, there's just so, so, so, so gendered and yeah.

196
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,749
And I think that's kind of that city that,

197
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:35,110
that like complexity is sort of what like the GoldieBlox company is trying to address more and it's very but it's still

198
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:44,290
against for in order to sell GoldieBlox they the color palette is often at least integrate some more sort of pinky colors.

199
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:48,760
Again not bad it's just like, you know what it's linked to.

200
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:56,260
And then I think the other thing here is that like from the get go, you know, gender reveal parties,

201
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:06,460
which again have sort of burst onto the scene in relatively recent history and started forest fires and all sorts of other things.

202
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:15,880
But just sort of reflecting on like what were you talking about in here in terms of like infants and, you know,

203
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:22,360
parent child relationship and how parents kind of conceptualize what infants are about,

204
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,220
what they can do, who they are like, how individually different they are.

205
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:32,890
I think this is really fascinating as well because it's like one of the few

206
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:37,210
things you can actually know about an infant before they're born is gender.

207
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,920
Again, relatively recent phenomenon to be able to know that.

208
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:48,380
Um, and so, you know, I think that all of this, of course,

209
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:54,670
has emerged in response to being able to know that, obviously, but what does that carry with it?

210
00:22:54,670 --> 00:23:02,379
And that being the thing you know about your kid before you like have your kid is is interesting.

211
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,760
Like, you know, what else could we know about our kid or, you know.

212
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:14,140
You know what? How might it be different if people know or don't know the gender of their kid?

213
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:26,200
So I don't know if people have, you know, people who have gone both directions in terms of this, um, you know, gender reveal or gender knowing.

214
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:32,840
Yeah, I don't know, like everything's different, you know, but so many ways people trying to do her.

215
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:40,100
But there are also like, I don't know how long ago like a video of the person who, like, made gender roles.

216
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:49,040
Oh, interesting. I thought you did one. Like, she made a video that highlighted like, oh, you guys are worried about gender revealed.

217
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:54,899
But the baby that got the first ever gender reveal is now like not their actual gender or like,

218
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:00,830
oh, like it was so weird how she did it, but she was just like, oh, well, they don't identify.

219
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,150
They did do that. She revealed them.

220
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:11,330
And so that was I can't remember where the video is, but it was the person who like said like she had very first ever dinner.

221
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,290
That's just like, oh, my daughter looked it up for me.

222
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:22,280
Um, but yeah, that's so fascinating because it's also like the parents, this is a decision,

223
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:29,930
you know, that they have that they're like making, you know, in a way on behalf of the child.

224
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:35,599
Yeah. And it's also was interesting that this is happening like kind of alongside like society becoming a

225
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,209
little bit more accepting of people who are of diverse genders or it just being like more common,

226
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,150
even talked about like in news and media and everything.

227
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:52,160
Um, it's interesting because it's like in one sense we're like moving to be a little bit more accepting of that.

228
00:24:52,160 --> 00:25:01,219
But then also these things are getting really popular and they completely go against everything that is like, you know, gender fluid change or gender.

229
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:07,970
And that's so gender stereotypes like that and just the pink and all the blue and everything.

230
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:13,220
And it's just interesting to see that come into popularity at the same time that society

231
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:18,650
is slowly becoming a little bit more accepting of like transgender genderqueer people.

232
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:29,540
Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. Like there's these sort of competing forces, societal forces and like again marketing, marketing forces and you know,

233
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:38,089
there always have been like for a long time like baby showers and things which are interesting enough.

234
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,540
But then this is just like again, a whole nother thing.

235
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:50,869
And, you know, we've talked a lot, too, in here about like parent blaming and parent, you know, pressures and perfect parenting and all this stuff.

236
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:55,270
But I think it this is like really a place that it could start out, right?

237
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,399
Oh, well, did you have a gender reveal? You know, what was your gender reveal party like?

238
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:05,300
You think that parent pressure could start early for sure on the parent and on a kid.

239
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:18,050
And I think it is also just with the clothing being able to find sort of gender neutral or even like non pink or blue colored things,

240
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,700
there's just a limited like a little more limited market for it.

241
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:28,000
It's certainly possible, but the mass produced things like really align with us.

242
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:32,930
Yeah. And it seems like it's not only literature, but also it tends to be more.

243
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:37,510
Yes. The sort of Ninth Ward like that.

244
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:42,710
Only then. Yes. There's like a group of people.

245
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:50,740
It's like what I toy's access. And actually that's why everyone else your stuff.

246
00:26:51,330 --> 00:27:00,740
Yeah. It's like you're fighting upstream and you have to go to, like, the cutesy fancy store versus target where all baby shopping happens.

247
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:07,999
Yeah. One thing that I noticed also kind of from TikTok is that there seems to be like with baby

248
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,010
nurseries and even like the way that like younger children are dressed mostly by their moms,

249
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:18,770
that it is kind of becoming more neutral colors like greens and browns and things.

250
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,909
But I would really like to think that that's like a shift in society.

251
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:27,350
You'd be like, Oh, well, my little girl doesn't always have to wear pink, but it's probably just for the esthetic,

252
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:34,819
like, like police who are like, Oh, I want everybody to look like you came out of like better homes and gardens.

253
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,290
And it's all these, like suburban white women, like tick tock.

254
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:47,360
I think that's such a good thought, but I don't think it has the real like intentions of doing anything to change this.

255
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,450
But it is a trend that's happening. Yeah, yeah.

256
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,510
It's good. It's good. I got I do I do feel a little tick tock.

257
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:01,460
I try to like I don't follow my daughter. I think she sends me things and I'm always like, don't follow, just watch video.

258
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:09,800
Yeah. I was wondering, is there any research on how to bring up your child or something?

259
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:19,340
Yeah. So I think that it's such a good question. So this is like the Bam's where like these psychologists in the seventies and they were they were

260
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,739
the ones who sort of were probably the most prominently trying to raise this gender neutral child.

261
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,590
And I can't even remember what all happened with that.

262
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,069
But it was like, you know, big news.

263
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:38,120
And they were like, oh, or, you know, they were very publicly like putting this child through an experiment, really.

264
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:47,660
And I think that as we kind of get more, you know, in like 25 years,

265
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:54,530
if current kind of culture trends kind of go the direction of more acceptance and gender fluidity and diverse genders,

266
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:59,540
I think we could know more about that question. I think right now, like we don't know.

267
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,900
And there's all these cultural influences happening.

268
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,220
I'll just I'll go to the next one. But there's also, you know, potential cultural shifts happening, right?

269
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:21,070
Other cultural influences. And so I think it's going to be very fascinating and I suspect that may get a little part of Partizan partitioned also.

270
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:32,780
That would not surprise probably any of us. Um, so you know that that's certainly something to sort of just, you know, as with so many things.

271
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:42,349
But I think that will, that will be related. And like if you're a child who is growing up in a an environment that is like this tonic,

272
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:46,879
like it doesn't match your gender preference and that kind of stuff,

273
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:55,730
you know, and that sort of gets to, you know, some of the things with LGBTQ youth, we know that those kids are going to have a harder time.

274
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:01,100
Like it's just, you know, despite like tech talk and support of social media, right?

275
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,880
So I think that that's important to think about, too.

276
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:16,130
And I think that thinking about, you know, all these different cultural shifts, again, relatively recent and rapid and again,

277
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:24,590
not like being resolved, but certainly like under discussion in a much more overt way, positive and negative than has been before.

278
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:33,070
Yeah. You know, so I went to a friend of ours yesterday and how like same sex marriage was just legalized like seven years ago.

279
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:38,360
Like it hasn't even been a decade. And so now we're having all of these like these, like you said,

280
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:44,179
like these recent discussions in other pronouns or like even someone of being like transgender.

281
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:51,259
And this is really like coming into mainstream. And I work for a summer program and we're talking about for we just don't have the

282
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:56,360
patience of or rather the question of sexual identity and also gender identity and.

283
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:04,279
Right. Higher ups are there in the older generation. So that like versus me in the U.S. But then I kind of have to think like, oh,

284
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,800
like back in their generation, they were really talking about the stuff and.

285
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:14,590
Yeah, especially with my work experience and working with like, um, kids who are like in middle school,

286
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:18,080
during high school and they have like a greater sense of who they are.

287
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:25,600
And then now we have like terms and labels to use that actually like reflects their identity and virtually thinking.

288
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:29,360
It's like, I feel like even when I was growing up, like maybe we knew about like, oh,

289
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:36,560
gay or lesbian, but I mean, genderqueer or non-binary, those things weren't really talked about.

290
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,950
So definitely like things like. Yeah, things like.

291
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,890
It just legalized seven years ago and 2015. Right.

292
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,550
Right. Yeah. Yesterday. But yes.

293
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,400
And and that idea of like, what box you check, right.

294
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,690
Like that is very, you know, formative.

295
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:03,079
And it's like it's it's like a basic data flow thing to that could be really a hassle and a lot to change.

296
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:08,959
But like I think that will be demanded more and more and it has been increasingly so.

297
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,840
So I think it's just reflects. Just hopefully like a lot of seismic shifting, I think.

298
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,920
Yeah. What I found. Oh yeah.

299
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:24,030
To to add into that. But that ship.

300
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:29,770
So I'm really into like the cartoon cartoon.

301
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:39,240
So that includes like. Couple million to like my family and then to like see the shift in life.

302
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:45,860
And I'm in my life so that the shift in my family that from like when it first started or within the show like.

303
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:48,659
Now what they used to talk about was very different.

304
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:54,960
Like it got a lot of criticism like and that's really big on talking about their criticism like do their cartoon

305
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:01,440
within like seeing how like they never talk about it anymore for the sake of like keeping their cartoons available,

306
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:09,360
but like they still tend to do it in certain ways. So like things about like over to communities,

307
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:15,750
it was very openly explicit like how they talked about it was like almost negative, but trying to be positive ways.

308
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:25,140
And now they're like shifting to like making characters who do it, like, who are like in those type of relationships to like advertise it,

309
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:31,469
but also like talk about it not in a negative way compared to what they used to do.

310
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:39,150
So it's like in the show, producers had to change the how their minds have changed to like now you have to be a lot more

311
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:47,790
accepting because kids are watching those things and kids are like more understanding of those things.

312
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:51,390
Like for example, like move did it and you switch.

313
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:56,770
They had an episode that way about him like, well, I don't know how to use it.

314
00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:03,480
Like I don't really know about him, like switching genders and choosing to like change genders.

315
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:09,840
However, like, I was not even think or talked about or like an idea at that point.

316
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:15,600
Yeah, I'm 28 is like now being like that that we talk about like being overly okay with it.

317
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:21,660
Yeah. It's just interesting how it is even cartoons down to like those smaller portions.

318
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:28,379
And then I think, yeah, like that the media can be such a powerful way to shift that.

319
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:35,010
I mean, it's not going to do everything but and it's kind of in part like you said, like reflecting things and this shift from sort of,

320
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:40,290
you know, this is where I think like the HBO kind of communication comes and the shift from saying like,

321
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,930
we think this is important, that people should do it this way,

322
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:50,070
not effective to like modeling and infusing beliefs in lots of different locations where people already are.

323
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:57,810
I think is is a good example of sort of thinking about how media could be shifted and how it is shifting.

324
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:06,419
And like, I forget, I forget, but like Will and Grace, which, you know, possibly heard of is like an old show now.

325
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:14,040
But it was sort of one of the first shows that haven't hasn't had a great primary character who is a gay man and talked a lot about that.

326
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,399
And that was like stunning, you know.

327
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,400
And now to think that that would be stunning is stunning.

328
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:25,380
So it's kind of, you know, again, like a lot of these sort of things do shift.

329
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:33,480
And there's something else you said oh when you said about like the kids the thing, you know, caring about it also now having that direct line of.

330
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:41,519
Tick tock it used to be Twitter with her off to like show your disappointment and your preferred way of you know, these shows working.

331
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:48,180
And that's obviously impacting, you know, the producers and things of these shows and of Legos or of whatever it is.

332
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:53,040
And so I think it's just a really fascinating space to think about.

333
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:59,670
I think the other thing here is that idea and again, thinking of Twitter,

334
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:07,319
like gender kind of historically atypical behaviors seen as no longer appropriate like

335
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:13,140
that has really been in response to people pushing back against it the very public way.

336
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:22,230
If anybody is watching these debates about the economists right now, they're having a whole meta moment in economics profession.

337
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:23,730
It's very interesting.

338
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:31,319
And of course, having said that, things are partizan and we know this, but like there's ongoing debates in all these spaces, right?

339
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:38,550
So all of these shifts and all these, you know, discussions prompt a lot of debate.

340
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:46,230
So, you know, watch this space. But it is I feel I feel moderately hopeful.

341
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,320
But that's also because I'm like older than you guys. So I can, like, see that shift, too.

342
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:58,410
So I know that there's also, like impatience, you know, among people who are like, what the heck?

343
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:01,590
People just get on with the program, you know?

344
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:06,810
So I think it's very interesting to kind of like this, this issue and see how it emerges.

345
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:15,990
Okay. So thinking again, developmentally, so gender, early adolescence, what's happening in early adolescence.

346
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:21,690
Right? And so this is a time when, you know, kind of awareness of sexuality,

347
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:29,100
sexual orientation, whatever dating definitions are out there can start to emerge.

348
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:34,499
And then also thinking about like kids. Who are maybe, you know, working, babysitting,

349
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:40,380
doing things like with people who are not their family in any kind of, you know, poor pre-professional way.

350
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,159
They're getting more exposure to sort of these gender roles in the broader world.

351
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,040
So like, even if your parents are trying to raise you gender neutral,

352
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:53,750
but then you go and you have like a teacher or a boss or someone who's not as gender neutral, you can get that exposure.

353
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:59,280
And then we've already talked about the media and then there have been some big studies sort of globally,

354
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,999
because I think one natural question is like, what are the cultural differences here?

355
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,920
What about, you know, cultures who do acknowledge gender fluidity like more traditionally?

356
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:16,440
And there's one big study that was this. They've said lots of different things, but this global early adolescent study and they look to see,

357
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:22,830
you know, like how early on did kids kind of recognize gender norms and equal gender norms?

358
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:32,459
And it was pretty early, my ten year old and I think linking that up just developmentally with this back to Ericsson,

359
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:39,120
like if we remember from those theories, like one of the things we're doing in adolescence is trying to figure out who am I?

360
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:45,570
And so what is my identity like? What is my role? Identity versus role confusion is one of these.

361
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:52,110
Erickson Ian like tasks and gender is one of those one of our multiple identities.

362
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,480
And so I think it's again, really fascinating to think about, you know,

363
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:06,120
if you're in a more gender fluid sort of society or family or personal situation, like what, that's like a complex set of ideas.

364
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:16,319
And so how can that be interacting with like your cognition or other, you know, kind of multiple ways of thinking about the world.

365
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:23,160
And so I think that's really fascinating to think about in terms of like, you know, one of these identities may be a complex identity.

366
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:34,950
And so that cognitive flexibility skill is important for sort of managing what all my identities are, and especially when identities is very fluid.

367
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:41,280
It could have, I think, implications for kind of how adolescents, you know,

368
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:48,000
generate different solutions and problem solve and all those things that are related to cognitive flexibility.

369
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:55,200
So that's just sort of again to like link it to its developmental period, what's happening in early adolescence.

370
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,940
And then the other thing just to, you know,

371
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:09,300
present in terms of findings and research is that this idea that if you're a girl and you have more gendered,

372
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:20,340
you know, typically gender, gender, conforming type views, you tend to report experience, more depression symptoms, body image issues, etc.

373
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,340
And there is a piece that's cited a lot. It's called Looking Good.

374
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:26,820
It's not a feeling, talk a lot about Instagram and all of those things.

375
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:32,880
And then on the flip side, boys who have this more typically gendered,

376
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:40,949
few gendered conforming views tend to engage in more sort of violent behaviors, risk taking behaviors, this idea of toxic masculinity.

377
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:48,029
So like if you're very extreme on your gender views, these are, you know, things that have been found.

378
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:56,969
And again, this is, you know, research that is like from the nineties to 2010 ish era.

379
00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:01,740
So it will be interesting to see if this switches or other research finds other

380
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:07,520
stuff because what we also know and this is like related to that kind of Lego

381
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:12,780
comment that kids who are displaying the sort of more gender and quote unquote

382
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:20,630
non-conforming behavior still do and experience more stress by victimization,

383
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:27,450
you know, internalized distress, etc., like sort of that minority stress theory type of.

384
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:35,080
Process or mechanism, right? So all of these things are sort of operating.

385
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:38,450
So I guess I would say like, like what do we do first?

386
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:48,469
Right. So like are we going to, you know, ideally maybe make this a more normative space where there's less victimization?

387
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:54,410
That would be great. At the same time, like you kind of understand kids who want to have these more gender views,

388
00:41:54,410 --> 00:42:02,600
especially these like rigid times of development, like middle school or like ninth graders, like these sort of early transition times.

389
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:13,969
It's very challenging, I think, to to sort of figure out how to how to help these kids part of what to not that one can,

390
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:23,990
like recommend the gender attitude, but that idea of sort of how do we socialize kids from early on, you know, in terms of gender?

391
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:27,290
And so these are just sort of thought questions.

392
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:37,700
But I think, um, this question about like how do we reduce victimization and that's cuts across so many different categories.

393
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:42,260
How do we build awareness of like gender fluidity but without stigmatizing?

394
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:47,040
So, you know, there's controversy about whether you say your pronouns because people don't want to say their pronouns,

395
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:53,630
but people do want to say their pronouns. So people do. Some people don't. So like it's very potentially tricky territory.

396
00:42:54,140 --> 00:43:01,460
Um, and then this question about like reshaping gender norms, I think like that cultural developmental connection.

397
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:07,520
And I think it also relates to like when do we start sort of quote unquote sex education, you know, in schools?

398
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:16,399
What does that look like? And so if we can sort of focus on these earlier stages of a, you know, non stigmatizing way,

399
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:24,230
I think that will help to ultimately start to reshape gender norms and better outcomes.

400
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:30,650
Okay. So any thoughts on that? Any thoughts on the sex education?

401
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,840
You know, some people are doing papers on that. Yeah, right.

402
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:41,719
This just like came to mind because I also have to take time to do a commercial like probably ten

403
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:48,230
years ago where they interviewed like older or like but like not little girls and just women.

404
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:54,870
And like I think there are a few men as well. And boys like some of them like control, like the girl, like what does it mean?

405
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,770
Like the girl, like acted it out and it was all very like stereotypical.

406
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:04,909
Like girls can't really, like, throw very well or run very fast.

407
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:13,580
Yeah. And then they next had like a bunch of younger girls and ask the same questions and all those girls and,

408
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:18,770
you know, honestly answered and these interviewers like, so what does it mean to you?

409
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:23,810
And I say, like, run like the girl was like, oh, like, run as fast as I can.

410
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:31,550
Oh, um, just thinking about how that is, like, instilled over time, like those beliefs and like that.

411
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:39,110
I think we moved even further past, like, you know, was girl negative to like, why are things so gendered in general?

412
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:52,090
But thinking about how like as you grow up you can instill those like negative views on your kids or just kids that you interact with and everything.

413
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:58,730
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, and that that phrase is so interesting, too.

414
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:06,490
It's kind of been, you know. Like tried to be sort of reclaimed as like a power way to do things.

415
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:11,410
And I think that's interesting. And I think that that's that's that generational piece.

416
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:18,219
I really think that, you know, over generational time that we've already, again, seen a lot of change.

417
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:26,799
And of course, Title nine thinking of sports is very much foundational for just getting girls exposure opportunities.

418
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:33,280
And now, of course, with transgender youth, where it's like a whole new discussion of, you know, Title nine and the sports implications.

419
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,319
And, you know, I think it was the oh, what's her name, Kristy.

420
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:45,490
Now, I'm like the the South Dakota governor or something who is talking about, you know, having transgender girls,

421
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:50,979
I want to say, in a sport that, like, couldn't find any team that actually had a transgender girl on it.

422
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:58,210
So it was just one of these things that like it's such a new territory, it's highly politicized.

423
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:10,090
And I think, as you said, it's very possible to sort of have these sort of unintentional socialization is, you know, in one direction or another.

424
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:15,580
And so we want to be mindful of that. We also want to be mindful that, like, these are rapid changes.

425
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:19,600
And so, like, if one's grandma is not like on board, you know,

426
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:25,420
it's kind of getting her there slowly or like saying, okay, it's not for you, you know, might might be reasonable.

427
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:30,250
Yeah. So not a lot going on with.

428
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:42,800
Trans. Inclusion in sports, especially like college sports and.

429
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:48,180
I just. I feel like it's so cool to see how.

430
00:46:50,770 --> 00:47:00,499
How there are like there are some people that are reaching out to you that would like be over here in this camp,

431
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:11,230
like politically and then coming out and saying like, not like inclusion is the baseline and that's that's where we need to start.

432
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:20,790
And. And it's also disgusting to read some of the stuff that.

433
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:33,589
Yeah. I mean, it can be I mean, I feel like also with like gay marriage,

434
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:39,860
people sort of were it was more personal because people knew people that people

435
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:45,620
knew people that they knew people had personal knowledge of individuals who,

436
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:53,810
you know, would get married. And so that made a big difference as opposed to, you know, some of the issues that come up in this space as well.

437
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,260
Yeah,

438
00:47:54,680 --> 00:48:03,050
I'm kind of going off that point with for I think like some things that have helped has been like seeing women in positions that they normally aren't,

439
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:09,020
you know, like with football where we have like the first yea grad assistant on the football team as a woman.

440
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:18,379
So I feel like doing things like that where but normally wouldn't see someone there like having a female referee in the NFL of like Lola.

441
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:24,320
I feel like we're getting to that. But, but it's still like you'll see money like, oh my God, there's a woman on the field.

442
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:34,190
So hopefully that'll continue. And I get that. Like eventually then we can transition into like, okay, how can we get trans both into this discussion?

443
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:40,129
But we're still just getting to the point where we can have women referee a football game for like at some point.

444
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:43,930
Hopefully that will be unremarkable, right? But now it totally still is.

445
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:47,419
Yes, absolutely. Yeah. Because on our first acts, I don't know if this was mentioned,

446
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:52,790
but there was actually I think it was Notre Dame had a female soccer player come in and kick from.

447
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:57,800
Oh, yeah, college football fans don't know if it's Notre Dame, but it was a college football team.

448
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:02,059
I will never know that. Yeah.

449
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:07,640
Yeah. And it's like, yeah, I think we are. It's like we're still at that, like, first.

450
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:15,170
The first two ever to do this stage of a lot of these like bigger profile, higher profile things.

451
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:21,800
But as you know, as it kind of increases, I think and again, like you think about Title nine,

452
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:28,780
it's been a long time that's been in place, but the implementation has been uneven like it's been, you know.

453
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:37,600
But I think probably everybody in this room, even a little bit, including me, has like had more exposure,

454
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:45,290
you know, in the Title nine women's sports space than they would have prior to that, for sure.

455
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:51,170
In the U.S., yeah, I was like thinking about the when do we start sex education question.

456
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:57,930
But I think a lot of the argument against that is like kids that are like should learn about this and like we're sexualizing children.

457
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:05,599
And I think that there's a difference between like sex education and like gender education and like no one is thinking like,

458
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:10,759
let's go to kindergarten classrooms and like tell them how, like sex between two men or two women works.

459
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:16,819
Like, I just don't think that is ever the case. But I do think it's important to like educate young kids, especially,

460
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:23,899
that we know that they're coming out as transgender or like questioning their gender more about gender education and how that can be fluid.

461
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:27,860
And I think that that is it. Those are like one in the same.

462
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:34,730
And a lot of the people that argue against like comprehensive sex ed or like gender education for your kids,

463
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,960
I think that that just gets thrown around as like doing what? You shouldn't do it.

464
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:44,479
Yeah. And I think that term like I think around front slides like sex is not equal to gender.

465
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,590
And again, like those of you who have ever written an academic paper over my right one,

466
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:53,629
like that's a criteria, that's like a critique that, you know, I'm always putting in.

467
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:59,540
I'm like, what did you measure? You know? And like, it's just not the same.

468
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:05,870
And at a very basic term level, it's unfortunate that this is the term that's kind of been thrown around because of what you're saying.

469
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:08,870
Like people are saying, well, then it's kindergartners and we're talking about sex.

470
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:18,440
And so I think some like rebranding of that process is important for sure.

471
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:21,019
Okay.

472
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:32,389
So let's see, like speaking of transgender youth, so there have been some reports on sort of just prevalence of transgender identity among youth.

473
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:41,780
And we do know that, again, just like with the LGBT youth literature, there's a lot of stigma of violence, victimization, etc.

474
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:49,520
Among these youth there have been, again, lots of debates in this space.

475
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:59,240
And and some of the some of the debates at various times have centered on that idea of delaying puberty in different ways.

476
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:04,700
And if you think about early adolescence and that sort of, you know.

477
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:14,459
Sexualized, you know, sex, sex oriented sex, sexual orientation dating, being interested in others,

478
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:21,990
like as coupled with that kind of like rigidity of sex roles or gender roles in those middle

479
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:26,340
school or early high school years like that all kind of crashes together developmentally.

480
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:34,740
And that's why this, you know, kind of puberty is one reason why this puberty onset can be really evoking a lot of

481
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:41,790
stress among youth who are transgender or just gender fluid considering their gender.

482
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:46,349
And so. Sorry, I think I'm just losing my voice.

483
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:48,180
I don't think I don't think I'm sick.

484
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:57,810
But this is a good question, a good space to watch because we're learning more because it's becoming an option or for people,

485
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:04,110
for families who can help their kids, you know, experience gender affirming care.

486
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:10,080
And I think one of the things that this group who does a lot of work with trans youth are talking about

487
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:16,170
is that there's that there's not like there's not really gender affirming care widely available,

488
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,849
but even more so, there's not like non-binary, affirming care available.

489
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:27,900
So I think that there's a lot that's that will be happening in this space over the next few years.

490
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:34,530
There's there have also been so that sort of like from that sort of biological duty of hormone blockers,

491
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:41,459
there's also that question about like whether a social transition is associated, better outcomes in general.

492
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:47,970
Yes. But of course, it's, you know, sort of dependent on your context aspects is everything.

493
00:53:49,050 --> 00:54:00,330
But thinking about, you know, if you can have a supportive school staff and anti-bullying policy is kind of similar to those that we talked about.

494
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:07,680
I think I gave a child trans article about bullying. A lot of these things can be helpful for all youth,

495
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:14,490
but particularly critical for transgender youth who are at higher risk for lots of things and LGBTQ youth.

496
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:26,150
And so one study that really looked at that question of social transition, they were this is a you know, Olson, who does this trans youth project,

497
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:34,800
they looked at youth who had socially transitioned and also they did one study of youth who had like re

498
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:46,250
transitioned back to their original gender and they found that very few youth actually did the transition back.

499
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:50,390
And if they did, it was sort of prepubescent, pubertal stage.

500
00:54:52,130 --> 00:55:00,530
And then this other study found that basically if you have, you know, a big if like if you have social support,

501
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:10,600
then kind of using your chosen name that aligns with your desired gender was associated with better mental health outcomes.

502
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:16,610
And again, that shouldn't be surprising, but it was a nice study that kind of passed out.

503
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:26,710
The fact that if your context is supportive and you then can embrace your chosen name, you do better.

504
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:35,330
And so I think that these kinds of studies are just important to like, again, know about in order to have, you know,

505
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:45,520
data to show what we know which is emerging about the well-being of particularly transgender youth and what kind of contexts can be helpful.

506
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:57,910
And again, I would say like a supportive trauma informed school system is good for everybody, but it's, again, like life changing for a lot of kids.

507
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:05,160
Okay. And so this is also more what we know historically.

508
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:10,150
So these studies are a bit, you know, just reflecting a lot of research over time.

509
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,890
Again, should not be too surprising, but it is still the case.

510
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:27,160
So 2017 study found that sort of more internalizing behaviors, more externalizing behaviors, more common among LGBTQ youth and other kids.

511
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,830
We talked about this a little bit last week.

512
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:39,940
Um, that LGBTQ youth tend to be overrepresented among youth who are homeless because they're getting kicked out of their homes or leaving their homes.

513
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:47,650
I would say, you know, quote unquote, voluntarily. But it's not not a great set of options for a lot of these youth.

514
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:55,030
And another thing is that they're missing school. And so that's where that school context becomes really important, because, of course,

515
00:56:55,030 --> 00:57:01,030
if you dress in school, on graduation, if you're opportunities, etc., to support themselves.

516
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:13,330
So that's just, you know, important to, again, be able to cite if you're working with this population or on behalf of this population.

517
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:22,569
And again, this is kind of what I said at the beginning, but like it's really relatively recent that people have started talking about like,

518
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:34,990
well, what are the mental health needs and unique risks of LGBTQ youth versus LGBTQ youth have?

519
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:39,520
A mental illness like that is a flip and it is a recent flip.

520
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:45,100
And so I think that just to point out, again, this is like a kind of a relatively rapid shift.

521
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:58,930
I've mentioned these kind of health risks due to a lot of stigmatization factors and the systems that we have in place.

522
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:05,770
Again, we like to bash systems all the time, but they're particularly failing youth in this demographic.

523
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:14,530
And so there are some good sensitivity, but there are some, you know,

524
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:19,510
efforts in like health settings or talked about them boxes to check right with you again is

525
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:24,970
expanding the number of boxes and types of boxes that we can check on our demographic forms.

526
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:31,780
And I think the homelessness point is important as well.

527
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:40,360
Uh, I'll just add two more study things. One is that if you guys monitor this, like does it get better campaign?

528
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:48,370
So this was a study that kind of looked at that and they basically found that, again, this should not be surprising,

529
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:56,000
but it was nice study to be able to pull it apart so that kids like just basically as kids got older, these things did improve.

530
00:58:56,090 --> 00:59:02,079
Right. So like young kids, early adolescence, like if I were going to design an intervention to reach these kids,

531
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:09,010
I would definitely focus on early adolescence and like pre, you know, ten to 10 to 13 year olds.

532
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:15,219
Because as kids hopefully emerge out of that period, they're finding their niche more,

533
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:18,250
they're getting social support more, they're able to kind of do more things.

534
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:28,900
And so this distress and victimization decline overall, but they also found that even that kids had high social support.

535
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:33,070
It didn't, like knock out the effects of being distressed.

536
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:40,780
So, you know, social support is great, but it's not the only, you know, thing we need to do for these kids.

537
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:52,120
And so that idea of, yes, it gets better, but we need to actually do more on behalf of these kids and these,

538
00:59:53,140 --> 01:00:03,460
you know, family factors can make a difference. Again, these are sort of these ideas around my family's disapproving.

539
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:12,490
I I'm going to leave home because my family's, like, threatening me, you know, cutting me off, restraining me, abusing me.

540
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:17,650
So lots of these factors are risk factors. So kids who feel like they need to hide their identity.

541
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:25,230
And who are isolated. Again, not surprising that these are sort of what studies show based on some data.

542
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:33,750
The other thing just to note, again, about school settings is that if there are certain activities available or groups or,

543
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:38,820
you know, teacher groups, teacher support at school, that can be really powerful.

544
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:43,590
And if those are lacking, then that can be really kind of harmful for kids.

545
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:51,420
And then we've talked about like the exposure and exposure to the gender roles and sometimes that is associated with religious identity.

546
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:56,579
Not always. And then here are some family strengths to think about.

547
01:00:56,580 --> 01:01:04,050
And again, family, but also school here, other contexts, acceptance of identity, support for identity,

548
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:09,180
sort of encouraging a kid to be positive about their identity or visible about their identity,

549
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:19,679
and also finding ways to, you know, if in a family there's a child who is LGBTQ,

550
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:26,640
but then the family members are figuring out a way to connect to that child with the community in some way, mentoring, etc.

551
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:34,770
And then just sort of having some I like this ad because it sort of like acknowledges like,

552
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:38,100
hey, you know, I love my child, but like this was a hard one for me.

553
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:45,420
You know, like I as a parents wasn't kind of ready to manage this like makes,

554
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:48,300
you know, it's like my kid going towards the pink Legos when they're two.

555
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:53,520
It's, you know, even more if your child is 16 and they say, hey, mom, you know?

556
01:01:53,700 --> 01:02:01,530
So I think that this is a is a just like a reasonable way to present this like challenge of the family,

557
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:08,190
but in an open, good, clearly loving relationship and saying like,

558
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:14,970
it's okay to say that this might be hard, but here's the things that we really need you to do as a family to support your kid.

559
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:21,809
So any comments?

560
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:30,690
Question I just kind of like I like to provide you guys with the the data and studies and let me know if you're interested more.

561
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:37,170
But I can pause there and stick around for a few minutes that people have paper questions.

562
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:47,549
Next time my my guest speaker can't do it, but we'll talk about medication adherence, which is kind of different from stuff we've talked about.

563
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:53,580
But like, how do all these developmental issues play out in sort of a pediatric context?

564
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:58,020
And I think it's pretty interesting application.

565
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:03,440
So particularly for people who are interested in that, that should be good and fill out evaluations.

566
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:08,730
And I will pause. Yeah, there's a lot of migrations.

567
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:12,140
Or come talk about papers to.

568
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:30,090
Happy. Spirit.

569
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:45,490
It's a thing I've been spared. The.

570
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:57,970
Great, great lecture was like really, really. Although I love it.

571
01:03:57,970 --> 01:04:01,480
But also it was like building when I did my paper on. Oh, that's so good.

572
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:09,400
So. Yeah. Yeah. So I agree with you that like the Internet because I'm looking now for human intervention and I, I,

573
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:16,210
you know, like on younger age intervention would be great for like gender stereotypes and stuff like that.

574
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:21,670
And I found like a really cool one that was done in Britain and stuff like that for 6 to 10 year olds.

575
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:27,930
And in my original paper I did like the most critical time are these, you know, yet you ask that's what yeah, yeah.

576
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:28,810
Middle school.

577
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:37,610
So it's a little bit older but like is that okay if I let's take this one and be like explain our plan obviously why I knew why they drafted

578
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:45,250
I think having an a younger age to kind of really get that stuff out like the gender stereotypes out you know quickly so that they're not.

579
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:49,200
Yeah. Really tear down that you know that that happens. Okay, cool.

580
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:52,600
I think that's awesome and I agree, right? Yeah. There's something to be done.

581
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:56,019
Yeah. Clear. What is that that we should do. Yeah. Okay, perfect.

582
01:04:56,020 --> 01:05:02,630
I think. Have a good weekend. Yeah. You can open question from I think I wonder if I can be with you on Monday like.

583
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:06,040
Yeah, yeah. A meeting I think.

584
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:19,150
Yeah. I knew in a meeting one other person last Monday, I mean they didn't even have to because that's know.

585
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:31,510
Yeah. So I have availability and if you haven't I do, I really would see probably between I got to like after two,

586
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:42,600
one, two, three or like 1030, 210, 30 days or anything.

587
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:50,920
I, I know. Okay. We're about to say Tuesday cause I'm in class or, or if we're driving.

588
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:53,950
Oh, okay. Well, that's when I'm meeting with someone.

589
01:05:54,490 --> 01:06:00,850
Yeah, I'm here Tuesday. It looks like I have to open day except for right after class.

590
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:05,400
So anything I read into class or what. What time works for you?

591
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:13,450
Um, why do I have my time between 131 and three on Tuesday?

592
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:19,570
Yeah. Who would do that? And we can totally presume and do want to say like 130.

593
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,650
Is that to do like 145.

594
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:27,510
Just give me 10 minutes for sure. Or we can do to, to work that up.

595
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:38,110
Okay. Let me put, um, do you want to send, to send a link and then we can zoom in and this is what I was talking about.

596
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:43,120
Oh, yeah. Let me see. It's so funny. I just love I to total the time.

597
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:46,720
I like to talk with all these people.

598
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:53,650
That's interesting. Would you send that to me? But yes, I can.

599
01:06:54,070 --> 01:07:02,270
But basically at the end she was saying, like, it's so funny that the person that the first interview now we're I think that's so fascinating.

600
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:06,880
Yeah. Yeah. If I can say, you know, um.

601
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:18,550
Okay. So.

602
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:33,360
That's right. And for an apprentice class.

603
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:38,180
Oh yeah, I know.

604
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:48,470
And all that. But I think I just.

605
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:56,880
You. And so terrible.

606
01:07:57,010 --> 01:08:09,780
And yeah, I mean, you just think. Yeah, I kind of had, like, the last few months of just kind of a few complications.

607
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:21,770
I started having seizures and. So finding a way to trying to take care of men's and.

608
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:31,560
How? Of course.

609
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:36,050
Of course. Think. Thanks for your.

610
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:53,560
Don't. Yeah.

611
01:08:53,590 --> 01:09:03,000
I mean, mean like everything. Like, I'm intending to live here, and it doesn't seem to care about the conventions.

612
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:17,620
Okay? How are you feeling?

613
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:21,060
Your social support this. Uh.

614
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:38,270
There is none. It's hard, but I know that they care.

615
01:09:46,830 --> 01:10:08,860
Do you think? Although day to day.

616
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:25,900
There. Instead of stuff that.

617
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:07,790
Are there. I think that.

618
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,630
How do you get a job when you are travel?

619
01:11:23,860 --> 01:12:09,910
We find now on the way. Per say.

620
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:55,040
As long as I can fun hear a lot of it like it is about her working with me.

621
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:59,150
As long as that works out. And I've never met the woman, so.

622
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:08,620
Yeah. Through the influence without class and.

623
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:16,230
That's that. But.

624
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:31,200
Would you like to recommend?

625
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:37,120
Each other before the semester began.

626
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:51,770
Is this situation. You will get 100% of what I have to give that I've never seen before.

627
01:13:51,770 --> 01:14:05,820
And again, it's like not. No one here 100% of what I have.

628
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:26,260
She and her. She's.

629
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:30,420
She's a vicious creature. She's not going to.

630
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:41,160
And everything is actually, you know, it's like, you know, you pretend it's about history and.

631
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:49,660
It physically could be. And this.

632
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:04,130
Like. Joining us from across the US.

633
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:17,860
As long as. He then?

634
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,920
Oh, yeah, I think so. We just. Yeah, we just proved that.

635
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:43,639
Um, yeah, that would self-deception. No, I have no idea.

636
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:50,910
But like. Is that?

637
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:55,780
Certainly. It's just less about. Drop it.

638
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:16,210
You know, just sort of say that. This is what I'm doing. Time for consumption that should already be ready for any public benefits.

639
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:27,070
Jay Carney. These are just.

640
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:37,390
The transcript just. You know, to be virtually.

641
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:41,310
I'd like to go over everything and make sure that.

642
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:51,020
That really helping to the credit hours that semester. Between those two classes.

643
01:16:51,290 --> 01:16:54,360
I found that. What do you think? I just.

644
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:58,930
I just need three more hours. Today.

645
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:28,310
Not so fast. Which is pretty.

646
01:17:52,440 --> 01:18:10,000
I mean. I mean everyone. This. On Sunday there.

647
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:26,490
I mean, it was open for probably ten days.

648
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:57,480
I. You that again.

649
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:04,620
That that. It just makes me feel.
