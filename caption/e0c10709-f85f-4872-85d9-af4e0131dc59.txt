1
00:00:00,564 --> 00:00:11,004
So, you know, like one of the first questions that, you know, I was going to use as, you know,

2
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:19,014
to kind of prompt people a little bit is is this question of why do we use peer assessment?

3
00:00:19,314 --> 00:00:28,374
Mm hmm. And I think a lot of faculty tend to use peer assessments because they're trying to offload grading onto someone else.

4
00:00:31,224 --> 00:00:37,013
I mean, none of us enjoy grading. It's a big you know, it takes a lot of time.

5
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:48,114
It takes a lot of energy. And I think often faculty, you know, use peer reviews as a way to help with that particular that.

6
00:00:49,224 --> 00:00:54,444
But there are many other reasons to use peer reviews, assessments.

7
00:00:55,374 --> 00:01:00,353
And this is this is just a, you know, a sample of reasons.

8
00:01:00,354 --> 00:01:08,454
It's it's not exhaustive, but it's a it's a really good way to, you know, help students solidify their own learning.

9
00:01:08,724 --> 00:01:21,984
Right. And and, you know, so solidify their understanding of the course material, but also learn discipline thinks, right?

10
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:25,854
Yeah. Yeah. And how they should go about doing certain things.

11
00:01:26,484 --> 00:01:32,244
It can be a good motivation for them to engage a little bit more deeply than they usually do.

12
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:38,004
It's a it's a good way to help them develop some critical thinking skills.

13
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:52,224
And because, you know, you're asking them to assess other people's work in the process, they also build their metacognitive metacognitive skills,

14
00:01:52,464 --> 00:02:02,994
their ability to think about their own thinking as they're thinking quickly and therefore hopefully ultimately improve their own work.

15
00:02:04,464 --> 00:02:11,724
It's it's a good way to empower them to take a little bit more responsibility for their own learning than maybe they do when,

16
00:02:12,324 --> 00:02:14,724
you know, with traditional assessments.

17
00:02:15,224 --> 00:02:24,203
Yeah, I think it's a it's a good opportunity to help them develop skills that they will need to use as professionals.

18
00:02:24,204 --> 00:02:36,863
Right. So that the give and receive feedback is something that in the professional world, I mean, you know, we all go through annual evaluations.

19
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:49,374
We, you know, when we collaborate with other people, there's, there's this need to provide feedback to others in academia.

20
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:53,754
It's a it's a big part of what we do, but, you know, in other fields as well.

21
00:02:54,024 --> 00:03:00,114
So there's there's a lot of different reasons why peer assessment is very beneficial.

22
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:08,364
And as you might see from the, you know, what's on the slide here, it's, you know,

23
00:03:08,364 --> 00:03:17,664
part of the the benefits that humans derive from this form of assessment is because it's more student centered,

24
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:23,993
it's more learning centered than the traditional assessment or feedback model.

25
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:27,383
So, you know, with peer assessments, it's more learning centered.

26
00:03:27,384 --> 00:03:32,004
It's more about what the students do. It's more about the process.

27
00:03:33,144 --> 00:03:40,703
It it means that they have to be actively engaged in in all aspects of the feedback process and,

28
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:46,763
you know, seeking, processing and then acting ideally upon the feedback.

29
00:03:46,764 --> 00:03:56,004
So there's there's a, a certain focus on sort of like future improvements that you don't necessarily have in traditional assignments where,

30
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:58,734
you know, it tends to be more sort of like end loaded.

31
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:12,704
And there's not necessarily an opportunity for students to take feedback that the faculty gave them and use it in in another assignment.

32
00:04:12,714 --> 00:04:18,924
Right. So and I'm not saying that, you know, traditional feedback cannot do some of this.

33
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:24,773
Right. But but the tendency is, you know, for traditional feedback to be more teacher centric.

34
00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:29,724
So I'm giving information to my students.

35
00:04:29,724 --> 00:04:33,964
It's something that I provide. They passively receive this information.

36
00:04:35,304 --> 00:04:40,043
You know, it means that, you know, they don't necessarily feel the responsibility to do anything with it.

37
00:04:40,044 --> 00:04:47,774
So maybe they do. Maybe they don't, you know, use that feedback in future assignments or.

38
00:04:47,864 --> 00:04:52,574
Another class. And like I said, it often comes at someone.

39
00:04:52,934 --> 00:05:01,604
It's often more summative, it often comes more toward the end when they don't necessarily have a chance to implement the feedback that we give them.

40
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:13,183
So, you know, the the purpose here is to kind of give some broad, you know,

41
00:05:13,184 --> 00:05:19,664
some explain some of the principles and the design principles to design good peer review activities

42
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:26,704
and then to figure out what tool might be best suited to achieve those those objectives.

43
00:05:26,714 --> 00:05:29,084
Because depending on, you know,

44
00:05:29,084 --> 00:05:37,454
there's there's a million ways of doing peer reviews and not every tool is going to be the right tool for what you want to do.

45
00:05:39,314 --> 00:05:48,854
The great thing is that we have a number of tools and, you know, so we can often find the right tool for what we want to do.

46
00:05:52,954 --> 00:06:06,693
So the is anything in, you know, in teaching or basically anything we do, it starts with a very intentional conscious design, right?

47
00:06:06,694 --> 00:06:15,214
So, you know, I feel like often the, you know, the peer review piece comes as sort of like this added layer.

48
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:17,613
So, you know, I'm teaching this in my course.

49
00:06:17,614 --> 00:06:25,744
There's a, you know, there's an assignment and oh, wouldn't it be nice if I just made that a peer review assignment?

50
00:06:26,824 --> 00:06:33,363
But really, what we should be doing is, is think about how you know what we are aiming to teach,

51
00:06:33,364 --> 00:06:43,054
what we want the students to learn to be able to do by the end of the course and how to best accomplish that goal in sometimes,

52
00:06:43,414 --> 00:06:52,144
you know, peer reviews can feed right into, you know, the course goals, the what we're trying to accomplish in in the course.

53
00:06:53,374 --> 00:07:04,023
So it helps support the course goals. And at the same time we can help them build a feedback literacy, which is something that, again, you know,

54
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:13,054
can serve them, you know, in their whether they're in school and then outside of school as well.

55
00:07:13,054 --> 00:07:18,513
So there's, you know, everything should always start from, you know, what am I trying to accomplish here?

56
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:22,174
What, you know, what are my goals in this class or in this unit?

57
00:07:24,264 --> 00:07:32,424
And you know, how might peer feedback help to support those goals?

58
00:07:33,474 --> 00:07:37,824
Where could the students use some help?

59
00:07:38,454 --> 00:07:46,944
Right. So where can I leverage this tool both to achieve the goal and to help, you know, to help the students?

60
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:50,454
So these should be the questions we start with.

61
00:07:50,484 --> 00:07:57,984
So in your you know, in the scenario that you were talking about of public health.

62
00:07:57,984 --> 00:08:09,344
Six 8681 you know, like we would need to think about not just, oh, it would be nice if they, you know, but how can that actually help, Don?

63
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:20,184
Right. Can can that help fulfill some of the some of the learning objectives or give them better, you know,

64
00:08:20,574 --> 00:08:29,874
better tools to do you know, to work on their own products in turn in something that would be a better quality.

65
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:33,654
You know, by the end of the year, by the end of the class.

66
00:08:35,694 --> 00:08:44,244
And I think in the online program, because, you know, so the challenges, there's a wide variety of products that the students are working on.

67
00:08:44,634 --> 00:08:50,484
But the the strength of the online program is the the student population where, you know,

68
00:08:50,484 --> 00:09:01,043
these working professionals bring a lot of, you know, their own, you know, expertise and experience to the table.

69
00:09:01,044 --> 00:09:11,874
And I think could that could potentially really enrich the feedback, you know, the feedback experience or the feedback process.

70
00:09:14,184 --> 00:09:23,424
The you know, this this gets into what I was describing earlier in terms of these loops and spirals, which is that,

71
00:09:24,174 --> 00:09:33,274
you know, we often when we do peer reviews, we we often assume that, you know, people know how to do this, right.

72
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:42,654
You know, I'm just going to say, you know, read doesn't give them feedback, but, you know, a feedback loop receives like any other kind of literacy.

73
00:09:42,654 --> 00:09:53,304
It needs to be taught, it needs to be practiced. And the more you give people opportunities to practice, the better they're going to get at it.

74
00:09:54,984 --> 00:09:59,754
And so it's not always applicable to every course.

75
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:04,944
But, you know, when we consider including some peer review or, you know,

76
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:14,254
some feedback assignments in the class, also thinking about, you know, is this a one time thing?

77
00:10:14,294 --> 00:10:24,174
Could this be a, you know, a repeated process that would give them a chance to to build their skills, to develop them?

78
00:10:25,134 --> 00:10:34,524
And you know what what kind of look can we build in that, you know, in that course?

79
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:38,513
So I'm not going to get into, you know, a lot of details.

80
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:44,934
But traditionally, it's it's a it's one loop, right?

81
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:57,293
It's a single loop process which may or may not be completed in the sense that, you know, there's you know,

82
00:10:57,294 --> 00:11:08,634
we don't always sort of complete that loop even in a sort of like the most straightforward application of peer review.

83
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:18,684
We very rarely have a second loop where the, you know, feedback is given to the person who gave feedback.

84
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:29,574
Right. So you get to learn about how good your feedback is and where you might be able to improve.

85
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:34,074
Right. So that's what I mean by like, you know, these loops.

86
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:38,484
And then there's this idea of the, you know, the spiral where, you know,

87
00:11:38,484 --> 00:11:48,174
you have the loops and they keep on building because you provide repeated opportunities to, you know,

88
00:11:48,394 --> 00:11:55,404
to build those skills and apply them again and, you know, incorporate the feedback, apply,

89
00:11:55,404 --> 00:12:02,603
incorporate, apply both in terms of sort of the, the products that the students create.

90
00:12:02,604 --> 00:12:12,654
But also, you know, that spiral also applies to, you know, the quality of the feedback I'm giving every time.

91
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:14,874
And I'm giving you feedback.

92
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:28,474
So, you know, this is a related point about the fact that this is, you know, something that happens over time and the more opportunities, the better.

93
00:12:29,224 --> 00:12:38,674
It also is getting at the fact that, you know, we need to help the students, you know, build toward the this feedback literacy.

94
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:45,024
And there are a couple of things that we that are pretty important to do in that regard.

95
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:50,234
And this one is really hard for faculty and it's, you know,

96
00:12:50,284 --> 00:12:54,874
providing really good rubrics so that the students actually understand what they need to assess,

97
00:12:55,474 --> 00:13:02,494
because we tend to look at an assignment and sort of know what we're looking for.

98
00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:08,494
Right. But a student may not have any good sense of what they're supposed to assess.

99
00:13:08,494 --> 00:13:15,633
Right. So they may focus on things that are more, you know, sort of like lower order thinking skills.

100
00:13:15,634 --> 00:13:25,624
Right. And maybe I'm supposed to be checking, you know, grammar or something like this as opposed to evaluating, I don't know,

101
00:13:25,684 --> 00:13:36,604
like the strength of an argument or, you know, what people are doing, you know, whatever else people might be doing in there.

102
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:42,363
So this is why you were saying that this might be challenging, particularly for 686, 81,

103
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:48,424
because it wouldn't be really one rubric like this because they're all doing such different projects.

104
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:50,523
Right. Or it could be one rubric,

105
00:13:50,524 --> 00:13:58,144
but it would take some work to try and figure out how to write that rubric so that it could be applicable to different contexts.

106
00:13:58,654 --> 00:14:12,874
Right. And, you know, there might be a need to, um, you know, so, so you can have a rubric, but you could also have guidelines.

107
00:14:12,994 --> 00:14:16,323
Right. So here is like a general rubric.

108
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:22,713
If the product is in this category, this is sort of, you know, how you might apply the rubric.

109
00:14:22,714 --> 00:14:27,664
If it, you know, falls in a different category, then, you know, maybe you would apply,

110
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:36,154
you know, this is how you would interpret the criteria in in the rubric, for example.

111
00:14:36,154 --> 00:14:42,843
So but yes, that's, you know, that's definitely what would be a little bit challenging.

112
00:14:42,844 --> 00:14:50,854
And six 8681 because of the the wide range of products that the students are working on, which, you know,

113
00:14:50,884 --> 00:14:58,564
also is really neat but would make this particular piece, I think it would take a little bit of.

114
00:14:58,894 --> 00:15:02,164
Yeah, a little more challenging. Yeah.

115
00:15:02,254 --> 00:15:09,564
Yeah. But some, you know, some pieces would probably apply no matter what.

116
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:15,064
Right. So the, you know, sort of like something along the lines of, you know, grammar, spelling.

117
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:20,494
You sort of like the, you know, certain quality of of the work.

118
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:29,104
And it doesn't matter if you're doing a I don't know if you're writing a policy brief or if you're doing an infographic like you still need to,

119
00:15:29,884 --> 00:15:38,044
you know, have that kind of like visually appealing or easy to read.

120
00:15:38,324 --> 00:15:39,724
Yeah, whatever. Yeah.

121
00:15:40,984 --> 00:15:51,714
So, but this is a, this is also a really good exercise for faculty to do right through, to really think about, you know, what is that I'm,

122
00:15:52,174 --> 00:16:03,873
you know, that I'm looking for when I read submissions and you know, what, what categories of criteria might that fall under?

123
00:16:03,874 --> 00:16:11,244
And, you know, how do I. Yeah.

124
00:16:11,594 --> 00:16:18,984
How do I go about assessing? Because, you know, as faculty, we sort of feel like, well, I know what's good when I see it, right?

125
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:27,624
Yeah. Yeah. So but that's not necessarily very helpful to the students even when we're writing an assignment.

126
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:36,414
Right. So there's a way in which when you go through this process because you you want the students to go through a peer reviews,

127
00:16:37,524 --> 00:16:45,234
it might force you as an instructor to to go back and design the assignment a little bit better.

128
00:16:45,264 --> 00:16:45,664
Right.

129
00:16:45,664 --> 00:16:57,324
So right at the end of the day, it might be a very beneficial process to go through to really think about what makes this a good, helpful review.

130
00:16:58,014 --> 00:17:01,434
Yeah. And what are we looking for from these assignments?

131
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:09,263
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't touch on this in this particular presentation, but, you know,

132
00:17:09,264 --> 00:17:21,474
applying a transparent assignment framework to things, you know, I think would be very beneficial in this context as well,

133
00:17:21,504 --> 00:17:26,934
because it helps to really draw out, you know, what,

134
00:17:27,564 --> 00:17:34,944
what you're supposed to do in this assignment and how you will know whether or not you've done what you're supposed to do.

135
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:40,794
Right. And there's just not it's not real clear, I feel like right now.

136
00:17:41,154 --> 00:17:53,154
Yeah. Yeah. And that's not unusual at all. I mean, the vast majority of the assignments that we write as instructors are actually not all that clear.

137
00:17:53,454 --> 00:17:57,164
Mm hmm. And that's why, you know, it's very frustrating when you teach because, you know,

138
00:17:57,174 --> 00:18:01,944
sometimes you get submissions and you're like, how could you have misunderstood?

139
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:04,554
Right. Right.

140
00:18:05,034 --> 00:18:12,684
But it's it's usually because the you know, it might have been clear to us, but it wasn't clear to the students what they were supposed to do.

141
00:18:13,404 --> 00:18:18,863
So the you know, the rubric can help them figure out when they're doing peer reviews,

142
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:23,694
what they need to focus on in the in the submissions, what they need to assess.

143
00:18:24,054 --> 00:18:29,664
But we also need to help them understand how they're supposed to be providing the feedback, right?

144
00:18:29,664 --> 00:18:36,464
So not just, you know, I'm giving you a 12 out of 15 on this particular criteria.

145
00:18:36,744 --> 00:18:44,074
Criteria and in the in the rubric. But can I help you take the 12 and make it a 15?

146
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:55,494
Right. Because the, you know, sort of like a purely quantitative assessment isn't necessarily all that helpful.

147
00:18:55,854 --> 00:19:05,784
And true feedback would help, you know, the person being assessed to see what they need to do in order to improve their submission.

148
00:19:05,794 --> 00:19:14,304
Right. So there are many different models that, you know, you could teach students or you could provide as as guidelines.

149
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:19,904
But the the point I'm trying to make here is that, you know, it's not just about teaching them what they need to assess.

150
00:19:19,914 --> 00:19:26,934
It's also about teaching them how they need to assess and what makes for a good feedback.

151
00:19:27,804 --> 00:19:33,654
And this is probably where the sort of like building professional skills, the things that are,

152
00:19:34,014 --> 00:19:40,194
you know, skills that are transferable from, you know, from the classroom to the workplace.

153
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:45,384
It probably falls more in this category than in the rubric category.

154
00:19:46,274 --> 00:19:52,524
Yeah. Because, you know, in the work place, you need to do things in such a way that, you know,

155
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:58,284
you're not going to ruin relationships by, you know, being brutally honest about things.

156
00:19:58,284 --> 00:20:03,864
And yeah, yeah. Make sure that people are still going to want to work with you.

157
00:20:04,414 --> 00:20:07,584
Right. You know, you're done with.

158
00:20:10,054 --> 00:20:16,594
There were. So, you know, I provided this spark model, but like, you know,

159
00:20:17,374 --> 00:20:23,763
there are many sort of like smart goals and, you know, there's several different models.

160
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:34,084
But this could be a way to help the students to see what they need to do in terms of writing feedback for their peers.

161
00:20:34,384 --> 00:20:45,184
Mm hmm. So, like I was saying, you know, as much as possible, we should try to think not just for peer reviews, but, generally speaking,

162
00:20:46,384 --> 00:20:59,794
how to teach in a way that's authentic and that will actually, you know, transfer to whatever career, you know, there they're moving into.

163
00:21:00,664 --> 00:21:05,844
So they, you know, thinking about how like in your case, for example,

164
00:21:05,854 --> 00:21:12,844
how do epidemiology like what what does feedback look like, you know, for epidemiologists and how might that be different?

165
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:18,724
You know, for epidemiologists and I don't know if I was statisticians or,

166
00:21:18,934 --> 00:21:27,184
you know, somebody who's like, you know, nutrition, you know, a diet session.

167
00:21:27,904 --> 00:21:38,704
Right. Because we we're so steeped in our disciplines that we don't necessarily realize that maybe have a very specific way of doing things.

168
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:48,514
And if we're training people who are going to go into that field, then part of our job is also to teach them how to build operates.

169
00:21:49,834 --> 00:21:53,703
So. In peer reviews.

170
00:21:53,704 --> 00:21:58,894
This is just another area where we can be doing that work.

171
00:21:59,374 --> 00:22:12,594
Mm hmm. So. I don't know if you have any questions about, you know, what I what I just anyway, I went over pretty quickly, you know?

172
00:22:12,604 --> 00:22:17,004
No, because I mean, I'm already sold on the importance of peer review.

173
00:22:17,364 --> 00:22:28,554
Yeah. So the, the next step then is to figure out how you might implement that in a class.

174
00:22:29,034 --> 00:22:37,344
And it starts by looking at, you know, the learning ecosystem, which isn't, you know, so pedagogy is part of it,

175
00:22:38,514 --> 00:22:46,614
you know, and and, you know, some of what I was describing is, is that, you know, those pedagogical considerations.

176
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:53,963
But then there's all this stuff that's on the left hand side of the slide that we also need to think about.

177
00:22:53,964 --> 00:23:03,204
So, you know, does the the modality of the cause, does that make a difference in what I do, how I do it?

178
00:23:03,864 --> 00:23:09,594
You know, does it shape how peer reviews are implemented in the class?

179
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:15,264
Do I want the students to do this synchronously? Right.

180
00:23:15,304 --> 00:23:22,443
Is this a sort of in class, whether that's, you know, face to face or in a zoom in a zoom session?

181
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:29,734
Right. I break people into breakout rooms and, you know, there's some kind of a peer review process that's happening there.

182
00:23:30,064 --> 00:23:35,074
Or do I want things to be more asynchronous, more formalized?

183
00:23:36,094 --> 00:23:39,434
Yeah. I mean, right now we've been doing it in breakout rooms. Right?

184
00:23:39,464 --> 00:23:44,764
Right. With people that have kind of similar project areas.

185
00:23:46,524 --> 00:23:52,374
Have been doing peer review that way in a very not formal way.

186
00:23:52,374 --> 00:24:06,654
And that makes me think also that probably many of them don't really know what they should be doing in terms of reviewing other people's work.

187
00:24:06,834 --> 00:24:10,974
But I know that they are, but a lot of them got, you know,

188
00:24:11,064 --> 00:24:18,744
really helpful feedback from someone like for students that are doing projects with CBC and they have all the clearance issues.

189
00:24:19,194 --> 00:24:22,704
So we're able to help each other navigate that.

190
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:26,984
Which ended up being really helpful for them.

191
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:37,194
But I kind of. I don't think we took into account as much that not everybody has done sort of of type.

192
00:24:38,054 --> 00:24:43,754
But this is where like thinking about the the goals of these conversations.

193
00:24:43,764 --> 00:24:52,424
So is the goal to help them help each other, you know, navigate some kind of obstacle?

194
00:24:52,424 --> 00:25:01,603
Is the goal to have them start to give feedback on the actual product they're working on, you know,

195
00:25:01,604 --> 00:25:08,834
because you might do different things depending on what you know, what the, you know, what the goal is.

196
00:25:10,214 --> 00:25:20,683
And, and this could evolve as they, you know, over the course of the term and maybe, you know, you provide more structure as the, you know,

197
00:25:20,684 --> 00:25:24,164
as time goes on where, you know, initially it's just, you know,

198
00:25:24,164 --> 00:25:31,034
sort of like when you're when you're having a scaffolded paper ride where the mission may be.

199
00:25:31,194 --> 00:25:35,204
Here's here's my topic. Mm hmm. Generally speaking.

200
00:25:35,204 --> 00:25:42,524
And then, you know, as the the paper builds, then then, you know, the.

201
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:47,934
The review gets more and more specific.

202
00:25:48,384 --> 00:25:56,634
So there's no you know, obviously there's no one size fits all for for this type of stuff.

203
00:25:56,634 --> 00:26:01,613
But this is where, you know, when you think about, you know,

204
00:26:01,614 --> 00:26:06,954
what's happening in these breakouts, you know, could there be more structure or could there be,

205
00:26:07,164 --> 00:26:16,554
you know, is there something specific that the students should be getting out of, you know, those conversations or interactions?

206
00:26:18,084 --> 00:26:24,383
The the type of assignment also is something to, you know,

207
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:32,484
so here I'm not necessarily thinking about sort of like the range of products that, you know, your students are working on.

208
00:26:32,484 --> 00:26:41,183
But, you know, in some classes, it's a, you know, a presentation of some sort,

209
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:47,244
whether it's like recorded video or class presentation in other classes,

210
00:26:47,244 --> 00:26:55,224
it's more of a, you know, so I implemented a critique of peer review tool in public health target in the online world.

211
00:26:55,674 --> 00:26:59,033
That's a much more sort of like traditional paper assignment.

212
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:08,774
It was scaffolded. But the, you know, so the, the assignment type with the submission type might also dictate how you handle the,

213
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:13,733
the peer review, the class size, who your learners are.

214
00:27:13,734 --> 00:27:20,754
I mean, you may go about doing peer reviews differently depending on, you know, whether you have undergrads or, you know,

215
00:27:20,844 --> 00:27:33,504
people like you have in the online program classes that are more mature, more working professionals, considerations of equity and inclusion.

216
00:27:33,684 --> 00:27:45,324
Right. Can can everybody participate? Can, you know, is there anything that you need to be mindful of, you know, in terms of equity and inclusion,

217
00:27:45,324 --> 00:27:53,994
things that could go sideways a little bit if they're not properly, you know, set up?

218
00:27:54,684 --> 00:28:00,593
Do you want things to be anonymous or not? Right. So like when they're when they're reviewing each other in in breakouts, obviously,

219
00:28:00,594 --> 00:28:07,404
it's it's not anonymous and maybe it's it's not just fine, but beneficial.

220
00:28:08,624 --> 00:28:16,054
So as you might want that process to be anonymous, in which case then that, you know,

221
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:24,444
helps to steer towards certain tools as opposed to as opposed to others grading preference.

222
00:28:25,014 --> 00:28:32,534
What I'm getting at here is, you know, do you just want the submissions to be assessed?

223
00:28:32,534 --> 00:28:41,274
Do you want the the people doing the reviews to get a grade for, you know, giving peer feedback?

224
00:28:42,174 --> 00:28:48,833
Because depending on sort of like what the goal is here, again, some tools accommodate this and not that.

225
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:53,903
So, you know, those are all things to to think about.

226
00:28:53,904 --> 00:29:01,584
Is it something that you want to be sort of like automatically integrated into your learning management system,

227
00:29:01,584 --> 00:29:07,644
whether it's Canvas or Coursera, because, you know, all tools will well do that.

228
00:29:08,604 --> 00:29:17,904
So, you know, once you've sort of figured out, you know, the pedagogy and the, you know, the pedagogical reasons for doing peer reviews,

229
00:29:18,204 --> 00:29:26,424
then there's there's still a bunch of questions to to run through in order to figure out what will be the right tool for that pedagogy.

230
00:29:29,544 --> 00:29:38,904
So oops. So just broadly speaking, and I'm not going to sort of like give demos of these tools.

231
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:42,594
It's more of a kind of like a kind of step of peer review.

232
00:29:44,094 --> 00:29:49,734
And it's not exhaustive either, but generally speaking, they kind of fall into two categories.

233
00:29:49,774 --> 00:29:54,234
So tools that were specifically designed to do peer reviews.

234
00:29:55,274 --> 00:30:05,864
Okay. Right. So both candidates and Coursera have peer review functionality and then you have tools like critique,

235
00:30:07,274 --> 00:30:12,104
which I will talk about a little bit and then use perusal and.

236
00:30:12,824 --> 00:30:18,734
No, no, I have never used it. Okay. So I'll talk a little bit about, about these two tools.

237
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:29,893
But, you know, for for tools like those, there's specific functionality for peer reviews, you know, elements, integration.

238
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:36,914
And you can anonymize, you can, you know, there are things that are specifically designed for peer reviews.

239
00:30:37,664 --> 00:30:49,514
They all approach things slightly differently or the functionality is, you know, better or worse, depending on the depending on the tool.

240
00:30:50,234 --> 00:30:55,184
For example, don't use the native Coursera peer review functionality because it's terrible.

241
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:59,053
Okay. Right. But I didn't even know that they had it.

242
00:30:59,054 --> 00:31:05,683
But okay, I know it's it exists. We just don't you know, we we go a different route when people want to do reviews.

243
00:31:05,684 --> 00:31:12,824
And of course, there are just because the, you know, the native functionality is is not great.

244
00:31:13,274 --> 00:31:20,804
Yeah. Yeah. You know, canvas has functionality, it's somewhat limited limiting,

245
00:31:21,674 --> 00:31:30,694
which is why we started using platforms like critic and perusal, which allows you to do things that canvas doesn't do.

246
00:31:30,704 --> 00:31:41,234
But but canvas as if all you're looking for is sort of a basic, you know, a peer reviews, people submit, you know, they get reviewed.

247
00:31:41,894 --> 00:31:48,433
Canvas will do that just fine. So there's there's tools that are specifically designed for peer review.

248
00:31:48,434 --> 00:31:54,674
And then there are tools that are not necessarily designed for peer review but can do peer reviews.

249
00:31:55,004 --> 00:32:00,684
Okay. So if you do video assignments, for example, Flip Grant might be a great tool.

250
00:32:00,704 --> 00:32:08,593
I mean, it's a it's a if it's designed for like elementary school kids or something.

251
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:13,904
So. Okay. It's it's nearly foolproof in terms of, you know, there's one button that does record.

252
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:19,334
You know, there's there's very little or a user error.

253
00:32:20,024 --> 00:32:35,924
Mm hmm. And it makes it a you know, it's a it's a a simple platform that could easily allow you to watch a bunch of screen presentations, for example.

254
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:43,544
Yeah. Now, because it wasn't necessarily designed to be a peer review platform, there's a bunch of stuff that,

255
00:32:44,144 --> 00:32:49,603
you know you will have, like an elemis integration and the ability to input scores.

256
00:32:49,604 --> 00:32:57,014
Like people can put comments, but if you wanted them to use a rubric, for example, that that wouldn't work.

257
00:32:57,314 --> 00:33:04,604
Right. So what I mean by, you know, depending on what your answer is to all the questions, you know, all the.

258
00:33:06,214 --> 00:33:14,224
You know, on all the variables I was, you know, I listed on the previous slides, then this could be just fine.

259
00:33:15,254 --> 00:33:19,544
Or severely lacking in the functionality that you're looking for.

260
00:33:21,854 --> 00:33:29,624
Similarly Yellow Digg. I don't know if you've come across this tool, but it's more of a discussion forum platform.

261
00:33:31,064 --> 00:33:39,734
But you could use it to because the students can post, you know, a variety of you know,

262
00:33:39,734 --> 00:33:44,084
they can do files, they can do they post, they can do videos, they can do.

263
00:33:44,684 --> 00:33:50,384
You know, this is potentially something that could be used as a platform for peer reviews.

264
00:33:51,794 --> 00:33:56,114
The you know, there wouldn't necessarily be anonymity.

265
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:02,174
And so that's something to think about. But you could also use it as.

266
00:34:07,724 --> 00:34:14,324
It's almost a way to bring even more transparency to the process.

267
00:34:14,324 --> 00:34:25,244
Right. And have the students be exposed to a lot of different presentations or violence.

268
00:34:25,694 --> 00:34:35,864
So we've used Gallaudet, for example, for poster sessions where people post, you know, a file of their poster.

269
00:34:35,864 --> 00:34:48,524
They do a quick one minute video spiel about their their poster, and there can be interaction with the audience about that presentation.

270
00:34:49,874 --> 00:34:55,424
So again, you know, a platform that wasn't necessarily designed for peer reviews,

271
00:34:55,424 --> 00:35:02,744
but that could be used for peer reviews and and even work quite well.

272
00:35:03,044 --> 00:35:08,834
And then obviously there's like the whole, you know, Google suite of things, which, you know, for Google Docs.

273
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:14,803
I mean, we we always we use that every day, right, as a migration tool.

274
00:35:14,804 --> 00:35:27,013
And, you know, so, again, you know, another way to potentially do peer reviews of Google Slides or, you know, people would be submitting.

275
00:35:27,014 --> 00:35:34,484
But and so, you know, this could this could work just fine depending on on what you're doing.

276
00:35:35,504 --> 00:35:39,164
The level of anonymity. But obviously if you wanted.

277
00:35:41,804 --> 00:35:49,394
For example, Gore is right to feed automatically into a grade book.

278
00:35:49,634 --> 00:35:53,424
Mm hmm. None of these tools would do that.

279
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:54,964
Right. I don't think that that's.

280
00:35:54,974 --> 00:36:07,264
Yeah, something that we would need at all, because they're not it's pass fail, cause they're not graded on how well they review other people's stuff.

281
00:36:07,274 --> 00:36:14,284
It's just more of them helping each other see what each other is doing, you know,

282
00:36:14,294 --> 00:36:25,394
getting ideas of different like a lot of students were using Canva to make fact sheets and stuff and just kind of learning stuff like that for me.

283
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:31,363
Yeah. And yeah, you know, like, oh, you this you could probably do this more easily.

284
00:36:31,364 --> 00:36:35,244
And this software would probably look more professional if you did it this way.

285
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:38,624
Uh huh. You know, a lot of that type of feedback.

286
00:36:39,884 --> 00:36:44,684
Yeah. No, please don't use neon pink. Right, right, right.

287
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:50,854
Yes, exactly. Yeah. No, it's, you know, but that's also something to think about.

288
00:36:50,864 --> 00:36:55,094
Right? Would it be helpful for them to be able to annotate a submission?

289
00:36:56,024 --> 00:37:04,094
Mm hmm. Right. Instead of just describing, you know, like, you know, that place where you had the whatever word for it,

290
00:37:04,144 --> 00:37:09,544
like, would it be helpful for them to have an option to to be like, this is what I'm talking about?

291
00:37:10,024 --> 00:37:13,504
Yeah. And like, would that be like in in real time?

292
00:37:13,504 --> 00:37:17,883
Like, you're showing me your work and I'm drawing on your screen like.

293
00:37:17,884 --> 00:37:21,634
No, Fredric, I'm talking about this sentence right here. Really awkward or whatever.

294
00:37:21,814 --> 00:37:26,584
Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, all things to kind of think about.

295
00:37:26,584 --> 00:37:35,254
And and then you're like, oh, right. Well, you know, based on based on all of this, this is the tool that might that might work best.

296
00:37:37,444 --> 00:37:50,544
So I'm just going to I don't know if it doesn't sound like the native L.A. functionality is necessarily what you're looking for.

297
00:37:50,554 --> 00:37:59,074
So let's let's maybe talk about some of the other ones.

298
00:38:00,004 --> 00:38:05,554
So perusal is a social annotation tool.

299
00:38:06,064 --> 00:38:19,834
Okay? So you can upload readings, you can upload videos and have the students highlight, leave comments, questions, interact with each other.

300
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:24,303
Right? So maybe I'm like, I can see this for 512 being right.

301
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:28,744
Right. So, you know, maybe I'm like, Hey, I really don't understand the sentence.

302
00:38:28,744 --> 00:38:32,254
And maybe you come in and you're like, Oh, this is what it means, right? Yeah.

303
00:38:32,584 --> 00:38:36,963
So this is so how do I check out these different softwares?

304
00:38:36,964 --> 00:38:42,424
Like if I want to click through. Yeah, we can actually.

305
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:56,554
There's a if you go to the Brazilian teaching canvas site, you will be able to because I think, oh, I see.

306
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:06,304
Cool. Yeah. So it makes you at least it makes you log in, but you can, you know,

307
00:39:06,304 --> 00:39:14,794
you can check it out that I think it's it's grabbing my thing from Coursera but anyway.

308
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:20,164
So it would actually let me let me do it a different way.

309
00:39:23,004 --> 00:39:30,744
So we used it in five week, for example, and, you know, we could give you access to any of any of those courses.

310
00:39:32,724 --> 00:39:45,894
And, you know, as the instructor, you have sort of like a recap of, you know, the kinds of comments the students loved.

311
00:39:48,114 --> 00:39:54,444
I think there's yeah, there's a confusion report that will show you sort of I think it's grabbing,

312
00:39:55,044 --> 00:40:02,814
you know, questions or somehow doing some, you know, language analysis to see.

313
00:40:03,504 --> 00:40:15,984
So anyway, so, you know, this could be very helpful if you're in preparation for exams and also you've assigned some

314
00:40:16,344 --> 00:40:23,634
perusal readings sample and you want to see what kinds of comments the students loved or,

315
00:40:23,724 --> 00:40:34,524
you know, questions so you can build your class session around those like, you know, that can that can work really well.

316
00:40:34,854 --> 00:40:37,974
But it also has the ability to do peer reviews, right?

317
00:40:37,974 --> 00:40:42,714
So the student so this these are just, you know, assigned readings, right?

318
00:40:43,134 --> 00:40:48,113
But, you know, we could also set it up so the students can upload their submissions.

319
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:53,384
And there, you know, that another people can annotate and comment on that.

320
00:40:53,424 --> 00:41:01,043
Yeah. Yeah. So you know that, you know, and there is element integration.

321
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:11,123
There is you know there's so and knows I mean sure how this works for peer reviews but it doesn't sound like you

322
00:41:11,124 --> 00:41:24,924
would be interested in this but the here you can set up and you know how you want the algorithm to assign scores.

323
00:41:25,404 --> 00:41:30,564
Oh okay. So you could, you know, so and all of this is customizable.

324
00:41:31,554 --> 00:41:37,584
So if you want to sort of like really emphasize, you know, I want you to provide substantive comments.

325
00:41:37,584 --> 00:41:48,534
You know, you might bump this dry, you know, if avoiding is not necessarily the thing you want to, you know, again, yeah, you want to take this down.

326
00:41:50,124 --> 00:41:56,874
So and you know, just so you know, it's nothing to do with peer reviews, but you can also have quizzes, okay?

327
00:41:57,274 --> 00:42:01,704
Info on the material or whatever. Like I was just doing a paper like this example.

328
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:06,504
Well, so for example, in 512, let's say you assign a chapter in the text.

329
00:42:08,724 --> 00:42:17,604
And you know, you want to provide some, some quiz questions so the students can only self-assess,

330
00:42:19,314 --> 00:42:24,383
you know, and they can be worth very few points, you know, or the other, you know.

331
00:42:24,384 --> 00:42:30,444
So but anyway, that's that's generally speaking, how Coursera works.

332
00:42:30,864 --> 00:42:34,404
Mm hmm. Oh, I'm sorry. Not Coursera perusal. Mm hmm.

333
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:44,694
And if you're interested in if you can't get into or you should be able to from the teaching canvas site, we can add you to some,

334
00:42:45,624 --> 00:42:53,424
you know, perusal courses and you can sort of like, you know, click around and see how that how that works.

335
00:42:59,524 --> 00:43:07,484
So if I log into canvas, will this resilient teaching site be available like in my courses, or how do I find that option?

336
00:43:07,924 --> 00:43:12,424
I'll send you a I'll send you a link. It's it's public.

337
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:16,774
So, you know, it's not behind. You don't have to be added to it.

338
00:43:17,464 --> 00:43:29,614
But I'll send you a quick link. I have the direct link to it, so I'm not going to go through this in perusal, but just know that,

339
00:43:29,824 --> 00:43:38,463
you know, just like you can upload readings or web pages or videos, you know, you could.

340
00:43:38,464 --> 00:43:44,014
So, I mean, maybe that could be a good option for six 8681.

341
00:43:45,884 --> 00:43:57,014
I don't know. This critic platform is very specifically a peer review platform, and we're helping it at the school at the moment.

342
00:43:57,254 --> 00:44:07,964
Okay. And, you know, like I said, I implemented in Public Health Graduate, where I have been truly floored at how well it worked.

343
00:44:08,144 --> 00:44:19,904
Really? Okay. Yeah. So, I mean, it may be overkill for what you're trying to do, but just, you know, it's an it, you know,

344
00:44:19,904 --> 00:44:28,904
speaking of these loops, especially because in that course, I, you know, the the the paper assignment is scaffolded.

345
00:44:28,904 --> 00:44:32,744
And so it was truly a feedback spiral.

346
00:44:33,014 --> 00:44:41,024
Okay. But the way the way it works is, you know, the students upload their submissions.

347
00:44:42,944 --> 00:44:46,394
So that's what critic calls the create phase. Okay.

348
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:56,654
Then there's the peer review phase where, you know, depending on what you how you set up the platform like.

349
00:44:56,654 --> 00:45:05,354
So in February, the peer reviews and they have to use the so they use the rubric and they give a score

350
00:45:06,194 --> 00:45:11,534
based on the criteria and the rubric and they have to give a written evaluation.

351
00:45:11,924 --> 00:45:15,074
Okay. And then when that phase is over.

352
00:45:15,974 --> 00:45:30,794
Then the you know, if the the people whose work was evaluated give feedback to the evaluators on the quality of their feedback and how helpful it was.

353
00:45:31,004 --> 00:45:39,674
And when you're setting up the course, you get to decide what weight you want to give to these different things.

354
00:45:39,764 --> 00:45:43,424
Okay. In February, I think I used the default.

355
00:45:45,524 --> 00:45:51,804
The structure that here met Zoe Starsky is using credit for labs in Vegas.

356
00:45:52,004 --> 00:46:01,064
521. Okay. And in his case, he's not at all interested in in the the quantitative score.

357
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:05,534
He wanted to emphasize the written evaluation.

358
00:46:06,524 --> 00:46:12,994
And so, you know, I think it's like 0% here, 100% there.

359
00:46:13,004 --> 00:46:16,483
I mean, you know, like, yeah, you could do it however you want. Yeah, you can.

360
00:46:16,484 --> 00:46:23,984
Absolutely. You sort of, like, make it so precise as what you want to point to.

361
00:46:26,144 --> 00:46:36,394
And, you know, there's there's like I said, you can the the screenshot I took up the in my slide deck was actually from critic.

362
00:46:37,994 --> 00:46:46,304
And so let me very quickly show you, for example, what that looked like in five eight because.

363
00:46:47,894 --> 00:46:52,634
I, I can't wait to dig into the to dig into the data.

364
00:46:52,664 --> 00:46:58,174
It was just. Astounding to me.

365
00:47:00,064 --> 00:47:06,444
So this is, you know, this student, Anahita, she's reviewed by Jonathan.

366
00:47:06,454 --> 00:47:09,484
I mean, this is what Jonathan.

367
00:47:10,414 --> 00:47:14,934
This is the feedback Jonathan left for Anahita.

368
00:47:14,944 --> 00:47:22,023
Right? This is the feedback Lizzie left for.

369
00:47:22,024 --> 00:47:28,684
And, you know, like this. Yeah. You don't naturally, like, took that seriously.

370
00:47:29,014 --> 00:47:36,734
Yeah. And then, you know, the Anahita gives them feedback, like, so in this case, it's for Lizzie.

371
00:47:38,614 --> 00:47:41,734
Letting her know that, you know, yes, this was motivational.

372
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:45,183
It was it was helpful.

373
00:47:45,184 --> 00:47:51,454
And she, you know, in terms of feedback, also gave some feedback.

374
00:47:51,814 --> 00:48:05,754
Okay. Right. And, you know, the the stars that you see is when the students, you know, power up like that.

375
00:48:05,754 --> 00:48:08,974
They're a great feedback giver. Yeah. Yeah.

376
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:13,894
So let's put that up at the beginning, which I did a calibration activity.

377
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:16,083
And so already the you know,

378
00:48:16,084 --> 00:48:25,924
the closer they were to the evaluation that I provided on the sample submissions already the platforms started calibrating,

379
00:48:26,434 --> 00:48:33,894
you know, their grading power and, and some of you know, otherwise everybody starts at like beginner level with right.

380
00:48:33,904 --> 00:48:43,044
Okay. But you can see, you know, Nick ended up because the course is over like Nick, Ethan, Allison,

381
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:53,644
like they all ended up at like whatever it is, platinum, diamond, you know, level where they you know, they leveled up but some students.

382
00:48:59,554 --> 00:49:08,074
I think this one might be the one who, you know, kind of like remained at a pretty basic level.

383
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:14,223
Yeah. Yeah. It's just really interesting.

384
00:49:14,224 --> 00:49:22,474
And I can't wait to kind of like dig into the data and see if, you know, when students were told, hey, this feedback wasn't particularly helpful.

385
00:49:22,474 --> 00:49:26,594
Like, did they do better the next time? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

386
00:49:26,614 --> 00:49:40,954
Right. So, so anyway, so this this may be overkill for what you're trying to do, but and, you know, students can submit all kinds of,

387
00:49:41,224 --> 00:49:47,914
you know, so it can be a paper, but it can be a video kinds of all kinds of things, as a matter of fact.

388
00:49:48,664 --> 00:49:59,883
Oh, I'm sorry. We need to go. Oh, when we first found out about this, this tool, it was a webinar, you know, from the company.

389
00:49:59,884 --> 00:50:06,034
And the instructor they had invited is somebody in Canada which teaches classes of like 1500.

390
00:50:06,484 --> 00:50:09,864
Wow. Has no assistance or in.

391
00:50:11,314 --> 00:50:16,004
And so she couldn't do anything other than like quizzes because how else.

392
00:50:16,094 --> 00:50:17,554
She didn't have time to grade it. Yeah.

393
00:50:17,554 --> 00:50:24,814
There's no way until she found until she found this and this is something that potentially we could think about for 512.

394
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:28,834
What she does in critic is she gets you know,

395
00:50:28,834 --> 00:50:37,264
they're randomly divided into two groups and given a little scenario and she goes to exercise like teacher friend or teacher mom or something.

396
00:50:37,354 --> 00:50:42,844
Yeah. Where they have to record themselves explaining a concept.

397
00:50:43,294 --> 00:50:44,524
Okay. Right.

398
00:50:44,584 --> 00:50:53,104
Based on the scenario that they, you know, but they have to explain it to a friend, to a family, you know, to say so basically they have to,

399
00:50:54,244 --> 00:51:00,963
you know, think about, you know, what it means and how to explain it in a way that makes sense to someone else.

400
00:51:00,964 --> 00:51:04,474
So they have to demonstrate, you know, their understanding.

401
00:51:04,474 --> 00:51:08,854
And, you know, so that's a recorded video and then they get peer reviewed.

402
00:51:09,304 --> 00:51:20,704
Yeah, but so, so anyway, so these are some of the, you know, the, the purely kind of like, you know,

403
00:51:21,304 --> 00:51:28,203
explicitly sort of, you know, peer review focused tools and so just know that they're there.

404
00:51:28,204 --> 00:51:34,054
And then I just, you know, I was just going to end with, you know, just, you know,

405
00:51:34,414 --> 00:51:41,044
as with everything else in life, you know, the more you're intentional about things,

406
00:51:41,554 --> 00:51:48,454
the more you, you know, you carefully design an experience, the more successful it is going to be is essentially what this boils down to.

407
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:54,604
So anyway, I, I'll show the slides and I'll send you a link to the Brazilian teaching canvas site.

408
00:51:54,964 --> 00:52:03,804
Oh, yeah, that would be super helpful. Yeah. And then, you know, we have some time to think about how this might be done in, you know, 60 and 60.

409
00:52:03,824 --> 00:52:11,494
Well, 61 might be a little late to do something different, but but even like next year, we might but for next year about it.

410
00:52:11,734 --> 00:52:19,723
So yeah. So I'm very glad that you were interested in this, because I think it's something that is I mean,

411
00:52:19,724 --> 00:52:26,564
these are really neat tools and I can absolutely see how they'd be really valuable for 618 and 61.

412
00:52:26,564 --> 00:52:32,924
Right now, the your ability to give feedback is it really graded?

413
00:52:33,424 --> 00:52:38,444
But we do want to put more of a focus on the quality of peer review.

414
00:52:38,774 --> 00:52:39,674
You know, I don't know.

415
00:52:39,674 --> 00:52:52,333
So it's nice to know that these tools are here and that there's kind of like different levels of engagement or scoring or whatever that we.

416
00:52:52,334 --> 00:52:58,873
Yeah. You know. Yeah. And you know, some of it can be dial down.

417
00:52:58,874 --> 00:53:07,424
Some of it can. Yeah, you can decide not to use a particular feature or maybe the entire platform is like overkill for what you're trying to do.

418
00:53:07,424 --> 00:53:10,153
And then we, we go a much simpler road.

419
00:53:10,154 --> 00:53:19,033
But, but the principles, you know, that I went over at the beginning should still apply no matter what tool, how we're doing it.

420
00:53:19,034 --> 00:53:25,394
Yeah. Yeah. So, so anyway, thank you so much for for just thank you.

421
00:53:26,804 --> 00:53:31,064
Always nice to see you. I'll see you in in a few minutes. All right. Sounds good, Frederic.

422
00:53:31,064 --> 00:53:35,014
Thank you. All right. All right. Bye bye.
