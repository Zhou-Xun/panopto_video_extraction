00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,380
In indirect standardization, we ask the question,

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,329
how did the number of deaths observed in a population compare to the number that I would

3
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,370
have expected if the population had the same mortality rates as another population?

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:33,650
Indirect standardization is most commonly deployed in small populations where it's not possible to get accurate estimates of age specific rates.

5
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:40,490
It's often applied in occupational settings where, for example, if you were looking at accident rates.

6
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:49,190
Thankfully, accidents don't happen all that frequently and so you don't have reliable estimates of what those rates might be by age group.

7
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:58,520
So the way that we fix this problem or adjust for those confounding in another way is we ask whether or not we observe more injuries,

8
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:06,950
for example, in our population than what we'd expect if our population had the same rates as the general population.

9
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:17,030
In effect, because we're not confident that we can get stable estimations of the rates or risks within age strata of our population of interest.

10
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:25,490
We use the risks or rates of the general population where we feel confident in those age specific risks or rates.

11
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:34,250
We can then compare that expected count to our observed account to see whether or not it's different or if it was the same.

12
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:42,899
So to conduct indirect standardization, what we do is instead of taking a standard population,

13
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,270
what we do is we take the standard rates of some population here.

14
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:58,560
What I have shown is we're using the standard rates of some population B and applying it to the observed population that we see in population A,

15
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:09,180
the way that we do this is we take our rates, multiply it by the counts of individuals and each of those groups in order to figure out the expected

16
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:16,770
number of injuries that we would observe if only our population had the same rates as our comparison group.

17
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:31,350
Here we multiply a rate of zero one per 10,000 by 154 people in the age 25 to 34 group and get an expected injury count of 1.5.

18
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:40,200
We do that for all of the other age groups. We sum them up and see that in our population we would only expect to see about

19
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,320
four injuries in our population if it had the rates of the general population.

20
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,290
However, what we observed was 12 injuries.

21
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:56,480
Therefore, if you do the ratio of the observed versus the expected,

22
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:03,559
you can see that there's almost three times as many injuries in our population as

23
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,510
what would be expected if they had the same injury rate as our general population.

24
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,480
So here are our detailed instructions for indirect standardization.

25
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,190
We first acquire our age specific rates for a standard population.

26
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:27,830
We then multiply those age specific rates by the number of people in the corresponding age range in our population of interest,

27
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:35,390
giving us the expected number of events by age group in our population, if only they had the rates of the standard.

28
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:42,290
We then sum across the expected number of events and then we divide the number of observed events

29
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,900
by the expected events to get the standardized incidence rate or standardized mortality rate.

30
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:53,060
If it's greater than one, it tells us we have many more events than expected.

31
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,140
If it's equal to one, we have as many as expected.

32
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,190
And if it's less than one, then we have far less than our expected.

33
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:09,489
So in summary, the key takeaways from this particular video are that standardization allows for the comparison

34
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:14,200
of rates between groups that have different distributions of susceptible individuals.

35
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:20,710
Direct standardization is great when there's large populations with stable strata, specific rates or risks.

36
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,160
The result is an overall adjusted risk or rate.

37
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:32,109
In contrast, indirect standardization is best when the population of interest is small and stable strata,

38
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,960
specific estimates of rates or risks are not available.

39
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:42,400
The results of indirect standardization is a standardized incidence ratio or a standardized mortality ratio.
