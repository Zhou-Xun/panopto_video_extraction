1
00:00:00,431 --> 00:00:05,021
In this module, we're going to be talking about your professional and your personal identity.

2
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:13,971
And we're going to be talking about hopefully how they fit together and overlap and also how it's kind of a life long journey, figuring it all out.

3
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:21,271
So we don't have to worry too much about feeling like they arrived or got it all figured.

4
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:26,581
This is an identity development model, and I'll go through it, don't worry about all of the visuals yet.

5
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:35,991
But I think it's important to acknowledge that while we're in college, while we're pursuing our career, we're often figuring out a lot of who we are.

6
00:00:35,991 --> 00:00:39,821
We're looking at the models around us and what type of relationships do I want?

7
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:44,871
What are my values, what roles are really important to me?

8
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:51,011
And a lot of this stuff can be shifting. Our world view can be shifting as we're taking in new information.

9
00:00:51,011 --> 00:00:54,291
And sometimes that can create a feeling of uneasiness.

10
00:00:54,291 --> 00:01:02,391
But I think we want to have the perspective that it's normal and we can navigate it and we can figure it out as we go.

11
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:07,071
And sometimes we'll feel like we figured it out if something will happen and we'll shift again

12
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:15,031
but this is just a normal process. What's really important is that we don't feel afraid of new information,

13
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:19,891
that we feel like we can work with it and get help to kind of figure out what to do with it.

14
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:27,101
And we don't feel like there's parts of ourself that we're leaving out because it can feel really weird to be in

15
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:33,311
an environment where you are pursuing something professionally or you're pursuing something in a new relationship.

16
00:01:33,311 --> 00:01:42,731
You can't bring your whole self in and you don't have places to talk about the things that are you're thinking about. So this model,

17
00:01:42,731 --> 00:01:46,721
let's for a moment just talk about professional identity and the question that

18
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:50,501
everybody asks us since we were a kid like what do you want to be when you grow up?

19
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:54,461
And sometimes we can be looking around us and think everybody's kind of got it figured out.

20
00:01:54,461 --> 00:02:04,021
And if we don't, that that's not OK. The reality of our work world today is that most people make small shifts in their career.

21
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:08,711
Every one to three years, and that every five to seven years

22
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,931
a lot of people make major shifts.

23
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:18,371
So this idea that we arrive at a place where we have figuring out where we get a job and work for 50 years, that doesn't happen a lot anymore.

24
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:27,761
What's much more important know is that we know ourselves, know our skills, know what we want, and that we set ourselves up to be kind of flexible

25
00:02:27,761 --> 00:02:31,491
and adaptable. So if you don't have it all figured out, you're in good company

26
00:02:31,491 --> 00:02:37,321
you're OK, and the world that we live in actually kind of works with that pretty well.

27
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:45,361
So if you look at the top, the columns kind of represent how much you've explored an area of your life.

28
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:51,081
And then the rows kind of show how much you kind of locked in and committed

29
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:59,621
to a certain thing. So in this case, we'd be talking about. So in your view, it's the same, it's mine

30
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:07,761
It's the top left column foreclosure. This is when the first idea that you think of as a career, you're in love with it

31
00:03:07,761 --> 00:03:13,341
that's it. So you haven't done a lot of exploring, deeply committed to it.

32
00:03:13,341 --> 00:03:18,971
We probably had this experience sometime with like maybe like looking at an outfit or a car or something

33
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:22,871
It was just the first one we see that's it. And that's not always bad

34
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:31,901
sometimes we just know and there's a certainy, but sometimes even when there's a certainty, especially with some of our major life decisions,

35
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:39,251
major areas of our life, like our careers, it can be helpful to just say, OK, I think this is it. let's just say you found a new car

36
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:46,571
I think this is it, let me just do a little bit of research, see what else is out there, if they still feel equally sure

37
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:48,911
then great let me run with it.

38
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:59,041
If we don't do that little bit of exploration, sometimes we get, you know, down in our journey and think, what if or if I had only known.

39
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:08,911
And so if you're feeling like you're in that box where, and this could be about anything, a relationship, your career, some big move,

40
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:13,451
renting a car anything like that. You feel you've locked in but haven't been

41
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:20,931
but haven't done the exploration, it might be good to do a little bit more information gathering.

42
00:04:20,931 --> 00:04:26,891
In the bottom left is diffusion. So this is where you don't know what you want to do

43
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:30,421
you haven't really given it a lot of thought and sometimes this is OK.

44
00:04:30,421 --> 00:04:36,271
For example, if you're a freshman in college and you have four years to figure it out,

45
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:44,321
spending some time where you're just adjusting to your new stage in life and learning as you go can be a perfectly

46
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:47,381
OK, place to be. But maybe as you get to be a

47
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:57,821
sophomore junior you're starting to do more questioning information gathering so you can be prepared to make decisions as you move forward.

48
00:04:57,821 --> 00:05:04,751
If you find yourself stuck into fusion where your just like, I don't know, deadlines and decisions are coming up,

49
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:13,091
that's where you might want to get some help to engage in getting more information and exploring what your options are.

50
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:19,551
Moratorium, this is sometimes where, like you're in over thinker, sometimes you can get stuck.

51
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:28,821
You have you've had tons before each ingathering, you've talked to tons of people and you can't still seem to figure it out.

52
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:32,991
Sometimes it is time to just pause away from the search a little bit,

53
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:38,121
do the things that you love, and then revisit it and see if it becomes more clear.

54
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:41,601
It's also sometimes a good time to talk with a mentor and other people

55
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:48,921
and just even maybe do some journaling about what's getting in the way, because sometimes we have beliefs like I have to make a perfect decision for ever,

56
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:58,551
and that's going to make most of us feel pretty anxious and stuck as opposed to this may be the first job I take or the first internship I take.

57
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:03,891
And if it's not a good fit I'll adjust as I go. I learned some things about what I like and what I don't like.

58
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:05,811
So sometimes if we're in moratorium,

59
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:14,711
just being a little bit still talking with somebody else and figuring out what's getting in our way and knowing that we don't have to make.

60
00:06:14,711 --> 00:06:22,271
You only have to make a good enough decision. And the last one in this is usually where we all saying we want to be at achievement

61
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:26,831
I've explored I made my decision I feel great about it.

62
00:06:26,831 --> 00:06:32,831
The thing to know here is that means that for this age or for this decision, you close the loop.

63
00:06:32,831 --> 00:06:38,991
You've done your exploration. You've made your decision and this is good

64
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:42,021
often to pause and even think about how you came to the decision,

65
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:46,581
how you knew that it was a good fit, because usually you'll get a few more steps down the road in life

66
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:52,641
and there will be new things to figure out. And so they'll look at this two ways.

67
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:57,881
You haven't gotten to achievement yet. Know that it's kind of a cycle in life.

68
00:06:57,881 --> 00:07:04,831
So sometimes we're not going to know yet, but we'll eventually get there as long as we keep gathering information.

69
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:11,881
And staying in conversation with people that can help us. And if you're there, don't be shocked if at some point you get new information,

70
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:18,241
your life changes a little bit you've a kind of explored again, all of this is normal.

71
00:07:18,241 --> 00:07:21,691
Wherever you're at is OK. It's just kind of knowing where you're at

72
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:33,701
and figuring out what you need to keep you kind of moving. This is a point

73
00:07:33,701 --> 00:07:45,431
where I really want you to just kind of think about your self and self reflect and ask yourself what is most important to you in your work life?

74
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:53,171
Even in the field of public health, there are so many different things that you can do and knowing a little bit about how you're wired.

75
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:57,551
What you like can go a long way in making a really good decision.

76
00:07:57,551 --> 00:08:03,081
So ask yourself things like. Am I an introvert or an extrovert?

77
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:07,431
Do I want in my work life to be interfacing and talking to a friendly crowd?

78
00:08:07,431 --> 00:08:15,831
Or do I want to work on teams? Or do I like kind of taking an idea and working on it by myself?

79
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:21,991
Do I like stability, do I want flexibility, do I like a lot of novelty and change and variation?

80
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:29,991
Or do I like to kind of do the same thing every day? Do I want to be out in the front meter or do I want to be a person who kind of

81
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:38,201
just is a really good team player and and is contested and gets things done?

82
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:41,981
Do I want to work somewhere where I have flexibility to travel?

83
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:47,661
Do I want to work remotely. What level of challenge do I want? Some of these things

84
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:51,281
I think we believe there is what we should want we should want to be a leader

85
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:55,361
we don't want to go in front of people. We should want tons of challenge.

86
00:08:55,361 --> 00:08:59,401
They think it's really good to have quiet moments where we ask ourselves, is that what I really want?

87
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:08,601
Let me name and figure out what I really want. Now, this chart in front of us kind of shows us a little bit about different areas in the work world.

88
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:16,781
And you'll get a supplemental that will show you like different careers in the public health field that go with these different areas.

89
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:26,681
So, for example, the realistic area on this chart is referring to people who really kind of like hands on,

90
00:09:26,681 --> 00:09:32,091
often like working with machines, tools, working outdoors.

91
00:09:32,091 --> 00:09:40,831
And so you would want if this is kind of your personality, you would want to find careers within public health, that allow you to do that.

92
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:46,521
Investigative if it's people who like to analyze, evaluate, these are often our researchers.

93
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:52,211
Do you want to know, like is not a part of my my personality that I really need met in my work life?

94
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:57,451
And hopefully, as you're moving through this program, you're getting to see people with different personalities.

95
00:09:57,451 --> 00:10:00,751
You're getting to see what they do and hear from them what they do day to day.

96
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:05,631
You're able to check in with yourself and see, does this sound like a good fit for me?

97
00:10:05,631 --> 00:10:10,101
The artistic group is pretty creative

98
00:10:10,101 --> 00:10:16,231
often they are doing visual representations or different movement representations of the things that we're thinking about.

99
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:22,441
They often translate research into ways of expressing it to people so that it resonates and that they get it.

100
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:28,361
They like coming up with new and novel ideas and working in spaces where that's the

101
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:36,921
In the blue, the social category, that's often where people like to kind of be health educators they wanna inform.

102
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:41,571
They want to engage with people and help meet their needs

103
00:10:41,571 --> 00:10:50,191
in that way. The green is enterprising, and these are people who like to influence and persuade.

104
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:57,931
They often like to be kind of in the front and getting out information and helping people be informed.

105
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:05,781
And the last one is conventional, and this is often people who really like organization numbers and are detail oriented.

106
00:11:05,781 --> 00:11:10,651
The main takeaway with this is that

107
00:11:10,651 --> 00:11:18,651
within one field like public health, there are so many different things that you can do so many ways that your work life can look.

108
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:27,651
And so you want to get a sense of all of what's out there, and then you want to make decisions the fit for your actual personal.

109
00:11:27,651 --> 00:11:35,651
Another thing that can help is knowing what your values are. And you'll get another follow up link here.

110
00:11:35,651 --> 00:11:42,381
Where you're going to see a long list of values and there's a couple of things that I want you to think about as you look at the different values

111
00:11:42,381 --> 00:11:47,511
I want you to think of what your strengths are. I think of this kind of what your secret sauce.

112
00:11:47,511 --> 00:11:53,221
You'll see all these different adjectives, and what of those things just kind of come naturally to you?

113
00:11:53,221 --> 00:12:01,061
If you don't know I would encourage you to sit down with a friend, a family member, a mentor and ask them what they see in you, and can kind of be like a fun get together

114
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:06,501
where if, you know, each person kind of tells the other person some of the things that they see in them. Well, a lot of us

115
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:09,171
we're taught to be humble and we don't really know our strengths.

116
00:12:09,171 --> 00:12:18,361
And so knowing what they are and what you bring to the work environment can really help guide you in some of making these decisions.

117
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:23,241
Look at that list and pick three that you think are your strengths.

118
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:34,751
Focusing on three can be good, cause then you can I know that your main kinda like your highlights also what are the values that you want in your work environment.

119
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:43,121
So different organizations that you work for are going to value different things and may value diversity more.

120
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:47,441
Some may value being kind of environmentally conscious more.

121
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:51,221
There's going to be different value, some are going to be more more flexible,

122
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:55,371
some are going to be more team oriented looking. Look, that list again,

123
00:12:55,371 --> 00:13:01,301
what are some of the things in the workspaces that you were in? That are really important to you.

124
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:07,181
Think about the places that you been in school or done internships or collaborated,

125
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:11,201
what was kind of your vibe that made you feel like you could show up and your work

126
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:16,031
and feel really comfortable? And maybe what are some of the characteristics that you're not

127
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:25,081
you don't like as much. And then the last thing when you're thinking about the 10 weeks of this program that you're in.

128
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:29,041
What on that list do you want this season to be about?

129
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:33,441
What do you want it to feel like? I would say again, here, pick three.

130
00:13:33,441 --> 00:13:39,751
You know, you might it might be about learning,

131
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:43,931
self care, and building your confidence.

132
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:46,021
You know, it could be about a bunch of different things,

133
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:55,031
but sometimes just knowing what those values are that you want to guide you through the three weeks can be helpful. In each season of your life

134
00:13:55,031 --> 00:14:00,921
you can come back to this and say, OK, what are my strengths? What do I need in the environment around me?

135
00:14:00,921 --> 00:14:10,371
What do I want this season of my life to. And that can kind of serve as a compass that guides you as you're moving through the

136
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:15,241
different situations of knowing yourself and knowing what you need from the environment,

137
00:14:15,241 --> 00:14:20,721
knowing what you're focused on making that

138
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:27,321
There is a quote that I really like that says, basically envision the life you want and then say no to everything

139
00:14:27,321 --> 00:14:32,831
It's not. And sometimes if we haven't visualize it, thought about it, thought about what's most important to us

140
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:38,861
we're doing a lot of things that actually don't fit with this picture of what we want our work life to look like,

141
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:43,511
what we want our professional life our personal life.

142
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:52,061
So what I want you to do is just take some time and visualize not so much like what is the specific job I want to do.

143
00:14:52,061 --> 00:14:56,191
But when I look forward and I think about what I want to be when I grow up and there's no

144
00:14:56,191 --> 00:15:02,531
like age limit when I want to do this, im well into my career and I still sit down and do this.

145
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:09,651
What do I see myself doing. What am I wearing, what do I feel like in my body, what is the environment like?

146
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:14,051
Who are the people that I'm surrounded by, what're my colleagues like, what is the team like?

147
00:15:14,051 --> 00:15:18,631
What kind of tasks am I working on? Who am I serving?

148
00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:21,421
Like most of us in our job we're showing up and we're providing a service for

149
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:25,341
solving problems for somebody who is that group that I want to be doing that for.

150
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:31,031
And what types of problem do I want to be working on and solutions do I want

151
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:38,561
The nice thing about this is that this is kind of it becomes North Star becomes kind of where we want to head

152
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:44,171
and we can continue to adapt as we go each step along the journey we find out more things about ourselves.

153
00:15:44,171 --> 00:15:49,661
We try a job and we're like eh I really would like to do, I don't like that as much as I thought and that's perfectly OK.

154
00:15:49,661 --> 00:15:55,361
It's not a crisis. New data when we adjust our vision in our map

155
00:15:55,361 --> 00:16:02,331
as we go. The other thing that I think about another quote that I've heard recently,

156
00:16:02,331 --> 00:16:08,791
and neither one of these I could find I tried to find out who said them, but in your pursuit to be exactly who you are.

157
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:14,691
And sometimes when we're trying to do big new, endearing things, we don't always have role models

158
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:21,011
and I think that's another cool thing about the program that you're in right now is that hopefully within this program

159
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:29,561
and as you go through life, you're looking for people who are doing their career the way that they want to do it or showing up as their full selves,

160
00:16:29,561 --> 00:16:32,891
because that's kind of where your secret sauce or your magic is.

161
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:41,441
And so, for example, in my job, I didn't know as I was going through college that I could someday be dressed professionally doing my work,

162
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:46,591
and some days I could be in T-shirts and and you know, that I could wear bright lipstick.

163
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:52,291
I could do different things because I think I had an avatar of what I thought it looked like to

164
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:57,631
What I've learned is that there's often sometimes depends again on that environment,

165
00:16:57,631 --> 00:17:01,171
a lot of space to show up and be yourself.

166
00:17:01,171 --> 00:17:10,451
So you want to be looking for mentors. And Seeing how people are doing it so it can inform ways that you can show up as yourself.

167
00:17:10,451 --> 00:17:16,711
And a lot of times we've learned a lot of rules that aren't really rules about how it has to be done, how it has to look.

168
00:17:16,711 --> 00:17:25,641
So being really clear on what we want and then checking in the people that we know, people better have shared values with us about what's possible.

169
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:28,581
Can help us have a broader vision of how we can show up

170
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:36,191
we don't all have to be the same cookie cutter, buttoned up version of what a professional looks.

171
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:44,331
So the big thing here is get to know yourself, know what you want

172
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:52,761
start to visualize what it's gonna look like, and then continue talking with people, connecting with people and investing as you go.

173
00:17:52,761 --> 00:17:58,011
Here is where even talking with peers and what they're learning in their situations,

174
00:17:58,011 --> 00:18:03,851
sometimes interning with people, scheduling informational interviews.

175
00:18:03,851 --> 00:18:08,621
With some of the people that you look up to and finding out more information from them

176
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:17,011
that can help up the map in how you get from where you're at and what you want.

177
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:27,721
So as we go on, we're going to continue talking about this, but this is kind of a really fun place to sit back a little bit and dream.
