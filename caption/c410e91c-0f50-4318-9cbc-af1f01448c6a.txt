Hello. How's it going? What is your name?

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,530
Lauren. Wow. And it was really great.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,450
So why are you interested in this position? So interested in this position?

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,930
Because I really like to work on environmental policies and federal government.

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:24,960
I've worked for both local and state government, and I think there's a lot more that I'd like to prevent them from the government.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,110
I think with my past experiences, it's kind of taken me on to the next level and you know,

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:39,200
for my dream and I really do want to go and work for the EPA. And what do you feel like some of your strengths and weaknesses are?

8
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,710
So some of my strengths, I'd say, is that you have like a pretty diverse work background.

9
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:50,999
I've worked in a lot of different areas and with my Masters in Public Health focusing on environmental of policy promotion.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,540
I also research for the environmental justice.

11
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,380
I kind of have like a mix of backgrounds and looking at things from a different perspective.

12
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:06,450
I think I'm also really great working with teamwork. I prefer to work in teams and kind of getting different perspectives on one thing.

13
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:13,000
And then as for weaknesses, I just sometimes I take on a bit more than I can chew.

14
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,009
Sometimes, yeah, I'm really passionate, so I want to work on a lot of different projects and things like that,

15
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,370
but sometimes it can be too much and I really need to focus on one thing.

16
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,590
So I have been working on that to go and focus on the most important thing and then taking on more projects as I can.

17
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,639
I think I also go and, you know, don't always ask as many questions as I should have.

18
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,820
You know, I kind of have this like, Oh, I can do this. I don't need anyone else's help sometimes.

19
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:42,270
So that's something else I've been working on as well. And why should we hire you over other applicants?

20
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,430
Um, so, like I said before, I really do think I have a diverse work background.

21
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,310
So as I said, I work for local and state government.

22
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:57,450
And I've also I you know, during my time with my master's program, I also worked for Case Western University.

23
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,989
We liked, you know, freedom, security improvements.

24
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,850
I think it kind of gave me a different perspective on within the social determinants of health.

25
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:14,639
I think I've kind of got a different background in each area, and I think that I've also had jobs that kind of have helped shaped me and my

26
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,960
background for my undergrad was actually in pre medicine and sustainability.

27
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,190
So I think that that that combination kind of gives me like different perspectives.

28
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:31,200
And also as I want to work on environmental policy, when I work for a local government, I also work partially for the service department.

29
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,809
So I got to see a lot of occupational health hazards that and so kind of give me a different perspective on things.

30
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,370
And so I think combining all those things together can make me a really great applicant for the job.

31
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,140
That's great. Thank you so much. Thank you for all of.
