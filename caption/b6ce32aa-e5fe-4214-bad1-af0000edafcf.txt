1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:08,340
Exactly which I am going to say yes and no.

2
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:38,420
33.4% in 2010 to 2020 out.

3
00:00:42,240 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm not saying I wish I it, but I think you can start by saying yes, you can.

4
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:25,020
How do you do it one way or the other?

5
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,720
I thought you said off and I was like Coca Cola.

6
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:44,160
Oh, my God, that's holding. Hands are only going to be where they grow and not just living in life.

7
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:59,820
Yeah. She has some, like, say, some sort of an outlet.

8
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:26,690
I think if you're going to look at something, she's like, I think he's going to have to look like there's different.

9
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:42,520
Yeah. So I was like, okay, let me talk to you like some kind of like since heard the one.

10
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:48,950
I got something that's terrifying. Oh, my God. I'm so far away from.

11
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,200
You know, I was thinking one thing.

12
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:15,450
I am not because I was just like you said, you're still very much talking about something.

13
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:28,470
It's really not true.

14
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:51,420
I feel like I just feel like I'm assuming you're not ready for that and that is what you do.

15
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:59,670
And you're not a single. There was one that I was like, I'm just learning everyone.

16
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,409
Women are having a ball again today and we're going to be good.

17
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:12,630
It's great. I think just the umbrella code or something, you might start it when you come out.

18
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:18,420
So I think this is where we left off when I was talking on Monday.

19
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:25,580
We're talking about depictions and I was going to start talking about the clip economy lessons.

20
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:32,490
So if there's a lot of things it as I mentioned,

21
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:46,650
it's correlated linearly with how much adipose tissue you have inside itself and it increases in response to that.

22
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:54,330
Yes, you can have an increase in leptin with an inflammatory response, and that's what's shown in this box up here.

23
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,430
So you have overfeeding adipose tissue.

24
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:09,220
You have an eye response as a significant inflammatory response like sepsis or a significant infection.

25
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,500
But there's a lot of these and they get into circulation.

26
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:22,090
And then there are things that can reduce these so that disrupt this association.

27
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:27,760
So if you were to fast for 36 hours, your left hand levels would go below detection.

28
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,650
You still have lots of adipose tissue, but you wouldn't be able to detect the selection.

29
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:41,830
So those are some caveats about this correlation between leptin and adipose tissue gets into the circulation, gets into blood.

30
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:48,850
There are some there was some research suggesting that other tissues could produce it, but that didn't really pan out.

31
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,650
It gets into the circulation and has many, many different effects.

32
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,360
So I focused on its ability to regulate food intake.

33
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:08,710
Recently, when we talked about how it could suppress appetite and increase energy expenditure, but it also has lots of other effects.

34
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,590
So it can affect immune cells. It can affect both the innate and adaptive immune response.

35
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:20,290
So it can influence things like t cell proliferation and response to an activator.

36
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:25,660
It can affect your blood cell formation.

37
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:33,530
In the article, Wheat says it can affect pancreatic beta cell function too.

38
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:41,260
You need to have leptin for reproductive function because it activates gonadotropin releasing hormone,

39
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,300
which is one of the signals that enables reproduction.

40
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:52,180
And without enough leptin, you don't get this enough of the signal.

41
00:06:52,600 --> 00:07:04,660
So in states where you have undernutrition, there's there's a lack of reproductive success because of low levels of circulating leptin.

42
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:17,470
Conversely, if you have too much adipose tissue, you have leptin resistance, and this is associated with for your productive success.

43
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:25,570
So an example of that would be, well, you're in a state of energy deprivation.

44
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:37,690
It's not a good time to conceive and have offspring because if there's a lack of an abundance of food to support that particular physiologic function.

45
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:50,950
Conversely, people who have very high levels of adipose tissue, BMI 40 plus would have a difficult time with that successful pregnancy.

46
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,400
And when these individuals,

47
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:04,150
some of these individuals who choose to have bariatric surgery all of a sudden have more success in terms of having children.

48
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,790
And it's thought that leptin is the best mediator in that response.

49
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:18,460
You can actually measure changes and in our age with undernutrition and over and find this response.

50
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:24,850
Yeah, we see early maturation in individuals who are a heavier weight.

51
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:32,680
So I'm wondering that's like kind of like contradictory, like who's saying a little bit how big is like the amount of.

52
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,739
Response to this has. I didn't talk about the maturation.

53
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:46,139
I talked about reproductive function. Okay. I guess I was thinking like, okay, you're having early maturation.

54
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:52,350
So that's like increased reproduction function individuals because as a consequence of that, as a consequence.

55
00:08:52,350 --> 00:09:01,470
But then we have this example where it's like too much capacity and then it's preventing them from having that reproductive health.

56
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:08,530
So it seems like slightly contradictory in my mind. Maybe I just don't know enough about this,

57
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:16,110
this or the mechanism that I'm referring to that's actually been observed in animal models because

58
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:23,189
you aren't going to crack open somebody's brain and measure generate has actually been demonstrated.

59
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:30,690
And then if you are able to stimulate that pathway, you can improve reproductive function.

60
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:38,550
But in terms of maturation and early maturation in that capacity, this just doesn't relate to that.

61
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:50,150
Yeah, I think that also by the effect of adipose tissue or most of the estrogen, some other things because.

62
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,940
Oh, right, right. Can you say that a little bit louder. Yeah.

63
00:09:52,950 --> 00:10:00,179
Like it should also be mediated by the productive hormone that gets in affecting reproductive estrogen.

64
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:05,030
And yes, that's why it's affecting that effect. Yes. And that's downstream from general range.

65
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:15,050
Yes. But in terms of again, in terms of in terms of maturation, physical maturation related to it,

66
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:23,340
particularly in young girls, this this diagram just doesn't relate to that mechanism.

67
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:32,400
But, yes, you do see an earlier maturation and younger girls with higher adiposity.

68
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:41,590
So in terms of basal metabolism, it can increase it if you're sensitive to it.

69
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:47,590
And this is thought to be mediated through thermogenesis.

70
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:56,260
We know that it inhibits food in our food intake and it affects the hypothalamic pituitary access.

71
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:04,760
And here's the pathway where you have chronically genic releasing hormone activating acetate,

72
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,850
which is the product of seed, increasing glucocorticoids and affecting many different physiologic functions.

73
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:25,830
The other thing that you should know is that here's here's a diagram of the thymus and here's also a mention of t cells and cytokines.

74
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:38,130
So with elevated levels of adiposity, you get this increase and the court records and this has been noted in some studies,

75
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:44,210
but you talk a little bit about cortisol in obese areas.

76
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:54,810
As was mentioned peripherally, about half, half people who have a BMI of 30 have elevated cortisol and half do not.

77
00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:01,410
Depends on the context, on the condition of the individual, their age and so on.

78
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:10,830
The level of adiposity, that level of cortisol is important in regard to the population of T cells that you have.

79
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:21,210
So there is this relationship between cortisol and T cell levels where if you have somebody who has high levels of cortisol,

80
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,900
I can actually suppress your circulating t cell numbers.

81
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,549
And that way cortisol is immunosuppressive in a lot of ways.

82
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:35,040
But in terms of this relationship, it can suppress t cell numbers.

83
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:51,810
So on the next slide we have the elevation of leptin and its association with a lot of chronic diseases and you'll see

84
00:12:52,050 --> 00:13:00,540
a loads of papers in the literature that have looked at this relationship and human studies it's been associated.

85
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:10,230
It's hard to demonstrate elevated levels of leptin with these different outcomes, but there certainly are strong associations.

86
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,830
But in an animal models,

87
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:23,280
if you give an animal a high fat diet and they have elevated adiposity and you study some of these end points like cardiovascular disease,

88
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:29,790
you see a mechanism that is activated that would promote that.

89
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:39,330
In the case of cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, you do see that response pushed more strongly.

90
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:54,560
So the way investigators have done this is they've either had animals that are leptin deficient and studied pathogenesis and found that left.

91
00:13:54,570 --> 00:14:00,420
And this important promoter of this process, one of the most famous studies that was done,

92
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:09,180
was actually done here at the University of Michigan with an eye expand and votary letters and physiology.

93
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:17,430
Some of you or from kinesiology might know how they looked at their attention for leptin to favor thrombosis.

94
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:28,680
So thrombosis is a process in which blood clots form and they can travel into small the small vasculature and what caused myocardial infarction.

95
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:38,309
And in that study showed that leptin could promote blood clot formation and the mouse

96
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:44,100
models promote cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction in these animals.

97
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:57,480
So a lot of other studies have looked at leptin and its association with these other diseases asthma, fibrotic liver disease,

98
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:07,080
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, recalcitrant drugs, sleep apnea and cancer,

99
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:16,139
and have shown a positive association and that the associations were shown in humans and then explored in animal

100
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:24,180
models or in tissues with humans showing that leptin can drive an important process and that disease development.

101
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:34,950
Yeah. Kristina Leptin also inhibits blood clot or with lack of left, it can have a blood clot location leading to a type of stroke.

102
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,999
So if you had potentially, potentially.

103
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:50,760
So what leptin as it's thought to do is it's thought to activate some of the key pathways that result in platelet aggregation.

104
00:15:52,920 --> 00:16:01,440
So one of these could be mediated through the metabolism of arachidonic acid, for example, from boxing.

105
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:07,919
And what leptin does there is it enhances the activity of Phospholipase,

106
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:16,440
a two which downstream and within a platelet would give you more from boxing information and more platelet aggregation.

107
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:32,550
So these are just some examples. And in instances where you have low levels of leptin within like with dystrophy and energy malnutrition,

108
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:39,980
you have a greater susceptibility to infectious disease and a greater severity of infectious disease,

109
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:50,700
I should say reduced survival and septic shock, as I mentioned, and delayed puberty.

110
00:16:53,570 --> 00:17:09,410
So. I had talked a little bit about the age that mouse and the occurrence of life or dystrophy in humans.

111
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:18,470
These are individuals who have very little adipose tissue, and this causes lots of problems for them in terms of metabolic disease.

112
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,530
They have a large livers like the mice did.

113
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:30,470
They have severe diabetes. And what do you do for these individuals?

114
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:39,140
They have large livers because their lipids aren't going into adipose tissue and this

115
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,810
lipid ends up in the muscle and it affects insulin resistance and glucose homeostasis.

116
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:55,790
One of the treatments that was pioneered by another person here at the University of Michigan overall was to give these people with dystrophy leptin.

117
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:01,100
So there's a treatment and the drug is called Metro Leptin.

118
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:04,940
And this is a condition that's very rare.

119
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,790
But she's one of the experts in the field.

120
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:15,250
So she has patients all over the country and in other countries, and they're treated with an injection of leptin.

121
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,670
I don't know if it's daily or if they've gotten a weekly dose.

122
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:29,720
Now, the drug is called Metro Leptin, and it's been modified such that it stays in circulation and it has life changing effects for these individuals.

123
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:41,540
So it's that very, very important medication that they use now to help improve their physiologic functions.

124
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:51,540
They're ruthless on this and all of the things that we're supposed to do if you have prostitution to do so,

125
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:57,670
it becomes clear to those previously that we learned a lesson definitions of due to.

126
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:04,630
Mutations are similar, but I see what you're saying.

127
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:14,770
Yeah. Yes, this is different. So the genetic mutation has to do with either your ability to form a functional leptin or leptin receptor,

128
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:21,670
which will give you a lot more adipose tissue because leptin isn't functioning normally.

129
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,030
With life or dystrophy, you just can't produce leptin because you have very, very little fat.

130
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,850
And is this leptin human that I remember previously about the human left?

131
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:41,080
This is. So in life or dystrophy, they're given synthetic left.

132
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:51,910
Yes. Thank you. So we are getting back to your question about maturation, whether whether leptin is the signal that causes early maturation in girls.

133
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:59,350
So that literature, I do know that in children who have this leptin deficiency,

134
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:07,870
who are quite obese, have quite a lot of excess adipose tissue, they don't undergo normal puberty.

135
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:19,030
So they have plenty of adipose tissue, but they don't have any leptin and leptin again to support that JE and RH activation.

136
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:28,840
Catastrophic release. Okay.

137
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:36,459
So leptin is the most well-studied, pro-inflammatory of a kind.

138
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,670
There are many others and there were many others mentioned in the reading.

139
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:48,520
This is the one I want you to remember. There were other mentions of very different kinds that are pro-inflammatory.

140
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:59,680
But let's focus now on these cytokines. So cytokines are proteins that are produced primarily by immune cells,

141
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:08,860
and they are a means of communication between immune cells, cells and other tissues.

142
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:18,910
So a cytokine like TNF, for example, can be produced by usually by an innate immune cell macrophage, but it can't be produced by others.

143
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,870
And this is something that activates the innate immune response.

144
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:27,130
It can cause a downstream cascade of pro-inflammatory events.

145
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:37,989
So I should also mention what I mean about pro-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory adipocytes or cytokines.

146
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:47,709
I should say they are associated with, in this case, an accumulation of type one cells,

147
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:53,230
mostly of all types in adipose tissue people, particularly in the visceral compartment.

148
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:03,450
So the cardinal signs of inflammation are redness, swelling, pain and loss of function.

149
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:13,389
This is a different kind of inflammation in adipose tissue is characterized by high levels of these

150
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:22,920
pro-inflammatory cytokines and a recruitment of these innate immune cells and other cell types to assess tissue,

151
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:32,500
particularly in the visceral compartment. So the most well-known one is tumor necrosis factor alpha.

152
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:36,190
It can promote adipose tissue inflammation.

153
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:48,910
And then, as I mentioned before, a number of studies have looked at the influence of TNF on the scientific genesis and it inhibits that process.

154
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:54,700
So in the presence of there being lots of tumor necrosis factor,

155
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:02,260
instead of having an expansion of adipose tissue through hyperplasia, you get an expansion through hypertrophy.

156
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:07,840
That's not a very efficient way to sequester lipids.

157
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:18,310
And as a consequence associated with that, you have greater higher levels of circulating triglycerides and free fatty acids.

158
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:24,790
Another thing that Tina does, and this has to do with insulin sensitivity,

159
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:34,899
is that it can downregulate or negatively influence the action of insulin within a tissue that

160
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:42,700
normally takes up with lots of muscle so it can sensitize or repair insulin sensitivity.

161
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:52,120
Whether or not that CnF that's produced in adipose tissue circulates to other regions of the body and has this

162
00:23:52,120 --> 00:24:02,200
effect that's not that doesn't seem to be the case because it actually takes higher levels of TNM to do this.

163
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:09,910
So it's the locally produced CnF in muscle and in liver that is thought to be responsible for this insulin sensitivity.

164
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:21,160
So in this case, the TANF is having local effects on inhibiting a different genesis, and it's a biomarker of inflammation, adipose tissue.

165
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:31,120
So the next one is IL six. And I have a slide that kind of touches that goes on this.

166
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:39,190
This is a really complicated cytokine that I can say it's not very well understood and its associated it can induce.

167
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:44,050
If you were to take IL six and you were injected into a to a rodent, a mouse,

168
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:51,700
you'd find that it induces hepatic insulin resistance and that it increases hepatic glucose output.

169
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,080
So in this way it's negatively associated with glucose homeostasis.

170
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:06,400
But there are some other aspects of this cytokine system that make it really complicated, which I'll mention in the next slide.

171
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:13,000
And the other thing. The other is that our class of cytokines that I want you to remember is the chemokines.

172
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:27,460
The chemokines are designated CCL or C, the CCL chemokines are ones that recruit mononuclear cells and lymphocytes as well.

173
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,660
The cells, chemokines recruit.

174
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,170
Mostly neutrophils to the side of inflammation.

175
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:47,580
So what you see in adipose tissue depots, particularly in the visceral adipose tissue compartment, is an increase in the scalp too.

176
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:55,139
This is what recruits monocytes to the adipose tissue.

177
00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:02,670
And this part. And then that here's an example of a chemical, a neutral volume attractant.

178
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:09,660
This not only tracks neutrophils, but it's associated with a disruption of insulin receptor signaling.

179
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:16,730
So these are just some examples of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are produced in adipose tissue.

180
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,430
There are a whole lot more. Yeah.

181
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:25,380
So I know when you put ten inside, you're talking about the inflammation involved.

182
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,190
You said something different. Yes.

183
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:33,899
And so when we talk about adipose tissue inflammation,

184
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:40,020
we're talking about the recruitment of inflammatory cells like we've seen already

185
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,970
and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines at that particular location.

186
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:54,600
And traditionally, we think of inflammation associated with tissue injury or infectious disease.

187
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,220
This is a little bit different. Yeah.

188
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,720
As you say, it's associated with muscle cells. What did you say?

189
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,910
Sorry. Okay.

190
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:18,300
So this is the CCL is a chemokines that promotes the recruitment of monocytes mononuclear cells from the blood into the visceral compartment.

191
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:25,040
So this is what you're seeing here?

192
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:38,560
Yeah. Pro-inflammatory at different times we get a lot more of these cells within the adipose tissue that promotes this inflammatory response,

193
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,270
thanks to exactly why they're being recruited there.

194
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,220
Well, it could be due to the cells that are dying and they're being removed.

195
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:52,420
And monocytes play an important role in tissue remodeling.

196
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,910
Perhaps that's why they're there, but it's not very well understood.

197
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,320
Okay. So explain. Yeah.

198
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,590
Nick, I'm sorry. I'm kind of confused by the tissue dying.

199
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:24,410
I'm not really a physics major at this point. I'm asking just in terms of like, if the fat dies, it would go away so that the cells,

200
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:32,420
the cells are scattered throughout the adipose tissue mass, and some are large and some are small.

201
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:38,270
It's not a complete homogeneity in terms of their size in general that their diameter increases.

202
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:44,390
So the ones this is one adipocyte that's died here.

203
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:56,879
Why did it die? Perhaps the theory here is it's not being adequately perfused with light from the capillaries because the

204
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:07,650
capillary bed has expanded enough to provide enough nutrient and gas exchange for that particular episode.

205
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,889
And it stops. You can actually measure oxygen,

206
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:21,030
tension and in experimental conditions where you can actually put in a monitor to measure oxygen tension in people and animals, as has been done.

207
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,690
You can lower you can measure a lower oxygen tension.

208
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:34,350
And this is thought to be the reason, one of the reasons why these adipocytes die as a consequence of having this free diameter.

209
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:41,280
Okay. If they were dying, the mass would be don't let this go into the neighboring cells.

210
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:46,320
They go into neighboring cells. And it takes a long time to remove those.

211
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:54,660
And products that are dead in adipocytes is a very slow process to resolve that.

212
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:12,310
So. So I talked about Il6 as being a pro-inflammatory signal.

213
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,340
And then in general it is.

214
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:25,200
So if you were to look at somebody who has sepsis or has an infection like like SARS, their levels of IL six are elevated in their blood.

215
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:33,170
That's inactive. And in terms of its action, it's complicated, really.

216
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:44,750
Question Yeah, okay. I'm confused. Um, so you go back to the last one, um, the picture of the cells.

217
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:48,650
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So don't t cells.

218
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,890
T cells are the one that mediate apoptosis.

219
00:30:53,810 --> 00:31:01,040
No. So, um, if the tonic response occurs within the adipocyte itself.

220
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:08,160
Okay. So the T cells aren't the ones that would be the ones that attach to antigens.

221
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:14,090
Yes, they are. Okay. So and then that's when they signal to indicate, like, this is not normal.

222
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:24,620
Yes. So do the T cells become adapted to the dysregulated site?

223
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,000
Like perhaps they don't.

224
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:36,740
They initiate this process of the conversion of that and to the green one to become one.

225
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,390
Oh, okay. So their thoughts are control that process.

226
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:47,959
Oh, because if you, if you do the same thing and you knock out a certain population of T cells,

227
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,020
CD8 positive T cells, if you don't see that occurring as much.

228
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,010
Right. So why the T cells that there these are very selective cells.

229
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:03,770
They respond to one particular type of antigen that's presented to them from a MHC class two molecule.

230
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:11,300
Why are they there? People don't. Scientists have thus far not come up with a good model that explains that.

231
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:27,960
And you say, okay. So interleukin six pro-inflammatory.

232
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:35,850
It does a lot of things and it's been best described in models of systemic inflammation in terms of sepsis.

233
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:46,919
Okay. So if you have an infection that gets into your bloodstream and the inflammatory cascade cytokines and other things get to your liver,

234
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:51,060
and liver produces a lot of things called acute phase proteins.

235
00:32:51,750 --> 00:33:00,989
An acute phase protein is produced by cells in the liver, and that tissue is responding to those laboratory signals.

236
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:10,620
One of those inflammatory signals, this interleukin six. But adipose tissue can also produce interleukin six.

237
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:18,020
Shown here. And interestingly, muscle produces a lot of sex.

238
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:24,000
If you exercise for I think it peaks at maybe 45 to 90 minutes and declines thereafter.

239
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:31,500
So we know that exercise is good for us. Are we inducing an inflammatory response every time we exercise?

240
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:41,040
A little bit, maybe. But the thing about IL six that makes it really complicated is it's the receptors that are expressed in these different tissues.

241
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:46,140
So with that, I'm going to show you a really confusing diagram.

242
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:58,020
So we inhale six that produce inadequate tissue locally will drain into the of blood and get to the liver.

243
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:03,750
Okay. And in that scenario, it increases hepatic insulin resistance.

244
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:14,460
Okay. With exercise, we see a positive effect in regard to insulin sensitivity in the periphery.

245
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:23,820
So when exercise, you can get an increase in IL six and in the muscle, you got an increase in insulin sensitivity.

246
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:31,050
Why? Well, it has to do with the different receptors that respond to IL six.

247
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:41,430
So there's a nial six receptor that's attached to a cell membrane and there's a soluble IL six receptor.

248
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:46,740
And it's thought that this is the difference. That's why we see different effects in different tissues.

249
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:51,900
So it's the type of receptor that is expressed in the tissues and then circulates

250
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:56,550
in the blood that might be responsible for these different effects of male sex.

251
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:01,430
That's the explanation. And this is there's a lot of work to be done on like that.

252
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:07,700
Could you repeat. So the soluble receptor. Yeah.

253
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:11,820
I should have actually posted an illustration of the different receptors.

254
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:16,590
And if you want to get into that level of detail for each person, if you've got a lot of other things to remember,

255
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:29,640
so there a membrane bound receptor profile six and then there's a circulating receptor for access to the blood and

256
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:39,270
you have docking proteins that can attach to the circulating receptor and induces intracellular signaling events.

257
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:48,390
And it's thought that the membrane bound receptor and the soluble receptor have different effects downstream of the signaling.

258
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:57,450
So it's complicated and confusing. Yeah. So what would we to increase?

259
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:02,760
And so you know, exercise will temporarily.

260
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:08,730
Which Senator. So the exercise would be that the soluble receptor.

261
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,430
And that's locally produced.

262
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:26,719
So this is this is really confusing. And the other thing that Il6 does when it's produced from exercise is that it

263
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:33,770
increases GLP one and it suppresses appetite in terms of appetite suppression.

264
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:41,690
You have to reach a certain threshold. I don't know if that threshold is as established, but in terms of the amino acid level.

265
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:48,739
But if you exercise intensely, usually after that intense bout of exercise,

266
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:57,500
you might not feel hungry if you're sick and you have a systemic inflammatory response that's going to suppress your appetite.

267
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:01,520
And IL six is one of the things that justice. Okay.

268
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:13,370
So the last thing I want to add is that a third of the il6 that you have circulating in your body is from adipose tissue.

269
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,070
So in general, people who have more adiposity will have a higher level of survival sex.

270
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:24,509
Remember, it's being produced here and this is the first organ that season delivery.

271
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:31,580
And perhaps I kind of explains why I'll say it's produced in adipose tissue has a different effect

272
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:44,320
on the liver with IL six produced in the muscle structure and a heater coming over overall.

273
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:51,130
Like, what is it? Let me check the weather app, which is the heater it's been.

274
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,920
Yeah, it's finally came on an Airbus.

275
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:05,419
So these are the pro-inflammatory signals that are well-characterized in IL six.

276
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:12,590
There's some confusion if I'm going to talk about two anti-inflammatory adipocytes

277
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:16,100
that are fairly well characterized and that were mentioned in your reading,

278
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:23,240
the first of which is a dip injected dip in actin was discovered about the same time as leptin.

279
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:33,870
Sure. University of Texas Southwestern, one of the people who first discovered this dip.

280
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:39,230
A kind. And here's the primary source is the adipocyte.

281
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:45,560
Yeah. There there's some research showing that if you stain heart muscle on these stains cement that the glial

282
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:53,150
cells you'll see positive staining for two different active but the primary sources at the adipocyte.

283
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:02,990
And the interesting thing about this certificate is that it has a complex structure, but Lupton is just a helical molecule.

284
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:09,230
Low molecular weight circulates in their blood, can easily get to your tissues connected to a lot of different things.

285
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:20,840
It's a big molecule. It has a client in this domain and it has this globular domain and it can circulate your

286
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:28,340
blood in different forms by a monomer or what's known as a high molecular weight complex,

287
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:40,190
which is shown up here. And the one with the greatest biological activity is the one with the high molecular weight showing up here.

288
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,990
It's hard to use a pointer on a white screen.

289
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:55,190
So this is the one with the highest biological activity and there are different receptors for a different act in different tissues.

290
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:01,520
And it has in general an anti-inflammatory influence.

291
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:06,530
So in the presence of cytokines, it can suppress inflammation.

292
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:19,310
And in terms of insulin sensitivity, it can promote insulin sensitivity, it enhances beta oxidation,

293
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:26,630
it enhances complement for the insulin sensitive insulin transport, glucose transporter, sorry.

294
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:32,510
And it can promote the genesis, as I mentioned before.

295
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:35,960
So it increases that sensitivity.

296
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:44,900
And down here it shows you its immunosuppressive effects to some of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TANF and interferon gamma.

297
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:56,270
Listed below this are a couple of anti-inflammatory cytokines IO ten and interleukin one receptor alpha.

298
00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:05,700
Those are anti-inflammatory side effects. So under the influence of high levels of active, you have a greater insulin sensitivity,

299
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:14,010
you have greater hyperplasia of the different sites and you have a suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

300
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,250
So here are some bullet points about adiponectin.

301
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:40,660
Interestingly, if you were to measure different all the time, hundreds of them measuring.

302
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:45,510
I'm just showing you the best. Well study ones. Adiponectin would be fine.

303
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:57,860
By far the highest concentration. It circulates in the blood in micrograms per gram quantities, which is an order of magnitude less than a gram now.

304
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:07,910
So it's much, much higher. And if you have an instance where you have more adipose tissue in that visceral compartment,

305
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,650
in humans and in mice, you see lower levels of circulating at different actin.

306
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:21,830
And having lower levels of circulating adiponectin are associated with insulin resistance.

307
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:31,940
And if you were to look at a large AP study for measure in a population of people to measurement of insulin sensitivity and adiponectin,

308
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:41,990
you'll find it's inverse relationship or adiponectin that's one specific, high connected, more sensitivity.

309
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:55,000
And importantly it disconnectedness has been shown to play a protective role, direct protective role in cardiovascular disease.

310
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,980
And I'll show you a slide here in a minute what that scenario looks like.

311
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:07,690
There are some instances in which certain behaviors can suppress adiponectin levels.

312
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:17,280
One of these is smoking. So if you were to measure adiponectin levels at smokers, you'd find lower levels of this particular difficulty.

313
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:23,940
Yeah. Is that an independently of BMI?

314
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:34,540
Because I know like smokers typically independent of BMI. Yes, it's higher in women and lower in men.

315
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,810
It's lower in African Americans.

316
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:48,790
And stress has been shown to lower levels of depression as well.

317
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:55,450
So if you study a population of people who have socio economic stress,

318
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:00,760
you can actually find significantly lower levels of a difference in the circulating.

319
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:07,420
A lot of a lot of things going on there. But yeah, go ahead.

320
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:16,390
Have they established a causal relationship between Adiponectin and stress or because this is just association, it's association.

321
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,730
So they wouldn't know whether it would be like a load of causing stress or.

322
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,780
Yeah. To my knowledge, no, it's an association. Yeah.

323
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:30,550
So it doesn't mean this smoking is related to insulin resistance.

324
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:39,890
Look through it through this adiponectin pathway. I don't know about the literature that is looked at.

325
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:50,240
That in particular. It's a possibility. The thing that you've got to understand about a different message is that the molecular weights matter

326
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:55,430
and the higher molecular weights are better than the lower rates in terms of all of its functions.

327
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:02,540
And one of the things that smoking does is it destroys a higher molecular weight.

328
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:09,620
It destroys the molecules such that it doesn't have its physiologic effects.

329
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:16,780
So proteases can break down that that higher molecular weight structure in the process.

330
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:25,810
That's one of the mechanisms by which smoking can interfere with the activity or the levels of that.

331
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:37,380
So if you have you have high levels of aging. And exactly why that happens is thought to be due to where most of your adiponectin comes from.

332
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:45,180
It turns out that the majority of your adiponectin comes from bone marrow, adipose tissue.

333
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,650
So that's really interesting.

334
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:56,250
And I've got a slide that kind of goes over the studies that were done to, to, to establish that finding both humans and mice.

335
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:04,700
So as you get older, you more ability to form active blood starts to come out of police declines.

336
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:10,970
So that population of cells in your bones shrinks and it's replaced by bone marrow adipocytes.

337
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:16,560
And that level is associated with higher levels of the connective.

338
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:25,420
Calorie restriction will increase adiponectin as well as bone marrow adipocytes.

339
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:38,020
So people with very low body mass will have higher levels of a different action and higher levels of bone adipose tissue, bone marrow plus tissue.

340
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:50,620
And there are certain drugs that can increase a dip infected so that cortisol like hormone dexamethasone can increase adiponectin.

341
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:58,760
And then the signs of Leonard being diamonds.

342
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:02,810
You've seen some some slides on what Pioglitazone does.

343
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,620
These drugs can increase next month's.

344
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:12,040
Okay. So these are par agonists and they increase.

345
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,040
So how do we know who figured this out?

346
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:24,050
That the bone marrow is the primary source connected to humans in mice?

347
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:34,320
Well, the studies that were actually done here at the University of Michigan or among McDougald was interested in what the heck is this?

348
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:41,010
The importance of bone marrow, adipose tissue. And it seems to play an important role in phone.

349
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:46,530
But in this case, he was interested in what the bone marrow was produced.

350
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:58,290
So they're looking at here individuals with anorexia nervosa and those who are undergoing cancer chemotherapy.

351
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:09,000
So it's both these interests and it's in both of these conditions, you have to decrease caloric intake and negative energy balance.

352
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:17,430
And as a consequence, white adipose tissue in the periphery, subcutaneous, visceral decline.

353
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:26,820
However, the bone marrow, adipose tissue increases and circulating next levels increase.

354
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:42,930
And when you measured adiponectin now in the bone marrow adipose tissue, you find that its secretion is increasing as it is expanding.

355
00:48:46,710 --> 00:49:00,900
So to figure out what's going on here in terms of which cell types are responsible for most of the adiponectin for food,

356
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:13,680
they developed this mouse that they were able to genetically dissolve in them such that their bone marrow adipose tissue could not expand.

357
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,730
So here's the experimental condition.

358
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:26,729
They have a mouse where they induce calorie restriction and they have another group of mice, and they do the same thing in calorie restriction,

359
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:33,480
except that they have this genetic means of preventing bone marrow, adipose tissue from expanding.

360
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:41,910
So here's what happens to a lot of places in the bone marrow with calorie restriction.

361
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:48,570
This red area here represents a matter that when excels,

362
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:59,310
it declines with counter restriction and and in the wild type animal the bone marrow adipocytes increase in size and number.

363
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:06,720
And there are a number of metabolic adaptations that occur in muscle in response to this.

364
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:13,079
So you have an increase in the PEROXISOME proliferator, activated receptor,

365
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:19,650
gamma activator, and this is a positive regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis.

366
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:25,050
You also have an increase in the transcription factor of proteins important for mitochondrial function.

367
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:34,709
Then you have increased circulating adiponectin well in the mice where they genetically design

368
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:41,520
them such that the bone marrow adipose tissue could not expand its loss to the present.

369
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:55,139
And another number of patients, not only cancer therapy, cancer, and that again causes this negative energy balance.

370
00:50:55,140 --> 00:51:04,410
We found lower levels of the definite. They also found lower levels of a disconnected in people who are chronically treated with the cortical sex.

371
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:20,760
Okay. So if you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, you might be on a drug inhaled drug that controls inflammation and steroids.

372
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:29,700
It's like a cortisol derivative is dexamethasone if you are on these chronically to control inflammation.

373
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:34,730
This has been shown to increase circulating at different levels.

374
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:54,720
All right. So just to clarify, the right side of the figure is the genetically modified cells so that both groups of mice were restricted.

375
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:59,220
One had inhibited adipose tissue expansion.

376
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,110
And it's lost the adaptations, the muscle and its loss increases.

377
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:08,100
So there's a mouse at the top of. Yeah.

378
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:15,570
Yes. Sure.

379
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:22,490
I'm sorry to say this was observed in patients.

380
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:25,610
I mean, I'm sorry. What did you say about cancer?

381
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:37,280
So in cancer patients who are undergoing chemotherapy, they have a negative energy balance and they lose weight, adipose tissue.

382
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:42,620
But their bone marrow, adipose tissue expands. Okay.

383
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:51,560
And if you calorie restrict a mouse or a human hair bone, adipose tissue expands as well and their amount of blood cell population declines.

384
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:56,480
Does this apply to the bone cancer patients? Yes.

385
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:05,360
However, if it's a bone marrow cancer that's expanding hematopoietic cells, it would be a different relationship.

386
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:09,620
That's my question. That's that's a bit different. That's a different scenario that.

387
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,650
But if you're on chemotherapy, you're going to lose weight. Okay.

388
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:19,840
All right, so one more figure here.

389
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:29,470
This is some plasma, a low plasma type, an action associated with coronary heart disease, but not hypertension in high risk non-diabetic patients.

390
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,290
So this is on the on the. This is a clinical study.

391
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:40,360
They're looking at people and they divided them up in tertiles of a different type of plasma.

392
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:45,129
And they have an adjusted coronary artery disease score here.

393
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:46,540
So the higher would be worse.

394
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:58,470
And when you look at the highest tertile of adiponectin, you find that they have a lower adjusted coronary artery disease score.

395
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,540
So based on this type of information.

396
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:07,989
A number of experiments were done looking at what Adiponectin does in terms of its caps,

397
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:16,180
its ability to prevent after Genesis or the formation of fatty streaks or plaques in the arteries of the heart.

398
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:23,530
And and a number of these studies, they found that Adiponectin had protective effects.

399
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:29,559
So one of the things that happens in after genesis of bone cell formation,

400
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:39,520
just first there has to be the adhesion of a circulating monocyte to the end of filial cells within the vasculature of the heart.

401
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:47,950
So that first event can be inhibited in the presence of the connection and the expression of these heat and adhesion

402
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:57,110
molecules in both the MONOCYTE and the endothelial cells is decreased in the presence of higher levels of the connected.

403
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:09,669
Okay. The other thing that disconnected does is that it can inhibit this scavenger receptor,

404
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:19,180
and this is a receptor that's expressed on the surface of monocytes that recognizes oxidized LDL.

405
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:26,320
And I'll talk about the process of that for Genesis more when we get to cardiovascular disease.

406
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:31,930
So it can downregulate this receptor in the monocytes.

407
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:41,830
So is atherosclerosis. You have the acquisition of these monocytes within the fatty streak.

408
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:47,100
And these cells differentiate into what's known as a foam cell.

409
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:56,760
We have a foamy appearance where there vacuoles have lots of lipids in them and they can increase in number.

410
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:08,250
Well, if an active can inhibit this process and the other thing that happens within a fatty streak there after Genesis

411
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:15,840
is a proliferation of split muscle cells that kind of causes the diameter of the artery to become more narrow.

412
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:28,469
And a dip in that that can inhibit that process as it did so in the anti lavatory

413
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:33,990
beneficial in terms of preventing chronic disease is to protect its function.

414
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:44,649
So for a long time Adiponectin was the sole anti-inflammatory, added the kind that was studied.

415
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:53,410
Then the next one came around. Around. It was discovered in 2010 and this is that secreted frizzled protein five.

416
00:56:53,430 --> 00:57:02,579
This was the study published in the journal Science that showed that adipose tissue is a source

417
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:09,030
of this and it is an anti-inflammatory and it improves its protective and metabolic function.

418
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:18,480
So they they designed a study in which they knocked out this SFR P five and then they fed the animals a normal diet or a high fat diet.

419
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:27,720
And they noticed that only under the high fat diet conditions shown here in circles did they see a difference in glucose levels.

420
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:36,780
So the field built symbols are from the knockout and the open samples are from the wild type animals.

421
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,980
So the higher level of glucose or in the animals that were fed the high fat diet,

422
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:45,990
the lower levels of glucose are shown here with the animal spreads in the normal diet.

423
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:56,080
Then this is, um. Glucose levels of percent of control after giving them insulin.

424
00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:03,730
And you can see that you have less of a decline in blood glucose after this.

425
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:11,200
So but what goes down in the animals that are in normal diet, the insulin resistance, animals that are fed the high fat diet.

426
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:17,450
There's less of a decline in the animals that have this sfr p a different type knocked out.

427
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:28,790
So the next thing they looked at was you see the presence of lipid droplets.

428
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:32,620
So if there's insulin resistance, perhaps there's issues with.

429
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:38,670
Lipid being able to control lipid adipocytes and so on.

430
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:50,339
So this is the triglyceride levels of lipid and liver and when compared to slide staining for this and you find that when you quantitate this,

431
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:54,120
there's more triglycerides in liver in the knockouts compared to the wildtype.

432
00:58:56,220 --> 00:59:02,070
Let's look at the key inhibitor of the adipocytes.

433
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,330
They're a little bit higher in the knockout animal compared to the wild type.

434
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:13,230
Some of you are asking questions about, you know, this homogeneity or heterogeneity of adipocytes within adipose tissue.

435
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:17,220
And as you can see, it's fairly heterogeneous in terms of their diameter.

436
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:25,140
In both instances, it's just that there's the average adipocyte diameter is greater than knockout.

437
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:39,940
And then I mentioned to you that you have expansion of adipose tissue through the process of hypertrophy, that it's associated with more inflammation,

438
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:48,820
and that inflammation is coming from the recruitment of the mononuclear cells and that become tissue macrophages.

439
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:53,890
That's what should be the work of this figure here.

440
00:59:53,950 --> 01:00:04,330
So here's a wild type and here's a knockout. And this green stain is a marker for macrophages now.

441
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:14,290
So the monocytes can be recruited to react with tissue and differentiate into a tissue and adipose tissue macrophage and HDL.

442
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:24,910
That's what's shown here. So in the animals that have this SFR P five knocked out, they have more macrophages in their adipose tissue.

443
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:39,550
So I focused in previous illustrations on Adiponectin and Adipose Genesis.

444
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:53,020
It turns out that this SFR p five secreted frizzled related protein has an interesting effect in a type of genesis.

445
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:56,920
So another pro-inflammatory environment.

446
01:00:57,430 --> 01:01:05,680
So you have the red macrophages here in the upper caption secreting TNF and 25 a.

447
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,740
These inhibit a type of genesis.

448
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:23,939
And then in opposition to this you have SFR P five and adiponectin that inhibit the functions of the macrophage molecules

449
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:34,650
that contribute to the genesis of this competition between the two that can drive the process of adipose tissue expansion.

450
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:41,400
So what does SFR P five do? It's an anti-inflammatory soluble mediator.

451
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:47,200
You can measure it in mice and humans. You can measure adipose tissue and you can measure it zero.

452
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:56,160
But it since it's been discovered recently, you'll find many fewer papers on it compared to a dip in that.

453
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:07,470
So it sequesters days went proteins that inhibit hyperplasia and ended the genesis.

454
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:18,300
It prevents them from binding to their receptor and under normal circumstances, in the absence of SFR, you would get a pro-inflammatory environment.

455
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:30,930
But this is blocked by the action of SFR P5, so it has beneficial effects on metabolic function.

456
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:40,530
So it provides some balance that can't it can overpower the effects of the pro-inflammatory signals here.

457
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:47,750
And and if you were to just take an animal and overfeed it with a high fat diet,

458
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:53,930
or if you were to look at circulating levels of this protein in the blood or somebody with a higher BMI, find it lower.

459
01:02:55,710 --> 01:03:05,490
And if you were to take this SFR p five and inject it in an animal, I don't know if it's done in a human yet,

460
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:14,070
but you would find that it reduces insulin resistance and systemically suppresses inflammation.

461
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:29,280
So if you were to put this a kind and animals fed a high fat diet, you'd find that it improves metabolic function as well.

462
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:40,020
So this is a molecule interest in the pharmaceutical industry to treat people with metabolic dysfunction.

463
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:51,570
Okay. So here's the summary for advocates that so adipose tissue secretes hundreds of different

464
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:57,389
types of finds that are a form of communication between the cells within the adipose tissue,

465
01:03:57,390 --> 01:04:06,570
but with other distant organs. So this relates to the current and endocrine function of these adipocytes.

466
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:11,540
And adipose tissue expands.

467
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:18,110
And when you have this hypertrophic type of expansion, you get more pro-inflammatory of different kinds.

468
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:28,729
They have local and systemic effects from the adipocytes and actually have the initiation and progression of obesity

469
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:35,870
induced metabolic and cardiovascular events as a consequence under the influence of the pro-inflammatory depictions.

470
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:46,810
And then the idea with using anti-inflammatory, a different kinds of stuff is to counteract the pro-inflammatory of different types of trigger states.

471
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:54,210
Okay. So those are the two different kinds. These are proteins that are primarily produced by these adipocytes.

472
01:04:55,690 --> 01:05:01,420
There are other things, other that have endocrine like effects.

473
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:12,760
And these next category of mediators are known as the little toxins are essentially lipids and the adipose tissue actually produces.

474
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:23,440
And here are some examples. You have a totally eight you have fatty acid, ester of hydroxy fatty acids or the pores are five bars,

475
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:30,250
and then you have 12, 13 die, which is the one I'm going to be talking about.

476
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:37,380
So what you need to remember about these is that they have both paraquat and endocrine effects.

477
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:46,920
They can regulate a lot of different processes like lipids, glucose homeostasis, energy balance and inflammation and tissue repair.

478
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:54,389
And this is one of the newer things that have has been discovered in terms

479
01:05:54,390 --> 01:06:01,020
of the adipose tissue derived factor that has diverse physiologic functions.

480
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:15,710
That have larger functions. One particular little time that's received a lot of attention recently is this 1213 dial.

481
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:26,660
And this one plays a role in fatty acid uptake in muscle during exercise or from exercise, as you say.

482
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:39,080
So it was determined that this particular diet, this particular lipid kind, was produced from brown adipose tissue.

483
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:47,720
So if you put someone in a cold environment enough to make them cool their body temperature, but not enough to make them shiver,

484
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:57,260
or you gave them a period of time to exercise, you would find that levels of this level would increase.

485
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:01,430
Let's just hope that sugary.

486
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:08,140
So that again you said that is the level of the shivering to cuddle on.

487
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:17,090
Yes. Yes. It's not thermogenesis, not it's not shivering, thermogenesis, what you're trying to do to fire up the brown adipose tissue cells.

488
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:30,110
So this particular depiction increases energy expenditure and it stimulates fatty acid uptake and oxidation in the muscle.

489
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:36,830
So it's produced by brown adipose tissue and it has its effects on skeletal muscle.

490
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:46,459
And the way they figured out that brown adipose tissue was the source of this little kind is what they did in humans.

491
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:54,860
After this exercise, they could take a muscle biopsy and they could look at a fatty acid oxygen, a fatty acid uptake.

492
01:07:55,580 --> 01:08:02,540
They could do the same experiment, except that in these experiments they could remove the brown adipose tissue from the mice.

493
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:12,720
And do the same type of, um, paradigm, or I should say program in which they exercise mice.

494
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:21,300
You could put them on a treadmill, mouse treadmills that you can use again, or you can put them on an exercise wheel, whatever the case might be.

495
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:25,260
And then animals that had brown adipose tissue,

496
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:33,030
we can measure this long time and animals where they removed the brown adipose tissue, they didn't measure nearly as much.

497
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:55,190
So go ahead, Sally. The tests at this point, it's important for solution and also have the effect on the press and prosecution, too.

498
01:08:55,290 --> 01:09:11,460
Yes. And then lastly, another type of adipose tissue secreted factor is it drives a exosome.

499
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:25,350
McRaney So and there are probably other things within this particular vesicle, this is an X is something this is a micro vesicle secreted by cells.

500
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:29,340
And it turns out that adipose tissue tends to create a lot of these.

501
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:39,420
So these are really small bubbles that have this lipid bilayer can circulate in your blood.

502
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:47,910
And they contain all sorts of different things. The focus of this slide is on the microRNAs.

503
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:55,860
Remember that? Something that has epigenetic effects that can inhibit, um, gene transcription.

504
01:09:56,310 --> 01:10:01,500
But there are other bioactive compounds and here there protein synthesis of exosomes.

505
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:15,390
There was a study done a few years ago where they knocked out a gene that was responsible for this effect.

506
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:22,350
And they found that it had profound effects systemically.

507
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:31,830
So if you prevent this release of RNA through this EXOSOME release, it can have a lot of different effects.

508
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:39,680
So. So that remember that the non-coding RNAs are shared between cells through these exosomes.

509
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:49,150
And one of the my friends of interest was this microRNA 34.

510
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:56,440
Hey, it's the only one I'm going to mention here. So this is mere 34, which is produced by white adipose tissue.

511
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:04,090
What this does is that it has an effect on adipose tissue, macrophages.

512
01:11:06,190 --> 01:11:16,390
So this is another player in that balance of macrophage differentiation from the M1 to the M2 phenotype.

513
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:27,050
So in this scenario, number 34, A, that is thought to inhibit the M2 polarization.

514
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:35,400
So you have here the increases in here.

515
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:45,570
Here's the scenario. Here you have the white adipose tissue and you have the macrophage here and it's secreting of Mir 34 A

516
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:57,279
and it's preventing the polarization of the macrophages and it's having an effect on insulin resistance.

517
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:04,420
So I think I'm looking at this slide. I'm looking at matters like, wait a minute, this should if this is inhibiting M2 polarization.

518
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:08,020
Oh, yeah. Okay. It's it's not it's it's not described.

519
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:13,270
So it would prevent the macrophages from becoming an M2 macrophage.

520
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:17,260
Okay, I can tell by your expression you're having trouble with that relationship.

521
01:12:18,190 --> 01:12:22,540
So you have macrophages and then adipose tissue has different attitude.

522
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:36,280
And what I have to. And M2 is the one that promotes insulin sensitivity and promotes tissue remodeling but doesn't inhibit Genesis,

523
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:39,610
and the M1 is the pro-inflammatory one.

524
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:55,150
So in addition to that, you have this RNA now that is preventing the macrophage from becoming more of a good one to the M2 macrophage,

525
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:59,170
and that's contributing to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance.

526
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:05,860
So the point of all of this was there's a lot of hormones that are produced by adipose tissue.

527
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:09,640
It is the largest. And to transplant into your body.

528
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:22,360
Yeah. Nica. So you were saying if there's high levels of and mice are ready for a year, 34 area is empty.

529
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:27,160
Yes. So if you had something that prevented that from happening.

530
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:47,490
Yes. So here are the key points from today's typical lecture.

531
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:57,299
So white on white, brown, adipose tissue secrete many different kinds of kinds and varieties with local paraffin and systemic effects

532
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:02,490
on the brain and pancreatic beta cells in the liver and skeletal muscle and cardiovascular system.

533
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:12,230
The production and secretion of depictions of liver kinds is and is dependent on the energy status of the adipose tissue.

534
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:18,469
And then through this endocrine action, these factors contribute to systemic energy metabolism.

535
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:23,750
Appetite. Summary Genesis. Glucose Metabolism and lipid metabolism.

536
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:26,599
Healthy States White and brown.

537
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:35,450
Adipose tissue secrete endocrine factors that maintain organ functions and metabolic homeostasis in hypertrophic adipocytes.

538
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:44,110
Hypertrophic vigor, adipocytes and adipose tissue resident immune cells accelerate a chronic

539
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:51,190
pro-inflammatory profile and have altered secretion of a tip accounts and lipo kinds,

540
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:54,460
thereby exacerbating cardio metabolic disease.

541
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:00,760
So preclinical pre-clinical studies are charted in animal models and in cell culture.

542
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:08,820
And clinical studies done with humans show that activating or inhibiting signals of specific depictions of

543
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:14,740
lipid tides could be an approach suitable to treat and prevent the development of cardiovascular disease.

544
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:23,980
However, in almost all cases, efficacy and safety in humans need to be proven.

545
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:34,030
All right, so this is one and I don't know if we're going to have time to talk about perception studies,

546
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:43,510
but here is at the center of it all the different sites having secreting these

547
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:47,740
factors that affect many different physiologic functions that are mentioned here.

548
01:15:48,550 --> 01:15:57,879
I mentioned a few of them. And the point of this is to say your adipose tissue does a lot of things and secreting

549
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:02,310
a lot of these endocrine factors that have significant effects physiologically.

550
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:09,660
There are others that I could have mentioned as well. All right.

551
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:15,100
Um, got 5 minutes. I don't know if we have enough time to talk about the liposuction studies.

552
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:21,340
Any. Any comments or questions at this point? Just a few minutes left.

553
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:29,120
Yeah, I know. That opens opens on on on seven.

554
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:38,820
Yeah. So that just beyond what we've covered so far and that will beyond what we've covered since the last test.

555
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:41,590
Yes, I know. We're like a little behind. Yes.

556
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:52,330
So what we've covered thus far up to this point, that time is not going to the lifeless section because that's going to be a longer discussion.

557
01:16:53,980 --> 01:17:00,100
Okay. So Chris will drop on Thursday and you'll have till Monday morning to finish it.

558
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:10,810
Um, any questions? The grader still working on the exams and those grades too, since I can't see any questions or comments at this point.

559
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:17,680
Yeah. You know, I think that you answered this a lot, but I'm still kind of confused about it.

560
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:27,820
It's going back to cancer therapy since the cancer therapy in Chris.

561
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:34,510
And it's not a cancer therapy having a direct effect.

562
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:41,470
It's that it causes a negative energy balance and a negative energy balance because of the chemotherapy.

563
01:17:43,530 --> 01:17:49,110
The bone marrow, adipose tissue expands and more.

564
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:56,080
I don't know. Maybe she said the answer to your question.

565
01:17:56,170 --> 01:17:59,880
The bone marrow cancers are different. Oh, yeah.

566
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:05,030
Oh, yeah. Is it cancer with the radiation?

567
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:09,880
How it affected but not addressed to the specific region of bone marrow cancer.

568
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:17,830
That's different. Okay. Okay. That's no wonder I ask you.

569
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:22,330
Thank you. Okay. So I will see you next week.

570
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:30,610
We'll talk about this is interesting, um, infection control studies and we'll see how that turns out.

571
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:52,750
I'm certainly going to find out about, you know, what it's like working with the bar.

572
01:18:55,950 --> 01:19:23,860
The doctors right now were like, oh, sorry, I didn't realize their take the dirty work is going to start any more.

573
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:28,670
We just hope. Yeah, right, right.

574
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:52,750
I just know that I want to get to discuss it at the end of the week and I want to make sure it's being told to the crows and their families.

575
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:57,190
And I want to do that. Okay.
