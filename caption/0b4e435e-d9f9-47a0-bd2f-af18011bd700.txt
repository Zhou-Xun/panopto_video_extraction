1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,900
Okay. Sorry, Sergeant. Try to threshold them at values.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,930
He knows. He knows the rest of us. Threshold limit values which OSHA base their powers on.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,060
But HGH updates their threshold limit values.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,960
Maybe once a year based on new information.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:29,490
So when you're looking at companies that want to do best practices and be on the cutting edge of occupational health and safety,

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:36,080
they'll generally follow recommendations from Nayak or TALVEZ.

7
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,520
When people are trying to go for what OSHA's aiming for, like we said, they're just aiming for that secret.

8
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,710
But because of the way that policy is structured, OSHA is the only regulatory body.

9
00:00:50,340 --> 00:01:01,080
So if you look at something like most chemicals, you can look up what the OPL is, and generally you'll see that OSHA has a number.

10
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:08,280
And Nyasha says half of that number, meaning they're more conservative, which in this case is a good thing.

11
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:18,840
So just say, for example, Tal, you mean according to OSHA, you're allowed to be exposed to 200 parts per million over an eight hour workday?

12
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:26,129
Most likely, Nilesh will say, actually, you can only be exposed to 100 parts per million or something like ammonia rather

13
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,840
than a thousand parts per million for an eight hour workday like OSHA would say,

14
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,320
Nilesh would say only 500. What's the holdup?

15
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,719
Why don't they just take the best practices that just Congress and politics?

16
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,420
Or is it? Yeah, because you have to push through to get it updated.

17
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:52,650
So I think it's like since the 1970s, maybe less than 50 panels have been updated.

18
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,450
It's a really small number.

19
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:04,049
They have a big impact on the companies that use these with it being a pretty big financial burden on them, or just like they probably wouldn't.

20
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:08,670
But it's like they're working against like whenever you're advocating for these to be lower,

21
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:15,059
you're working against all of the most like financially powerful industries in the country.

22
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,140
So they're lobbying probably too much to overcome most of the time.

23
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:28,080
Yeah, well, so, so like just say, for example, like we've talked about before,

24
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:34,130
like this manufacturing company that makes the T stands for basketballs, they actually have a spray booth in there.

25
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:45,540
So if you are, you know, using this mixture of of paints and aerosols and you're going off the current OSHA panels from the 1970s,

26
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:51,750
it might be just sufficient for you to wear like a full face mask with cartridges.

27
00:02:51,750 --> 00:03:02,730
Right? But if they tur if they change the ovals to be more conservative, each mask has something called maximum use of concentration,

28
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,970
where it's only so good as long as what you're being exposed to in the environment isn't more than that.

29
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:17,040
And if it's more than that, you have to either use a higher level respirator which will cost more, or you have to implement something else.

30
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,460
Like you have to retrofit a better h back system.

31
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,770
Those things cost money, right?

32
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:30,300
So rather than just doing kind of more or less like the bare, the bare minimum it would cost them and people don't like change.

33
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,170
People hate change generally. 50 years.

34
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:45,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree. But you know, and if you plan to go into policy and do some some lobbying now, okay.

35
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:53,550
So in the U.S., in the domain of policy making, you know, we have laws which are created by the legislature,

36
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,600
funded by the executive office, interpreted by the judiciary.

37
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,149
And then you have regulations which are detailed policies on implementations of law

38
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,040
developed and enforced by a government agency as directed by the executive branch.

39
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:17,370
And that's why you see the power and, and reach and breadth of regulations change as administrations change.

40
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:26,460
Non governmental policies are like guidelines which are nonbinding and then directives, but also like recommendations as well.

41
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:33,059
So here we are. We talked about OSHA. Some people say it was 1970, some people say was 1971.

42
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:38,610
Because you get from December 1970 with only one, you know, in government, everything takes a long time to happen.

43
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,670
We also have the Department of Labor, which is mine and Safety and Health Administration.

44
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,299
So technically, if you work in a mine, OSHA doesn't have any power.

45
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:58,410
They're just because the mining administration essentially serves focused on mines just because their occupational hazards are so specific.

46
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,180
Then you have the department. Of transportation that looks at like the transportation of hazardous materials.

47
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,520
Federal Aviation Administration and Federal Railway Administration.

48
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:20,590
And then your Department of Defense. So I said, nice, here is the non regulatory agency and they usually focus on best practices.

49
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,640
The headquarters is in Morgantown, West Virginia.

50
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,750
Interestingly, I had a chance to visit a couple of summers ago.

51
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,590
It's a really cool building in Morgantown, you know.

52
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,900
You know, it's in West Virginia. You know, a lot of.

53
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:43,960
So the United States used to be like a huge. It used to be more focused on mining.

54
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:49,990
So West Virginia was a huge state for setting up like occupational bases for that.

55
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:56,379
So their headquarters is in West Morgantown, but they also have a office in D.C.

56
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:02,350
Atlanta, Denver, Cincinnati, Spokane.

57
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:08,170
Juneau, Alaska. And then somewhere in California, I forget.

58
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:14,229
I'm so impressed that you are. They look past like the federal, like, kind of.

59
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,470
Yeah. And like we're region five. Yeah. Yeah.

60
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,660
The only reason I know that is because I thought I wanted to work at Nash for a little bit,

61
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,510
and I realized I did it because things move too slowly there.

62
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,650
And I found a little busybody academia's faster.

63
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,980
Oh, yeah, certain aspects. But then certain aspects.

64
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:48,270
Not that. Like the action and like results. Yeah, but now I work more than 40 hours a week, so probably for this for the same salary to take, kind of.

65
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,810
But you're not in most for gaokao. Yes, I'm not.

66
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:58,200
But if I was, I probably would have worked in Cincinnati, which is more like the worker's comp, where the workers comp people are located.

67
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:04,080
But it's Cincinnati. Yeah, it's Ohio. Yeah, that's so that's like, not better.

68
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:12,060
That's that's true. Well, you know, Ohio's state motto, find it here, find work.

69
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,730
Don't know. That's when you drive across the border, just says find it here. And then ours is part of Michigan.

70
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,079
The minute you come in, you just run over budget potholes.

71
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,170
You just. Yeah. So these here in particular.

72
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,250
So the Occupational Safety and Health Act established OSHA knowledge,

73
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,040
but it also established the Occupational Safety and Health Regulatory Commission,

74
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:44,970
which essentially serves as the legal branch of occupational health, which we'll get to in a second.

75
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:56,430
But the big one is that essentially the ACA says that employers are required to furnish like a workplace free of hazards.

76
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,800
Right. But obviously, we know that that doesn't necessarily always happen.

77
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:09,090
So the major problem with why not improve our occupational health policies and regulations?

78
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,610
So we're looking at science versus policy, right?

79
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:20,220
So with science, we're concerned about the truth, cause and effect policy is dealing with reality sometimes most of the time.

80
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,420
So where do you find the happy medium?

81
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:33,770
Dreams. And your dreams? Yeah. And a lot of times, you know, you do.

82
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:42,079
You can actually lobby. So as part of I'm funded partially by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Worker Training Program,

83
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:49,879
and we have to do these progress reports. And every year we have essentially these congressional reports where, like the program,

84
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:58,910
administrators will go before members of Congress with like a really easy five page kind of newsletter things saying like,

85
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:04,670
this is how many people we train, here's some cool photos, blah, blah, blah, trying to get to them,

86
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:11,180
like the impact of what this program is and its positives on their respective constituents.

87
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:17,930
Because, I mean, I think, you know, realistically, most people who work in government have bachelor's degrees,

88
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:26,270
maybe maybe sometimes a J.D. If they're a higher level politician, most of them don't have a science background.

89
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:30,620
Obviously, an occupational health worker.

90
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,549
Health is not like a sexy or controversial topic.

91
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:38,120
I mean, some people want less government regulation.

92
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:47,959
Right. But, you know, I think you'll be hard pressed to find any most people would say, oh, we want workers to be to live.

93
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:53,780
We don't want them to constantly die at work. But because it's an unexciting topic, it's not exciting.

94
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:58,880
Like abortion are like immigrants on the border.

95
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:06,260
It generally tends to just get ignored. So we're talking about this the other day, these state level, offshore plans.

96
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:18,229
So in the blue, the regular blue, this is a state approved OSHA plan that covers private, state and local government workplaces.

97
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:25,460
And then in the darker blue, it's an ocean state plan that covers state and local government workers only.

98
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:33,590
So not Illinois, New York, Maine, Connecticut, New Jersey, the Virgin Islands.

99
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:40,790
What do you notice about the states that have state level plans versus the ones that don't?

100
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,920
Political but political map overlay.

101
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,880
Yeah. Yeah. But interestingly, you know.

102
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:06,380
Yeah. I would say with the West, I feel like in Utah, like Arizona, like they were like there were big mining industries there.

103
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,620
So I think that like entice them where to do their own.

104
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,360
Yeah. And they must like the Appalachian area to Turkey.

105
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,590
So where are you gonna say something?

106
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:25,530
You know? Yeah.

107
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:35,910
In particular. And if we look at historically where union membership has been heaviest, it's always been heaviest on the West Coast, Hawaii,

108
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,910
New England and and then also like in in the parts of upper Midwest, like Michigan,

109
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:48,060
we have a ton of unionization here, like the United Auto Workers, the auto manufacturing industries.

110
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,490
Same with certain parts of the state.

111
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,260
But one thing that's come in to destroy unions essentially is is right to work.

112
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,720
How many of you have heard about this? Right to work.

113
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:13,170
So right to work. Some states are right to work, which means that if your workplace has the offer to unionize, you can decline union membership.

114
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:21,810
Because a lot of people, as time has gone on, the rate of union membership over the last century has decreased significantly.

115
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,630
And people don't really understand now what unions can do for you.

116
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:35,940
They see it rather just as every month, like out of my paycheck, my union dues are eating away at my paycheck.

117
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,530
So I'm going to say no to I'm going to opt out to being in a union.

118
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:45,390
I have my right to work right without being in a union. So I'm just going to do that.

119
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:53,940
But in turn, like, they lose a lot of their organizing ability, their ability to like ask for equal wages,

120
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,770
better working conditions, essentially mobilizing in that way.

121
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:06,840
So a lot of states in particular, and I would say red states have adopted this right to work principle.

122
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,880
I would say since the pandemic,

123
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:18,210
pro-union sentiment is making its way through like we've seen a couple of Starbucks use and not unionize some Trader Joe's.

124
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:26,550
But companies like Amazon and Starbucks are very vigilant about squashing down unions as soon as they happen,

125
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:33,540
like going so far as like spying on employee conversations like they can't have like

126
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,949
if they know if they have these conversations in the break rooms or or whatever,

127
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:46,830
like they're going to be monitored. And companies spend a lot of money, a lot of money to be anti-union.

128
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:54,000
I just learned after I worked at the Starbucks at Stansberry.

129
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,580
Oh, go ahead.

130
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:11,630
And I'm and we're one of the ones that voted to unionize in year three on point it was last spring was bad it was morale was so low because at

131
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:24,030
that higher ups where there is this one like the week where our district manager and like the person above her and then the person above her,

132
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:35,490
they all came in and like took us into the back like storage room, like a group of five or six of us at a time.

133
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:48,100
Just had an open conversation with us about making sure that we were all very educated and that we did our own research.

134
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:56,800
And Starbucks was kind enough to provide a website where we could find all of this information.

135
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,440
But it wasn't the Starbucks website, but it was Starbucks dot com slash something that was a.

136
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:13,070
Then like everyone's hours were hot it. Yeah.

137
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,940
Or did it unionize?

138
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,250
Yeah, we voted to unionize. But like all of the.

139
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,100
It's just a really long process. It is.

140
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:31,580
It is. And that's what they're banking on, right, is people giving up and losing momentum.

141
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,760
And in places like this, like in Starbucks in particular.

142
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,690
And like. Like the rate of turnover with inflation.

143
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:48,210
Yeah. Relatively high. Yeah. Cause you usually get, like, college students or, like, teenagers or places like that.

144
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:53,150
I think. I don't know if that's a long service, but they hired a lot of, like, high school aides.

145
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,979
Right. Because if they know you're an entry, that's probably your first job, right?

146
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:03,260
You're willing to accept more things, you're less experience.

147
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,590
You don't necessarily know what a good workplace looks like yet.

148
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:14,360
You know, now a lot of Trader Joe's are unionizing as well. As I mentioned, like some Starbucks that ended up successfully unionizing.

149
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,620
They just closed those those locations out of the times.

150
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,340
Yeah, I know if you worked at Starbucks during the pandemic,

151
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:30,440
but I remember when they were like kind of back in school where they had us do like a guided meditation about coming back to work during a pandemic.

152
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,059
And they were like, This is a new chapter. And I was like, I would only grow that iPad.

153
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,770
I was like going make me go back to work. But I don't want to be in unsafe working conditions.

154
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,040
Yeah. A guided meditation, something like that.

155
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,630
It was like the CEO. It was ridiculous. I was in. I was like, is everyone actually doing that?

156
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,160
Government has in you something like that. Yeah.

157
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:56,270
Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Thank you for having right on track for Starbucks.

158
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:05,120
Yeah. Yeah. If if unions weren't beneficial, I would just say, why would they work so hard to try to not get people to unionize?

159
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,049
It's we're in we're in late stage capitalism right now.

160
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:15,410
So at a different job, like a temporary job, it was for fear of being persecuted by the like the TJ family of companies.

161
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,940
Yes. This training they make you watch a video about why you should unionize.

162
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:23,390
Seems like a part of you require you go.

163
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:28,889
I know it is. It is. I'm trying to think you're so messed up.

164
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,950
They just go like, how? How is this legal? How interesting.

165
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,850
If you can watch, if you have access to the late night with John Oliver,

166
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:43,190
there's a pretty interesting half hour episode on unions and they kind of like make

167
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:48,370
a parody of like one of those videos they show employees about why unions are bad.

168
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:54,010
Just talk to us. Yeah. If you get a union like you can't talk to that.

169
00:17:54,350 --> 00:18:00,200
Yeah that's what our whole conversation like with that's reference to the that.

170
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:09,280
Think about this. The man you can't bring in the trash cans from the street anymore is.

171
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,480
If you ask the manager, we'll be able to do that like someone else.

172
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,340
I'm just going to do that. But that's not in my job description.

173
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,690
Yeah. You need to really, really care about who brought in.

174
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,620
Okay. Thank you.

175
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:35,870
So let's continue thinking about this in terms of psychosocial factors because we'll get to a point where you can want more discussion.

176
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:40,630
So with Asia in particular, with the burden of evidence,

177
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,640
essentially their goal is to protect all employees from impairment of health and functional capacity.

178
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:57,830
Right. But we obviously have major issues in terms of like current OSHA regulations have are super old, so they still have significant health risks.

179
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:04,280
So one of the biggest issues in the workplace in our modern world now is musculoskeletal disorders.

180
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:11,760
They contribute to about 30% of all injuries and chronic injuries in particular.

181
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:17,899
Billions of dollars in direct cost and then billions of dollars in indirect costs per year.

182
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:30,290
In the United States in 1999, they tried to put forth a regulation into law that would require ergonomics programs at workplaces.

183
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,740
Essentially, that would require ergonomic assessment of people.

184
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:38,390
Ergonomics is all about with Cheryl. We'll talk to you in our guest lecture down the line,

185
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:45,680
fitting the person for the task rather than forcing a person into a task that may not be appropriate for them.

186
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,660
ANTHROPOMETRIC It got struck down.

187
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:59,930
So they did draft the standard. It went to Congress and in and it was passed for about six months.

188
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:07,190
And then President George W Bush came into office and Congress revoked it.

189
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:15,140
So since then, we've not had an MSD or ergonomics standard, despite this being a huge problem.

190
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:25,280
I know you sprain them, but I myself just went to orthotics because I thought I had to.

191
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:32,600
It was like a whole ordeal. I had to get an MRI for something else and I got this like numbness and tingling over my hand.

192
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,499
And it did a bunch of times and they were like, Oh, you just actually have carpal tunnel.

193
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,500
And I was like, went to orthotics, got fit.

194
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:46,670
I was like, This is so sad. Like, I don't even like do manual labor in what it is like to be doing something little research all day.

195
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:53,569
And now I have carpal tunnel. But even for me, like with someone with like a really cushy office job,

196
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:59,120
imagine someone who works in construction, for example, someone who does a lot of manual lifting.

197
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:07,460
Huge issue. Another issue that's becoming more and more present is heat stress.

198
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:16,729
And so currently, anything related to the temperature and workers, whether that's cold stress or heat stress, falls under the general duty clause.

199
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:23,990
And the general duty clause is basically we don't have a specific regulation for this, like bloodborne pathogens and specific regulation,

200
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:29,150
respiratory protection as a specific regulation, we don't have a specific regulation for this.

201
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:37,730
So just falls under the general duty clause, which means like kind of like a catchall, like, okay, employers do your best to protect your employees.

202
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:44,900
So now with climate change, we've seen record breaking heat and a lot of deaths,

203
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:54,650
particularly of people of color who work in agriculture or construction work outside, dying from essentially heat stroke.

204
00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:06,560
But there is no standard nationally specific states have promulgated their own standards on heat if they have a state law where.

205
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:15,920
So in California, for example, they have a heat illness prevention standard that requires employers to provide training, water shade planning.

206
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:24,979
If the temperature is 80 degrees and above Minnesota, their heat standard only applies to indoor places.

207
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,810
They're talking like manufacturing facilities, warehouses.

208
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,010
And then in the state of Washington, they have an outdoor heat exposure rule.

209
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:39,260
But this is only three out of 50 states that are thinking about this right now.

210
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:48,440
We talked a little bit about fines the other day just to show you for comparison.

211
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:54,800
So we have a couple of categories. I was talking to you about McSwain, the steel manufacturing company, right?

212
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:04,610
So we have a couple of categories of fines. If you have a willful violation, that can be anywhere between 5000 to $70000.

213
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:13,160
But, you know, you can fine up to $250,000 per person or up to 500,000 per corporation if it's repeated.

214
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:18,920
But again, any of the fines in the OSHA category they can take to the.

215
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,390
See to have it reviewed and get the fine decreased or argue their way for it down.

216
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:33,340
So as I mentioned, like that guy in the documentary who died, they argue down his death to a misdemeanor and an $8,000 fine.

217
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:44,560
Serious violations can be up to 7000 other than serious violations at the 7000, failure to abate 7000 per day, per each violation.

218
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:53,590
And then if it's repeated but it's not well, for $70,000 per violation for the bait report, abate means like compliance.

219
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:57,130
And like you agreed that you would fix these certain things.

220
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,770
You know, you didn't. Yes.

221
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:12,630
Yes. Whereas if you look on the other side for the Clean Air Act, for every non-compliant vehicle or engine, about $45,000 each,

222
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:25,139
4500 per tampering event or sale of a defective device, and then up to $45,000 per day for reporting and recordkeeping violations.

223
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:32,820
If you kill an endangered species, depending on which it is, it's a $50,000 fine and you can be in prison for a year.

224
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:44,820
Cercla is so superfund sites is anywhere between 32.5 to 37.5 in the thousands each day for noncompliance.

225
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:51,900
Love Canal cost about over $4 million to clean up.

226
00:24:51,900 --> 00:25:02,070
And that was like, you know, the seventies, eighties, Rick, where you can charge a maximum penalty of up to $73,000 a day.

227
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:09,000
And Tosca is one year of criminal provisions and up to $50,000 per day.

228
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,790
So these are just some hard numbers to show you.

229
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:25,770
Again, the terms of light level, implicit level of consideration or care that they put in for the environment versus people themselves.

230
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:35,530
Do you think it's because if more people know it's more common than oceans, so it's just like they're going to have stricter that.

231
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:43,150
Could that be one factor? There are a lot more. I think.

232
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:48,070
I think I mean, I feel like people know equally about EPA and OSHA.

233
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:51,849
Is that not what you base your general opinion? I agree.

234
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:59,620
I think OSHA is more like workplace and then you write it off like freaking out here kind of deal that it's like common nature,

235
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:02,440
but that's just my subjectivity.

236
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:11,360
I was thinking that maybe like the oceans have never got an adjusted for inflation, like where the economy's actually at.

237
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:15,550
So like maybe when they passed this, that was a big deal.

238
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:22,360
And now it's just not they never changed it. Yeah, well, also, like EPA acts keep getting like amended or updated.

239
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,379
Right? Whereas like OSHA. Right.

240
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:37,030
But also with OSHA, you have tons and tons of employers, whereas with EPA, you have those employers polluting.

241
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:51,670
But there aren't as many industries to chase around like you generally have your heavy hitters mining, oil and gas production.

242
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:59,070
For Sting, for example, people who might be dumping into water sources.

243
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:06,940
But for OSHA, like they have to deal with anywhere from like The Cheesecake Factory to like Marathon Gas.

244
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,390
Right. So it's also about bandwidth.

245
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:15,640
EPA has a lot more person power itself, a lot more funding.

246
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:23,540
Okay. So back to this. How does it relate to psychosocial factors then?

247
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:27,440
How do these policies relate to psychosocial factors?

248
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,649
I'll show you a couple of things.

249
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:41,120
So, Simone, 2003, this is essentially what they postulated as the relationship between policy and then the social position in health.

250
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:51,440
So here you have your social position and health, which in turn, you know, your social position influences your economics,

251
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,870
your social, psychological and cultural spheres, and then also your behavioral sphere.

252
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,450
And all of this in turn impacts health.

253
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:12,440
McLeod And Smith countered this specific framework, saying that policy is the thing you needed most to get rid of.

254
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:21,230
Social inequalities in health in developed countries and policies in particular should be directed towards improving

255
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:29,270
physiological and behavioral risk profiles and improving the material circumstances of the disadvantaged.

256
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:35,870
Because they're saying that essentially if we're thinking about it at a multi level,

257
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:46,790
think about like the social ecological model making changes at that individual level, interpersonal level, even community level can only do so much.

258
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:53,840
But when you're trying to impact psychosocial factors, you have to target policies and target inequalities.

259
00:28:54,620 --> 00:29:00,560
So I'm going to have you all do a think pair share.

260
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:12,200
But before we do think per share, let's go back to the question what is what is psychosocial factors have to do with policy?

261
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:24,610
And vice versa. Quick policies can influence like the environment in which people work and also like I feel like they're their mental health.

262
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:32,890
Like if there's a policy protecting them that's being long worth backing out of their mental health, like, can you give me a specific example?

263
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:37,660
Not really. Okay, that's okay. Anyone else?

264
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:44,920
I think if I was a say in the workplace and factories and whatnot and kind of knowing that these regulations have an update and so on,

265
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:51,010
then I would feel like my government isn't looking out for my benefit and not give me a lot of stress and I just wouldn't like that.

266
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:55,060
So that's one thing. Yeah.

267
00:29:55,210 --> 00:30:09,720
Other other thoughts? A lot of people actually don't know that OCE has this old and outdated right to employers now,

268
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:20,550
so that probably dictates how the employers run their workplaces and you know how you feel about your direct relationship with your supervisor.

269
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:27,629
So we know about some things like supervisors support, poll support, autonomy.

270
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:39,660
Those are all psychosocial factors. I mean, let's think how how is something like the Safe Drinking Water Act affect your psychosocial factors?

271
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:49,710
I mean, look, we have clean water here. Too bad water with people really thinking about it.

272
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:59,220
But if, say, Jackson, for example, what's going on there, that's going to be a lot of social factors just because it's interrupting their whole life.

273
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:03,800
So. Yeah. Which ones. But with psychosocial factors.

274
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,950
I mean stress, obviously. Yeah. Obviously stress. That's when it comes to mind.

275
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:17,420
Um, I think family tension and stuff and just kind of just in general, I'm hopeful, although it's just kind of just feeling defeated.

276
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. From a broad level.

277
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:28,160
So doing I think per share is going to go like this.

278
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:38,480
And I guess I would like you to discuss with your partner what type three policies and it could be at any level you want communities, state, federal,

279
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:45,530
what three policies either from the environmental side or the occupational side do you think

280
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:52,280
should be targeted to address health inequalities and then thereby psychosocial factors?

281
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:59,240
And I'm going to have one of you report back. Does that make sense?

282
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:05,710
To me an example to get our brain started. Yeah.

283
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:10,910
So I could say, for example, like, I think that like, you know,

284
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:20,660
the Safe Drinking Water Act should be amended again to put more restrictions on like fluoride

285
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:25,760
is a really hot topic now that we were talking about in one of my other classes last night.

286
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:34,190
And, you know, that might affect, you know, neurocognitive development, which can affect like X, Y and Z.

287
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,010
So that could be an example.

288
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:46,940
Or if you air or if you want to get even broader in terms of like environment, we talked about neighborhood environment and also built environment.

289
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:56,190
You could think about like a policy to for a like housing, like caps on housing prices or something like that.

290
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,300
So that. Okay, all right.

291
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:07,860
Go to your pad. But there's so many chairs.

292
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:12,640
There are more guys, I think.

293
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,380
Yeah, yeah, better frequencies.

294
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:27,829
So yeah. I said, yeah.

295
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:36,890
I mean, I don't think so, but yeah.

296
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:51,180
Do you have like a similar environment that, you know, has poor health and that poor air quality and that policy is kind of short I think.

297
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:54,900
Such factors, yeah, just the environment.

298
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:04,880
Just what I hear about today is looking at the Civil Rights Act like environmental justice, like environmental health promotion incorporated into it.

299
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:11,400
Um, this is like someone's like suggesting, like how we can have that more, you know,

300
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:16,849
the priority for government officials and that would contribute to a lot of different

301
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:25,850
things and health the quality of environments on of just the economy for a lot of people.

302
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,530
Um. Go down to segments.

303
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:39,200
It's not like. Disproportionately impacted communities of color.

304
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:59,160
Think I go up and vote for one. Yeah, I guess.

305
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:10,800
You would like to think that you know those things to just take the time to see their priorities.

306
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:41,070
Why? Are you if you say you're an astronaut, I don't think anyone will personally consider the country on the battlefield.

307
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:54,800
I'm just making it. And.

308
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:09,600
I think. Yeah, yeah, we're very proud.

309
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:15,790
I was like, Oh, wow. Yeah, I can.

310
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:30,700
French. All these things that affect different cultures and religions.

311
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:47,540
They make people feel. French Ministry of Defense, because there are going to be more so than anything, that's for certain.

312
00:36:47,810 --> 00:37:01,280
And. I mean, the thing that maybe.

313
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:08,360
Control of certain pollution. Right.

314
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:13,920
Maybe four or six things. Let's go to a ball.

315
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:19,020
Yeah, man. It's just like kind of like that.

316
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:25,559
And then to kind of go where the vigils are and then that would impact like the way they're viewing this.

317
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:38,400
It's good to happy. Um, but then if this is, these are people who are willing to do that expansion of it obviously if you find.

318
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:50,980
70 the had. One thing you get used to.

319
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:01,240
Industry and residential areas usually have to be close by or not.

320
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:14,270
So that might be an important thing for good people if they do have proper zoning and don't have to make use of that.

321
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:21,910
They're doing this so you can have anything everywhere in town, near elevations.

322
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:28,720
But. Yeah. Okay.

323
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:35,010
Kind of your conversation diagram. I don't know if you saw my announcement earlier.

324
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:38,080
I did have to like the flip flop the schedule a little bit.

325
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:43,329
Okay. And I'll remind you again the day we have Dr. Rosenberg s lecture,

326
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:49,180
she's technically still on leave, but I'm kind of where she had to do this as a favor to me.

327
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,229
But we'll just be in class on Zoom that day.

328
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,710
So you don't feel like physically come here because we're all be online anyway.

329
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:05,230
Okay, so let's do our report back. So I saw you vigorously taking notes.

330
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:09,220
Bridgette, are you the reporter for this group here?

331
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:14,140
Okay. What do you what you all discuss? We talk about the clean air stars.

332
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,160
And I did research this summer that, like,

333
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:22,150
some of the standards are necessarily protective of health and it's like within reach for them to lower them.

334
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:29,620
We also talked about the impacts from like wildfires and how those can contribute to air quality

335
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:34,360
and that like disproportionately affects communities of color on low income communities.

336
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:43,990
They also talk about the Clean Water Act because of like Flint and Jackson, Mississippi and Benton Harbor.

337
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:50,230
And we talk about making that more of a higher priority to protect the water quality

338
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:57,010
as well as like more equitable enforcement and sampling of these water standards.

339
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,750
And we also talk about ocean standards, like what we were talking about earlier, which would help with the safety,

340
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:09,790
climate and everything, like the relationship between workers and their employers.

341
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:15,940
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. In particular with the wildfires.

342
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:24,550
So my family lives in Sacramento, which is kind of like northern California in the valley.

343
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:30,710
But basically, if anything happens because it's a valley all the like, that air like goes whoosh.

344
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:35,319
So you'll remember a couple of years ago there was that huge fire,

345
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:41,979
like kind of northern north column in Paradise caused by PGE and Pacific Gas and Electric.

346
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,860
And it caught all this stuff on fire.

347
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:54,939
And then you have people doing like gender reveal parties and like Joshua Tree and like setting natural natural preserves,

348
00:40:54,940 --> 00:41:01,480
you know, like on fire as well. But, you know, you also have people who live like in San Diego and Los Angeles.

349
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:13,059
And it's really stressful to think about like I bought this really expensive, nice property and I don't even feel like safe in my own home because it,

350
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:22,600
number one, could catch on fire at any time, either because of climate change or because some idiot is deciding to create fire.

351
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:29,890
And we're still in like a drought. Right. Or if it could just like slide off the hill on a mudslide because it doesn't rain that often.

352
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:42,370
And that inherently, I think, adds a lot of psychosocial stress, in particular a lot of strain physiologically, which we'll talk more about.

353
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:47,860
Um, I think, yeah, that's definitely like when I was in Chicago, like there wasn't a wildfire in Chicago.

354
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,000
Chicago, but like there were wildfires up in Minnesota actually,

355
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,629
like close to where one of my friends works like the boundary waters, like natural area.

356
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:06,520
There were like a lot of fires up there and you could see it reflected in the air quality in Chicago was like you traveled that far.

357
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:12,219
So it's not just like a local problem, but like especially in the Midwest because like things don't get trapped by mountains.

358
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:15,490
It just like travels through the whole area. Yeah.

359
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:25,329
Yeah. My mom said that when, you know, a lot of northern California and even Napa caught on fire for a little bit in the valley,

360
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:30,370
it was just like the sky was orange for a week.

361
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:35,319
Like you couldn't even see the sun really. And it was just like soot.

362
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,910
Like she would go to her car. It was just like a layer of sweat.

363
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:44,499
So it was during the pandemic. So everybody was wearing a mask anyway, which was great.

364
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,819
But one of my friends lives in Idaho right now and she like, there's a wildfire near me.

365
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:53,490
I was like, Please wear a mask. Because, like, I had a friend in Denver who had asthma.

366
00:42:53,890 --> 00:43:00,670
She was like outside. She had an asthma attack for like the wildfires in Denver at the time because they always have wildfires.

367
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:06,190
Do you actually, like, die like a few days later? So I was like, please, please wear a mask.

368
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:11,350
It's like a mask on. Yeah, sorry to hear that.

369
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:15,160
Um, we all remember Australia.

370
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:25,300
A good chunk of Australia was on fire at the beginning of the pandemic, so they had that going on and then literally like the continent.

371
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:29,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. People don't.

372
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,040
A lot of people don't think specifically about how things are happening at the climate level

373
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:44,399
or policy level specifically affects not just your health in terms of like physical health,

374
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,390
but also mental health, which obviously thereby impacts your physical health.

375
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:59,490
Um, not, not an easy thing to convey sometimes despair, which you all talk about some of the same things.

376
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:07,620
One that we brought up towards the end was kind of like zoning laws and stuff that local governments have or state governments to,

377
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:16,020
um, about how we're industries and residential and everything can be policed and how like have either a good impact,

378
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:18,270
um, if it's done well and you know,

379
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:29,040
we don't have a refinery in your backyard or if you do and then that can have many psychosocial factors that have negative impacts.

380
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:35,879
Um, what I wanted to bring up that was an interesting thing I read earlier was within the Civil Rights Act,

381
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:40,410
having like an environmental justice lens or like in addition amendments to it

382
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:46,380
to have more like the thinking through of like how we can help communities,

383
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:51,750
environmental justice entities and stuff through just like the basic civil rights.

384
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:58,979
Um, and then having that just like all sorts of different factors me is, is like as an emergency preparedness.

385
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:08,430
So when emergencies and, you know, natural disasters happen, um, who gets the right resources and then going forward.

386
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:14,430
But interest really that's exactly what my other classes are that yeah.

387
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:19,740
Do it, I need to take it to a next, next semester.

388
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:23,970
It's fall only. Um, I know you'll come back.

389
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,480
You'll come back out of the graduation. I'll just be like an alumni in the back.

390
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:32,250
Yeah. You can audit the classroom or third year. Third year of student.

391
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,760
Yes, yes, I'm actually a third year. There's, um.

392
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:43,800
I know it does happen. It can. It's making up zoning laws.

393
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:49,020
There's an interesting article you can read. It's in the Michigan Daily Gazette, you know, I think was yesterday.

394
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:53,400
But I talked about how Ann Arbor is trying to get rid of single family zoning.

395
00:45:54,060 --> 00:46:00,510
Oh, I just thought that and I did see that. Oh, yeah. So, so read that article because it describes it a lot more eloquently than I can.

396
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:10,080
But essentially single single family zoning was established as kind of like a redlining anti-black policy to keep the city of an arbor,

397
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:14,850
because we usually think of Ann Arbor is like so progressive and stuff.

398
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:20,909
That's history. It has its history for sure. So they're trying to get rid of that.

399
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:27,030
And also like getting rid of single family zoning laws in Ann Arbor would drive the housing prices down,

400
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,480
which a lot of people have strong feelings about.

401
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:37,440
So I live in Superior Township, which is just like right next to it and I technically have an Ypsi mailing address,

402
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,730
although I live in Superior Township, I like literally don't care.

403
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:51,609
But there's one community that is right on the border of Ann Arbor that is next to Parker Miller County Park and kind of like the Nichols Arboretum.

404
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:55,110
Um, like Gettys and North Dicks burrow right there.

405
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:07,950
And they wanted to become, rather than Ypsi mailing address and Ann Arbor mailing address because they said it was driving their property values down.

406
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:15,480
Um, so there's all these kinds of like individual level interest money, right?

407
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,610
So complicated. Okay.

408
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:25,530
Thank you. I always, I always like to end with a case study.

409
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:31,020
So this one in particular is called the Stress Check Program.

410
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:37,410
So this was a new national policy for monitoring and screening psychosocial stress in the workplace in Japan.

411
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:41,729
So I don't know if you all are familiar with the workplace culture in Japan.

412
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:48,719
It is very different here than the United States in Japanese, which I don't know the word off the top of my head,

413
00:47:48,720 --> 00:48:00,680
but in Japan they have a term that literally means working yourself to death because you literally died over working life,

414
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:07,079
because you work too much work because they're like standards for safety.

415
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,690
Are there standards for safety are very high.

416
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:18,510
Um, so like there are Honda, Honda manufacturing facilities like they do a lot of ergonomic stretching and all this kind of stuff.

417
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:25,230
But especially in the office culture, like a white collar culture, it is like an.

418
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,809
Like an emblem of pride to work over 100 hours a week.

419
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:39,160
And it's very common. Like a lot of cultural dynamics in Japan, where it's still it's still pretty patriarchal.

420
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:45,700
Right. So you expect the man to be like bringing in the money to be the breadwinner of the family.

421
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:55,209
So they're usually working like super hard at their job and in turn, like the women kind of do some of the more domestic things.

422
00:48:55,210 --> 00:49:06,030
But at the same time, like it's causes culture where it's like the men are so exhausted and the women just feel like neglected in the home.

423
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:09,730
So you have a lot of like marital issues.

424
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:21,160
The child birth rate is down there. So the government has like financially incentivized people to have children just because it is a very aged

425
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:29,079
population and then usually about to blow off steam rather than like the men coming home from their job,

426
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:36,430
they'll go to like these very niche like specialty, like cuddle cafes or like and you know, these kinds of things.

427
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,110
So there and there's also high rates of suicide, too,

428
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:51,400
among like a lot of white collar jobs because so much of their like identity and self-worth is tied to their performance at work.

429
00:49:52,420 --> 00:50:03,340
Um, so, you know, people joke about how, how hard people work in the U.S., which yes, they do and we have crappy vacation policies.

430
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:12,280
But I would say this is this is more so like cultural, cultural norms that kind of drive this.

431
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:20,469
So they this dress check program was a national policy that mandated workplaces that

432
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:27,580
had over 50 employees to do a stress check program for workers at least once a year.

433
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:35,020
So this became effective in 2015 as an amendment to their industrial safety and health law the year before.

434
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:43,060
So what's the rationale for this? First was to decrease the risk of mental health problems in workers by increasing

435
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:47,530
their own stress awareness of their own stress through periodic surveys and feedback.

436
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:54,400
They wanted to decrease work related stressors by analyzing group stress, survey results and improving the work environment.

437
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:59,890
And they wanted to prevent mental health problems by screening high risk workers and providing them,

438
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:05,020
excuse me, opportunities to see an appropriate health care worker.

439
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:16,180
Um, but, you know, I think it's really great that they implemented this, but mental health stigma is really high in Asian culture.

440
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:18,760
Um, just, um,

441
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:27,190
painting like a broad stroke here because there's so many different races and ethnicities that make up Asian Americans or Asian culture over 40,

442
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:34,330
but in particular, like it's, you know, usually like take it on the chin, you keep your head down and you keep working.

443
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:39,219
If you're experiencing like any mental health issues, you're not vocal about it.

444
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:47,290
You kind of just like keep it to yourself and try to like power through it because because of the stigma,

445
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:50,439
like you don't want to like embarrass your family.

446
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,399
You don't want to be seen as like the crazy one, right?

447
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:01,360
Or like you don't want to, like, bring shame to your family that those kinds of things.

448
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:09,080
So this is kind of their process for implementing this mandated program.

449
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:17,739
We're preparing for it. Interestingly, it was employers who expressed interest in this initiative.

450
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:22,870
Usually you expect to see the employees saying like, we're too stressed at work.

451
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:33,069
Right? But this was initiated by the employers. Then they, you know, discussed this as a health committee and then they announced it to workers.

452
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:36,070
They did a mandatory stress check survey.

453
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:43,240
And then, you know, like a physician or public health nurse would, you know, do this stress check survey.

454
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:47,740
And then there's a couple of options that people can go through.

455
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:53,049
They can either go to health counseling or, you know,

456
00:52:53,050 --> 00:53:02,470
they might obtain consent from the workers to share the results with their employer or they might think about like workplace improvements.

457
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:07,690
For some people experiencing what they consider high stress,

458
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:13,729
they might be asked to see a physician and go through further options where they might be referred to a counselor,

459
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:19,240
a mental health expert, and then, you know, kind of go through the process.

460
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,990
And this is all like at no cost to the employee.

461
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:29,730
So it sounds like all good and well, right? I can't.

462
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:32,920
And I can't. And he's still not.

463
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:38,940
Yeah. I can't imagine the U.S. role in something like that as it has been a very progressive employer.

464
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:41,400
Yeah. So how did it go?

465
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:51,870
Well, they did a one year retrospective study, so the study included about 2500 participants, but the sampling frame was about 5000.

466
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:56,370
And this combination was an annual stress survey.

467
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:05,250
And they found that if they did the stress survey and they made efforts to improve the psychosocial work environment,

468
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:16,170
it may be it may have been effective in reducing psychological distress in workers, but the effect size was pretty small.

469
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,969
So, I mean, this sounds like such a good thing, right?

470
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:25,230
So why do we why was the effect size small? Like, why?

471
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:34,320
Why was like doing the stress survey and then improving the psychosocial work environment like not as impactful as, you know,

472
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:43,020
we think it would be because the job I feel like it's a combo of like those all the things that you

473
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:53,520
were telling us about what the the work culture is like and how a person's identity is tied to that.

474
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:00,240
So I don't I don't know if you're going to be getting like accurate data.

475
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:10,010
Yeah. Either. Like people are going to be reporting things the.

476
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:22,130
And then there's the statement and I think everything you said about like the culture.

477
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:26,330
Yeah. That explains why we would have.

478
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:32,230
Whatever studies they're trying to do is probably.

479
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:38,370
It's probably not going to be the most accurate. Yeah.

480
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:42,410
Sam, are you speaking for me? Yeah, I think so too.

481
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:46,799
Um, yeah. I think this is all good and really cool study,

482
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:53,340
but if you're not able to kind of kind of get to the roots of being able to talk about these things just naturally,

483
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:57,030
then I don't know if they're going to be able to give their whole honest answer to their

484
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:02,730
surveys or being willing to really open up to if they're going to see counselors and stuff.

485
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:07,750
They're just kind of. It's too much, too fast.

486
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:14,339
I feel for just. Knowing my thoughts, my culture.

487
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:18,210
But not knowing any other. Other upcoming subject.

488
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:24,490
I think maybe it's because there's still work to do.

489
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:30,630
Too many hours. Okay. Guess. I don't think this survey could reduce their working hours per week.

490
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:43,960
Right. And also, you won't. It won't do much about their working culture because they're going to wait and work that day.

491
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:50,040
Right. Yeah. I think that's a really good for me. For me.

492
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:56,490
Yeah. I mean, in China, we have the same.

493
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:03,640
Situations as in Japan. So I'm not surprised that the effect size is small.

494
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:13,530
Yeah, I have a couple of thoughts. Um, first one year retrospect, one year is too short for a retrospective lesson.

495
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:22,450
Number two, maybe it's because it was in Japanese and it wasn't translated, but I have no idea what the contents of the stress survey was,

496
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:27,100
so I don't know what that questions they were that actually ask what the constructs

497
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:31,660
were that they were asking and how valid the questions were that they were asking.

498
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:38,230
Turning back to our earlier conversations about creating purpose for useful surveys, right?

499
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:43,120
Additionally, improvements to the psychosocial work environment.

500
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:47,649
The paper detailed nothing about what that actually means.

501
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:51,459
I don't know if it was a program. I don't know if there's an intervention.

502
00:57:51,460 --> 00:58:00,370
I don't know if it's like a guided meditation. I don't know if it was like a video that they watched or like, but I would love to get here.

503
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:03,819
It's like a weekly therapy dog session.

504
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,550
Right? But we have no idea. Yes.

505
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:16,990
Even if they get referred to counseling through the survey system, like they only get what they like, you only get what you give out of counseling.

506
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:22,840
So if you go to counseling kind of like required, you don't want to be there, you just don't talk, right?

507
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:28,180
Right. And what if I stress, you know, there's what they do.

508
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:33,490
They call what they call is like psychological hardening or conditioning where it's like,

509
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:37,620
oh, you're trying to make people more like mentally resilient, right?

510
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:42,250
But you can only do that so much. What if the other stress is coming from the workplace?

511
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:47,469
You got to fix the workplace. You can't send them to therapy to do that.

512
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:49,930
Yes. Maybe you can learn how to cope better. Right.

513
00:58:49,930 --> 00:59:02,229
Or like disassociate, you know, but if if they had included the measures, I would have been curious to see like which measures came out the most.

514
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:05,630
Wasn't it indeed work hours that they needed cut back on?

515
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,860
Because I know Microsoft, for example, there,

516
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:18,790
highlighted a four day work week in Japan and they found that people were just as productive in the four days, but much happier.

517
00:59:19,450 --> 00:59:22,240
And then they they they stopped it. They just went back to that.

518
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:33,620
They just went back to their usual, um, so, so I guess the point I'm trying to convey with this program in particular is,

519
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:45,850
is things sound good conceptually, but in practice you have to really get ahead of yourself and think about like, what am I trying to measure?

520
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:50,710
And then once I get the data from what I'm measuring, what do I plan to do about it?

521
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,430
The thought is nice, but that is nice. I mean, that's that's more than we have going on here.

522
00:59:57,430 --> 01:00:01,120
Right? So I think it's a start for them.

523
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,290
But I think after this,

524
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:11,139
like hopefully there are some behavioral health scientists working with them because then if they don't see like if the effect size is small,

525
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:17,110
they're just going to scrap this mandatory program and then you're kind of back at square one again.

526
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:22,500
I can't speak to how much the workplace culture in Japan has changed since COVID.

527
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:32,580
I know in the United States it's changed our work culture a ton, a ton of time, but I'm not sure what it's, it's like there.

528
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:37,480
Um, let's. That's all I've got for today.

529
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:44,320
Sorry, Josh watching. I forgot to record the first, you know, 15 minutes, but it's.

530
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:45,430
It was. It was just.
