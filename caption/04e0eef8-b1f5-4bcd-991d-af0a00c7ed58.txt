1
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,200
Okay. I think we left off. Here.

2
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:46,670
Okay. So we talked about let's say we have identified our patient that we think is at risk for re feeding and we're going to start nutrition for them.

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,770
How do we go about doing that? Remember, our rule of thumb is start low and then go slow.

4
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,480
So we're going to kind of start very conservatively in terms of how much nutrition we deliver.

5
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,540
Specifically carbohydrates.

6
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:08,639
But remember, if most of our patients are either going to be eating or on nutrition, there will be some that will be on parenteral nutrition.

7
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:19,620
And that's a different approach compared to this, because we can really give precise amounts of carbohydrates, protein and fat.

8
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,219
So we'll get into all of that next semester.

9
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:29,459
But for the most part, we're going to start enteral nutrition, which is a nutritionally complete formula.

10
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,330
So the macronutrients are kind of similar to what we would recommend for a regular diet.

11
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,230
So we can't like control the exact amount of carbohydrate we get.

12
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:46,860
We can, but it's, it's going to be all in one form, so all in a formula.

13
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,200
So that's why we will, we do it kind of at a calorie level and not just a specific carbohydrate level.

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,489
So these gives you a couple of ideas about how we would go about starting nutrition.

15
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,629
And again, next week we'll actually be estimating energy needs for people.

16
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,050
So this will be a little bit put this into a little bit more context.

17
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:14,780
So other considerations we need to have is our total fluid that we're going to give our patients.

18
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,849
These patients are they're malnourished, usually coming out of starvation state.

19
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:31,490
So we need to be very careful on this total volume that we're giving them as to not be super overwhelming to their system.

20
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,920
So a good rule of thumb in this may vary between institution or published guidelines, but in general,

21
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:46,420
we'd like to keep the fluid around a liter, 4000 animals or less in the first few days.

22
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,150
We're not just going to bombard them with like three liters of fluid.

23
00:02:51,980 --> 00:03:00,480
And this is more useful with our enteral and parenteral nutrition because we are prescribing an actual volume amount that we're giving to the patient.

24
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,130
We'll be writing these orders. We do need to monitor their weight closely.

25
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:15,640
So when we see that our patient is gaining weight kind of quickly, do you think that that's reflective of actual lean body mass gain?

26
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:25,270
Probably not. So if we see a patient as gaining over a kilogram per week, that's about one kilogram is Â£2.2.

27
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:33,159
That may indicate that it's just some fluid retention. So we do see some fluid shifts when we reintroduce nutrition.

28
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,870
So that might indicate we're going a little bit too quickly on the overall volume.

29
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:45,070
So keep that in mind. Yes. When patients are like that, how you the monitor.

30
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:55,870
Yeah so in the hospital and this is even if patients are mobile they'll take that weight so the hospital beds can can get a weight on it.

31
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,230
Raise your hand if you think those are super accurate.

32
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:08,169
If you've ever seen someone or if you've been in the hospital yourself, you know, you've got blankets and who knows what on the bed.

33
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,620
So they're not always super accurate.

34
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:19,329
We can ask for that to like be zeroed out. Usually our nursing staff, if we talk to them like we really need to get some accurate measurements,

35
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,820
they can help, but a lot of times they will take a bad weight.

36
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:29,830
Otherwise they have to roll in like the scanning scale which you can request, but often they just take it from the bed.

37
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:36,560
Which is not always super accurate. Yes. If the patient is already on a full pulse.

38
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:43,730
Because they can't be sure of the competition. Does the water still go every day?

39
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh, if you were to slow down, then if they're tied down, cherry already kind of have to pull back.

40
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:02,120
Yeah, it would probably. You would probably see less quick, less of a quick rise in the way if it were truly desolate retention.

41
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:15,240
If you faithfully do the 1000 mile every day, even though the only other supplement at the regime is really pulled back, you mean if they're done?

42
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,680
If we're kind of out of the woods with the reef eating? Yeah.

43
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:30,500
No, not yet. Oh, it's like the slices that either we reduce the feeding because we realize that some of the electrolytes dropped.

44
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,780
So we either reduce the have to preserve feeding or we pause.

45
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:46,120
We do every other day. I hope that's the way that's. So as we adjust the feeling, do we always keep this water device?

46
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,370
No, not necessarily. Not all patients will retain fluid.

47
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,540
So sometimes the nutrition we provide might be there.

48
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:02,210
They might not be an additional IV fluids. So maybe we need to provide all their hydration through their internal nutrition.

49
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,729
So this is just the first few days.

50
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,260
This is a good rule of thumb,

51
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:17,080
and we probably don't need to exceed this anyways in terms of what we're going to be delivering calorie wise or probably be much less than this.

52
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:25,540
But some patients are on additional I.V. fluids, so they might just get fluid overloaded and that would need to take into account

53
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,220
it's not going to just be on the medical team will monitor the fluids as well.

54
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:39,530
Okay. So of course we want to prevent repeating from happening, so we need to identify those at risk.

55
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,750
These are just kind of some key takeaways.

56
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:49,040
We're going to have conservative initiation of nutrition therapy, along with aggressive monitoring and replacement of electrolytes,

57
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,120
usually will replace the electrolytes through I.V. supplementation.

58
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:01,190
And that will be a physician order. We're not going to be ordering I.V. phosphorus replacement.

59
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:07,440
You could recommend that and give if you become like a nutrition support dietitian.

60
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:13,389
There are some like nutrition support teams where there's a dietician or maybe a pharmacist and they kind of manage

61
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:20,200
all the nutrition support patients if it's a smaller facility or maybe the service you cover as a dietitian,

62
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,470
you're more involved in writing orders and things like that.

63
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:31,480
But that will take some time and clinical expertize to get to that point where you're actually prescribing electrolytes.

64
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:40,480
We generally use cals per kilogram or percentage of total calories as our estimating our goal.

65
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:51,580
So those two methods we talked about may be 25% of your estimated needs or using calcium kg or five if they're at higher risk.

66
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:58,290
Must keep in mind our delivery of carbohydrate, but also our total fluid like we just talked about.

67
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:06,879
Okay. So nutrition support usually should begin. No more than 50% of estimated energy needs.

68
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:14,470
Sometimes it's much less than that. I would say. Most often if we do identify patients at risk, they're probably at pretty high risk.

69
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,700
So 25% might be a better target, but you're not going to exceed that 50% of their estimated needs.

70
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:30,580
Then we'll haven't advanced the nutrition that we give them to their actual goal over several days, depending on how they're doing.

71
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,850
The electrolytes we need to monitor most closely potassium, phosphorus and magnesium.

72
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:41,320
So the phosphorus and magnesium are a separate lab draw.

73
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:46,899
They are just like a basic metabolic pill, which we'll talk about next week.

74
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,210
So we want to make sure that that is his words.

75
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:58,209
We can watch those electrolytes as well. Often we'll have them checked twice daily in the first few days.

76
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:02,320
So like in the morning and then again in the afternoon or evening.

77
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:10,720
So we can see how those electrolytes are responding to either the nutrition we're providing and or the supplementation that we're giving.

78
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:20,620
We're going to supplement them, preferably through I.V., sometimes through oral supplementation.

79
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,950
Does anybody know why we would do ivy supplementation over having people take electrolytes?

80
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:33,130
Really? Sure. All right.

81
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:44,840
It's yes, it's not pleasant, especially like oral health or oral potassium is really tough on the gut.

82
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:53,300
So a lot of times people feel very nauseous. So it's just it's difficult to get people to take them.

83
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:59,660
And it's not as absorbed, absorbed as quickly if we're getting things right into the bloodstream.

84
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,760
It's going to be pretty impactful right away. So we want that kind of quick delivery.

85
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:10,370
If their phosphorus is really low, we're not going to have them swallow some oral phosphorus.

86
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,000
We're just going to give it to the I.V. Okay.

87
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,170
So thiamin supplementation should be started without need to check a serum or whole blood diamond levels.

88
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,670
I realize this felt differently depending on the day. So either way is fine.

89
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:36,270
The thing about thiamin is when somebody is malnourished, we can just assume that they're Simon depleted.

90
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:42,060
Simon can be depleted within three weeks of poor intake of the water soluble vitamins.

91
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,940
It's necessary for carbohydrate metabolism.

92
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:50,849
So in most people where they're malnourished, we're just assuming that they're going to be diamond depleted.

93
00:10:50,850 --> 00:11:00,390
So we don't need to check like a blood diamond level. We just automatically kind of empirically will supplement them.

94
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,930
So sometimes I'll write down like how much we would give.

95
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:09,270
This is just like for reference, I don't expect you guys to know this.

96
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:16,499
These kind of things may change. Like we may have different guidelines when we go into the real world,

97
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,330
but for instance, we would do like a 100 milligrams of thiamin a day for ten days.

98
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:29,100
Sometimes they'll get thiamin in their I.V. bag. So this is just something to keep in mind that we're always just going to supplement it.

99
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:35,440
We don't need to confirm that there's a there's a deficiency.

100
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,680
We also usually give a milligram of folic acid for seven days.

101
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,000
Again, these water soluble vitamins do deplete quickly.

102
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,619
So we're just kind of assuming that they need these things.

103
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,540
So you'll off you'll see, people will often have ordered diamond and folic acid together.

104
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:08,240
Okay. So let's go over kind of treatment. Let's say our patient starts to exhibit signs or symptoms of re feeding.

105
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,510
What would be an example of a sign or symptom? What are we primarily looking for?

106
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:25,010
Electrolytes. The electrolytes. Right. The patients that are going to tell us and yeah.

107
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:34,280
Repeating those clinical symptoms we talked about like where they actually go into heart failure, those are very severe forms.

108
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,390
Where they're actually exhibiting symptoms is unlikely.

109
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:46,940
You might not feel great. That could be for a variety of reasons. But this is really that we see that those electrolytes start to drop.

110
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,140
Okay. So what are we going to do with regard to their nutrition therapy?

111
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,320
So it depends if we've started it or not.

112
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,059
So we're either going to get a slowdown or two beatings.

113
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,900
Maybe we just ramped them up too quickly so we can either cut back.

114
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:11,610
We sometimes we have to hold them. We just have to stop infusion until we get those electrolytes stable.

115
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:20,190
Sometimes we just keep them at the same place and don't advance them for like maybe 12 hours until and while we're supplementing electrolytes.

116
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,320
So it just kind of depends on the current patient's situation.

117
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:32,129
So often it's either we hold them steady, we don't increase, we cut back,

118
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:37,380
maybe we go down by half of the volume or we completely stop them for a period of time.

119
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:48,120
But if I was asking about water is about during this time you've decided to stay or cut back or not eating.

120
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:57,509
Do we also have to consider the water? Usually if we're cutting back on the nutrition delivery, yes, that'll cut back on the total volume.

121
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:03,089
They might get additional IV fluids during that time to make sure they stay hydrated.

122
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:07,120
But yes, the goal would be not to overdo it on the total amount.

123
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,110
Sometimes in order to do that or more, water will cause kidney stress.

124
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,800
And we're holding back. So we have to do.

125
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:24,799
Less water could be less water, or they might to adjust it for us to have more sodium.

126
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,860
So it's not too different. Then there's.

127
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:31,010
Yeah. You'll have to decide what the clinical picture looks like. Yes.

128
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:36,050
During this time we're going to aggressively replace the electrolytes that have gone well.

129
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,990
And when do you guys think we should restart nutrition therapy or begin kind of ramping up again?

130
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,950
Yes. When their electrolytes are stable.

131
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:58,880
And I don't think it's really clear what that means. Is it just like, okay, well, now they're within normal limits.

132
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:07,730
Maybe they checked them right after we ran some phosphorous through their I.V. Then they check it and it's like normal.

133
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:15,050
It would probably be good to have, like, two blood draws, you know, 12 hours apart that have been stable.

134
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:20,120
But that's not you know, that's just kind of what I think they make.

135
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,690
Sometimes they'll just supplement and then restart. Might not have as much control over.

136
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,600
Okay. So just a summary of our important part. Important points.

137
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:36,940
We need to be able to identify persons at risk for re feeding and take steps to prevent it.

138
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,620
And we are going to be the ones doing that when we go up into our nutrition assessment.

139
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:47,980
Look at their labs, their history, everything, their weight, their diet history.

140
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,610
If they're malnourished, there's probably a good chance that we're going to start nutrition,

141
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,970
that we need to be very concerned because they will potentially be.

142
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:04,930
We're going to start nutrition therapy very conservatively. Gradually progressed to the goal over several days while closely monitoring their serum

143
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:10,510
electrolyte levels and having aggressive depletion of those electrolytes as indicated.

144
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:16,259
And usually we always supplement with time. Okay.

145
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:23,220
So that's kind of like a summary and hopefully we'll put some of that into a more applied setting.

146
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:31,980
Any questions on any of that? I do have a question on the slide somewhere.

147
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:36,650
There is someone saying the implications of the feeding syndrome.

148
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,430
And I noticed the only two electrolytes I mentioned not.

149
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,519
Efficiency was a, uh, I think.

150
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:55,069
Oh, yes. A lot of magnesium alone would not make me think this patient is because it's

151
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:00,110
really the phosphorus and the potassium would be the ones that are more sensitive.

152
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,690
So I mean at that. Thank you.

153
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:11,020
Sure. Okay. So let's get a little bit more into the path of physiology.

154
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:14,550
I'm going to go over like the same concepts on multiple slides.

155
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:19,750
So what that should tell you is that I really want you have a good understanding of this.

156
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,830
Okay. I'll tell a quick story.

157
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,450
I did my internship at the hospital. I told you that, unfortunately, that internship is no longer there.

158
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:33,210
And after I finished the internship, I applied for an open position they had at the hospital.

159
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:41,190
So I went in for the interview and it was like dieticians that I had worked with through the internship that I knew well.

160
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,459
Also the manager I had known because I was in the internship.

161
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,000
So I felt pretty comfortable and it was pretty laid back.

162
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,960
You know, this is my first professional interview, so I was nervous, but I felt pretty good.

163
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:57,390
And so we were just doing like pleasantries, introductions.

164
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:04,590
And then things got really serious. And my manager, the very first question of my interview was,

165
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:11,970
please explain the pathophysiology of me feeding syndrome and my friends who I did actually get that position.

166
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:19,260
The girls who I worked with said they were like hitting each other under the table because they didn't feel like they would have been okay.

167
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:26,280
So the reason we we spend so much time on this concept is because, again,

168
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:32,940
the dietitian is the one that is going to be identifying this and handling it.

169
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,770
The medical team might have an idea of what's going on,

170
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:44,040
but you are going to be the one that's going to know what to do if patients start to show signs of the re.

171
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,630
So very important that we have some expertize in this area.

172
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,620
Okay. So hopefully you read the articles.

173
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:59,900
What historical references did Mike Craft bring up in his article?

174
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:14,490
You mentioned our good friend. And so please, if you picked up on that and we'll get more on him a little bit later,

175
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:20,520
but you guys, you know, we'll do your Minnesota starvation experiment kind of reflection piece.

176
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:30,569
But Answer Key is that full process really helped us learn a lot about starvation, how the body and that's how it responds.

177
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:38,610
And then what happens when we start giving people more nutrition, some others that I find kind of fascinating.

178
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,689
So this fear you're interested in other historical references.

179
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,110
I have some some papers here that you might be interested in.

180
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:56,310
This first paper from 1922 talks about the effect of starvation during the siege of Cook.

181
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:04,290
So this was like 150 day siege where soldiers had limited food rations resulting in widespread starvation.

182
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,810
And this is the quote I pulled from that article.

183
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:15,270
Death frequently occurs in those who, after forced absence, suddenly and completely gratify their natural cravings of hunger.

184
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:22,960
So and then again around World War Two, this is another paper, these.

185
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,639
This was among Japanese prisoners of war in the Philippines.

186
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:33,090
They saw a 20% mortality rate of subjects following re feeding 20% very high.

187
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:41,400
So if there was like limited food because of the war and then all of a sudden maybe there's an abundance of food,

188
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:46,890
20% mortality rate when people started having access to adequate nutrition.

189
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,790
Now we learned a lot more about refitting when we started using I.V. nutrition.

190
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:02,190
So back in the sixties and seventies, when we started using parenteral nutrition early on, we when we saw an increased usage of to feeding,

191
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:11,280
but mostly TPN, we had case reports of patients with illogical symptoms in those who were underweight and started on this nutrition therapy.

192
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:16,800
You know, 3 to 7 days after starting nutrition support, we'd see these dramatic symptoms.

193
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:22,320
There were case reports of death and the low phosphorus was this universal finding.

194
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:33,650
Okay. So we've gone over this quite a bit, but let's do a brief overview of our fuel sources during the Fed stay and starvation.

195
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:40,500
So when we're in a Fed state, you know, our preferred fuel source is what, glucose?

196
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,800
Yep. So carbohydrate is going to be stored as glycogen in the liver.

197
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,020
So we have readily available energy.

198
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:58,130
And then during periods of starvation, glycogen stores are going to be depleted and the body is going to be responding by utilizing, what, two things.

199
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,660
Fatty acids? Yes. After about three days, we begin that shift to using fatty acids.

200
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:13,190
But what else are we using as well as amino acids?

201
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:18,680
Right. So protein and fat will become the primary fuel source.

202
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:27,830
When this shift happens, we see decreased levels of what circulating and is released from the.

203
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:36,260
Pancreas. Insulin, lower levels of insulin and increased levels of glucagon to help maintain our blood sugar.

204
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:42,140
Great. Okay. So let's go over our.

205
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,980
Our kind of flow sheet. So there's just a couple of things that you had to have on your flow sheet usually.

206
00:22:53,370 --> 00:23:00,060
And this is only like this third year, maybe I've done this assignment because I think it just helps kind of work through the process.

207
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,910
Some people have like so much wonderful information, which is great.

208
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,070
So but if you didn't, if you just kind of hit bare bones and you got the main concepts, that's fine too.

209
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,270
So let's say we have our patient. They're malnourished.

210
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:21,389
Maybe it's due to starvation, maybe it's due to something else, but they're malnourished like we just talked about.

211
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:26,850
We have decreased insulin, we have increased gluconeogenesis, especially at first.

212
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:32,790
Right? So that's going to be protein breakdown in order to create new glucose has fuel.

213
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,430
We then have adaptation to fat metabolism.

214
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,030
This doesn't have to be in order, but this is just.

215
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:47,370
All of this is going to result in weight loss, but also depletion of vitamin and mineral stores.

216
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:53,910
Right. So just nutritionally depleted and definitely fat and muscle loss.

217
00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:01,100
So let's say at this point they come into the hospital and you see them and we're going to start some nutrition.

218
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,830
Glucose will again be the major energy source, right?

219
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:11,120
Because we're going to be delivering balanced nutrition for the most part.

220
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:17,510
So we're going to switch back to carbohydrate glucose as the major energy source.

221
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:27,769
So what happens when we reintroduce carbohydrate? Yes.

222
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:38,110
So blood sugar is going to rise, then that's going to stimulate insulin release from the pancreas and put that in the balance.

223
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:43,900
And we have where we're going from a catabolic state to an anabolic state to shift.

224
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:52,270
This response is normal with response. So our blood sugar rises because we're eating carbohydrates, so insulin gets released.

225
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:56,250
This sets off a number of metabolic pathways. Right.

226
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:01,750
This is kind of what's going to trigger the cascade of events that we associate with re feeding syndrome.

227
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:14,910
So then we're going to see and this might make this little help, I think, come into more context.

228
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,140
I know, I know I play next semester, but next semester we get into diabetes.

229
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:27,120
And so I think this whole cellular uptake triggered by insulin will kind of come full circle for you.

230
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:35,480
So insulin is going to drive glucose into the cell so that the cell can use it for energy.

231
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:42,990
Correct. So like, that's why people with diabetes, whether they are type one and are producing insulin,

232
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:49,680
their blood sugar is very high because they need insulin to get the glucose out of the blood and into the cell.

233
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:55,740
Or if they're insulin resistant, they're not producing enough insulin or if their body just isn't as sensitive to it.

234
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:02,280
That's why their blood sugar stays high, because it's not coming from the blood into the cell to be used as an energy source.

235
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:11,160
So insulin will drive glucose from the blood into the cell, and along with it goes potassium,

236
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:18,350
phosphorous and magnesium, leaving the blood levels of those electrolytes very low.

237
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:29,130
Case we have the cellular uptake of glucose potassium will follow as well as phosphorous and magnesium also calcium sometimes as well.

238
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:36,530
So that's going to lead to very low phosphorus, potassium, magnesium levels in the serum and.

239
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,390
We also have an increased utilization of thiamin for carbohydrate metabolism.

240
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,880
We're presuming their stores are already low, likely leading them to be deficient in thiamin.

241
00:26:53,400 --> 00:27:01,680
Then we have just chronic whole body depletion of phosphorus. Why else do we see this is are malnourished so they're nutritionally depleted.

242
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:05,190
We have the cellular uptake of phosphorus. But what else?

243
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:13,580
Yes. Increased demand for the last 2 to 3 years.

244
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:26,870
Yes, exactly. So the body needs all of those enzymes to complete glycolysis and a lot of those involve phosphate.

245
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:34,310
So that is also going to increase the demand for phosphate, which has been depleted and it's just going to complete it further.

246
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,920
So we get this chronic whole body depletion of phosphorus, and that's where we can start seeing clinical features of re feeding syndrome.

247
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:50,839
So that could include cardiovascular abnormalities, respiratory problems, musculo, musculoskeletal problems,

248
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:56,900
even neurological concerns and hematologic abnormalities if it's not addressed and corrected.

249
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:05,149
So we're hoping that will address and correct it, but is in the worst case, it can lead to a coma and even death.

250
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:09,440
And we have case reports of that, but it does not happen very often.

251
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:21,200
So this is an example of what it could look like. You could have some more detail like and I've posted some other papers here which are quite nice.

252
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:28,050
So if you did a Google search, you might be able to find some some examples of these flowcharts.

253
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:35,550
But this one's a little bit hard to see and it gets a little bit more involved in terms of manifestations of these things.

254
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,050
But again, the main concepts.

255
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:46,530
Malnutrition, starvation, low insulin increase, gluconeogenesis loss of weight, depletion of vitamins, stores can be adapted to our fat milk.

256
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:56,160
Now metabolism when you start repeating have an increase in glucose which results in a release of insulin,

257
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:03,299
the insulin also can drive this sodium retention that we see.

258
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,290
So we hold on to fluid, we hold on to sodium.

259
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:13,890
Urine volume might go down. That is also driven in part by the insulin response.

260
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,950
That's quite complex. This is very simple.

261
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,629
Don't have to know that the keto pathway, which is understanding insulin, is really driving a lot of these things.

262
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:33,270
So we can have hyperbole mixed state. So increase volume which in an already weakened heart can can be problematic.

263
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:41,820
We have our trans cellular shifts. We also have lower phosphorus due to the the requirements for ATP.

264
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,570
Again, this one is like really old. So this is from 2001, but this one is quite nice as well.

265
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:59,560
So it just kind of goes through those, those basic steps in why this is a syndrome, like the constellation of signs and symptoms.

266
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:10,490
Okay. So this is not like a great figure, but sometimes it's kind of helpful.

267
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:15,729
This is from a paper of gastroenterology and hepatology.

268
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:20,500
So we have this these little kind of red pages.

269
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:25,870
Things are the insulin. The white dots are going to be glucose.

270
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:30,009
And then we see this is just showing potassium and phosphorus. And then we have five in here.

271
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:39,790
And this blowfish represents the cell. So we're in when we're in homeostasis or essentially a friend state, we could see it's pretty balance.

272
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:47,229
The amount of glucose that's in the cell and outside of the cell is the same with the potassium and phosphorus.

273
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:54,760
Everything's kind of in balance when we get into a starvation state or a malnourished state.

274
00:30:55,810 --> 00:31:01,209
Remember, a lot of times if a patient comes in and we do a blood draw, like almost every patient that gets hospitalized,

275
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:06,820
there's just blood is taken for maybe it's a CBC basic metabolic panel.

276
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,380
So potassium and phosphorus are often normal.

277
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,030
They're within normal limits.

278
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:23,080
We talked about that on Tuesday and you can see why the body is going to do whatever it takes to maintain normal blood levels.

279
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:29,860
So you can see how the cells become very depleted of electrolytes in order to maintain normal levels within the blood.

280
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:40,270
We can see the glucose is also low because there's not been nutrition and also that will correspond with low circulating levels of insulin.

281
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,670
So then we institute carbohydrate predominantly.

282
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:54,470
We give nutrition and what's going to happen that's going to cause a release of insulin from the pancreas,

283
00:31:54,860 --> 00:32:01,399
which is going to drive glucose into the cell as well as potassium and phosphorus.

284
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:08,030
And you can see that those levels in the blood then become quite low and it become dangerously low.

285
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:15,200
So that is our trans cellular process.

286
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:27,270
Does anybody have any questions? What is this, these things that insulin is.

287
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:38,079
Okay. So if you go on an interview and they ask you to explain feeling syndrome, you'll be able to do it.

288
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,440
And I bet that a lot of people wouldn't be able to do it.

289
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:45,969
Unfortunately, yes. You're going to know that you've created conditions that.

290
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:53,020
Yes. So there's the silver, I think it was.

291
00:32:53,020 --> 00:33:03,700
How did that happen? But for the first year or two, those that happened simultaneous, I would say it's probably pretty simultaneously.

292
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:11,350
Potassium follows, so that's why I kind of put those together.

293
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:17,610
But it's, it's all like the processes happening. Kind of around the same time.

294
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:23,310
Okay. Okay. So don't worry too much about the water, especially the electrolytes.

295
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:29,780
Just know that that trans cellular shift will complete the blood levels of something better.

296
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:37,860
Yeah, that's a good question. Yes. And for the blowfish picture on the far right or if you're saying that like insulin

297
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:44,339
speaking of glucose into the fish so that our blood levels of glucose are low,

298
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:51,390
as I was. Well, not necessarily. Not necessarily because they're going to be after we eat a meal, they will be high.

299
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:58,620
Right. And so it's just going to bring them down to like normal level.

300
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,879
So, yeah, that's then showing all of that film, right? It's showing all of it.

301
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,600
And that's what I was like, Oh, you want anything else out?

302
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:15,870
Yeah, there may be some situations where you'd have low blood sugar, but for most people it would just be perfect.

303
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,800
That's a good question. This is not a great figure by any means.

304
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:23,070
I mean, but it's it's helpful to kind of illustrate the process.

305
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:30,270
Okay. So let's do a couple of cases have realized this is quite small.

306
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,540
Not the best color. I'll have to change that.

307
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:39,450
But we'll go over this together and we'll spend some time just to do a couple of cases.

308
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:45,210
So this is from the suggested reading.

309
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:49,410
So M.H. is a 73 year old nursing home resident.

310
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,889
She has a history of cerebrovascular accident or severe disability.

311
00:34:55,890 --> 00:35:00,720
Know what that means in plain language? That's a stroke.

312
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:05,100
So when you see a cerebrovascular accident or CVA, that's a stroke.

313
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:13,620
Okay, so she's had a stroke approximately four months ago prior to this admission and that's resulted in dysphagia.

314
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,000
We haven't done that. We're going to do a session on dysphagia. Does anybody know what that is?

315
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:31,970
Yes. Yes, it's difficulty swallowing is what that means, which is can happen as a result of a stroke.

316
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,710
So she's been on a pure diet with thicken liquids.

317
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:43,700
This is a kind of classic presentation for some of our elderly patient patients that have had a stroke.

318
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:49,279
They have resulting dysphagia. Then they have to go on a diet like this.

319
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,340
So pureed diet with thickened liquids. How do you think she's been eating on this?

320
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:06,300
If you could just kind of imagine. Patients on peri diets and especially I'm thinking like with 90 well ten.

321
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:15,150
So because of just that, that usually triggers like, oh, she's been on this for four months, she's probably not eating very well.

322
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:23,730
It's just really hard to adapt to that kind of diet. Since that time, her medical history includes hypertension.

323
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,480
She has atrial fibrillation and asthma.

324
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,990
She's admitted to the hospital with a fever, aspiration, pneumonia and dehydration.

325
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:40,360
So this will all come together in a couple of weeks. But what does it mean that our aspiration on that is.

326
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:50,870
This can happen with people post-stroke or people that have dysphagia.

327
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:56,620
Their swallowing is. Effective.

328
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:02,190
And sometimes they can get food cannot just go down the esophagus.

329
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:07,050
It goes actually into the trachea and then into the lungs, which then can cause an infection.

330
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:14,320
So you aspirate food into the lungs and then that builds up bacteria and then you pick up on that.

331
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:20,040
So that is a common presentation of some of our older adults, especially post-stroke.

332
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:27,940
The reason we put people with dysphagia on these kind of diets is to prevent aspiration pneumonia.

333
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:36,250
But even on a diet, she's had aspiration pneumonia and dehydration that can liquids when patients are on that.

334
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,470
They're almost always dehydrated because it's just really unpleasant.

335
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,370
They can't they just really can't get get enough hydration from the they can feel it's alone.

336
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,739
Okay. She's made a MPO. That just means nothing by mouth.

337
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:55,270
It's not safe for her to eat orally, especially after this aspiration pneumonia.

338
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,920
And she started on IV fluids. So D five half normal sailing.

339
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,120
We'll discuss what that means of modified barium swallow.

340
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:11,080
So this is where they're looking at her ability to swallow demonstrates aspiration and all consistencies.

341
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:15,250
So she's really not safe to consume anything morally.

342
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:23,680
Okay, so she's going to need a feeding tube and nasogastric feedings are initiated according to standard protocol.

343
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:28,270
All that means is they place a tube through her nose, which then goes into the stomach.

344
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:34,310
A weight is obtained the following day. She's 56 kilograms.

345
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:38,600
Her weight at the time of her stroke four months ago was 65 kilograms.

346
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:45,080
So the following day. So her two feedings have been started according to a standard protocol.

347
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:51,380
And I'll tell you what what that is, there are just standard orders for two feedings that physicians can order.

348
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:59,270
And then usually when the dietician comes in, we make adjustments to that order, but they can just send the standard order through.

349
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,840
And usually it's much more than people need to be starting out at, especially someone like this.

350
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:13,550
So the following day, she's developed worsening respiratory distress and was transferred to the ICU for further care.

351
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,780
And these are her blood chemistries. So these are what hers actually were.

352
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:23,300
And this is the reference range that. Okay.

353
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:27,739
So is this patient exhibiting signs of re feeding syndrome?

354
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,040
What do you think? Yes. Yes. Right.

355
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,750
So she how we would determine that that she's at risk.

356
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:43,159
She's had this degree of weight loss due to this four months where she's been on this pureed diet after her stroke,

357
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,900
where she probably hasn't been eating well. She's been started on nutrition.

358
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:55,310
And we see this is a very low phosphorus levels just plummeted right after they started surface.

359
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,750
So let's take a little bit let's take a closer look at this.

360
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:08,450
What's happening with this patient? So she's had a 13% weight loss over four months if we actually do the math.

361
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:11,840
That should kind of like be a red flag to us.

362
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:17,650
If we through just kind of standard calorie needs for an adult,

363
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:23,950
sometimes we'll just say 25 calories per kilogram could be a starting point based

364
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:28,900
on her admission weight that would put her at about a goal of 1400 calories a day.

365
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,600
This is just like an example. We would all, of course, fine tune.

366
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:44,410
So let's take 25% of 1400 if we were going to start nutrition on this patient because we are we like determine that she's at risk for repeating.

367
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:49,210
So we probably want to give her no more than 350 calories in that first day.

368
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:55,460
You could also do ten cals per kilogram. That's a little bit higher.

369
00:40:55,470 --> 00:41:03,030
I would probably air on the more conservative side here, and you could potentially even do five takeouts per kg.

370
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:13,530
So let's stick with this like 25% of the call we just figured out D five half normal sailing at six miles an hour for the last 24 hours.

371
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:16,860
So that's how I d fluid order. Does anybody know what d five means?

372
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:21,390
Probably not. I wouldn't expect you to, but maybe anybody have an idea.

373
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:30,140
This means that there's a 5% dextrose solution in her I.V. fluids.

374
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:34,880
Does anybody know what dextrose is? It's sugar.

375
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:39,550
It's just straight. So she's getting carbohydrate through her I.V.

376
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:50,930
So let's calculate what she's getting from that. 60 miles an hour, over 24 hours, that's 1440 meals, 5% of which is dextrose.

377
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,010
You guys do not need to know this. I'm just giving you an example of what other sources of nutrition.

378
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:01,580
So she received 72 grams of dextrose in the last 24 hours just from arriving fluids.

379
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:11,210
There are 3.4 calories per gram of dextrose. So she has gotten 245 calories from a variety of foods in the last 24 hours.

380
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,600
And if we think about that, that is simple carbohydrates straight into the bloodstream.

381
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:22,969
So even at a low level, that sometimes is enough to drive the re feeding process.

382
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:26,570
And we'll see patients that are malnourished come in and they're started on I.V. fluids

383
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:31,720
and their electrolytes just start to tank just because of the dextrose they get.

384
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:37,200
So what is the standard protocol to feeding order look like?

385
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:41,280
It starts at 50 miles an hour, which is not super high.

386
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,860
But when we have somebody that's kind of frail and malnourished, that's going to be too fast.

387
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:52,500
So we'll take an example of what that would look like. It's usually a 1.5 cal per mile formula.

388
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,470
Get none of this. You need to know we're going to do actual nutrition.

389
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:03,420
Lots of practice with it next semester, but all that means that there's one and a half calories per milliliter of formula.

390
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,709
So 50 channels per hour. Let's say you come in. She's already gotten 8 hours.

391
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:12,210
So that's 400 mls total times one and a half calories per.

392
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:16,710
And also she's gotten 600 calories from this 2 billion.

393
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:23,700
So in her first 24 hours, she's gotten 845 calories or close to 60% of her needs.

394
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:32,970
That's not like excessive. But you can see in a patient like this, that is definitely enough to drive them into a feeding process.

395
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,790
Sometimes we forget that the IV fluids is also contributing to this.

396
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,470
Now, not everybody is going to be on day five, but that's something to just keep in mind.

397
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,120
Okay. So she's definitely got too much nutrition, too fast.

398
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:54,550
Her electrolytes now are very low. What should our next steps be for this patient?

399
00:43:54,580 --> 00:44:00,549
What would you do if you came in that morning? Let's see. The fitting order was placed last night or over the weekend.

400
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:07,330
You come in, you do your assessment, you see those electrolytes, you see the fluids running, you see the two feedings running.

401
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:17,110
What would your next step be? Just slow down or replenish the electrolytes.

402
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:26,530
Yeah, but I think we have to do something. I would probably page the team, either hold the two feeds or let's like cut the rate in half.

403
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:36,550
We probably would want to just hold things. Another thing I would probably say is can we change to a non dextrose containing I.V. fluid?

404
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:43,299
Course, we're not going to order that. But you could tell your medical team, like if you need to give her hydration,

405
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:47,470
can you do it without the dextrose component, especially now that we've started?

406
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:54,520
And so nutrition, it's always good to just have like one source when possible of calorie delivery.

407
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:58,870
Definitely want to correct the electrolyte abnormalities before restarting

408
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:03,070
enteral nutrition or if we just cut it in half before we start advancing again.

409
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:07,240
So that has to happen. Maybe that should even be like the first thing.

410
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:13,760
But we want to hold hold off on giving more nutrition. So let's say we do all these things.

411
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,130
How would we restart our internal nutrition? Let's say we we we stop the two feedings.

412
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:24,310
We got the dextrose out of the IV fluids and we've now supplemented the electrolytes.

413
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:32,430
What would you guys do? I would reduce the percentage.

414
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:40,320
Yeah, we would just start at a much lower rate. You know, sometimes we'll just say ten miles an hour for the first 24 hours or ten,

415
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:45,770
ten, ten miles an hour for 12 hours increase by five miles every time.

416
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:50,009
You know, we we'd come up with a progression and we would we would put that order.

417
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:57,480
And we'll also monitor the electrolytes closely with the reunion initiation of our initial nutrition.

418
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,889
And it really would be twice a day. So it just means twice a day.

419
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:07,830
You'll see that. And clinical chart notes a lot, specifically the phosphorous, magnesium and potassium.

420
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:11,040
Those are the ones we're going to have to monitor very closely.

421
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:18,200
Okay. So remember our nice guidelines here.

422
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:25,910
Severe illness or MPO for five days? Maybe they're well nurse, but they're really sick and they haven't been eating.

423
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:33,050
We could start at 50% of their standard needs for the first two days if they're criteria for high risk.

424
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:36,470
It could be at ten cals per kilogram increase over seven days.

425
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,290
Extreme risk would be even lower.

426
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:48,950
Or per the guide in the papers, which I tend to lean on a little bit more, is the 25% of their estimated energy needs as a starting place.

427
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:53,330
And that might have to continue beyond the first 24 hours.

428
00:46:53,330 --> 00:47:00,230
Maybe it's like the first two days. We just kind of hold here and then we kind of start to increase slowly.

429
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:14,930
Okay. Let's do another case. This is a 65 year old male admitted to the ICU with COPD exacerbation.

430
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:18,650
So chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.

431
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:25,400
Patient was well-nourished prior to admission. Just returned from a Caribbean cruise with his family.

432
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Now he's intubated and sedated, so he's on a ventilator.

433
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:35,270
Enteral feedings were initiated at a low rate within 24 to 48 hours of admission.

434
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:38,870
If somebody is on a ventilator, they're not going to be able to eat. Right.

435
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:49,840
So they're going to be on enteral nutrition. So it's phosphorus level on hospital days two and three were 1.7 and 1.9.

436
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:56,920
That is low. That's going to be below the reference range. Magnesium and potassium levels were within normal limits.

437
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:05,090
So in your opinion, is this patient exhibiting signs of repeating syndrome and or is this patient at risk?

438
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:17,170
No, it doesn't. What it feels like is well-nourished before coming in.

439
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:23,080
I don't know. The time is right to tell us too much because we don't have a lot of information how

440
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:30,930
long he's been on the field or I guess he's been better off two days or something.

441
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:35,890
I would agree. I don't I don't think this is receding.

442
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:44,380
The patient was well nourished, came in with a COPD that, you know, essentially a pulmonary emergency, required ventilation.

443
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,510
They started enteral nutrition pretty quickly and then at a low rate.

444
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:57,160
Yes, question. I'm sure are things on the.

445
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,840
Time for. Oh, good question.

446
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:09,699
No, we can run and tell nutrition continuously and they'll they usually will have I.V. access.

447
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:13,600
And that's how we deliver like a phosphorus bolus, for instance.

448
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:21,110
Like if. Or does it just are they just.

449
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:28,160
Yes. Sometimes it it can be really especially phosphorus.

450
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,980
It can be really difficult to get them back rebounded within the limits.

451
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:39,260
We can be getting a ton of us fast and they're they're just kind of it's just that whole process.

452
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:43,549
It's just being it's so depleted. The cellular transition is happening quickly.

453
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:51,980
So that's a good question. Like a lot of times we're giving a lot of electrolytes to replace them and it can take a while for them to really respond.

454
00:49:53,750 --> 00:50:00,860
But the nutrition delivery will be separate, like it's going through a tube hooked up to a pump,

455
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:04,160
and then they'll have the electrolytes go through with their IP access.

456
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:11,420
There are situations where we can flush electrolytes through a feeding tube that may be in our more stable patients,

457
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:15,300
but usually all at the same time through the IP.

458
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:22,640
Yeah, it is diarrhea feeding syndrome because this person wasn't malnourished to start with.

459
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:24,590
Yeah, it would be unlikely.

460
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:33,680
So someone coming in while nurse there started on child nutrition pretty quickly this the low phosphorus could just be due to.

461
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:42,639
Sometimes like hyperventilation or patients with respiratory issues.

462
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:47,740
It could be due to that. We're just kind of assuming, but I agree like this.

463
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:52,330
This is not like a bikini picture. We don't need to slow down the two buildings.

464
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:59,590
We don't need to stop things. Of course they're going to supplement the phosphorus, but it's this that's likely not due to refilling.

465
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,800
Okay. So what next steps would we take for this patient?

466
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:19,299
Kind of already talked about that. Probably just correct the electrolyte abnormalities maybe prior to bumping up the until nutrition.

467
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,060
But I don't think that might even be a little too conservative.

468
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:31,840
I think you can keep progressing with the nutrition but still monitor and of course correct the the phosphorus.

469
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:40,810
Okay. Last one and we will get done early today. Surprise!

470
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:46,160
This is great. Okay, so this is even less information than the previous case.

471
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:52,010
We have a 45 year old female admitted from the E.R. with diabetic ketoacidosis.

472
00:51:53,240 --> 00:52:00,080
She was eating well into it until two days ago when she became ill from a virus and stopped taking food and medications.

473
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:06,560
So her current weight is 62 kilograms. Her usual weight is around 65 kilograms.

474
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:15,740
She's receiving IV fluids at 125 miles an hour, and she's on an insulin drip with potassium replacement.

475
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:27,020
Patients that come in with DKA or diabetic ketoacidosis, their blood sugar levels are really, really high, so they're often on drip.

476
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,690
On admission. Her potassium level was 5.8. That's elevated.

477
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:38,790
Her phosphorus was 4.6. That's high normal, and magnesium was 2.5.

478
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:44,320
That's normal. Her phosphorus level now is 1.4.

479
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:50,310
You think this patient is exhibiting signs of re feeding syndrome?

480
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,020
This one's difficult, in my opinion. What do you guys think?

481
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:08,070
I see some head nods and some handshakes. If it's not reheating, what do you think could be happening here?

482
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:27,650
Yes. I wouldn't expect you to know this.

483
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:35,770
So, yes. When people in the UK are really uncontrolled blood sugar, we can see very high potassium levels.

484
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:42,730
She could also be dehydrated on this mission. So these electrolytes and a falsely elevated.

485
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:49,430
She's not an infant, meaning she's getting continuous insulin infusion.

486
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:56,470
What is kind of the driving force behind repeating insulin?

487
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:02,120
So in this situation, I think it's possible this patient is repeating.

488
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,120
She hasn't been eating well. She has lost weight.

489
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:06,950
It's just been two days.

490
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:19,310
But I think in addition to that, with this continuous insulin infusion, that could really be mimicking the effects of her feeding syndrome.

491
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:26,510
So often resolution of a DKA or a diabetic ketoacidosis will mimic feeding syndrome

492
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:31,190
due to those potent effects of insulin driving electrolytes intracellular.

493
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:37,970
So even if it's not due to reseeding, that whole process can still happen.

494
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:47,019
So she may be repeating after experiencing loss of potassium, magnesium and phosphorus in the urine during the cap, during the catabolic,

495
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:57,040
effects of decay or decaying is highly catabolic and patients can lose weight quickly because they're not utilizing the blood sugar.

496
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,780
It's just in the blood very high.

497
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:07,650
And the exactness insulin can accelerate the serum drops of glucose because of the electrolytes moving into the cell.

498
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:16,360
And it's really because the cells can't use that sugar in the blood for energy.

499
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:25,460
So this is a really complicated kind of process, but I think it's possible it could be repeating or it could just be the resolution of four DKA.

500
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:35,040
And then you mentioned it. Patients presenting with DKA have really large potassium deficits,

501
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:42,720
so they can have really high levels on admission, but it can drop very quickly once treatment is started.

502
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:55,250
Okay. So what should our next steps be for this patient? Let's see.

503
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:04,670
Her phosphorus has now dropped. So I would say probably excess aggressive depletion of her electrolytes.

504
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:11,210
She's not on until nutrition. She we're just going to restart her oral diet and monitor.

505
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:19,130
But it really is just going to be driven by electrolyte replacement until that blood sugar has really come down and stabilized,

506
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:23,090
she'll probably remain on insulin. So we're going to have to just kind of balance that.

507
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:28,390
So that one is a little bit beyond the scope of this class.

508
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:36,670
But just to give you an idea of some different presentations, we may see that could look similar to repeating, but potentially not.

509
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:47,269
So the whole point of like this second one. Even though those nice guidelines say a low electrolytes on admission.

510
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:53,050
So this was after nutrition was started that we saw the low phosphorus.

511
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:58,639
So that was maybe the only criteria from those guidelines.

512
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,030
That is probably a little subjective.

513
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:09,710
Just because somebody has a low potassium, that admission alone does not mean that they're at risk for feeding, in my opinion.

514
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:15,110
So even though that was kind of on that left column of high risk,

515
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:20,210
if just one of these, I believe, always make sure we're looking at the whole picture.

516
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:25,490
Okay. Just one little electrolyte. We need to maybe investigate a little bit more.

517
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:31,480
Does anybody have any questions? That's all I have for you today.

518
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:43,540
Feel pretty good? Yes. And that's another trend.

519
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:54,520
Oh, that's a good question. You know, maybe like it is increasing, that's still low.

520
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:01,980
So I would maybe consider that but don't like we'd want to see more of a trend.

521
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:06,310
It's what I would say. But that's that's a good sign if they go up a little bit.

522
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:16,370
But we'd like to maybe see it. Any other questions?

523
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:23,090
Yes. The diamond deficiency with reviewing, I know it usually is at the end of like many charts is I guess the timing of that.

524
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:30,260
I was a bit confused work. Was it kind of simultaneous as well? I would say like in terms of when the depletion is happening?

525
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:33,930
Yeah. It's very similar.

526
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:37,160
Yes. Once carbohydrate is reinstituted.

527
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:43,549
Yes. Because it is a whole factor for carbohydrate metabolism in the stores are probably very low.

528
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:48,230
It's just going to be depleted further. So yeah, it's kind of like at the end of that.

529
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:54,860
But this these things are all kind of happening all at once or at once to some degree.

530
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:07,130
And almost all you'll see when you guys do some clinical rotations, you'll see something called like a banana bag, so they'll hang for a patient.

531
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:14,090
It's just a yellow IV fluids solution. It's got thiamin folic acid, some other electrolytes.

532
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:17,150
And that's usually someone that's come in very dehydrated.

533
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:23,780
They use that a lot for patients with alcoholism that come in because those vitamins are depleted.

534
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:31,430
So those things could actually kind of always be on board for our malnourished patients because we're just assuming depletion.

535
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:37,720
Anything else? Okay.

536
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:45,720
Well, that's all we have today. This is like the record being done early and then Tuesday.
