00:00:05,244 --> 00:00:07,828
Hi, welcome back.

2
00:00:07,828 --> 00:00:10,524
The same as pretty much everything else.

3
00:00:10,524 --> 00:00:13,931
Human resources management is evolving.

4
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:19,710
And it should be, because of the speed and degree of change in the economy,

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,852
in industries and specifically in the health field.

6
00:00:23,852 --> 00:00:27,100
In this second segment of the module,

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:32,289
we'll discuss the new role of human resources management.

8
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:36,516
To begin, let's talk about the video clip you just watched.

9
00:00:36,516 --> 00:00:39,014
The clip shows the stereotype or

10
00:00:39,014 --> 00:00:44,295
the general public's perception of human resources management.

11
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:51,479
As a matter of fact, human resource management has gotten a bad rep.

12
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:54,740
When you tell your coworker, I'm going to HR,

13
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,746
their reaction maybe I'm so sorry, what happened?

14
00:00:58,746 --> 00:01:03,094
Because there's a general perception that human resources

15
00:01:03,094 --> 00:01:06,596
is a place you go only when something goes wrong.

16
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:12,743
Or when you are in trouble or when you are on the elimination list to be fired.

17
00:01:12,743 --> 00:01:18,203
Human resources also has the reputation that they make the rules and

18
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:21,283
that they do everything by the rules.

19
00:01:21,283 --> 00:01:25,158
It is also thought of as a black hole,

20
00:01:25,158 --> 00:01:29,039
things only go in and never come out.

21
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:33,708
And there's a perception that they are slow in response.

22
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:38,285
When you do need HR or human resources, and come to them with questions,

23
00:01:38,285 --> 00:01:43,687
suggestions, and complaints, they rarely respond because their hands are tied and

24
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,805
there's not much they could do.

25
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:50,820
So as a result of all this reasons, human resources,

26
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:57,739
it perceived to be a department to work around toward to avoid at all cost.

27
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:03,106
In fact, there is actually some truth to those perceptions.

28
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:07,829
Because human resources management in many organizations

29
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:13,117
are still stuck in the past when the focus was solely on selecting,

30
00:02:13,117 --> 00:02:16,243
controlling, and letting go people.

31
00:02:16,243 --> 00:02:21,601
And when human resources management was actually called personnel management.

32
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:25,867
In many organizations including health organizations,

33
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:30,403
the change from personnel to human resources is only in name.

34
00:02:30,403 --> 00:02:37,235
Substantively, the nature and the scope of activity have remained the same.

35
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:43,804
However, this old personnel model is no longer sufficient today.

36
00:02:43,804 --> 00:02:48,644
To fully support an organization, making it not only a good, but

37
00:02:48,644 --> 00:02:53,492
really a great organization, a transformation is much needed.

38
00:02:53,492 --> 00:02:58,706
And human resources management has the responsibility of contributing

39
00:02:58,706 --> 00:03:03,664
to creating an organizational culture and environment where people

40
00:03:03,664 --> 00:03:08,037
have an opportunity to be heard and for the truth to be heard.

41
00:03:08,037 --> 00:03:13,710
Which means human recourses is not just a management function or

42
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,450
tool to get personnel in line.

43
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,147
It needs to be as we discussed the piece

44
00:03:20,147 --> 00:03:24,777
in the puzzle that bring everything together.

45
00:03:24,777 --> 00:03:28,690
The diagram on this slide shows four quadrants that

46
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,148
are organized according to two dimensions.

47
00:03:32,148 --> 00:03:35,762
The first dimension is operation cost,

48
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:40,768
operational focus versus future and strategic focus.

49
00:03:40,768 --> 00:03:45,720
And the second dimension is process versus people.

50
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,373
Traditionally, human resources is in the lower

51
00:03:50,373 --> 00:03:55,713
left-hand quadrant called administrative experts.

52
00:03:55,713 --> 00:04:00,765
As administrative experts, everything human resources

53
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:05,301
does is operational administrative activities and

54
00:04:05,301 --> 00:04:09,535
is focused on the processes rather than people.

55
00:04:09,535 --> 00:04:15,112
This traditional role was useful because it served two primary purposes.

56
00:04:15,112 --> 00:04:21,312
First, it freed managers from personally having to fire workers.

57
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:26,807
And second, it was able to establish consistency in hiring,

58
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:30,412
firing, and compensation practices.

59
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:37,976
In this traditional role, human resources serve primarily the executive agenda.

60
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:42,336
But what's viewed as a roadblock are the rest of organizations,

61
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:45,675
therefore the bad reputation that we discussed.

62
00:04:45,675 --> 00:04:49,666
To help organizations to adjust in a dynamic world and

63
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:54,725
make the transformation from good to great, human resources needs

64
00:04:54,725 --> 00:05:00,416
to move towards the other three quadrants by becoming a strategic partner.

65
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:06,000
By being an employee advocate and by serving as a change agent.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,762
As a strategic partner, human resources need forward thinking and

67
00:05:10,762 --> 00:05:13,184
contribute to the development and

68
00:05:13,184 --> 00:05:18,293
accomplishment of organization wide strategic plans and objectives.

69
00:05:18,293 --> 00:05:23,898
To fulfill the role, human resources need to modify to mindset

70
00:05:23,898 --> 00:05:28,880
from being a top management servant to being a partner.

71
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,192
What it means is that human resources needs to adjust its

72
00:05:34,192 --> 00:05:40,988
practices to help organizations become more adaptive and resilient.

73
00:05:40,988 --> 00:05:45,841
Second, human resources management in today's organizations

74
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:48,407
needs to be an employee advocate.

75
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:53,205
It means that they need to have a customer oriented mindset,

76
00:05:53,205 --> 00:05:57,172
and treat employees as their primary customers.

77
00:05:57,172 --> 00:05:58,905
In this advocate war,

78
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:03,842
human resources management is not just an immediate function.

79
00:06:03,842 --> 00:06:08,483
It represents employees concerns to the top management.

80
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:14,232
Also their other responsibility should be to create a work environment and

81
00:06:14,232 --> 00:06:18,886
culture that empowers employees to have a sense of ownership

82
00:06:18,886 --> 00:06:23,279
of the organization, and are motivated to contribute.

83
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:30,953
Finally, human resources management today needs to become a change champion.

84
00:06:30,953 --> 00:06:37,198
By offering and promoting continuous learning throughout an organization.

85
00:06:37,198 --> 00:06:42,311
By promoting employees identification, as well as their committment to

86
00:06:42,311 --> 00:06:47,594
organization's missions, values, vision, goals, and action plans.

87
00:06:47,594 --> 00:06:53,154
Human resources should also involved in using appropriate metrics

88
00:06:53,154 --> 00:06:59,405
to assess organization's effectiveness in meeting is mission and goals.

89
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:04,553
At the same time, human resources should evaluate functions

90
00:07:04,553 --> 00:07:09,315
in relation to the strategic needs of the organization.

91
00:07:09,315 --> 00:07:15,217
So to summarize, succesful organizations are becoming more adaptive,

92
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:20,651
resilient, quick to change the direction and customer oriented.

93
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:26,446
In this environment, much of the human resources role shall be transforming.
