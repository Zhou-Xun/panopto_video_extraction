1
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:29,010
Mr. So, hey, good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,650
I just wanted to start off by looking at our calendar quick just to kind of reset,

3
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:40,080
we got like multiple moving parts going on feeling like the exam is finally behind us.

4
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:48,930
I know you're in the throes of the proposal assignment. And then today we'll actually take a peek ahead towards the debate assignment,

5
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,720
which really doesn't happen until that first week of December, the last week of classes.

6
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:01,170
But we'll actually kind of get a head start on it just from an organizational perspective, just to point out,

7
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,640
make sure folks are seeing this, will go through these a little bit later in the class period.

8
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,740
But the debate instructions are posted. The debate group assignments are posted today.

9
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,730
No lecture three, although Professor Meeker's lecture on Tuesday, which I thought was awesome,

10
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:26,790
like he's just he has an amazing background in that area that I simply don't have.

11
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,310
Right. So it's not like you just covering the concepts.

12
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:35,880
He's like drawing on all of his, you know, 20 years of research experience, managing all of those nuances.

13
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:44,640
Right. Of bio monitoring and biomarker collection and where it's hard, where it's opportunistic.

14
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:54,210
You know, what what the challenges are along the way, but also kind of bring it home right to the bigger picture of the, you know,

15
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:03,540
where modeling fits in versus measurements and how things can be used to kind of synergistically or alone as it may be.

16
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,550
All right. So we have we have two objectives today.

17
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:14,160
One is we're going to do our third installment of Exposure Science and the news.

18
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:22,770
We'll use about the first half of the class for that, the second half of the class we use to kind of dig into our our debate group assignment.

19
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:30,300
Both of these will involves, you know, some breakouts and discussion among smaller groups before we do that,

20
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:37,500
knowing that the proposal is due a week from today. I do have it created now as an assignment.

21
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,900
You should see it in canvas. You'll be able to submit the assignment just as an electronic file.

22
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:53,130
I don't think it's specified. Not your your choice, if you want a word or whatever is easiest for you is fine by me.

23
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:59,630
Do you folks have any questions on the proposal assignment?

24
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:05,300
Yeah, I was wondering if we should be you in things of my life.

25
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,690
I think it's a big time. Should we say we found this?

26
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,740
And I don't think we should all just be like a plan.

27
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:18,080
You you. Yeah. So that's a good question.

28
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,510
And the way it was, the way it was posed. Right.

29
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:28,400
As an assignment was it's this kind of hypothetical situation where residents of a community just kind of went

30
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,280
out on their own initiative and got their blood tested and found that their levels were were higher than,

31
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:43,070
you know, if they kind of Googled it or looked into some data, sources are higher than where it's reported elsewhere and across the country.

32
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,770
And so there are some concern raised. Right.

33
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:51,800
And so that's kind of like the initial bit of negative information about where there might be a problem here.

34
00:03:51,800 --> 00:04:01,640
So, yeah, so I kind of told you all that you can choose a real factual existing community, right, to be in Ann Arbor.

35
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,260
It could be Lansing, Traverse City, whatever it is.

36
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:12,260
But in Michigan. But I also gave you some freedom to kind of make up make it can be Andréa land.

37
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:22,040
Right. Or injury in Greenville and choose the size that it is and what the socioeconomic makeup is.

38
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:28,730
So in that regard, yeah, you can you can have a little bit of freedom.

39
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:36,020
I mean, the whole point of the assignment is I'm looking for you to kind of actively walk through

40
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:42,800
that process of exploring what exposure assessment approaches might be available,

41
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,640
kind of to weigh the pros and cons of each of them in that context, and then kind of finalize by saying,

42
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:58,460
based on all of this kind of analysis that I've laid out, I'm suggesting that this would be the best way forward in this circumstance.

43
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:04,700
So the answer is, yes, you can you can kind of lay out some some details of your,

44
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:11,840
you know, fictional, futuristic community, if you'd like to if that if that's helpful.

45
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:20,870
Yeah, of course. And Rebecca mean it's like we're talking about pros and cons of different methods,

46
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,600
would it be appropriate like a table for like bullet points to do that?

47
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,220
Or do you want it all written out as like it's up to you?

48
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,510
Yeah, I'm I'm not looking for it to be pretty necessarily.

49
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:39,730
Right. So, you know, don't worry about it being I'm looking for like the nuts and bolts here.

50
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:44,410
So bullets are easier if a table is easier.

51
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,840
I think I made a statement in there that said, you know,

52
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:53,410
there's this eight to 10 page and I'm looking for but tables, figures, references don't really count.

53
00:05:53,410 --> 00:06:00,520
So if that kind of frees you up and you just want to make a table to stick on the end, that that is absolutely an option if that's easier.

54
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,540
OK, yeah, I'm just happy.

55
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:13,120
Yeah, I really I'm looking to be have the least amount of constraint as possible and kind of what's the format of how you, how you accomplish this.

56
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:20,200
So whatever kind of it works best for you should be OK as long as you can get across.

57
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:27,540
Right. Kind of the aspects of the grading rubric and address each of the points.

58
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:39,200
These are good questions, any others?

59
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:46,400
All right, so, you know, I totally understand that there's likely a lot of work still ahead of you over the next week.

60
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,790
If questions do come up, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

61
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,390
I'd be happy to either solve it over email or we can schedule.

62
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:58,760
Was that that's easier to address whatever questions. All right.

63
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,290
So with that, let's go ahead and change gears.

64
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:10,580
So it seems like it's been a couple of weeks since we had one of these exposures, science in the news exercises for this one.

65
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:16,730
We're kind of addressing all of the things that we were for the first two, but going a little bit beyond right.

66
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:23,510
And kind of applying what we've learned, even the aspects of the proposal assignment and kind of finishing with in your example,

67
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:28,580
your article, talk about, you know, what would be the opportunities for exposure assessment.

68
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,920
How might you go about it within the context of your article?

69
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,520
Come off real quick and see how many folks are going to be.

70
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:48,480
We've got well, how about in the interest of time, let's let's try to pair off not para four groups of three,

71
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:56,640
can you can you all kind of like geographically sort of self-selecting to four groups of three?

72
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:05,490
And if you need to rearrange physically a little bit, that's OK as well first and then we'll do the same format.

73
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,800
Each person will have to five minutes, I'll remind you,

74
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:20,643
to kind of rotate through so that each person had the chance to explain their article and then only be to and.

75
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:37,013
All right. Let's go ahead and reconvene. That's.

76
00:08:37,013 --> 00:08:41,623
Cool, so sounds like lots of interesting discussion going on.

77
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:48,383
Sorry that we can't hear all of them, we don't really have that amount of flexibility in class, but I folks wouldn't mind.

78
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:55,463
I don't know if you've come to some sort of consensus within your group to report out one of the articles summaries.

79
00:08:55,463 --> 00:09:00,063
Maybe we'll start on this side of the room and kind of work our way around.

80
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:07,133
So the group over here, do you have an article that you can share with the whole class? Yes, we actually have the same article.

81
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:15,033
Oh, no kidding. Yeah. Yesterday, we both jumped on it, so it was on the ballot and soldiers in fast,

82
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:27,593
we had to be tested a bunch of fast food places to study better and they had to accept the food,

83
00:09:27,593 --> 00:09:35,363
had traces of beelines, mostly predicted from the handle of food clothes themselves.

84
00:09:35,363 --> 00:09:37,343
If you think that was the impact.

85
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:47,993
Well, the idea of the being doesn't give you an indication that we had a lot more coverage of the elites than a vegetarian options.

86
00:09:47,993 --> 00:09:57,323
And I just told you here it probably was in the shape of the food products that can possibly be chewing on toys,

87
00:09:57,323 --> 00:10:09,743
probably McDonald's toys or some of that, because those are toxins, either external contact to get her to look at packaging, maybe it's see.

88
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:20,183
And then how do we assess exposure? Usually I think violets are measured in older body tablets.

89
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:30,423
And I saw estimates that five to 20 times the absorbed dose or ingested dose of the actual milliliters is not pretty.

90
00:10:30,423 --> 00:10:42,173
That's a pretty big range. So I guess maybe I'm wondering what the B it would be better use of fecal matter and said I know it's not as commonly used,

91
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:45,013
but like it might be more telling the story.

92
00:10:45,013 --> 00:10:58,433
It's over and there will be a million people that are trying to, you know, through those processes more often.

93
00:10:58,433 --> 00:11:04,223
Thank you so much and very cool that it was maybe article of the day sometime.

94
00:11:04,223 --> 00:11:09,593
Curious, I haven't seen this article. So not just Oranje, but to anybody who's familiar with it.

95
00:11:09,593 --> 00:11:16,463
Was it only looking at the fast food restaurants and processing specifically, you know,

96
00:11:16,463 --> 00:11:25,073
just like samples from 64 line menu items across like mainstream Battleford, occasionally these places.

97
00:11:25,073 --> 00:11:29,483
OK, that's what I talk about.

98
00:11:29,483 --> 00:11:38,193
OK, yeah, they got about like 78 percent of the time.

99
00:11:38,193 --> 00:11:43,823
I'm sure the main concern of this article is even though it's like, wait a minute,

100
00:11:43,823 --> 00:11:49,293
it is recommended, it solely may also be slower for most people in life.

101
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:54,603
And if you throw it away, you know, we all using that as their main source of food.

102
00:11:54,603 --> 00:11:58,493
So it's like those populations are much more at risk.

103
00:11:58,493 --> 00:12:08,213
Absolutely. We kind of control that. Now, I know a guy who is like when he used to say, like, they're like, oh, I should eat less fast food.

104
00:12:08,213 --> 00:12:11,913
However, the fact that I wasn't born, he seemed more concentrated.

105
00:12:11,913 --> 00:12:18,173
And it kind of makes you think more about this is the packaging and handling and processing them.

106
00:12:18,173 --> 00:12:23,003
Right. Which then makes you consider is it just the same grocery products?

107
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:26,783
Sure. Well, yeah, no easy way to make that.

108
00:12:26,783 --> 00:12:32,603
And that was a little bit of the context of why I asked my my question was, was there any reporting of, I don't know,

109
00:12:32,603 --> 00:12:38,693
a regular restaurant or other sort, you know, food distribution systems, which would be really interesting.

110
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:43,373
But I can see the fast food industry. I mean, there's a lot of kind of process, right?

111
00:12:43,373 --> 00:12:47,123
Packaging maybe more so than other associated with it.

112
00:12:47,123 --> 00:12:55,193
So that approach makes sense. And yes, as you mentioned, when it's you know, there's already kind of a you know, based on socioeconomic status,

113
00:12:55,193 --> 00:13:02,933
a kind of a vulnerable sub population that's using that as a food source more frequently than than others.

114
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:07,913
Awesome. Thank you so much to everyone who brought that article with them today.

115
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:22,193
Let's go ahead and move to the next group. The article that I found is concerning a variety of people, and it was found in North Carolina in 2014.

116
00:13:22,193 --> 00:13:28,073
I heard the news update is that the EPA is releasing toxicology report on it.

117
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:35,933
And so like this, the report levels are lower than what the time is currently like watching for.

118
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:40,823
And even still, like even the house watching points, just like the recommended amount.

119
00:13:40,823 --> 00:13:47,363
It's not like a revelation. So basically,

120
00:13:47,363 --> 00:13:56,063
they're expecting the EPA to release an advisory in the spring and they're not going to really do anything until then to lower the of the election.

121
00:13:56,063 --> 00:14:05,393
So some people are angry about that for sure. And sure. But the water policy.

122
00:14:05,393 --> 00:14:09,863
So Genex is the variety and the timing is good,

123
00:14:09,863 --> 00:14:19,013
and it's on the coast of California and the chemical has been released into the barrier before the local river,

124
00:14:19,013 --> 00:14:24,173
and it provides drinking water to dozens of people.

125
00:14:24,173 --> 00:14:33,393
And it's. The company is like us enough to do it with your partner, and they like change the name,

126
00:14:33,393 --> 00:14:42,213
I think I was wondering what is life threatening divorce, as we know and.

127
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:54,393
So. You're they found that it's basically being released into the groundwater through runoff and it's also the.

128
00:14:54,393 --> 00:15:01,833
And since he was found, they've been charged with running a study on the five deposits that they released.

129
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:11,423
So that was a good move by the. The Department of Health and Human Services.

130
00:15:11,423 --> 00:15:16,313
Yeah, hopefully that makes sense now.

131
00:15:16,313 --> 00:15:24,713
That's awesome. Thanks, thanks for sharing. And then I'm going to prompt not just you specifically, but I'll look at you, but really open to anyone.

132
00:15:24,713 --> 00:15:30,473
And this is good. This is going to be interesting because the topic is pithos. Right now, you're all working on this proposal assignment.

133
00:15:30,473 --> 00:15:50,323
So what what would be in this scenario that that Andrea described, what would be some opportunities for assessing exposures in that context?

134
00:15:50,323 --> 00:15:54,223
So third is more like the company of the river.

135
00:15:54,223 --> 00:15:59,503
So definitely getting more caffeine on a river and a warm river because one's getting

136
00:15:59,503 --> 00:16:06,013
any idea how his lungs are doing and they can do like water to the household,

137
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:11,203
you know, what their lungs are. So it kind of some area sampling.

138
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:18,493
Right. Some slightly more focused residential sampling. OK, any other ideas I heard on the Paris attacks?

139
00:16:18,493 --> 00:16:25,753
And so far, we must consider the possibility of getting some of that air that gets it.

140
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:30,463
The raindrops falls and that may be a lot less oil for our area.

141
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:41,023
OK, excellent. So looking at kind of another environmental pathway, looking at air and soil, perhaps in addition to the water.

142
00:16:41,023 --> 00:16:48,513
Great. Many others.

143
00:16:48,513 --> 00:16:55,233
All right, cool, thanks so much to the group and to Andrea, let's go ahead and move up front over here with all did you come up with.

144
00:16:55,233 --> 00:17:02,443
So you're going to say that Olsher nine out of nine was from a town in Michigan called Kalamazoo.

145
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:06,873
I know I said stay close to the border with Illinois.

146
00:17:06,873 --> 00:17:18,003
And there's basically this community is hurting some voters and they're downwind from a a packaging facility and a wastewater treatment plant.

147
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:24,723
So the concern was that it was hydrogen sulfide. So the residents complained enough.

148
00:17:24,723 --> 00:17:29,823
And it's a primarily black community. So there's a fair bit of environmental justice concerns also.

149
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:39,663
And the EPA and Michigan Health Department came out and did air quality testing around the factory and the wastewater with the global economy vehicle.

150
00:17:39,663 --> 00:17:45,933
But they couldn't detect any light colored hydrogen sulfide or anything else because of the odor.

151
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:49,543
But like the testers were like, we can smell it. We just don't know where it's coming from.

152
00:17:49,543 --> 00:17:53,403
So identify the source.

153
00:17:53,403 --> 00:18:03,213
And because of these complaints in the factory is also receives some violations for like the odor they have, like hydrogen sulfide monitors.

154
00:18:03,213 --> 00:18:10,833
And the wastewater facility changed how they were processing, like the waste.

155
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:17,463
So they was like they said, there's no short term exposures and they're working on, like, assessing a long term exposure.

156
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:23,193
So this was like three weeks ago. So it's a good ongoing assessment.

157
00:18:23,193 --> 00:18:29,113
So the impact of exposure is hydrogen sulfide of chemical,

158
00:18:29,113 --> 00:18:34,953
and it can be appearance and it has really high levels and the main pathway would be linked

159
00:18:34,953 --> 00:18:42,813
to the atmosphere and air and therefore it would be an inhalation and for excessive exposure.

160
00:18:42,813 --> 00:18:51,963
But like the air monitoring and air quality sampling of the area and also the camera, maybe the sources,

161
00:18:51,963 --> 00:19:00,933
and then they were also doing some looking at the study of like asthma prevalence and really the hospitalizations and the surrounding area.

162
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:06,513
And then I like it would be maybe helpful to do some, like geospatial modeling if they knew where the source was.

163
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:10,593
But they can't seem to like, identify. Right. Right. Which is concerning.

164
00:19:10,593 --> 00:19:14,733
Yeah. Thank you so much for sharing a little bit concerning.

165
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:21,033
Write that up. And I haven't watched the whole recording. Actually, this this reminds me of Professor Júlia.

166
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:25,773
Did he happen to mention I've heard him describe this before in previous lectures,

167
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:31,803
but when he lectured in the class, did he talk about using your nose as an environmental monitor?

168
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:38,703
No. OK, so, you know, he's like this modeler guy, right? So I really kind of downplays, like all the effort we go through to make measurements.

169
00:19:38,703 --> 00:19:45,093
He's like, you know, we spend all this money on this equipment. In this technology. We have a really good sensor right here on our face.

170
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:48,233
If you can smell it, this tells you you're being exposed. So. Right.

171
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:56,973
So in this case, this is writing reported that they can actually smell it, but they're not able to detect it with their monitoring equipment.

172
00:19:56,973 --> 00:20:06,753
It's absolutely concerning to say something because like I Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo and I worked all over that area and like,

173
00:20:06,753 --> 00:20:13,953
there be some mornings that I could be. So it just smelled like the worst gas station that we ever want to like.

174
00:20:13,953 --> 00:20:17,793
And it was so strong that I was always in the mornings.

175
00:20:17,793 --> 00:20:22,443
So people would assume it's like they're going do a Saturday or something like that,

176
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:30,153
depending on the wind patterns that have to be literally just sit there just like a so.

177
00:20:30,153 --> 00:20:34,953
Yeah. And it was like sometimes it blew through the campus.

178
00:20:34,953 --> 00:20:43,143
You can use some words and it sure. Very hilly area despite being in Michigan.

179
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:51,723
But yeah, I was just there always had folks out there, you know, and so soon to be determined.

180
00:20:51,723 --> 00:20:56,313
Right. Well this is an ongoing issue. We'll see how this plays out. Excellent.

181
00:20:56,313 --> 00:21:04,983
Thank you so much for sharing that. And then the group up at the top, if you wouldn't mind reporting out.

182
00:21:04,983 --> 00:21:11,493
So my uncle is now a.

183
00:21:11,493 --> 00:21:19,003
A recent study by the U.S. there has just received funding from the EPA and.

184
00:21:19,003 --> 00:21:29,173
We're looking at a household exposure and children and.

185
00:21:29,173 --> 00:21:33,433
One of the biggest three big reasons why this.

186
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:41,903
Speaking of. I guess because of that, everyone staying indoors more often, so.

187
00:21:41,903 --> 00:21:50,943
If the children would be exposed to dust more, but also creation of dust from people being indoors.

188
00:21:50,943 --> 00:22:03,913
Sure, yeah. The streets of. Indeed, the chemicals that were of interest, but the main one was.

189
00:22:03,913 --> 00:22:17,453
Just the. Flame retardants and environmental phenols, they made enough in the past.

190
00:22:17,453 --> 00:22:27,383
One of the big issues. But the last word, contamination from.

191
00:22:27,383 --> 00:22:39,493
And as we know, children turn to. By putting things in their mouth, too, so that proves to be a major.

192
00:22:39,493 --> 00:22:52,523
There is a round of explosion.

193
00:22:52,523 --> 00:23:01,603
Another that they made was some of these. This final.

194
00:23:01,603 --> 00:23:08,123
They lasted about a year for a long time, so children.

195
00:23:08,123 --> 00:23:15,893
Probably a very large target group. He got.

196
00:23:15,893 --> 00:23:28,553
So you want. Exposures for Solms and.

197
00:23:28,553 --> 00:23:30,533
Awesome. No, thank you so much, yeah.

198
00:23:30,533 --> 00:23:40,793
And this was actually really nice, like the huge variety in the types of pollutants agents that you all at least reported out,

199
00:23:40,793 --> 00:23:46,113
the environmental pathways and then even their outdoor exposure. So, like, totally random, but really cool.

200
00:23:46,113 --> 00:23:53,283
And then, Morgan, if your fellow is still comfortable with sharing yours, if you wouldn't mind describing your article to the class at the time,

201
00:23:53,283 --> 00:24:00,233
I was standing out to increases exposure to indicate destructive chemicals and things.

202
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:08,993
So this one, in addition F.A.A., is that all methods of dining out so cafeterias and restaurants is also focused on

203
00:24:08,993 --> 00:24:15,503
adolescents and adults and they notice that people eat out more than 50 percent of the time.

204
00:24:15,503 --> 00:24:25,733
Fifty percent of adults and 64 percent of children reported higher higher income after read, said Ejectable.

205
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:39,303
And then they looked at six different types of Ilic. And I that the article is very interesting because you and I think that it is eating out

206
00:24:39,303 --> 00:24:44,393
in general would cause such a different outcome than buying groceries from the store.

207
00:24:44,393 --> 00:24:54,393
Yeah. So they kids to sell the at home have 64 percent less exposure than those who did.

208
00:24:54,393 --> 00:25:03,873
OK. OK. And then the type of exposure I think I finally if I at it and then there that was it just OK.

209
00:25:03,873 --> 00:25:09,453
Yeah absolutely. So see so I was smart to inquire about these questions.

210
00:25:09,453 --> 00:25:17,903
That's really interesting. Wow. So what if folks think what the ramifications of that sort of.

211
00:25:17,903 --> 00:25:22,773
Right. What was it saying that people who have 50 percent of the time as in life,

212
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:30,453
every other being over out five point fifty five percent of the time, the majority of their meals are eating out, which is a lot.

213
00:25:30,453 --> 00:25:35,403
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Rebecca Well, that's interesting.

214
00:25:35,403 --> 00:25:43,083
And I read an article about, I think the same study that they did. And they also tested for some Salli like alternatives because.

215
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:49,323
Right. We've been banned. And so they're using other contraception and they also found high levels.

216
00:25:49,323 --> 00:25:56,883
Yes, those are right. Right. Things like an implication is it's not enough to just say, OK,

217
00:25:56,883 --> 00:26:04,833
will be to ban these individual chemicals because it looks like someone they quoted a scientist who called it like black mold.

218
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:10,713
Exactly different. And it's expensive to study them.

219
00:26:10,713 --> 00:26:13,753
Yeah. And that's, you know, it's unfortunately another great example.

220
00:26:13,753 --> 00:26:23,883
That's how things work generally in this country, is a chemical goes out into consumer products, into it's applied broadly.

221
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:34,803
We find out, you know, decades later that it's causing harm and go through the hoops of regulation and policy making to reduce those exposures.

222
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:44,343
And so now alternates need to be created. And industries generally, you know, don't don't go too far from the tree.

223
00:26:44,343 --> 00:26:50,133
They just kind of like change like a different apple from the tree and a very related alternative.

224
00:26:50,133 --> 00:27:00,363
Right. Which unfortunately often ends up again with another big timeline being found to be harmful as well.

225
00:27:00,363 --> 00:27:03,063
So, yeah, excellent point.

226
00:27:03,063 --> 00:27:12,463
Any other comments that I would find very of this kind of articles on the ground like to the EPA levels such level as the low numbers in an interview,

227
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:23,843
and I think she was at one point to have a child health division topics and she mentioned how it kind of goes the precautionary principle,

228
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:31,773
something like we have a long keep track associations, like integrative factors about exposures.

229
00:27:31,773 --> 00:27:39,783
But there is a good case of possibility that really low levels of receptors can cause actual harm or.

230
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:47,523
Well, that's very hard to see. But like, there could be a like like any level about zero is harmful.

231
00:27:47,523 --> 00:27:53,013
And the fact that we have the levels that we have currently is my body.

232
00:27:53,013 --> 00:27:59,193
Absolutely. Absolutely. Yes. And there's there's numerous examples, actually, you know,

233
00:27:59,193 --> 00:28:04,653
with all the work that I do around air quality issues, we talk about ambient particulate matter.

234
00:28:04,653 --> 00:28:09,783
There are standards right there. A couple of different timeframes. There's annual standard levels.

235
00:28:09,783 --> 00:28:18,713
There's a 24 hour daily levels. There's a ton of exposure and health literature.

236
00:28:18,713 --> 00:28:21,633
This basically shows there's no threshold. Right.

237
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:26,823
So just because, you know, the levels are below that standard doesn't mean that there's no harm being done.

238
00:28:26,823 --> 00:28:33,633
And that's absolutely the case for for a number, you know, of exposure, contaminants.

239
00:28:33,633 --> 00:28:41,793
All right. Cool. Thank thank you so much for your engagement and your discussion and bringing these really interesting articles to the class.

240
00:28:41,793 --> 00:28:50,403
Let's go ahead and change gears and move on to spend a little bit of time on our debates.

241
00:28:50,403 --> 00:28:56,463
And again, the point here is, if you recall back a few weeks ago, I kind of introduced the proposal assignment,

242
00:28:56,463 --> 00:29:01,983
but said just focus on the exam, do well on the exam, and then you can come back to the proposal.

243
00:29:01,983 --> 00:29:06,963
So kind of similar here. I know you're really focusing on the proposal over the next week.

244
00:29:06,963 --> 00:29:10,503
This is just to kind of introduce get it onto your radar,

245
00:29:10,503 --> 00:29:18,243
allow your groups to kind of begin coordinating a little bit about how you best work together going forward.

246
00:29:18,243 --> 00:29:22,353
So this is the actual assignment that's posted to canvas.

247
00:29:22,353 --> 00:29:31,283
We're going to have these formal student team debates, so we'll have a couple of class sessions.

248
00:29:31,283 --> 00:29:37,613
Where I'll give a short lecture, you know, I'll try to limit it to about 30 minutes or so,

249
00:29:37,613 --> 00:29:46,973
and then we'll kind of shift gears and move on to the to the student debates. They'll be almost exactly 30 minutes in in time.

250
00:29:46,973 --> 00:29:58,793
They'll be very formal in terms of the timekeeping. So each group of students, each team is basically assigned a position around a topic.

251
00:29:58,793 --> 00:30:07,523
So you're assigned to be in favor or for a specific position or you're assigned to be against it.

252
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:14,003
And you need to work among your group to come up with the best arguments to support that assign position.

253
00:30:14,003 --> 00:30:18,383
You're going to be doing some work. So researching the topic,

254
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:28,403
coordinating with your team to come up with a good argument and how you're going to approach your your presentation as part of the debate.

255
00:30:28,403 --> 00:30:38,933
A little bit on grading. This is the debate assignment will be worth 30 percent of the overall course grade for the class.

256
00:30:38,933 --> 00:30:46,403
So it's equivalent to the exam. Right. Which was 30 percent and also equivalent to the proposal, which is 30 percent.

257
00:30:46,403 --> 00:30:55,943
Interestingly, of that, 30 percent, 20 percent of it is going to be from my evaluation.

258
00:30:55,943 --> 00:31:03,443
But the other 10 percent is going to come from peer evaluations from members of your debate team.

259
00:31:03,443 --> 00:31:10,073
So there's a scoring sheets, I think it's at the here.

260
00:31:10,073 --> 00:31:17,933
So here's an example of the instructor scoring sheet that I'll be completing. And then, yes, here's a student scoring sheet.

261
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:33,683
So I'll ask you to submit this on the day of your debate and evaluation of each of your debate team members and going back to this part.

262
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:40,583
So in terms of the presentations, again, I mentioned, they're going to be very formal in terms of the timekeeping.

263
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:47,213
So each team is going to have 10 minutes to make a presentation to make their case, either for or against.

264
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:52,523
In this specific topic that you've been assigned, I say PowerPoint, you know,

265
00:31:52,523 --> 00:31:56,393
Google slides, whatever it is that your group decides upon, is going to work best.

266
00:31:56,393 --> 00:31:56,813
I don't know.

267
00:31:56,813 --> 00:32:08,843
You can bring in like a giant poster board and like, hold it up, whatever works for you and try to agree to allocate kind of both preparation,

268
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:17,753
effort and also active presentation relatively equally across your group team members.

269
00:32:17,753 --> 00:32:24,323
So you've got four people in your group, four students in your group.

270
00:32:24,323 --> 00:32:28,313
So, you know, that would cut out to two and a half minutes in person.

271
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:33,893
It doesn't have to be exactly two and a half. But, you know, kind of roughly divide out the effort.

272
00:32:33,893 --> 00:32:39,203
You'll have 10 minutes of uninterrupted presentation. No one's going to interrupt.

273
00:32:39,203 --> 00:32:43,673
No one can ask questions. I'm going to keep a very strict time.

274
00:32:43,673 --> 00:32:49,733
You're not going to get more than ten. So if you get to ten minutes, I'm going to cut you off.

275
00:32:49,733 --> 00:33:00,323
You'll sit down. The next group, the against group, will then have a chance to come up, give 10 minutes of uninterrupted presentation to the group.

276
00:33:00,323 --> 00:33:08,303
When they're done, each of the two debate teams will kind of like huddle off, maybe even in the hallway.

277
00:33:08,303 --> 00:33:15,083
We've got two minutes to come up with your rebuttal to what your opponent just presented.

278
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:22,793
Will reconvene after those ten minutes. The four group will have two minutes to give their rebuttal again uninterrupted.

279
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:27,713
The against group will have two minutes to give their rebuttal uninterrupted.

280
00:33:27,713 --> 00:33:31,463
And then at that point, we can actually relax a little bit.

281
00:33:31,463 --> 00:33:42,713
You can you're kind of relieved of your assigned position. And we can have more of a of an open discussion around the topic as a class.

282
00:33:42,713 --> 00:33:48,803
I've got some recommendations here. You know how you might sequence and divide up some responsibilities.

283
00:33:48,803 --> 00:33:57,533
So, you know, state the issue, give an overview of the main reasons for your position and review some of the details of the

284
00:33:57,533 --> 00:34:03,443
case that are key to evaluating it and identify kind of the focal points of controversy.

285
00:34:03,443 --> 00:34:12,173
The debate topics which we're going to talk about here in a minute, are are chosen purposefully to not be cut and dry or clear.

286
00:34:12,173 --> 00:34:21,593
Right. There's valid arguments both for and against. So there are issues of controversy associated with each.

287
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:30,803
But then you're going to be highly relying on, you know, scientific data and evaluation.

288
00:34:30,803 --> 00:34:37,373
The evidence in the rationale for your position and then, you know, importantly, cite the sources, right,

289
00:34:37,373 --> 00:34:47,283
that you're relying on to inform your positions and make sure they're based on good science sources.

290
00:34:47,283 --> 00:35:00,393
That is the assignment, I'll go ahead and pull up the topics, but then before we break out, see if folks have any questions.

291
00:35:00,393 --> 00:35:13,683
So Group One who is assigned in the pro position group to is assigned in the vacant position for the debate topic.

292
00:35:13,683 --> 00:35:20,433
Should urban farming be permitted in heavily industrialized cities like Detroit?

293
00:35:20,433 --> 00:35:28,383
And your debate in class will be December 2nd and then groups three and four with

294
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:33,993
group three being in favor of the position group for being against the position.

295
00:35:33,993 --> 00:35:45,023
Your topic will be should indoor residual spraying of DDT still be allowed for the control of malaria?

296
00:35:45,023 --> 00:35:48,563
So in a minute here, we'll go ahead and break up.

297
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:52,553
And now after the pre class discussion on assigned seats,

298
00:35:52,553 --> 00:35:59,843
I'm going to feel even less guilty about having you actually leave your assigned seat to get into these groups who can totally break the rules,

299
00:35:59,843 --> 00:36:07,643
but still give yourself some physical space and you'll have a chance to begin to talk about how you're going to accomplish this.

300
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:11,633
How are you going to work together? You know, we're going to need a resume.

301
00:36:11,633 --> 00:36:16,883
We're going to meet in person at a cafe. We're going to use, you know, Google Docs, whatever it is.

302
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:17,243
But, you know,

303
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:27,413
kind of talk about some of those logistics that you'll use over the next five or six weeks to come up with your your presentation and your plan.

304
00:36:27,413 --> 00:36:36,423
Any questions about the assignment, about the expectations and so forth?

305
00:36:36,423 --> 00:36:42,173
Yeah, just so our interpretation of our topics,

306
00:36:42,173 --> 00:36:53,943
so we take the sentence at face value and then interpret it in whatever way because those or should be asked point blank questions before.

307
00:36:53,943 --> 00:36:58,773
So, yeah, take take that question at face value.

308
00:36:58,773 --> 00:37:04,923
You know, some of you might have backgrounds where you already feel like you're a little bit informed about your assigned topic.

309
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:10,563
Others may not at all. Right. And then both scenarios are OK, you're going to be doing some work, you know,

310
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:15,153
actually doing some research and really kind of informing yourself as part of this.

311
00:37:15,153 --> 00:37:20,553
The challenge will kind of tell you up front is going to be because you're going to have a personal opinion,

312
00:37:20,553 --> 00:37:28,833
right, of whether you're against this or not. And to do well on the assignment, you're going to have to set aside that personal opinion, right.

313
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:38,403
If you've been assigned to be against residual spraying of DDT, you've got to kind of turn yourself into that, into that person.

314
00:37:38,403 --> 00:37:51,713
And that's your soul mission, is to come up for all of the reasons for why we should not be spraying indoors for DDT.

315
00:37:51,713 --> 00:37:57,743
Any other questions? All right, well, again, these are not meant to induce stress,

316
00:37:57,743 --> 00:38:04,233
just to give you a head start on being organized or five or six weeks away from these debates.

317
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:17,183
So there are a long way off. I'm going to go ahead and invite you to maybe I can handle the classroom geography, let's say group number one down here,

318
00:38:17,183 --> 00:38:26,693
like in this front quadrant of the room, group number two over here in this quadrant of the room, group three kind of in the back corner,

319
00:38:26,693 --> 00:38:35,273
the upper level of the room and group four in this corner, kind of an upper level of the room and try to, I guess,

320
00:38:35,273 --> 00:38:42,983
pay attention to the green dots in terms of how you arrange yourselves some some folks don't have all their group members.

321
00:38:42,983 --> 00:38:47,753
Don't worry about it. The unique names are listed here in this document.

322
00:38:47,753 --> 00:38:58,943
That's, of course, you know, the ad that you mentioned. It's everyone's email for contacting others.

323
00:38:58,943 --> 00:39:14,635
Yeah, yeah. Hello.

324
00:39:23,797 --> 00:39:29,107
but I just wanted to see if any any more questions had kind of come up about the debate format,

325
00:39:29,107 --> 00:39:36,657
you know, how to prepare about the expectations and so forth. All right, awesome.

326
00:39:36,657 --> 00:39:43,497
So, yeah, I you're going to be doing a lot of out of class communication and coordination,

327
00:39:43,497 --> 00:39:49,227
I wanted to allocate some in class time to help you at least kind of get kick started.

328
00:39:49,227 --> 00:39:54,537
There's four minutes left in the class, period. You're welcome to continue chatting.

329
00:39:54,537 --> 00:40:00,267
Until then, there is a class right afterwards. So they're going to start coming in and kicking us out.

330
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:04,137
But again, thanks so much. It's great to see you all. Have a good weekend.

331
00:40:04,137 --> 00:40:08,386
Thank you. Both.
