00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:14,860
Okey dokey. So welcome to our last lecture of appendix 36, where we're talking about multi-stage climate pension models in which we fit them to data.

2
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,719
A couple of announcements before we get started. The poll everywhere.

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:26,440
Our results were that overwhelmingly people wanted to be on Zoom, so 80% of the class voted for them.

4
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:33,400
So we'll do Zoom for the final presentations and I'll set up a survey on campus to do that.

5
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:43,690
I also posted rubrics for the paper and final presentation, which we can look at after the lecture today.

6
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:57,870
We see. So. Lab ten, which we started last week, will be due next Monday and we'll start the last lab lab 11 on Monday.

7
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:10,350
So yes, I think on campuses as the left tends to actually want to say, okay, if that is the case, then that's fine.

8
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:18,520
Or Thanksgiving break should be for an actual break in, not just having to do lots of work.

9
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,540
That goes for me as much as it goes for all of you. So whatever I said on campus is fine.

10
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,140
Okay. So to stage conceptual models, we've been working on the last several weeks.

11
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:42,520
Again, this idea of the mathematical expression of initiation promotion progression, which stem cells become initiated.

12
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:51,480
Initiated cells grow at a faster rate than normal stem cells that have some death rate and some rate to convert that progress to malignancy.

13
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,820
So let's talk a little bit about how we fit our models,

14
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:11,469
the data and the we have here data on the right hand side and that it's going to get connected to our simulations through an optimization algorithm.

15
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,690
So the optimization algorithm is going to find the best simulation that fits the data.

16
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:25,870
But how does it do that? It needs to be able to play around with model parameters.

17
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:33,400
So here on the left, we have the model parameters which impact the simulation.

18
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,190
But there's also other pieces that go into the simulation in model specification.

19
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:46,390
Is that a two stage model? Is it a three stage model, a different model that we're looking at, a multi stage transition model?

20
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:55,030
And if we're looking at a clinical suspension model, is there like individual level exposure data that we're taking into account that say,

21
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,950
oh, at this age you had this exposure, at this other age you had this other exposure.

22
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:08,919
And so that all together comes to give a single simulation that can be compared to data with what we call a likelihood,

23
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,510
which we'll talk a little bit more in a minute.

24
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:17,790
The optimization algorithm is going to be messing around with the model parameters and what finds the values that best fit the data.

25
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:24,990
The other two parts exposure data and model specification are fixed based on our research.

26
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,720
We're going to focus on fitting population data from cancer registries.

27
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:40,590
But really what we're talking about today can just as well be used for individual level data excuse me,

28
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,430
individual level data and individual exposure information.

29
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,050
Back in lecture six, we talked about the standard age period cohort model.

30
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:58,739
And there we assumed that age period and cohort effects were multiplicative on incidence.

31
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:05,520
So we had incidence as being a function of the number of people at risk at a given age period of cohort.

32
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,919
And we were to multiply that by this baseline incidence rate and the not an age

33
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,360
effect that tells us how that incidence rate changes in function of age and cancer.

34
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:28,739
We found that kind of increasing its age, how it affects how period changes so year to year changes, impact incidence and cohort effects.

35
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:38,580
So quite how you were born and how changes over time and exposures or behavior patterns can impact incidence.

36
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:51,770
And so what we're going to do in this model context is to replace the baseline incidents and age effects with the multi-stage expansion model hazard,

37
00:04:52,580 --> 00:05:02,060
to say that I don't need a baseline incidence and an age effect which are sort of very flexible in the way that they work.

38
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,300
And to say actually now we know biologically that this multi-stage whole expansion model,

39
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:15,200
functional form, I should probably put an A in here as well actually,

40
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:32,060
which is a function of three parameters R.P and Q and A and H gives us four given a sum output that we can multiply by the number of people at risk,

41
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,260
we can still include period and cohort effects here.

42
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:48,320
And in fact, once we've constrained that next slide, once we've constrained the age effects to have the form of the multistage transmission hazard,

43
00:05:48,650 --> 00:06:00,230
this model actually now becomes fully identifiable because age is no longer a flexible effect of period minus cohort.

44
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,840
It's a very fixed, fixed form. So that makes our lives a little bit easier.

45
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:16,730
We have to be a little bit careful here because if we remember the functional form for at least the

46
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:25,850
clothes that the clothes form for the fixed or constant parameter multistage one expansion model,

47
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:37,970
it's this, it's this, this form. Here we have our P times Q times this complicated exponential of Q in here.

48
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:45,110
And so if you think about how period and cohort effects are impacting this function,

49
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,750
it really ends up being this kind of like de facto assumption that.

50
00:06:50,120 --> 00:07:00,230
Q That big and big C are impacting are because they're they're impacting P or Q They're taking all these kind of other things in a nonlinear way.

51
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,149
So the only linear effect could be.

52
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:12,559
R So we're really assuming that period and cohort effects are effective initiation, which is not necessarily the case, right?

53
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:23,480
Because if, if like some of these changes over, over time are changing like a promoter, that's not really necessarily the differential form.

54
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:33,590
So you could instead think about each of initiation and promotion and progression parameters

55
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:40,129
as having a period of time in effect and not really sure why I could see an MP for that one,

56
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:46,820
but there are also 3pc. This is a this is going beyond what I'm expecting you to do in this course.

57
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:56,750
But I just want to have this here as just to know that we don't necessarily have to think about our period card effects

58
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:03,680
affecting initiation only they can affect promotion if it's like smoking and smoking affects promotion potentially.

59
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:14,390
One thing you do have to be a little bit careful about is that if your cancer that you're investigating is one that is screened for.

60
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:21,590
So that affects things particularly prostate breast cancer, um,

61
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:32,809
lung cancer to be a little bit careful because what we impute as changes in initiation may not actually be changes initiation,

62
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:41,870
there may be changes in screening. And so that you're just catching more cancers because you're screening them through to get a little

63
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:47,960
bit careful in the way that you interpret any period or cohort effects on the initiation rate.

64
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,429
So I talked a little bit before about this likelihood function.

65
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:59,980
And so those of you in biostatistics are probably intimately familiar with likelihood functions, but if you're not,

66
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:12,970
a likelihood function connects an observed outcome to a parameter in the statistical distribution.

67
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:21,160
In this case, we're thinking about observed incidence and model incidence model incidence being our parameter for our distribution.

68
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:37,260
So if I want to think about the incidents at age A and period J being this function I at some given age period and an implicit birth cohort,

69
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:47,140
then I'm going to assume that my observed incidence comes from a person distribution with mean i.

70
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:55,300
I j with the mean of the modeled incidence because I was not the only thing you could do here.

71
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:05,409
You could do binomial, you probably do the negative binomial anything that I could probably do in normal.

72
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:12,580
But that's not really a typical assumption for something that has integer outcomes.

73
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:17,980
So if we assume Poisson distribution, then the likelihood for a single distribution,

74
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:30,190
the probability that the outcome was OJ is given by this formula E to the minus AJ times AJ raised to the oh AJ oh divided by oh.

75
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,640
We're not going to sort of talk about why this is the correct functional form for the purpose of

76
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:43,660
likelihood it's available in Google and in your biased sources or feel free to ask me after class.

77
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:52,560
If I want the likelihood for all observations then I have to take the product of

78
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:58,960
it is individual probabilities over i j so I take the probability of these forms.

79
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,890
Um, and often we're interested not, uh, these products are hard to work with,

80
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,739
so we usually like some's better, so we often will take the negative like likelihood of all observations.

81
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:17,830
We take the log of that function and then we can sum some of them up.

82
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:30,760
So how does this kind of connect to anything? We can still remember that I AJ is our simulation and our simulation is the function of our parameters.

83
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,420
Therefore, the likelihood is also a function of our parameters.

84
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:47,070
Right. So I did pencil in all parameters, but this little piece at the end, this log, a large factorial, this does not depend on the model parameters.

85
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:54,480
And it's usually the kind of, you know, especially if you're thinking of your observed incidents as being like thousands of things.

86
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,590
A factorial is just like an awful number to work with. So because it doesn't depend on the product, the product, the parameters at all,

87
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:08,640
we usually drop it and only need the relative negative log likelihood and not the absolute negative log likelihood.

88
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:17,460
So what I will probably many times just be like this is the negative log likelihood and that's not strictly true.

89
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:23,670
But I think I was careful in the code for this lab to be that this is the relative negative log likelihood.

90
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:31,470
But we, uh, it's easy to get caught in our sure trend.

91
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:41,550
Okay. So optimization. So we're going to be thinking in this class, it was primarily about maximum likelihood estimation.

92
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:47,250
You can also do things like Bayesian estimation, which is also totally fine,

93
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,540
but I think maximizing it is kind of the most straightforward to understand.

94
00:12:52,350 --> 00:13:01,440
So we're going to find the parameters that maximize the likelihood that the data arose from those parameters.

95
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,550
Given your model.

96
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:15,260
And so that means just like thinking about it and being like, okay, the probability that I observe this number of cancers at this age in this year,

97
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:23,569
given that I know that this multi-stage clonal expansion model is underlying that and it has some initiation progression parameters,

98
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,420
and I know that there are changes in initiation over time.

99
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:37,970
So given all of these kind of moving pieces, what's the probability that all of the data collectively was came from this set of parameters?

100
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:46,780
Um, one thing that's nice is finding the maximum likelihood of quantifying the minimum negative log effect we had.

101
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:55,730
And finding the minimum negative likelihood is equal to finding the minimum relative negative likelihood which justifies dropping that factorial term.

102
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:05,390
And so our goal here is to use an optimization algorithm to find parameters that keep the minimum -100.

103
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:11,860
So that's a typo here. Okay.

104
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:19,450
So this can allow us to start thinking about comparing between models.

105
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:24,370
So any specific model I can find the minimum relative likelihood.

106
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,730
I can find the parameters that best fit.

107
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,840
Assuming they're identifiable, mean, assuming that they can be uniquely determined.

108
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:38,260
But I can start to compare models as well. And so I can say, like for my data, let me change the model specification.

109
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,160
So is a two stage model or a three stage expansion model?

110
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,790
A better explanation for the data that I see?

111
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:52,300
Should I put period and cohort effects on the R parameter, the P parameter or the Q parameter?

112
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,270
Or is that actually like over uh, does that not give me enough flexibility?

113
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:06,610
And really that one could argue they should be on Alpha or MU Zero or MI one underlying them.

114
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:17,530
We know that those parameters are not identifiable in the constant parameter context, but could they be and the parameters changing over time?

115
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:23,530
I actually don't know the answer to that. And so that could be, you know, an area for research in the future.

116
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:32,080
How do we do this model comparison? We've already used the information criterion in Lecture six for the APC models.

117
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,250
But just a refresher here.

118
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:42,250
The AC is two times the negative log likelihood, plus two times the number of parameters.

119
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:49,510
The negative log in, it puts a penalty on that fits and never parameters puts a penalty on overfitting.

120
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:54,190
Again, we don't necessarily care about absolute AC.

121
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:59,890
We have a relative AIC, so we can use a relative risk factor as well.

122
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:09,940
Okay. So just a couple of examples of what this has kind of looked like in the literature.

123
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:20,320
So we've seen this figure before, incidents of head and neck cancer, head and neck cancer that comes from sites that are likely history or related,

124
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,480
HPV, unrelated or if we want to separate oral tongue cancers out a little bit.

125
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:40,029
And in this model, this is actually my work from my Ph.D. thesis where we looked at two stage clonal expansion

126
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:48,460
model with our best fit or fitting period in current effects on either our P or Q.

127
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:56,080
I'm not going to kind of go into all of the P and Q. Let's just say that the best fit was with appearing in court effects on our.

128
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:08,730
And so what that allows us to do is think about how the incidents, for example, by cohort might be different as we look over time.

129
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,570
And so I think back in way back in Lab one, we did some work where looking at a specific incidence for different cohorts.

130
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,020
I think that was for head and neck cancer.

131
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:26,790
And so we can say like, okay, for our best fit model, what would that incidence look like at different cohorts?

132
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,000
Of course, we have less information about the more recent cohorts because they just haven't aged long enough to know.

133
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,750
But we can see how those fits related injury unrelated.

134
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,049
And so we can see how incidence is changing over time and not just look at the data,

135
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:47,820
but see what that means in terms of the underlying cohort effects of hazards.

136
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,730
Talk about hazards first.

137
00:17:52,140 --> 00:18:01,440
In this work, we looked at how the hazards differed by sociodemographic subgroups who looked at white men, black men, white women and black women.

138
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:09,660
And so if we take out those period in cohort effects and we're just left with this kind of pure hazard, this is what we get.

139
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:17,490
So white men have the highest hazard of head and neck cancer and HPV related subsides.

140
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:24,330
So we see a couple of patterns actually in both PCV and HIV unrelated subsets.

141
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:34,440
Men have higher hazards in both cases, and that's actually reflected in a larger initiation or R parameter.

142
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:42,350
So we can see that that that our parameter controls the height of the asymptote of the two stage composition of.

143
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:54,770
But we also see that both black men and white actually black men and black women

144
00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:01,550
have an earlier increase in their hazards compared to white men and white women.

145
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:08,150
So if we if you sort of compare this, the blue line, which is black women and the green line, which is white women,

146
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:18,140
the actually the asymptote for black women is a little bit lower, but that the increase in hazard starts almost ten years earlier.

147
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,650
And this is reflected in the P or promotion parameter in the model.

148
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:30,890
And so we can actually, again, just looking at the data through the lens of our model,

149
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,570
we can kind of say something about why these disparities are happening.

150
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:44,820
This is these are the cohort effects that we fed to the underlying.

151
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:52,470
They're a little bit ugly here and maybe a couple of too many degrees of freedom.

152
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:58,380
But what you can generally see is that these TV related websites have this really this increasing cohort effect.

153
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:09,300
So more recent cohorts have higher incidence issue and have neck cancer, whereas for the unrelated subsets, we generally see this decline over time.

154
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:14,129
Some of this willingness is probably just overfitting really.

155
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,910
They should have had confidence intervals on it and that would have been quite wide.

156
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:27,030
But reason was general general downward trend consistent with reduced use of combustible tobacco.

157
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:36,370
Questions so far about or about this first example.

158
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,089
So in the second example, I'm going to think about time.

159
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:54,040
Varying exposure is in what population level data can tell us about changes and exposures at the population level.

160
00:20:54,070 --> 00:21:02,110
So what we're doing here is thinking about how the time during exposure and the MSI model can kind of give us cancer incidence trends,

161
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:10,570
but also how we can potentially go backwards and say, given this cancer incidence trend, what would the time during exposure have had to have been?

162
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:20,800
And so this idea of can we estimate risk factor prevalence from cancer incidence?

163
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:29,500
So the forward direction is straight forward. We have cancer incidence data where each teleological age and prevalence data are risk factor data.

164
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:34,990
We take that with our model parameter estimates and we get some inference in the cancer biology.

165
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:42,670
But if we do backward framework, if we take that cancer incidence data through the ones of our model to get both

166
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:47,560
the inference of the cancer biology as well as that of the age and prevalence,

167
00:21:49,810 --> 00:22:00,400
comparing the model, they're basically the same, except that this initiation parameter is being impacted not just by some background initiation rate,

168
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,180
but by the prevalence of the logical agent or risk factor.

169
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:08,559
So really like for example, we might be thinking about how smoking changes over time,

170
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:18,910
if that's initiated or if HPV or other other types of viruses, likewise cancer oncogenic viruses.

171
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:29,260
So this is not an opportunistic virus, but it is a bacterium that can cause and is associated with gastric cancer.

172
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:41,650
Helicobacter pylori, Helicobacter pylori infections are not only in sort of low resource settings,

173
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:47,920
they are also high risk settings and are typically acquired in childhood, often from parents.

174
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,950
And generally speaking, persistence of treated.

175
00:22:51,310 --> 00:23:03,100
They don't always cause disease, but they're associated with sort of like gastric inflammation, acid reflux.

176
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,780
And those symptoms, if they persist, can lead to gastric cancer.

177
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:18,790
And if we look at low prevalence in the United States over the last 100 years or so, we can see that it was about 80% prevalence,

178
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:29,890
around 1900 decreasing to 20% prevalence by 1980 or so, and probably gone lower since then.

179
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:38,860
And so if we take gastric cancer incidence and we take the prevalence data,

180
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,660
we should be able to model that cancer incidence and estimate the biological parameters.

181
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:52,570
And that's we can do that. So we're not instead of estimating just sort of general cohort effects,

182
00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:01,810
we're using cohort data on a specific risk factor and kind of saying like, is that enough to explain the cancer incidence data?

183
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:12,400
And in this case, the answer is yes. We do a pretty good job of estimating gastric cancer, just knowing what the Helicobacter pylori prevalence was.

184
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:19,570
That's not saying that this is causal necessarily, but something is changing.

185
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,800
At the same time, the same way that each other prevalence is,

186
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:30,850
that could be assessed by standards of sanitation, for example, but it's changing a bit in the same way.

187
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:37,660
So we used this for the three parameter model and age appropriate pylori prevalence.

188
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:41,290
We can capture all of this time varying incidence.

189
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:51,220
Okay. So that that's great. Um, this one is a little bit easy because we said Helicobacter pylori remains until treated.

190
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:56,380
And so basically we can say that you're infected at birth and it's constant over your age.

191
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:05,469
Smoking is not like that. Smoking changes with age, prevalence does and studies.

192
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,730
Exposure changes with age.

193
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:16,390
We do have individuals doing profiles based on like the nurses health study, but that's not so useful here for kind of the the U.S. context.

194
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:22,810
So what we're gonna do here is, is look at these h period cohort models of smoking prevalence.

195
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:31,450
Um, this is by Holford and all four men and women over the last decades.

196
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,980
In the last hundred years.

197
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:41,500
And we're going to say if this is the prevalence of smoking and smoking affects initiation, cannot explain lung cancer incidence.

198
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:51,400
And we do a pretty good job. It's not perfect, but we can do a pretty good job of not saying it's like particularly bad for like the oldest cohorts.

199
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:56,110
Um, and you don't quite kind of capture some of these, these trends here.

200
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:08,140
But generally speaking, knowing prevalence for ages and over cohorts of smoking does pretty well line up with what we see for lung cancer.

201
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:12,790
And again, this is a really parsimonious model. This is a three stage quantification models.

202
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:19,840
So it's four parameters. Rather than three, but still not parsimonious, meaning two and not a lot of parameters.

203
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:26,560
So we're not overfitting. Okay. So that shows us going from prevalence to incidents.

204
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,410
What about incidents? Backwards to prevalence.

205
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:38,200
So previously we were we were using the prevalence to estimate incidence during go backwards to use incidents to estimate prevalence.

206
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,580
So let's first try that h pylori example.

207
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:52,960
What happens if we just take the incidence and see if we can estimate prevalence from that incidence?

208
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,610
How well would we have recovered the true prevalence?

209
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,990
And we actually do a pretty good job. So here's the black line.

210
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:08,920
Is that data again and the prevalence for men and women here and blue and red.

211
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,160
And that trend is pretty clear.

212
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:21,790
So again, we have this really clear connection between how the initiated agent of gastric cancer is changing over time.

213
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:29,680
It may not. And there's pretty good causal evidence that it's pylori, and this is consistent with that.

214
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:37,380
That's great. We could do this because we actually had the data already to double check with.

215
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:43,920
But if we don't have that. What's something that we don't test for?

216
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:49,560
And one answer is oral human, papilloma papillomavirus or oral HPV.

217
00:27:51,240 --> 00:28:06,270
We do have some recent cross-sectional data, though. So in 2009, in 2010, that this prevalence of HPV in the world cavity was found to be bimodal,

218
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:12,240
meaning had two peaks, one around 25 and another around 55.

219
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:19,200
And there was a lot of sort of discussion in the literature about whether this is somehow

220
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:26,370
a cohort effect where it's just a group of people who had HPV when they were younger,

221
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:37,829
just kind of aged up and never activity. Or is this like a symptom of baby boomer divorce and quote unquote,

222
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:45,540
section second sexual debut in which they're becoming sexually active and being infected with HPV?

223
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,060
So one thing that we were trying to do is say, okay,

224
00:28:51,260 --> 00:29:01,350
we have this one snapshot of HPV prevalence and we know oral cancer incidence over the last decades.

225
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,070
Can you tell us about oral HPV?

226
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,380
Um, this is not this is largely a proof of concept.

227
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:16,860
So we need to see to see if these effects are really plausible.

228
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,120
So we need some reference point for understanding age specific prevalence.

229
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:28,440
And we're just going to assume that it has a similar shape to Servico genital HPV excuse me,

230
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,930
genital HPV prevalence, which we have a general sense of this shape.

231
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:46,380
So we have this. And let's say that like we do, we generally think that HPV prevalence peaks in young adulthood and decreases that therefore.

232
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:59,880
And so if we look at incidents and men and women trying to estimate this cohort change in HPV prevalence over time, we can do a pretty reasonable job.

233
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,750
It's not necessarily perfect here, but we're generally capturing the oral history of your oral trends.

234
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:13,110
Again, this is not necessarily HIV positive cancer, but it's sites that we generally associate with cancer.

235
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:22,470
COSBY And so what what does the model predict that prevalence would have looked like over time?

236
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,050
And so our cohort effects plausible here.

237
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:36,690
And for men we actually like in some of these cohorts see a bimodal pattern emerging.

238
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:49,260
It's not necessarily kind of perfectly aligned with what we see in the data, but again, we can kind of have this kind of hint of a bimodal pattern.

239
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:58,140
And so this work, again, is not sort of supposed to be like quantitatively true, but qualitatively or qualitatively recovering.

240
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,720
This bimodal distribution,

241
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:12,450
showing that cohort effects are at least a plausible explanation of the bimodal distribution of HPV high prevalence, meaning that,

242
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,900
okay, if I look at this prevalence,

243
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:21,690
that's going to have said that like there must have been something going on in the cancer incidence for this to be plausible.

244
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,590
And it's true, we basically find that. Okay.

245
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,010
So what was the point of all of this lecture?

246
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:40,410
The goal or the takeaway was really that these multisite expansion models can be fed to data in order to investigate a lot of different aspects,

247
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:46,980
one of which is comparison of mechanistic parameters across two sites sex, race or other variables.

248
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:56,470
So we saw that in and where we saw white and black men had higher initiation, but black men and women had higher promotion.

249
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:02,550
So we could potentially look at how period cohort effects affect evolution, promotion progression.

250
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:09,150
We can look at dose response to carcinogens, particularly given individual level data.

251
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:15,690
We're not going to do that in this class, but we can see it in the last lecture, particularly in the benzene example.

252
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:24,150
And you could think about population average prevalence of risk factors like we saw with gastric cancer, lung cancer and oral cancer.

253
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:32,910
Um, really, we're going to focus on this first bullet for this class as you kind of explore this model fitting for your cancer.

254
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:41,430
Um, but, you know, there's lots of other things that can be done with this framework.

255
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:51,380
Okay. I want to say a little bit about the screening normally or not normally.

256
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:55,360
Historically, there has been a kind of a lecture on screening in this course.

257
00:32:56,170 --> 00:33:01,660
I'm cutting it out for a couple of reasons. One of which is that it's not really my area of expertise.

258
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:06,940
Second of which is we've kind of run out of time doing other things.

259
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:14,920
But I do want to at least say a little bit about what might be involved in doing screening models.

260
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:28,180
So we think both our multistage quantification models and our multistate models, the transition models have been used to model screening.

261
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:39,090
This is a multi-state transition model where we think about how a person has some probability of each year of getting an adenoma.

262
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,100
This is for colorectal cancer that adenoma can grow.

263
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,790
At some point you might be screened, detected, you may come into clinical cancer, at some point you may die.

264
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,490
So these are all just kind of probabilities of each year.

265
00:33:53,320 --> 00:34:02,020
I've also seen multi-stage clonal expansion models that think about coming up with distributions of

266
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:09,970
both the number and the size of adenoma or polyps that you would find in colorectal cancer screening.

267
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:18,400
And so that is a little bit more of a complicated extension of multi-stage quantitation models,

268
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:26,229
but it's another way in which they're used to try to match data that you get from actual colonoscopies,

269
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,080
because they are like, Oh, we did this philosophy.

270
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:37,810
We found, you know, three adenomas that were less than five millimeters and one that was 6 to 9 and two that were rated a ten.

271
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:42,550
But the probability that that was would have been true for a person of this age.

272
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,780
And based on that, that tells us things about how the cancer is wobbling.

273
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,240
So those are things that can be done in the screening world.

274
00:34:54,270 --> 00:35:02,460
Next week, we'll do lab 11, which broadly speaking, is just about fitting your cancer with an age period cohort, multi-stage, conceptual model.

275
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:10,140
I've given you most of the code. So largely it will be about documentation and interpretation.

276
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:18,240
And this is a good place to talk about the final project and then we'll talk about the rubrics.

277
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:25,080
The final project is to present a synthesis of the work that you've done in this class for one cancer.

278
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:30,930
And this will include a discussion of risk factors and epidemiological patterns of incidence and survival.

279
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:38,340
The idea is that you'll have a clear narrative here. It's not just going to be like, Here's my results from all the labs.

280
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:45,330
Let me just kind of like say them all labs 4 to 7 and 11 may be relevant here,

281
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,410
but you don't necessarily need to put all of them or all pieces of all of them.

282
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:58,049
I generally expect that you may need some additional analysis beyond what was done in the labs, but but not like huge amounts.

283
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:07,950
Mostly just like, oh, oh. I would have wanted the APC analysis for the combination of race cross sex and I didn't do that.

284
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,160
I'm going to do that for the final project, that kind of thing.

285
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:18,420
The goal will be in a bit ahead about 10 to 15 minutes with a couple of minutes for questions.

286
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:22,440
So the idea that everyone will ask at least one question from at least one presenter.

287
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:32,560
You can do this in pairs. You'll have to kind of talk about which cancer and do between you and the rubric is currently closed on canvas.

288
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,720
So I think we'll talk about that and then I'll close for questions.

289
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:42,620
Okay. So let's talk about the final presentation rubric.

290
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:50,770
First. So.

291
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:58,720
Printed in style. Assume that this is going to be a formal academic talk.

292
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:04,780
Please speak clearly and with sufficient volume if you are members of a group.

293
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:11,350
You have roughly had equal amounts of time. The slides are here to augment the presentation,

294
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:21,640
not to just read the text from the slides and are designed to convey information so that you can read the axes.

295
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:29,780
You're not. That's why we're not distracted by what's on the slide.

296
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,500
It's kind of clear that they're helping us understand what you're saying.

297
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:40,399
I'm partial to the assertion evidence approach for presentations,

298
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:50,180
which is that your title of your slide is a statement and that the rest of the slide is the evidence for that statement.

299
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,749
Some people kind of go overboard on that,

300
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:59,510
but I think it's a useful way to approach presentations so that we're not it's kind of like bullet point blow up and go,

301
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:05,870
Oh, I have to say that I sort of recognize that in my teaching slides kind of only get halfway there.

302
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:14,750
Okay. Your presentation should include an introduction that gives us enough background information on the cancer,

303
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:20,059
includes a discussion of risk factors in any well known broad epidemiological patterns.

304
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:27,110
So if it's generally understood that this cancer hat in women have higher incidence but they have lower mortality,

305
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:31,670
then that's kind of what we want now. So kind of at the level of what you did in my offer.

306
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:42,010
Um, the methods should be a clear but concise explanation of any of the models that are used in the presentation.

307
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:52,670
I'm not expecting you to be like and I have my drainpipe models and I have my ABC models and I have my MSE models and I have my survival.

308
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,730
So not everything has to be in the final presentation, but it should have.

309
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:04,240
But whatever models you're using to create your story need to be in the methods.

310
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,240
If you have multiple models, which I expect you will,

311
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:12,910
you want to think about whether you had all of your methods up front or you're doing method and results.

312
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:18,970
Method results and a priori, I don't know what makes the most sense for your story, but I want you to think about it.

313
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:31,540
The results in overall narrative should create a clear, compelling story about some epidemiological trends of interest for your cancer.

314
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:38,650
Again, not simply a graph dump of trends for all subgroups that can be kind of like mind numbing to be like,

315
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:42,910
Oh, okay, I have seen all of the different combinations. Some are doing this, some are doing that.

316
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,980
I don't I'm not really sure what the takeaway is.

317
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:51,520
So you may want to focus on just one or two important stories in detail rather than planning on giving this overwhelming interview.

318
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,330
So you might just be like, I'm just going to talk about, you know,

319
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:08,590
the interaction between sex and subtype or this is really going to be about like the difference between men and women, white versus Asian.

320
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:14,740
And so think about what what you want to talk about.

321
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:21,000
I'm kind of going along with this point. This is a synthesis.

322
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:27,480
So it's not just a pastiche of kind of piecing together of all the courses labs, but the integration of them.

323
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:31,950
And I'm kind of expecting one or two analysis that were not submitted in any lab.

324
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:35,750
And so you might kind of come at this from that thought process of, okay,

325
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:42,960
now that I've done all of the analysis that I've done in this course, I have one or two questions about trends for this group or that group.

326
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:46,920
I didn't really follow up on that in a later lab, but I can do that now.

327
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:59,670
So think about it from that perspective. I'm not worried about attendance in this class because in previous classes it's like there

328
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:02,670
have been multiple presentation things and some people only come to one or the other.

329
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:10,920
You're expected to be here and to ask at least one question of somebody else.

330
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:17,640
So you don't need to ask the question of everybody but at least one question of somebody and you need to respond to questions as well.

331
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:24,960
So I pause here for questions about the final project. Then I'll go through the rubric on the paper.

332
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,360
So the questions about the final project.

333
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,680
When is the worst weather conditions there? On the 14th?

334
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:41,160
From 4 to 6 p.m. that's our final time. And that will be on Zoom and I'll send it in.

335
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:53,280
The Zoom link will be on campus. So any summit on us or do we just hear you will submit the presentation, but there's no write up for this session.

336
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,210
Okay. We don't have to do.

337
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,590
We don't have to if we don't want to. Correct. Okay. So everyone can be individual.

338
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:10,430
We should have we have 2 hours. So with seven people, that would be fine.

339
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:18,530
Um, but I guess I'm expecting maybe one or two groups and um, the rest individual.

340
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:27,000
Um, kind of up to. So this was the final presentation.

341
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:34,860
The paper review there is that this is a seminal paper, less than 2000 words.

342
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:38,280
So this is not meant to be like a term paper.

343
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,430
It is a review of paper from the literature, the goal the.

344
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:50,880
What I want from this. So in addition to showing it to me beforehand, just to quickly sign off on it.

345
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:59,370
Description of the authors research question and including any background information on the public health problem.

346
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:07,440
To understand why it's important a discussion of why the research question is important,

347
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:12,480
including basically how the work is going to advance the field or or the impact of public health.

348
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:22,320
These are obviously both kind of going to go hand in hand include.

349
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:26,490
So imagine you're writing this for a general audience.

350
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:30,750
So give a concise but informative overview of the model, structure and important features.

351
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:35,459
This does not mean like, just like let's do all the states in the model and all the parameters in the model.

352
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:41,220
But but say in English words, what the what's going on?

353
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:48,810
You can even name parameters or name states if that's useful, but it should just be like I turned this table into words.

354
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:56,629
Describing the assumptions inherent to the model type. So maybe you're talking about the Markov model, the net Markov assumption,

355
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:06,170
if they're doing a multi state transition model or if it's the positive expansion model.

356
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:16,100
You're saying that like, oh, there's this, you know, we're assuming that we have an initiation promotion progression paradigm.

357
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:25,340
Oh, but that also, like the authors for their cancer, wanted to include this time dependent risk factor, something like that.

358
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:31,400
You'll summarize the key results and conclusions and provide an overall critique of the paper.

359
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,870
For this, I want you to assume that you're kind of writing for an academic journal.

360
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:46,790
So don't say things like, I think that this paper was great or say like, you know, imagine that you have academic stature and say like,

361
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:56,120
this paper has successfully accomplished this thing or like this paper like did not quite achieve its results.

362
00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:00,560
And convincing me or convincing, you know, the reader of the first thing.

363
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:06,860
So if you have questions about that, I'm more than happy to clarify.

364
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:12,410
Um, but, but I guess just don't think about this as, you know,

365
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:17,840
an undergrad style paper where they're just kind of like, tell me what you think about this.

366
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,950
So think about it for an academic time.

367
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,450
So any questions about the paper?

368
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:36,830
Again, this is not meant to be a huge amount of work, but you take one paper and based on what you've learned in this class.

369
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:45,450
Give us a review. Don't academic papers you often use first person, though?

370
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,980
Usually plural, but. Sure.

371
00:45:48,840 --> 00:46:03,120
So in particular, like in the context of um, like a research article, um, journals depend on whether they want passive voice or active voice.

372
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,300
And if you're using active voice, you'll say, like, we did this thing.

373
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:16,350
And so you might use the word we and, and like a review or commentary.

374
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:24,330
But generally speaking, the authors are making statements about the paper, not like, Oh, I thought that this was the case for this paper.

375
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:28,140
Um, I guess it's more like speak with authority or.

376
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:39,600
Anything else? That's all I have for today.

377
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:46,910
Maybe let's just touch base again on the let's see the calendar.

378
00:46:48,650 --> 00:47:01,480
I put the calendar here. You know, I was in London. You know, do to see my calendar.

379
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:05,030
It's not helpful. Okay.

380
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:13,640
This is kind of small, but you'll see here we have the rest of the week where we have no more classes this week.

381
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,300
On Monday, we will have lab 11.

382
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:28,280
You'll have the 30th, the fifth and the seventh to work in class to finish up anything that you would like to work on that might include lab 11.

383
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:31,730
It may include the final project, and that may include the paper.

384
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:43,100
Um, I know that we've done a bunch of work in this class, but a lot of it has been kind of in classwork and yeah, I have.

385
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:51,860
So I'll mention I might do a slide on this, but I have forgotten two teaching evaluations.

386
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:57,020
I know you've all been invited to them. I cannot see them until after your grades are submitted, so don't worry about that.

387
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:04,670
They're extremely helpful to me and they're also actually extremely important to how I get reviewed as a faculty member.

388
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:11,030
And in fact, which is true for all faculty members. And they actually that impacts things like our salaries.

389
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:19,910
So now I so it's very helpful for you to respond to them in an honest way.

390
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:25,280
And so I'm just asking that you do however you feel is appropriate.

391
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:32,959
It can be sometimes a struggle to even get like 50% of people to respond to teaching evaluations.

392
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,460
So that's my my plan for doing so. Okay, I'll stop there.
