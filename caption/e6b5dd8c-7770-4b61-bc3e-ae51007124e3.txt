Hi, California, rural community members, thanks for joining me today.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:13,650
I'm glad to see we have such a broad representation, including farm workers, farmers and your families.

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,020
It wasn't too long ago when National Geographic highlighted our California drought story.

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,520
I'm here today to help share a different perspective to this drought story,

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:31,410
the story which some of us have been living with daily, the story of the silent voice of our rural community.

6
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,390
Hopefully, as I share this story, you will be able to figure out who are the silent voices.

7
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:46,960
If not, don't worry, I'll let you know. Let me first explain to you the current state of climate change with regard to drought in California.

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,080
Yes, drought has been a part of California's climate DNA, but unfortunately,

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:01:00,970
as you can see here with the graphs that with the increased temperatures, which is the lower graph we are experiencing,

10
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:09,670
we're also seeing droughts getting worse and longer, which is the top crash and causing serious impacts on our farming industry,

11
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:15,790
especially with increased costs, lost jobs and worsening health outcomes.

12
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:22,570
And yet what we do not hear from our silent voice is the critical impact that the drought has taken on their health.

13
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:27,250
You see, our rural communities are dependent on wells for their water.

14
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:33,700
And unfortunately, most of these wells go dry, with the additional water use performing in times of drought.

15
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:41,320
And so we end up with nearly one million people in California with poor access to safe and reliable drinking water.

16
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:49,600
If water is key to growing crops, it is even more critical for the health and well-being of the essential workers who harvest the crops.

17
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:59,590
Drought increases adverse health outcomes, including worsening of chronic disease, acute stress and mental health.

18
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:06,520
So have you figured out who the silent voice is? Yes, this is the story of our farm workers.

19
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:13,760
The heart of our farming economy, many of them and their families are far too familiar with this picture.

20
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:24,640
Aquaman delivering water to their houses. Yes, in agriculture communities, which use approximately 80 percent of California's water supply.

21
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,530
Yes, they need water delivered. And they're the lucky ones that get water delivered.

22
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:36,280
Farm workers are the silent voice because many of them are highly dependent on their jobs, which are some of the lowest paid jobs yet

23
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,280
they provide essential work. So let us come together and use the drought to strengthen us.

24
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:49,060
May we hear the silent voice of our farm worker and work together to ensure safe and reliable access to drinking water for them,

25
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,020
all them and all our rural community members?

26
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:58,300
Thanks for letting me share this other perspective of our California drought story.
