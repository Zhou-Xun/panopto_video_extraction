00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:10,733
After watching this video,

2
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:16,290
you will be able to use PROC PHREG to
run Cox proportional hazards models.

3
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:20,584
So let's continue with our time-to-event
analysis example in which we

4
00:00:20,584 --> 00:00:24,670
are modeling time until return to
the drug use for patients enrolled in

5
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:29,470
two different residential treatment
programs that differ in length.

6
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,174
Remember that our event
is return to drug use and

7
00:00:32,174 --> 00:00:36,790
our main exposure was the treatment
program, short versus long.

8
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,557
We saw in the previous video that we
can calculate in bivariate analysis

9
00:00:40,557 --> 00:00:44,150
the survivor function for
the two different redness.

10
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:48,747
Now when we have a continuous variable,
we cannot use Kaplan Meier Curves, so

11
00:00:48,747 --> 00:00:52,300
we will need to run Cox models.

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,472
So let's do it for the variable age.

13
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:59,260
Let's see if there is any association
between age and return to drugs.

14
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:07,496
The hypothesis could be the younger
people relapse earlier than other people.

15
00:01:07,496 --> 00:01:09,831
So this is the call you
use to run Cox models.

16
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:14,950
It's called PROC PHREG,
from proportional hazards revision.

17
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,909
As usual, you do a specified the data
set in your PROC statement, and

18
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:24,320
then your model statement is, as always,
your outcome equals your exposure.

19
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,529
Know that now your outcome is formed by
two variables, your time variable and

20
00:01:28,529 --> 00:01:31,220
your censoring variable.

21
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,830
Know that this is exactly the same as we
did for PROC test so nothing new here.

22
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:42,260
Remember that it does not
matter if your censoring

23
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:48,594
variable is an event variable or
a censoring invaluable,

24
00:01:48,594 --> 00:01:55,720
as long as you specify the call for
censoring important sources.

25
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,548
So the first part of the output will
give you some general information about

26
00:01:59,548 --> 00:02:01,505
the model that you can mostly ignore.

27
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:02,255
Remember always to check
the numbers of a thread and

28
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,020
use because that will give you
a sense of the missing values.

29
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,900
In this particular example
we do have missing or

30
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,289
invalid information in five subjects.

31
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:12,615
And then we have a nice summary of
the number of events and censor values.

32
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:19,579
Out of this 623 we have available for
the analysis, 90% are censor.

33
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:23,877
Now you get a section that is the same
as we've seen before for other models.

34
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:28,024
The Model Fit statistics and the Testing
Global Null Hypothesis that we have

35
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:32,584
used before to estimate the likelihood
ratio test for statistical interactions.

36
00:02:32,584 --> 00:02:36,939
So that's why I told you that although Cox
models are not part of the generalized

37
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:40,320
linear model family,
they still have some things in common.

38
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,892
Remember, the Cox model
is the cat of the family.

39
00:02:45,892 --> 00:02:47,953
And finally we get our
parameter estimates.

40
00:02:47,953 --> 00:02:52,945
We get betas with their corresponding
same as before, and nicely

41
00:02:52,945 --> 00:02:58,409
prepared track actually exponentiate those
for us so we already get as our ratios.

42
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:02,675
And remember that we said we
were going to interpret rates.

43
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:08,092
So in this situation the interpretation
for a continuous variable is that for

44
00:03:08,092 --> 00:03:12,341
every year of age the rate of
relapse decreases by 1.3%,

45
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:15,278
which is kind of in favor of a hypothesis.

46
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,889
But turns not to be
statistically significant,

47
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:23,339
so we cannot make a huge deal of it.

48
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:24,051
So summary,

49
00:03:24,051 --> 00:03:27,947
in this video we use PROC PHREG to
run Cox proportional hazards models.

50
00:03:27,947 --> 00:03:32,043
In the next video we will continue with
Cox Proportional Hazard models while

51
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:36,512
adjusting for confounders and
evaluating statistically dash.
