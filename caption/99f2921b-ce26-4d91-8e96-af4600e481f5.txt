1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,370
Okay. So today we're just discussing the topic, bottled water.

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:10,320
Okay. The bottled water is we are very familiar with.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,210
We are very familiar with. And it's pretty commonly used.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:27,180
And so what is bottled water basically is a drinking water pet in the bottles for individual consumption or with.

5
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:34,890
That's about. Okay. So you can see a different kind of bottle impacting in Europe.

6
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:41,370
In Europe. Well, when I was in Europe, we tend to drink the bottled water all the time.

7
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:50,730
Okay. We only use the tap water for other purpose, for when we drinking or cooking, especially for drinking, we rely on the bottom line.

8
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,719
But that's common practice. And then you may wonder why. Ask why?

9
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,760
For example, in Belgium, when I was in Belgium, the water is pretty high.

10
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,990
If we boil water, you'll see the precipitation. That's what we have here.

11
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,880
And why in the I. But we know the water is put it from these pretty hard.

12
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:17,520
But when you boil water, you don't really see any kitchen because our do you watch and have done a very good job.

13
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,510
Okay. To remove the calcium mechanism. Right.

14
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:27,870
So we have to face to face softening process to remove this hardness of the water.

15
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:42,240
This is I mean, if you look at these markets in dollars, markets, $100 billion market and billions and they just failed.

16
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,280
So are the market. And the in fact, now with this number, it's pretty old numbers,

17
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:53,460
but we will see was it the increased consumption of the bottled water in the United States?

18
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:59,160
So why why do you think you want to drink more water? For the reasons.

19
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,550
It is typically regarded as being kind of standard.

20
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,460
Of course, some people think it tastes better.

21
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,390
Taste better. It's convenient. Convenience. Yeah.

22
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,760
Okay. Yes, it's true. Some and some people said it better.

23
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:29,350
Some say it's a convenient commute and then it's safer because it is different.

24
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:38,900
So it could be have health benefits, emergency use, convenience, safe test.

25
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,380
Some precedent don't really have a safe municipal water.

26
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,360
And the thing about the pollution with water. Well, water. So. So here is really.

27
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,290
Yeah. Different reasons why people want to use all water.

28
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,800
So one of the one of the use is emergency.

29
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,690
You have the natural disasters like water crisis.

30
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:10,940
In that situations, they would involve water and any other major disaster working with a bottle of water there and the effects sometimes.

31
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,720
Now we store tons of bottled water just for the emergency use other kind of supplies.

32
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,630
Okay. So that's one of.

33
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:31,230
This is the reasons why we do the bottle one. Even here, we say we have the we have the Hamiltonian power here.

34
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:39,720
For example, for some people still drink water. What they're seeing the bottle water because this reliability all this is of a

35
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,560
civil war with all this have some issues and it probably is not high quality.

36
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,490
Now, if we use this, yes, we have a high point of that.

37
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,160
Okay. So why people are doing the bottled water?

38
00:03:51,460 --> 00:04:01,470
If you look at this, numbers worry about tap water quality, substitute for other beverage, taste better and then worry about a test of water quality.

39
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:10,690
This is one of the reason because the tap one safety it's a big concern for many people I just mentioned in Canada want to talk about Canada.

40
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,670
So one size I'm regrets of this I'm not regret it's just the way how can we communicate risk.

41
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,719
I'm talking about we talk about it in our drinking water and then we test the water.

42
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:32,020
The CBC news is a thing. The CBS they the reporter, she brought snake several bottled water from Canada across the border to my lab.

43
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:40,330
Who will test it? We find anybody using bacteria that have water and then they wrote a catchy story.

44
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,700
And then the commons is all we should be arguing. But that's not it, I tell them.

45
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:52,000
It's not really. We just find it is probably everywhere and you'll find them in the body water as well.

46
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,170
But then the people say, oh, okay, just do the follow up because they worry about the safety of chemical.

47
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:07,090
Right. So so that's the the the reasons for drinking the bottled water.

48
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,090
More to go see here. European countries, Western European countries, 25%.

49
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:22,799
How much? And then yes, America, also North America, also some,

50
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:37,680
some the North Africa and the Middle East and other places and then some you can see here in Africa in the in the Asia,

51
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,100
Asia, and now the market also increasing. Okay.

52
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:50,250
So basically, yes, these wealthy countries are doing the mobile one are doing in mobile world and other places.

53
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,370
That's also the case. Or drink of consumption.

54
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,740
Top ten countries here. This is a total number.

55
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,970
The United States, we are still one of the big consumption.

56
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:12,400
This is a total, total consumption. And then if you look at its countries, which country consume more, more water per person?

57
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:20,720
Italy. Mexico. And then Belgium, France or just Belgium, the European countries?

58
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,420
Yes, we also have a pretty high consumption.

59
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,500
But what you can see here, yes, if you look at these numbers,

60
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:35,420
mostly in the European countries and the rich countries consume more bottled water than other places.

61
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,460
So that's the market. And you'll see the market here in the United States.

62
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,100
We see all this market. Me, by the way.

63
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,990
So I. I don't do over at home.

64
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:53,560
I don't do more work in office. I don't buy beers at home.

65
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:00,680
What I bought for I buy is really I use bottled water that I don't use.

66
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,280
I use bottled water when I go out. Trouble when I do some sports.

67
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,280
And sometimes I bring the bottled water. Okay.

68
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,389
I have water in my car. Just for the convenience.

69
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:18,790
Really, for the convenience of bus. Okay. So what is the source for the bottled water?

70
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:25,660
Well, I'll talk about the board, and I try to see what all these concerns we can see here.

71
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:32,710
So the source can be spring water will want to purify the water, municipal water or sometimes contaminant.

72
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,940
Also spring water. So here you can see these different wells.

73
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,260
You can dig the well. Then you can come out with this with with this water.

74
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:47,980
Spring water will want purified water. And a lot of times the source is just municipal.

75
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:55,299
Okay. You buy all these the bottom one of the sources, like, really spring water.

76
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:01,260
They just use tap water and then maybe do the for the treatment for that.

77
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:14,970
There are also standards additive for the for the they consider the bottled water are the beverage.

78
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:22,150
So us FDA has some standards of identity for the bottled water make this tap arena from confined aquifers,

79
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,710
fluoridated water, groundwater and then mineral water confines.

80
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,270
Purified water distillation was also released.

81
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,850
Produce sparkling water. Spring water or water? Well, water.

82
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,260
Okay. So there's different titles for the water.

83
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,620
If you if you see the labels of the bottle water, you see different kind of labels.

84
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:46,940
One of the labels, for example, is a spring water. Could be come from streams.

85
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,980
Okay. And also sparkling water. Now, in fact this is becomes also more popular.

86
00:08:50,980 --> 00:09:06,490
Now, I don't know whether you guys see this. The machine is a small machine you can use to to put the carbon dioxide into the water or other drinks.

87
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:20,380
And because sparkling water you can find. Okay. What kind of regulations we have FDA again, FDA regulated bottled water.

88
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:24,220
Okay. It's not an EPA is FDA who are regulating the bottled water.

89
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,820
They have these foods.

90
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:36,340
Drug X manufacturers are responsible for producing safe, wholesome and truthfully labor food products, including bottled water products.

91
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,060
So bottled water is considered a beverage company.

92
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:49,150
The food. So is it regulated by FDA? You know, I was I was a scholar in residence at FDA for six months.

93
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,920
This is not a one way water, but with biofuels.

94
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:03,020
And then I said, how much you've got? This is the bottled water and this is what you have get.

95
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,239
So that's the the the regulation.

96
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:14,200
We have quality, the standard of the quality for bottled water, including water for use other ingredients in beverage.

97
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,330
Some of them I don't really consider the bottled water like this.

98
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:27,190
I don't really consider the bottled water if they just describe describing the neighbor as the water, carbonated water.

99
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,809
And then this is not considered bottled water. Okay. So look up.

100
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:36,430
Understand us, look, understand this much more to be information methods.

101
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:43,540
We're talking about membrane filtration methods. So basically we should have a most proper number of.

102
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,330
2.2 or more coliforms 400.

103
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,690
Mm. I don't know whether you can still remember the.

104
00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:01,690
The drinking water tap water standards for drinking water in some of the coliforms.

105
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:17,299
So that's good for the technology of finding zero coliforms for the EPA regulation when they

106
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:27,830
say that 5% of the samples every month average should be coliform at most 5% is quality,

107
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:32,540
which you cannot, which is just mean. This is almost you cannot soon be able to take.

108
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:40,870
If you take them and then that's not really so. But here you can find like four or two.

109
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,650
And that's if you say, yes, we have it, and then that means that you'll be okay.

110
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:51,970
Okay. So in physical quality quantity.

111
00:11:52,940 --> 00:12:02,149
Well, a company of lacquer units equivalent one from Sam poisoned by the methods describing sections here with the permission

112
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:08,480
not exceed five units of the commercial all exceeds 50 units that the beaches should not exceed five units.

113
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:15,050
What's it the beauty for? For the man for the tap water.

114
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:29,050
For whatever of. It's a region for tap water.

115
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:42,690
And I would assume that women need. 0.05.

116
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:50,120
Okay, now it's five. I mean, this is the maximum we can have for the border.

117
00:12:50,160 --> 00:13:00,000
If it's five useful to be as really high. I mean, we also have some chemical standards like football and potato casserole genes.

118
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:15,230
Okay. So again, this is a select contaminant for potential concern for the for of water here coming from bacteria that comes out of playgrounds.

119
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,780
It's not regulated by the FDA. That's not regulated.

120
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,550
So the money's not regulated. Yes, it's regulated.

121
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:31,450
So the some of them are regulated by the EPA for tap water, but it's not regulated by the FDA.

122
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:40,110
So that's the the. And then if you think about the bacteria counts in the water, this is a this is ought to go what's going on?

123
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,610
Okay. This is started about and that if we start the pond, the water.

124
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:55,880
And then what do you see here? After like ten days, about ten days, you'll see the concentration of the micrograms increase.

125
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,770
So you may wonder why that. I was a botany.

126
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,710
We see the increase of the bacteria counts in the water, bottle water.

127
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,550
Why why we see the increase of them, what change?

128
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,800
So we see the growth kind of growth of the oil fields coming along.

129
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,990
And I would assume it's because there's no more flow.

130
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,740
And so it's a stable condition that allows for growth inside a bottle.

131
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:48,770
Mm hmm. Okay. Where the other person changed.

132
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,380
So how do we control the growth of a funeral in the temple?

133
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,150
You know, different religions.

134
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,350
Right. So having car regularly that you don't have to have that any more.

135
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:25,380
Yeah, I know. Okay. So that's one reason this is the of again, I would also stick the water bottle there in a more constant temperature.

136
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:32,570
The temperature would be the room temperature now used to be have water on the ground, sometimes the temperatures low.

137
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,170
And now with these stories in the in the in the store,

138
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:44,640
you'll see the increase of temperature difference presentation simply that's also growth for the other.

139
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:54,370
So no oxygen, no option less.

140
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:00,100
Yeah, that's few options. Sure. You. It's good for both of tests.

141
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:09,919
So what happens also with the ball when you balls the whistle was that you could a surface area you the ball you have surface area and then what

142
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:18,530
happened is very he would have organic matters when they're about to go you have to have the food tied to the organic matter of the nutrients.

143
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:25,460
So what happens when you bottle the water, this organic matter of addition attach to the surfaces.

144
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:35,960
Okay. So the concentration that the composition of the organic matter, all these becomes higher when you go to the what kind of country.

145
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,969
So that countries in our moment is not good for bacteria. It is too low to go back and go.

146
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,720
But now, because this kind of intuition now you can support the growth.

147
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:51,720
Okay, so there's many reasons disinfectants or residuals and so that allow that to grow.

148
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,810
Okay. So when you have this bottle water you see is looks very clean.

149
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:02,030
But if you see the pretty high bacterial counts are not necessarily mean.

150
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:07,370
They are all positive. Okay, that's that's different. Okay. But it's just if you look at the numbers, yes, it's higher.

151
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:18,079
Okay. So if we look at this FEDOROFF, we can play cards for for me, call me for me.

152
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,450
Eunice For me, if this is a permanent meter.

153
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:34,490
So it's really a virus. Some can be like ten to force and the fifth tensile tensile 100,000 and this is permitted.

154
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:43,760
Okay, see if you permit, if you think about the, the, the most of the time you will use 100 millimeter and that in the tap water,

155
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,020
the regulation for the PC is it's like 500 when they need the pen.

156
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,690
So if you miss them, that's 500. Okay.

157
00:17:51,740 --> 00:18:04,370
And I have a probably that 5 to 10 is pretty low of for the for for this here you can see in terms of the traffic cons to the bacteria.

158
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:09,439
Yes is higher and then if you look at the standard for the arsenic in the selected bottle,

159
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:20,120
one of these is a well the California big just this acidic all these bottle water from the market and they look at these numbers

160
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:28,130
and then you can see here for in terms of arsenic to the bottle what a lot of them is higher than the the the California standard.

161
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:40,590
Okay. That's one way. And the see if you see the the potential carcinogens, again, this is the FDA standards.

162
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:50,390
It's California standard here. It's also higher than the than the the the the standard for the for California.

163
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,910
So a lot of this or standards is higher.

164
00:18:54,330 --> 00:19:04,340
Okay. Um. So here's some some misleading kind of comments here.

165
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:11,150
Potable water contains no chlorine or harmful chemicals, which is not true.

166
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,110
Okay. Yes, chlorine radios. I don't.

167
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:18,990
But they say there's no harmful chemicals. That's not what you want.

168
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,820
Water is always high quality. Whatever. What is the consistent interest in the quantity?

169
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:30,500
That's not always true. Okay. We do have some issues now with aging infrastructure, all these issues for the tap water.

170
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:36,860
But on the other hand, yes, no new water borne illness has been traced through the bottled water.

171
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,490
That's not true. We do have the outbreak with bottled water.

172
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:53,960
Crypto cannot get in the water. Water that you. So there's different sorts of the water we use some spring water, some even tap water, lots of water.

173
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,740
So imported bottled water must meet. All the US rules we don't have was basically.

174
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,940
So some of the concerns that we have.

175
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:18,870
So this is all the the concerns we have public health concerns, economic concerns, environmental concerns, economic concerns.

176
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:26,910
So public health concerns we have with the ball water, with the environment concentration, the air quality.

177
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:39,660
We don't have it. I mean, in the US, yes, we have the we have the association for me to be to be to be due to tell the truth is that in the

178
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:49,320
US and I would say the auto industry we have regulation from have the codes so they work with us.

179
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:52,650
So it's not a very big problem.

180
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:58,260
But if you go to some other countries, everything ought to be available.

181
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:06,340
I can tell you one time what really worse than the pebble.

182
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:16,050
Okay. So equally concerns one of the concerns for the for the one is that it's like a beverage, okay?

183
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,160
There's not a lot of human rights. So now some people can afford it.

184
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:28,080
Some cannot afford it. If we just provide that bottled water, a lot of people cannot really afford it.

185
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:38,910
Okay. Environmental concerns, surely you know all these places, the prosecute contamination is one of the big issue in the worldwide,

186
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,590
not only in the US, but also worldwide and then economic concerns.

187
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,840
So how much the cost for the bottled water? How much the cost for tap water?

188
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,980
The tap water is still really cheap. Okay.

189
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,300
Think about I was always said the water bills is very high.

190
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:03,020
But relatively speaking, if you see the police is much, much cheaper than bottled water.

191
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:12,990
Water probably probably like bottled water is probably like a thousand times more expensive than the bottled water.

192
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:17,850
Okay, that one in the Wash American store.

193
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:29,830
So every year this is a manufactured used much as 45 to 50, meaning bearer of oil and produce up to three tons to two a year.

194
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:34,620
That's the for the one industry here.

195
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:39,900
Okay. And then the bottled water in the landfills, not only the second.

196
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:45,780
Plastics, chemicals into the into the water.

197
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:53,610
Again, this is one of the one of the biggest the issue in terms of the recycling of the bottles.

198
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:02,020
In fact, I just mentioned before, in the United States, normally we we ship all these photos and we took the bodies.

199
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,910
We don't really recycle here. We don't really have the facility to recycle.

200
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:12,690
We ship them to China, to the west, to the south east Asian countries, and then they do the recycling there.

201
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:19,140
But there is somebody the China has a law prohibits the importing of these plastic bottles.

202
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,420
And then in this some period of time, we don't know how to deal with it.

203
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,400
We don't have the capacity to deal with those who are putting the landfills in the United States, in the Western countries.

204
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:35,670
Okay. Twice more. What's the gasoline does bottled water cause?

205
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,760
Otherwise, I'm guessing it does tends to cause tap water.

206
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:47,770
So this is also true in terms of the water you see the for bottled water when we get to the border, how much it costs.

207
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:53,219
I mean, that's the the typical cost in the United States.

208
00:23:53,220 --> 00:24:04,510
Right. So how much of Warmbier how many hours C student passes detergent, energy.

209
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:19,500
Mm. Yeah. 60 ounces. So if you say it was a price for the gasoline, it's not for the three points, but it's like how many,

210
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:29,880
how many bottles of water we can have three bottled water for, you know, calculate the price.

211
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:37,110
Oh. So there's 128 ounces in a gallon.

212
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,519
There's eight water bottles in a gallon of water. So and it's gallons.

213
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,700
It's $8 a gallon. And that's how does it add up?

214
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:51,989
Okay, so think about the price. Right. So, okay, come on away.

215
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:59,760
Buy from the from the grocery store, like for $4, $5 per 24 bottles.

216
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:00,630
Okay.

217
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:11,070
And now here with is not the if you buy just the one bottle, $1 is pretty common price and you sometimes the higher and then there's ace bottles.

218
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:16,780
So $8 and this. So what's the price of gas now for something.

219
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,280
So again, which is true.

220
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,650
Which is true. And if you go to the catalog of this, the bottle is even more expensive than this.

221
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,880
Yes. Okay. So think about this.

222
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:38,299
Okay. Think about this again.

223
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,990
This is a tap water. No, this is a carbon footprint.

224
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,440
This is the cost. And then this is a EVA.

225
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:56,820
It's a French water. Okay. And you have all these different fancy advertisements every time.

226
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:02,790
And then the one thing about every job is greed. And the job of the war is greed.

227
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:17,000
That's just it. Think about all of these. Okay, so with this, the information you can see here, you know, the bottled water is not necessary.

228
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,220
Surely better than a pebble.

229
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,820
Okay. We talk about tap water. We have a lot of issues with tap water.

230
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:33,900
One of the big issues is there's a variation, there's an inconsistent quality and there's the infrastructure that's all has a problem.

231
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,200
And especially during the distribute, the water is alcohol.

232
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:45,320
So, yes, climate system. Okay. But think about the water we have and they come here every transport.

233
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:50,819
Transport. I mean, we travel through all these systems and then we come to the contamination.

234
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,440
All this regulation we have is epidemic.

235
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,760
As you know, they have to control the politics to make it.

236
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:03,719
And also we need a cup of water. So basically what I'm saying here for the tap water.

237
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,020
Yes, it's more reliable. Okay. More reliable.

238
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:15,720
You have more stringent regulations then the then the bottle water here, I must say, the bottled water.

239
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,920
We have a very big issue with all water here in the United States.

240
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:24,960
So we have this association for potable water, for example.

241
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:29,700
They have these industrial standards.

242
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:41,100
They have all these. So to do it, to make it worldwide. So with I said, we have some good control, quality control formula.

243
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:47,670
This is in the United States, European countries. I say probably the same, but they should do some direct.

244
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:55,829
You mentioned what everything called bottled water. They may just really just boil water from the tap or bottled water from the from the ground.

245
00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:04,770
And then they seal. So here's the.

246
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:25,560
So here's one of the video I. It's very interesting video.

247
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:35,420
There's some language there that the just the ones I know you if you are comfortable with that kind of language, you can cope.

248
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:40,470
You can maybe whatever. How are you? Okay. And probably been used more.

249
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:49,169
Anyway, so this is a really great a great video which you can use if you go to settings.

250
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:53,700
Even with family, you can share with your family about your friends with this video.

251
00:28:53,700 --> 00:38:42,210
Okay. We?

252
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:57,700
So this will you just show the one aspect of the ball industry and how they try to sell their products.

253
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,440
But now with that's with us that's a.

254
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:19,130
One of the petitions I received on campus for my students, she says.

255
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:27,980
And which are really bad. The bottom line on campus, which are really bad, the borrower on campus.

256
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:34,760
So ask me to support the petition to ban the water on campus.

257
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:41,180
So if if you me, what's your what's your response?

258
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:50,470
It'll be hard. It will be very hard to get through.

259
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:58,180
No. Yeah. Okay. It's very hard to get through by just whether you support it or against Sibanda or what I can.

260
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:12,900
Obviously what it means and what they're known for a lot of them bottled water and not found by our over there.

261
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:20,549
I mean I just think about like my daily life now,

262
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:27,180
like I don't really think I really see very many disposable water bottles even being sort of on campus.

263
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:32,630
I feel like even like in the dining halls, you know, you're given a glass or a cup, you know.

264
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:39,780
So I think it's I don't know how they would tell them that it's okay.

265
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:47,310
I mean, you know, you have these stores that are still still bottled water.

266
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:51,180
Okay. So the stores included. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just just the bottle.

267
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:55,710
So. But we should we should we been the bottled water on campus?

268
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:02,690
You know what? Because people still want that.

269
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:16,379
People still want in that it is. Yes. But you could say yes just because it's so expensive.

270
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:26,640
It's just so and and then, you know, it's for your other concerns, all these good reasons to ban the bottled water.

271
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:39,840
But I will not support this petition. Why all this concern is when do we really see the Volvo clubhouse issues?

272
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:48,660
No issues from Boardwalk, you know. So why?

273
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:59,460
What's the what's that was a basis for some legal basis to ban the borrower to have any legal basis to ban bottled water?

274
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:05,580
No. So so that's that's as it was said, yes.

275
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:13,650
The ball water is not as good. It's not even like a better quality than the tap water, the less of it.

276
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:19,049
Right. But in terms of the house.

277
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:23,280
But in our house, then end of the house, impact on bottled water.

278
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:27,320
We can already find the strong evidence for that. Okay.

279
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:33,030
So there's no legal basis to compare this.

280
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:41,160
I mean, this is a free economy, free country, free. And you can choose to buy estate if you want.

281
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:47,250
I mean, there's all legitimate reason. For example, we have all these issues with plastic bottles.

282
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:52,080
We can talk about these with these photos that they use.

283
00:45:52,350 --> 00:46:02,670
We ever you have them like a bottle. And the effects, the magical microplastics of plastics particles were released from the bottle.

284
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:09,990
You do get it and then it comes to your body. And those three, there are all these microplastics get into your body.

285
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:17,640
So that's what I said. Every week I think we each the credit card amount of the positive our body.

286
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:31,430
Okay. I think it's every week we're each we're in just like a one on one credit card of the plastic equivalent plastic sea level as high.

287
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:41,700
Right. So as all this the media is by now, if you compare me to the soft drinks attempts to see if either Venice.

288
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:47,610
Really, I was appalled by this object, especially for you.

289
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:50,670
High school, elementary school and high schools.

290
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:55,130
All about all the soft drinks in their system.

291
00:46:55,500 --> 00:47:03,150
Because we know this is a moral the data we support the something called the house worth of issue.

292
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:13,770
They probably don't really have this data to say the bottled water column has come off as helpful so there's no

293
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:24,120
need for this is you can bet is one and bottled water in this estate is there what we can do what we should do.

294
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:30,660
Okay. Education should provide the convenience access to tap water.

295
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:46,890
They provide the community with tap water and make sure that we, for example, the the the the the distributor, the reusable.

296
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:52,980
So that way you can reduce the use of boardwalk.

297
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:01,060
Okay. Is that a valuable thing? This loop is. And people has a has a.

298
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:05,110
Have the choice to choose what they want. Okay.

299
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:14,800
I mean, this is this is their rights. And and even like freedom, for example, here is in the house contents.

300
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:26,350
We think about the house because all these these photos, I mean, there's so many stuff and I saw it on my kids as cause much, much, much worse.

301
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:33,760
Houseboats and the bottom water that we can fathom. Everyone we say is allowed but is allowed.

302
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:43,090
So. So again, I don't think there's any capacity one to end the bottle or on campus of other places.

303
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:50,970
It's very easy to do the education, say so that people we use this bottled water,

304
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:59,170
consume this bottled water as a way to go to get as a way of the industry.

305
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:08,290
So some of the industries I mean, in the United States, I would say the association, the bottom one association in all this,

306
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:22,570
the fierce advertising is they have all the some kind of like cheating advertising they have as a business that this kind of thing is they are doing.

307
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:28,690
But but on the other hand, yes, they do have this association. They do have this a standard code.

308
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:33,010
And they provide I mean, they are also have a good use of the board.

309
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:38,320
We have a good use of the bottle, especially when we have situations.

310
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,880
We have to have some source of the drinking water and is what is a good source.

311
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:48,940
And then we'll have these like events, all this sometimes the bottled water is also convenience of inconvenience.

312
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:53,340
Okay, the and some people are willing to pay the fine but on the other.

313
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:59,290
But we cannot that's the problem. That's that's the thing that we have already to think about discuss about.

314
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:03,970
We cannot use all the water to do because tap water.

315
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:11,440
Okay, think about how much water we use every day on a daily basis.

316
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:17,709
Right. So we have to use at least now, now 250 gallons.

317
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:25,750
But this is 90 gallons of water per person, everyday calculation.

318
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:31,870
The category of the cost, 90 again is water every day.

319
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:37,750
If we use bottled water for this, how much it cost?

320
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:44,140
$720 a day. So anybody care for that?

321
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:48,160
Yeah. Yeah, no, we're doing this.

322
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:52,080
It don't say we just use bottled water for drinking.

323
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:59,710
For cooking. How much water we use it. It, it 52 liters by one gallon.

324
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:08,140
Is it one gallon water every four it. And then we use the two gallons for cooking.

325
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:15,730
How much. How many candles everyday. So three, three or two sweet, sweet gallons per day.

326
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:21,550
Right. You said we used to have water for for for like cleaning, shower and hygiene.

327
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:26,240
So that's just for tap water, for drinking, for cooking purposes.

328
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:31,420
82 against the then for president and then kind how much it cost?

329
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:43,990
16, $16 for the general for the some income for it and not for regular people.

330
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:50,760
Right. So this this is that if if you think about it.

331
00:51:50,770 --> 00:52:01,490
Right. That's really that again. So we cannot think about just use all what we have, of course, have while all these issues we cannot rely on for.

332
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:10,410
Okay, that's pretty clear. We cannot rely on bottled water for this because all this is one of the issues, economy issues, health issue,

333
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:16,460
all this equity issues that ever without water we are sitting right anyway

334
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:22,000
the city more we are doing that now the Detroit you said about people cannot

335
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:38,110
pay the working away with that's Reggie was speaking to price it costs that local we see a lot of people cannot pay the value right as a core issue.

336
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:46,329
Okay and then the during the pandemic, you know, the government had to sign the executive order to order the Detroit watching events,

337
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:54,550
as you have to do with the collective ever to come up have to replace it was a pandemic

338
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,330
so that we can provide the water to these people is very essential for the pipe.

339
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:01,360
Okay. So sometimes the the the Detroit.

340
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:08,760
You mean? It's just that, you know, if they cannot pave the water, the facility knows how to do what is correct as a service.

341
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:13,200
Okay. It would just be a service of. That's the reality.

342
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:22,709
But now think about if it's all over. So and that's what can come out of it before.

343
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:30,840
So that's the reason we still need to use bottled water is the tap water to provide this kind of sort of simple,

344
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,890
safe, clean water, a basic human right. Okay.

345
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:44,009
Is that in its human rights? But surely the bottled water is not a feasible alternative space program.

346
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:52,230
How are these issues with tap water with a you want this food system by the bottle was really is not a valid viable alternatives.

347
00:53:54,720 --> 00:54:10,620
Okay. Why wasn't it. But again, we will not be able to ban this by what is a free economy and you can open it if no legal basis became available.

348
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:18,479
Okay. I mean, the thing would have been a very large if you have this health of the FDA,

349
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:26,940
when FDA do they expected to to cause the base vacated by drugs or the other food degrades if it caused people to die.

350
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:36,149
If you see the munchies and then you see the product, you have the ripple base from your product of severe disease, from the FDA.

351
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:40,580
Would want you to be able to do that in the U.S. Okay.

352
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:46,380
With boil water, we don't get this thing that prevents disease.

353
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:50,570
So that's also one of the reason why FDA does things like this.

354
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:58,710
At one point, the regulator bottle water and there's so many other pressing things for them to do.

355
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:03,900
And bottled water is not on their radar right now. Okay.

356
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:08,430
Sure. It's not on their radar. But here I mean, that's the reason.

357
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:16,229
Don't blame FDA for this, because FDA said, why did you spend all the resources for something you don't really have?

358
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:22,400
The big problem like I have and will use my usual resources through the FDA.

359
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:27,780
Looks like our FDA says, oh, we have all the FDA people living and all this kind of stuff.

360
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:37,919
You know, if you could help one of the FDA, I think even five, 35 years experience, they're like this pretty nice facility.

361
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:44,150
But that's all the people they have. Okay. So they cannot really record again in the States.

362
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:51,300
If we think about the states, we don't really have a lot of people on board here in the Eagle.

363
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:58,410
I mean, we have the people now have more people will come on the tap for oxygen to go with them on it.

364
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:04,860
In terms of Google working with all this, you know, whatever plan we go with how many people really work for.

365
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:15,470
So so education is key and provide that reliable city or tap water is more important than the firewall.

366
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:22,910
Okay. So that's the BBVA and we can all relate that to bottled water.

367
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:33,210
I mean, there's no way to convey the point of why we prevent boil water, why we don't get marijuana, like why we don't find all these sausages.

368
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:45,680
Why are we going back all the sugar as all of them stuff is more damage to health, more damaging health.

369
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:53,430
And so but that doesn't mean the bottled water is better than pebble.

370
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:58,050
Okay. So with all this information, you have to know this.

371
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:02,430
Some of these fancy thinking about bottled water is not cheap.

372
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:06,150
Okay. I got really cheap.

373
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:18,120
And there are some use some some legitimate use of the bottom one of the Web, you know, convenience emergency and all this other really the case.

374
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:23,420
So so that's the reason we say yes we've had more will save the bottled water.

375
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:27,620
Yes. Come on really because we have all bottled water that some people idea.

376
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:35,880
That's why we just use all one of them before directly and some of the offices if we I don't know whether you use out on some

377
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:44,700
some offices they use these bottles the dispenser they have the discounted right and they just squirted into the people.

378
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:50,430
I mean, there's in the for example, in China, a lot of most of you have lack of just was expensive.

379
00:57:52,020 --> 00:58:01,050
But then if you go to the check that the dispensers so to how musty it is you you'll find this that they don't really.

380
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:08,050
In Sweden and the inside of the tube, you will see all these slimy biofilms there.

381
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:14,170
So that was not very good with a good systems in place.

382
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:18,770
While we have water, the good thing is that you have the running water all the time.

383
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:28,640
A different use that can reduce. We reduce or remove this contaminant or reduce the accumulation of content which is in this packet.

384
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:35,020
Okay. So that's about the bottom on that.

385
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:39,340
And then there's another another see for the bottle of water here.

386
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:45,390
I mean, I said, by the way, the good news, if you want to if you can figure out the distribution system and this is really good,

387
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:50,390
that's the there's no cost for the raw materials.

388
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:59,750
Okay. It's new possible room to it. You can you can also like if you can do it, you can potable water from from here, you can see it.

389
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:10,760
I mean, there's some regulation on that. But basically you get all the tap water just from here and then you see other people again,

390
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:16,310
that's really Coca-Cola, Pepsi, all these beverage companies, they sell the value of.

391
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:24,200
They've had their profits higher than their viewers, but they do.

392
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:27,370
I mean, I have been using that for their Pepsi.

393
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,800
Then they are watching the process. Okay.

394
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,030
It's pretty advanced.

395
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:42,950
They use towards the tap water when they make you kokoro for example, the treatment is much, much more advanced than what we used to give them.

396
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:54,110
So. So what happens is that's further purified, intended as the soap of the society to the these together with the water.

397
00:59:54,380 --> 01:00:02,990
So and also the water when the bottle phone of this introduce them to the plastics as it comes to the water quality what they produce.

398
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:10,280
It's good that is with with you water with them I mean what not really work for them

399
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:15,530
it just some probably want to see this to get in their plans and to see how they

400
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:21,799
have over watched them in process they're watching process it's pretty advanced but

401
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:29,930
anyway again so with all this I hope you'll be more confidence with our tap water.
