1
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:29,389
So let's start first by opening up at next Excel file.

2
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:33,139
And here I have a directory full of different file types for us.

3
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:37,309
Ready and waiting. The Excel file types I think you guys are very familiar with.

4
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:46,009
You can see xls, little symbol over here. And it ends in something like .xls, or .xlsx.

5
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:51,799
So all we do is we basically just double click it. That's going to launch my Excel program.

6
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:58,279
Hopefully it doesn't take too long for the video. It looks like it's coming up on my second screen.

7
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:03,709
So if you just give me one moment, I will pull it back over so you can see it.

8
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:08,629
So here you go. You likely know Excel quite well.

9
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:13,579
You know, when it opens up here, you can see we've got a different header file.

10
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:22,519
Sorry, a different line, which has all of the variable names in it, followed by the data.

11
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:30,463
You can see here that there's a bunch of missing notes in this file that's shown basically by just empty cells.

12
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:43,053
If we go ahead and close this out, next step, what we will look at is something that has been delimited basically in column.

13
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:45,659
So let's take a look at this file here.

14
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:52,622
You can see that this particular file has an extension of Dot Datt, which is indicating that it's a data file.

15
00:03:59,675 --> 00:04:03,425
You can do the same either with notepad or word pad.

16
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:07,775
Any of those types of options are good to take a look at that data.

17
00:04:07,775 --> 00:04:17,605
So this is what's called column data because it is all separated basically out in these nice, neat columns you see here.

18
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:26,165
Right? They're all just one after another. It might actually be that this is also considered to be a tab delimited file.

19
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:33,065
Often they look quite similar to one another. But here you can kind of see that these things are separated.

20
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:38,495
And so either columnar or tab would likely bring this in.

21
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:43,505
All right. Let's take it another example. Take a look at another example.

22
00:04:43,505 --> 00:04:51,035
This one here is now a .text file. This here, too, might be a tab delimited file.

23
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:53,735
It looks very similar to column data.

24
00:04:53,735 --> 00:05:06,365
But you can see in this particular situation where the data extended to long, the tab pushed those values over to the right.

25
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:11,945
OK. So next step, we're going to take a look at space delimited data.

26
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:20,015
Here's one. You can see that each variable in the data set is separated just out by a single space.

27
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:25,805
You can see that sometimes there's missing ness, which has been indicated by points,

28
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:34,335
and sometimes you can see that there's different amounts of space as here you can see that the spacing is much wider,

29
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:38,435
you know, than the single space that separates that last date.

30
00:05:38,435 --> 00:05:45,875
The good news is, as I told you, SAS is extremely flexible and we'll be showing you in lab about how, you know,

31
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:56,465
how SAS is able to accommodate those different spaces, as well as in next week when we talk about space to limited data.

32
00:05:56,465 --> 00:06:00,575
Another one that's nice to look at is the CSV file.

33
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:05,165
So whenever you see a CSV, that means that's a comma separated value.

34
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:10,685
What's interesting is that programs know to open that in Excel.

35
00:06:10,685 --> 00:06:15,515
So that becomes a default. If I open it up using Excel.

36
00:06:15,515 --> 00:06:25,775
What you'll see is that the delimiters disappear on you and you can't even see those anymore.

37
00:06:25,775 --> 00:06:36,695
How ever if I go through and instead of opening it with Excel, I ask it to open with notepad.

38
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:41,225
You can see here that the data is being separated.

39
00:06:41,225 --> 00:06:47,195
Indeed, just as the name says, each one by a comma.

40
00:06:47,195 --> 00:06:58,505
Finally, I just want to show you one example. I've named this crazy dot text, but this is an example where you're delimiter is a percentage sign.

41
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:04,566
Not a big deal. We just need to tell SAS what the delimiter is and it can move ahead with that.

42
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:13,779
OK. That was a pretty simple video. The key takeaways I wanted you to have from this particular video are just that data

43
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:20,199
files from other programs like Excel are typically going to be seen in those programs.

44
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:29,289
I don't really talk about that. But access, for example, or, you know, a lotus one, two, three, if you're old enough to remember what that is.

45
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:39,189
Those kind of program files will be just click right in to the program itself to open when you're looking at more simple flat files.

46
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:45,279
You may have text files that have delimiters things like tab space or commas.

47
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:51,009
You can have other delimiters like I showed you with a percentage sign. But that's far less common.

48
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:56,079
And really the most important thing to know is that you need to take a look at the type

49
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:02,528
of data file that you are working with in order to best successfully bring it into SAS.
