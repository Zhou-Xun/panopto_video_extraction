1
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,870
In this module, I'll give you

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,865
an introduction to solid waste.

3
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:13,680
But before we do that,
I want to ask you,

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,180
what was the last
thing you threw in

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,475
the garbage? Do you remember?

6
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:18,870
You probably don't and that's

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,340
not surprising
because it turns out,

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,935
Americans throw a lot of
stuff in the garbage.

9
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:24,360
In fact, if we look at the

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,400
typical American
over their lifetime,

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,019
they're going to throw away 600

12
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,850
times their body
weight in garbage.

13
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:34,580
That's about Â£90,000 of
garbage on average per person.

14
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,010
I'm standing here on this
beautiful sunny day at

15
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,470
the Recycling Drop-off
Center of Ann Arbor.

16
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,830
So this place represents
an opportunity for us to

17
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,600
reduce some of the impacts

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,775
of solid wastes here in America.

19
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:50,150
I'd like to begin by
defining solid waste.

20
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,800
Traditionally, we've talked about

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,320
solid waste as either
garbage or refuse.

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,805
We still use those terms.

23
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,455
But it turns out,
there are actually

24
00:00:57,455 --> 00:00:59,495
very specific definitions of

25
00:00:59,495 --> 00:01:00,860
solid waste given to us by

26
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,660
the Environmental
Protection Agency.

27
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,385
So solid waste can fall

28
00:01:04,385 --> 00:01:06,365
into a couple of
different categories.

29
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:08,080
One of them is sludge.

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,560
So this could be sludge from

31
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,510
a wastewater treatment plant or

32
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,060
from a water supply
treatment plant.

33
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,060
We can also think about
other discarded materials.

34
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,615
These could be from industrial,
or commercial sources,

35
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:22,850
or mining and
agricultural operations,

36
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,931
and also from just
general community sources

37
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:27,830
like households. It's
important to know that

38
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,680
despite the fact that it's
called solid waste, in fact,

39
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,615
solid waste can be liquid

40
00:01:32,615 --> 00:01:35,395
or semi-solid or it
can contain liquid.

41
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,355
The key definition of

42
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:39,200
solid waste is that
it's either been

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,540
abandoned or it never

44
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,330
had any value or use
in the first place.

45
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,810
It truly was waste.
Interestingly, discarded military

46
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,130
munitions are considered

47
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,750
solid waste There are

48
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,030
some types of materials
that once they're recycled,

49
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,650
they become basically
solid waste by definition.

50
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,245
There are three major streams

51
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:00,910
of solid waste you'll
want to remember;

52
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,680
one is municipal, the second,

53
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,110
industrial, and the
third, hazardous.

54
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,690
So municipal waste
is generated by

55
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,540
residences and
commercial entities.

56
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,000
It can also be created
by treatment plants.

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,745
It's also wastes that accumulates
in places like streets,

58
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:18,455
or parks, or beaches,

59
00:02:18,455 --> 00:02:20,680
or highways and
recreational areas.

60
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,710
Some examples of municipal
waste include food,

61
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,020
just regular trash or
household garbage,

62
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,020
and also special types of
wastes like construction waste,

63
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,450
mining waste, and
agricultural waste.

64
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,345
The second major stream
is industrial waste.

65
00:02:34,345 --> 00:02:37,615
Not surprisingly, this is
generated by industrial sites.

66
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:40,780
This would include things
like chemicals, metals,

67
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,240
dyes, glues, resins, and glass.

68
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,045
The third important stream
is hazardous waste.

69
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:48,470
This is often generated by

70
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,740
industrial sites but it also
includes biomedical waste.

71
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,575
So examples here would
be flammable waste,

72
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:56,990
infectious waste,
and also things like

73
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,135
pharmaceutical agents.

74
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:01,520
So looking a little
more closely at

75
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,760
US municipal solid waste
generation, unfortunately,

76
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,070
the United States is
the world leader among

77
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,470
industrialized nations
in the amount of

78
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,190
municipal solid waste
we generate per person.

79
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,700
We generate on the order of

80
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,720
260 million tons of municipal
solid waste per year.

81
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,160
Looking at the graphic here,

82
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,270
I want to draw your attention to

83
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,310
a few categories of
municipal waste.

84
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,265
So you'll note that food
waste and yard trimmings

85
00:03:25,265 --> 00:03:28,665
accounts for about 25
percent of municipal waste.

86
00:03:28,665 --> 00:03:31,860
Then if you add up
metals, plastics, paper,

87
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,110
and glass, that's
another 50 percent

88
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,625
of municipal solid waste.

89
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,220
Collectively, those
things represent

90
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,510
about three quarters of

91
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,700
all municipal solid waste
and the good news is,

92
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,600
those things are either
recyclable or compostable.

93
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,810
If we switch gears and think
about industrial waste,

94
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,115
we produce much more.

95
00:03:49,115 --> 00:03:51,500
In fact, about 7.6 billion

96
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,890
tons just in the US every year.

97
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,000
A commonly cited
statistic is that

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,820
about 97 percent of
all solid waste is

99
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,950
industrial and only
three percent of

100
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,930
solid waste is the
municipal waste

101
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,990
that we're most familiar
with its garbage.

102
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,330
Looking at the image here,

103
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,840
you'll see that
manufacturing far and away

104
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,750
contributes the most
industrial solid waste,

105
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,850
but there are also
important contributions

106
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,460
from mining and agriculture.

107
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,760
What regulations and
agencies are out there to

108
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,430
protect us and help us
manage solid waste?

109
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,430
If we go back to 1965,

110
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,180
the Solid Waste Disposal Act was

111
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,700
passed and this gave the
US Public Health Service

112
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,060
the authority to provide
funding and technical guidance

113
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,160
to states and other governments

114
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,205
to better manage their waste.

115
00:04:36,205 --> 00:04:39,540
Then in 1976, there was a
very important act passed,

116
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,615
the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act or RCRA.

117
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,260
This act gave the Environmental
Protection Agency

118
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,230
both regulatory and
enforcement authority

119
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,300
regarding waste management.

120
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,880
Very importantly, it set
minimum standards for

121
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,445
how to design and run landfills,

122
00:04:55,445 --> 00:04:58,490
and it also gave a
framework basically for

123
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,410
states to manage their waste

124
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,375
in a more integrated fashion.

125
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,830
So these two laws and

126
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,750
the Environmental
Protection Agency have

127
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,430
basically resulted in what we see

128
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,425
here today at the
recycling center,

129
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:14,197
an excellent opportunity
to reduce solid waste.
