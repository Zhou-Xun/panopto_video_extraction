1
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,650
In this module, I'll be
talking to you about

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,115
different ways we have of
disposing of solid waste.

3
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:15,840
Let me ask you, have
you ever thought

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,460
about where your municipal waste

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,050
goes when it leaves
your household or

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,030
your residents? Probably not.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,100
We're very fortunate
in America to have

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,760
a very efficient and relatively
invisible mechanism in

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,410
system for collecting and

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,410
disposing of municipal
solid waste,

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,530
but we generate about
260 million tonnes

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,715
of this stuff every year.

13
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:37,050
It has to go somewhere.

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,600
So in this lecture,

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,880
we'll be talking about
the different ways and

16
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,160
manners in which we can
dispose off this waste.

17
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,350
So previously in another module,

18
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,689
we talked about the
hierarchy of controls,

19
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:52,130
which is basically
a way for us to

20
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,005
rank order by preference,

21
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:55,850
the ways that we can minimize or

22
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,025
eliminate environmental
health hazards.

23
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:01,220
We can take the exact same
approach for waste management.

24
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,070
So the image you see
here is the hierarchy of

25
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,125
waste management approaches from

26
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,430
most preferred at the top,

27
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,855
to least preferred at the bottom.

28
00:01:08,855 --> 00:01:10,520
Let's look at these in detail.

29
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,030
The first level here is
source reduction and reuse.

30
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,535
Basically, these are
ways for us to eliminate

31
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:19,555
the creation of solid
waste in the first place.

32
00:01:19,555 --> 00:01:22,520
The second level, is
recycling or composting,

33
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,770
collecting solid waste
and then converting

34
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,530
it basically into a
new useful material.

35
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,020
The third level is
energy recovery,

36
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,870
basically burning waste
to create energy that

37
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:36,075
can then be used to power
our homes for example.

38
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:40,130
Finally the fourth and very
last least preferred approach

39
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,900
here is the treatment and

40
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,825
disposal of waste after
it's been created.

41
00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:47,030
The image you're
looking at now is

42
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,520
a representation of the
solid waste management

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,960
approaches primarily used in

44
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,835
the United States from 1960-2015.

45
00:01:54,835 --> 00:01:56,450
So what you'll notice is back in

46
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,210
1960 virtually always created

47
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,410
in the United States from

48
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,820
municipal sources was disposed
up through land filling.

49
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,520
But starting in the
1970s and 1980s,

50
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,480
you'll see the
fraction of materials

51
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,490
that are recycled or burned for

52
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,180
energy recovery has been
steadily increasing to the point

53
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,800
now where only about half of

54
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,190
our materials are
sent to a landfill.

55
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,150
If we zoom in a little bit
closer and in more detail on

56
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,220
your municipal solid
waste generation

57
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,280
in recycling in the US,

58
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,275
again from 1960-2015,

59
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:30,860
the first image here on the left

60
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,330
shows our generation rates.

61
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,265
You'll see two lines
on this image.

62
00:02:34,265 --> 00:02:35,975
One is the absolute amount of

63
00:02:35,975 --> 00:02:37,940
solid waste generated,
that's in blue,

64
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,040
and one is the per capita amount

65
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,810
generated, that's in orange.

66
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,090
So in blue, you'll
see that the amount

67
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,280
of solid waste generated
has been steadily

68
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,010
creeping up year-over-year
but you'll also see that

69
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,705
the change year to year has

70
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:52,910
basically become smaller
in recent years,

71
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,135
so we're generating a
relatively smaller amount

72
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:58,400
each year compared to
the previous year.

73
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,090
But very importantly, if you
look at the orange line,

74
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,900
the amount that
we're generating per

75
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,580
capita actually increased
until a couple of decades ago,

76
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,705
and then we saw
basically a plateau

77
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:11,160
and it started to decrease
slightly since then.

78
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,470
So on an individual basis,

79
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,790
we're actually starting to create

80
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,960
slightly less municipal
solid waste every year.

81
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,570
Now the image on the
right shows recycling and

82
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,780
composting specifically
over that same period.

83
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,120
The blue line represents
the absolute amount

84
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,580
of material that's getting
recycled or composted.

85
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,725
That line is going up.

86
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:31,985
That's a good thing,

87
00:03:31,985 --> 00:03:35,030
and the orange line
shows the percent

88
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,620
of municipal solid waste that's

89
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,375
being recycled or composted.

90
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,980
That line is also going up
over time, which is great.

91
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,010
Let's zoom in on 2015 specifically
in the United States.

92
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,780
So in that year, you
can see that we sent

93
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,730
about 52 percent of all of

94
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,950
our municipal solid
waste to a landfill.

95
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,995
About 25 percent of it was
recycled, that's great,

96
00:03:54,995 --> 00:03:57,860
and the other 25 percent
or so were either

97
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,205
burned for energy creation
or were composted.

98
00:04:01,205 --> 00:04:03,530
So what we'd like to
see going forward is

99
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,180
that landfill fraction will

100
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,285
continue getting
smaller and smaller.

101
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:11,030
What does the landfill
actually look like?

102
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,055
Well, prior to 1970,

103
00:04:13,055 --> 00:04:15,770
most landfills operated
by cities were simply

104
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,910
dumps where people would bring

105
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,710
garbage and it would be burned.

106
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,720
Prior to that, a
lot of garbage was

107
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,315
disposed to by burning
it in your backyard.

108
00:04:23,315 --> 00:04:25,520
Now after 1970, we started to

109
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,640
transition to something
called a sanitary landfill.

110
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,500
The image you're
looking at here is

111
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,110
a cross-section of a
sanitary landfill.

112
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,360
I want to highlight a
few features for you.

113
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,070
So first, you can probably notice

114
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,780
the sanitary landfill
is basically

115
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,600
a big hole dug into the ground,

116
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,880
but that hole is lined with
an impermeable material to

117
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,260
prevent the solid waste from

118
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,735
moving further throughout
the environment.

119
00:04:47,735 --> 00:04:49,280
You'll see represented by

120
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,140
basically drawings
of trash bags here.

121
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,060
This landfill has been completely

122
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,855
filled with municipal
solid waste.

123
00:04:55,855 --> 00:04:57,350
You'll also notice that there's

124
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,330
a tube passing up
through the center of

125
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,980
the sanitary landfill as

126
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,560
bacteria break down some
of the solid waste,

127
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,055
they will generate
methane as a byproduct.

128
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,730
That methane needs to be either

129
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,070
vented to the atmosphere
or even better,

130
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,100
captured and burned
for energy recovery.

131
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,500
You'll also see at the
bottom of the landfill,

132
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,420
there's a leachate
collection system.

133
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,430
So leachate are the
liquids that are

134
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,430
created as that solid
waste is broken down.

135
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,035
You'll see here
there's a system for

136
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:25,910
capturing that
leachate and actually

137
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,905
treating it so that
doesn't spread

138
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:30,485
inadvertently through
the environment as well.

139
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:32,900
You'll notice that
since this landfill

140
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,670
is completely full,

141
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,560
it's been capped
with a clay liner.

142
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,015
Also impermeable and then
covered up with soil as well.

143
00:05:40,015 --> 00:05:42,290
Finally, you'll notice
there's a monitoring

144
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,095
well that's been dug
adjacent to the landfill.

145
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,430
This monitoring well is

146
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,500
monitored regularly to
make sure that none of

147
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,240
that leachate is escaping and

148
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,220
potentially getting
into groundwater.

149
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,230
So sanitary landfills are very

150
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,570
purposely designed to safely

151
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,910
capture and store and hold

152
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,860
for a period of time
municipal solid waste.

153
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,680
I want to highlight
some positive features

154
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,035
about our US collection
system here.

155
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,120
In terms of recycling
and composting,

156
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,800
there are some types
of materials that were

157
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,390
really good at collecting.

158
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,710
So as you look at this graph,

159
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,200
you'll see that lead acid
batteries for example,

160
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,260
we collect virtually all
of those and recycle them.

161
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,120
Other things were really
good at recycling or

162
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,055
steel cans and aluminum,

163
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:26,765
as well as yard trimmings.

164
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:29,270
But unfortunately, there
are many many categories

165
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,710
of waste and types of

166
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,195
products that we don't do

167
00:06:32,195 --> 00:06:34,550
such a good job
recycling or composting,

168
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,705
those represent opportunities
for improvement.

169
00:06:37,705 --> 00:06:41,210
Finally, I'd like to wrap
up talking about waste to

170
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,675
energy incineration or what
I've called energy recovery.

171
00:06:44,675 --> 00:06:48,110
So waste to energy incineration

172
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,670
basically involves the controlled

173
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,515
combustion of solid waste.

174
00:06:51,515 --> 00:06:53,450
What we're looking
to do here is reduce

175
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,390
the overall volume
of solid waste,

176
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,010
and unfortunately in the process,

177
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,080
convert some of that solid
waste into air pollution.

178
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,260
So you'll see a schematic
of an incinerator here.

179
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,340
You'll see at the left side,

180
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,595
we have a feed that's where
the solid waste will come in.

181
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:11,000
We have a combustion chamber
here into which we feed air,

182
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,025
and fuel, and we cause a fire,

183
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:14,840
and that first combustion chamber

184
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,210
basically breaks down a
lot of this solid waste

185
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,010
into ash that can then be

186
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,710
disposed of for
example in a landfill.

187
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,030
You'll also see though, there's

188
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,905
a second combustion chamber to do

189
00:07:24,905 --> 00:07:27,920
additional burning and the
results or the output of

190
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,690
that second combustion chamber is

191
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,940
often particulate or gases that

192
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,875
represent solid waste
that's now been

193
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,260
unfortunately converted
into air pollution.

194
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,780
Incinerators have been
very successfully

195
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,310
applied for reducing

196
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,200
the hazardous
characteristics of wastes.

197
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,805
Sp for example, they can

198
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:46,415
be used to destroy
dangerous solvents,

199
00:07:46,415 --> 00:07:49,370
pesticides or
chemicals like PCB's.

200
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,050
They've also been used to destroy

201
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,790
things like chemical weapons,

202
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,770
but they can't change
the basic nature

203
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,705
for example of metals.

204
00:07:56,705 --> 00:07:59,340
So between land
filling, recycling,

205
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,840
and composting, and incineration,

206
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,150
we have a description basically
of the vast majority of

207
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,455
ways that we deal with

208
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:10,730
solid waste and dispose
of it in this country.
